Istanbul, Madrid and Tokyo are hoping to host the Games at a time of global economic uncertainty and renewed scrutiny over the benefits of hosting the Olympics. The winning bid will be chosen at the IOC&apos;s session in Buenos Aires on 7 September, when a new president will also be voted in to replace Jacques Rogge and a new sport will be added to the programme for the 2020 Games. The shortlist was narrowed down to three after Baku and Doha were eliminated at an earlier stage and the Italian government withdrew Rome&apos;s bid due to the country&apos;s dire economic situation. The Qatari capital has already indicated it will bid again for 2024 after being left off the shortlist because of pressure from broadcasters concerned at its plan to move the Games to the autumn. Tokyo&apos;s bid, which lost out to Rio last time after being eliminated in the second round of voting, has been installed as the favourites by bookmakers and is seen as the safest option for 2020. Many of the venues are already built and leaders will position its bid as a means of bringing the country together in the wake of the natural disasters that hit the country in 2011. It is also well positioned geographically, with many seeing it as Asia&apos;s turn to host the Olympics after Games in Europe and South America. Over recent years the final round of presentations, to the IOC executive in June and to the IOC membership in September, have become disproportionately important. Tokyo was seen to have lost ground last time around with a highly technical, underwhelming final presentation and is determined not to repeat the mistake this time around. Like other recent successful bidders, it will emphasise its youth appeal and promise to &quot;help reinforce and renew the Olympic Values for a new generation&quot;. For the last two summer Games, the favourite has been overtaken in the final stages by a more compelling backstory, with London overhauling Paris in 2005 thanks to a late surge generated by Tony Blair and Lord Coe. In 2009, Rio became the first South American city to host the Games, humiliating a Barack Obama-backed Chicago bid in the process, after emphasising its position as a coming global power. Istanbul, as the bridge between east and west, is seen as having similar emotional pull this time around. The government&apos;s decision to back the city&apos;s Olympic bid rather than an attempt to host the 2020 European football championships led to that tournament being spread across the continent by Michel Platini. But while both Tokyo and Madrid have many of their venues already built, Istanbul would represent more of a risk as many of them would have to be constructed from scratch. As well as question marks over its ability to pull off the huge logistical challenge, it will also have to deal with questions over corruption head on in the wake of a huge football match-fixing scandal and a recent spate of public officials being sacked for bribery. Madrid, seen as outsiders by the bookmakers and bidding for the third consecutive time, will have to address questions over Spain&apos;s parlous financial state and its likely long term repercussions. The bid team will attempt to turn that huge negative into a positive by arguing that a successful bid would bind the country together and provide an economic stimulus. The bid documents, which run to hundreds of pages and detail the final masterplan of venues, budgets, financial guarantees, security, accommodation and other key aspects of the projects will be publicly released on Tuesday. All the bidders are expected to push their commitment to delivering &quot;sustainable&quot; Games, in line with Rogge&apos;s commitment to ensuring the cost and scale of the Olympics did not continue to spiral after the high water mark of Beijing. The IOC&apos;s evaluation commission, headed by British IOC executive board member Sir Craig Reedie, will visit the cities in March and prepare a report for IOC members in June. The full IOC will select the host city in a secret ballot in Buenos Aires on 7 September."}, {"sentences": ["Political deadlock, which has also characterised the reform agenda in Washington and Tokyo, could allow social unrest to grow and wreck any coherent reform plans, she said."], "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Business", "World news", "European Union", "Economics", "Banking", "European banks", "Euro", "Europe", "Euro"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-07T19:13:36Z", "title": "The euro crisis is over, declares Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/07/euro-crisis-over-jose-manuel-barroso", "article": "The euro has been saved and the euro crisis is a thing of the past, European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso has declared. But his optimistic comments and the prospect of looser rules for banks failed to lift markets, which ended a strong run of recent gains. &quot;I think we can say that the existential threat against the euro has essentially been overcome,&quot; Barroso said in Lisbon. &quot;In 2013 the question won&apos;t be if the euro will, or will not, implode,&quot; he said. Barroso has maintained an optimistic stance throughout the crisis, but his comments were in sharp contrast to the new year&apos;s message from German chancellor Angela Merkel, who told TV viewers last week that the currency zone faced another rocky 12 months. City analysts are also deeply concerned that austerity measures demanded by Brussels as the price of bailout funds would lead to prolonged recessions in periphery countries and the need for steeper spending cuts. Cuts to essential public services in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal are expected to increase unemployment and lead to further social unrest. Protests on the streets of Madrid on Monday highlighted the tensions inside the euro area after banner-waving protesters blamed Brussels, Berlin and the right of centre PP government of Mariano Rajoy for privatisations and cuts in healthcare spending. Elga Bartsch, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said she was anxious that Barroso and his colleagues in Brussels would fail to resolve long-running disputes over the EU&apos;s new institutions. &quot;The euro crisis seems contained for now. But we think it is not resolved for good. In addressing the fundamental flaws in the euro&apos;s institutional set-up, progress on banking union will be key. Assuming no crisis escalation, the euro area should re-emerge from recession and return to sub-par growth. Politics is the main risk,&quot; she said. Political deadlock, which has also characterised the reform agenda in Washington and Tokyo, could allow social unrest to grow and wreck any coherent reform plans, she said. &quot;An extended recession, diverging political positions and several elections create a difficult backdrop for in-depth reforms. We therefore expect only limited progress on an effective resolution of the crisis this year. We believe that progress on banking union, where preparations are under way for a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and where discussions continue on harmonising, and possibly pooling, bank resolution and deposit guarantee schemes, will be key.&quot; Merkel faces a general election in the autumn against a resurgent Social Democratic party (SPD) while the Italians are expected to go to the polls next month in an election that could see a revived Silvio Berlusconi with enough votes to block reform measures. Global stock markets, which have warmed to the message that the euro crisis is abating, drifted lower as some investors sought to cash in on last week&apos;s strong gains and worries grew of more political brinkmanship in Washington. Major indices surged last week after the US Congress passed a bill to avoid a &quot;fiscal cliff&quot; combination of government spending cuts and tax increases. The deal, however, remains incomplete. Politicians will face another deadline in two months to agree on more spending cuts while a debate over the country&apos;s $16 trillion (\u00a39.9tn) debt ceiling is also looming. Concerns that the eurozone will suffer another year of economic downturn after entering recession last year were heightened by comments from OECD boss Angel Gurr\u00eda who said the 17 member zone could continue contracting into 2014. Britain&apos;s FTSE 100 fell 0.4% to 6064 while Germany&apos;s Dax was down over 0.7% to 7719.78. France&apos;s Cac-40 lost 0.8% to 3701.06. Wall Street opened lower as well, with the Dow shedding 0.4% to 13,377.13 and the broader S&amp;P 500 falling 0.4% to 1460.14. The one bright spot for the markets was the banking sector, where stocks were up after global regulators eased new rules obliging lenders to set capital aside. The so-called Basel III rules are a set of new international standards to make sure banks protect themselves from the same trouble that caused the 2008 financial crash. On Sunday, the officials setting those rules delayed the date by which banks needed to have certain amounts of cash readily available. The move caused a jump in bank shares \u2013 Deutsche Bank was up 3% but the biggest gains were among ailing Spanish banks, which some had feared would struggle to meet the new cash requirements.

Ish \u2026 Strictly speaking, it&apos;s now the tallest building in western Europe, at 309.6m, since Moscow&apos;s Mercury City tower overtook it last year \u2013 with a 29m advantage. How does it compare to the world&apos;s highest observation decks? With the highest deck on the 72nd floor at 244m, it&apos;s got a long way to go before it can compete globally. More than 30 public decks rise higher around the world: Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa; the vertiginous Canton Tower in Guangzhou, China; the Tokyo Skytree; and the CN Tower in Toronto all boast decks at around 450m. Even the Eiffel Tower beats the Shard, with a viewing platform at 276m. What&apos;s inside? Hailed as a &quot;vertical city&quot; by its architect, Renzo Piano, the bulk of the Shard is taken up by offices, up to the 28th floor, followed by three floors of restaurants \u2013 to be run by Hong Kong&apos;s Aqua Group and the founders of the Japanese restaurant chain Zuma, Arjun Waney and Rainer Becker, and open from April. Above this sits 18 floors of the five-star Shangri-La hotel (complete with a swimming pool on the 52nd floor), topped off by 10 apartments \u2013 each expected to fetch between \u00a330m and \u00a350m. At the top, occupying levels 68\u201372 is the public gallery, The View from the Shard. How do I get a ticket? To save the queuing scrum of most London attractions, The View from the Shard operates on a pre-booked timed ticket system \u2013 already on sale, you can book online here up to four months in advance, and print out your airport-style e-ticket at home. Billed as a &quot;premium attraction&quot;, it comes at a premium price: \u00a324.95 for adults and \u00a318.95 for children (compared to a trip on the London Eye for \u00a317.28, or the Emirates Air Line at only \u00a33.20 on an Oyster card, and the Walkie-Talkie tower, which will be free when it opens at the end of 2014). Open daily from 9am to 10pm from 1 February, a limited number of &quot;walk-up&quot; tickets are also available on the day \u2013 at the increased price of \u00a329.95 and \u00a323.95. How do I get there? The Shard might be hard to miss, rising 300m above London Bridge station, but the entrance to the View is trickier to find \u2013 located in the brick vaulted passage of Joiner Street that threads its way beneath the station. Arriving by train or tube, you won&apos;t even have to go outside, and the exit deposits you back on the station concourse level after your visit. There is no dedicated cycle-parking and whatever you do, don&apos;t come by car: there are no parking or drop-off facilities. What do I get for my money? Anyone hoping for a &quot;4D theatre experience&quot; or other interactive distractions along the way will be disappointed. As the name of the attraction suggests, the main draw is the view, and it is rightly given centre stage. Elevators whisk you up to the 68th floor at six metres per second, where a triple-height viewing gallery offers a 360-degree panorama up to 40 miles across the city on a clear day. Digital telescopes provide extra information on what you&apos;re looking at, and you can feel the wind in your hair on the open-air 72nd floor. Visits are not timed, so once you get up there you can stay as long as you like \u2013 although there is nowhere to sit down. There is also a &quot;sky boutique&quot;, and the best thing on offer is its cuddly toys of Romeo the fox (the dare-devil creature found living at the top of the Shard during construction). Anything else? Leave big bags at home \u2013 anything over 55 x 38 x 20cm will not be allowed in, and there is no cloakroom facility, although folded pushchairs can be left downstairs. Binoculars might be handy \u2013 there are 12 digital telescopes, but with 250 people in the galleries at any one time, you might be in for a wait. And remember to check the Met Office forecast before you go \u2013 it&apos;s so high that low fog can easily scupper the view."}, {"sentences": ["Much like the successful bids from London and Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul&apos;s bid team will make much of the extent to which the Games will be embedded into the city and its culture as part of its attempt to beat Madrid and Tokyo to the prize of hosting the 2020 Games.", "Istanbul, bidding for a fifth time, is seen as a riskier choice than Tokyo and Madrid because many of the venues and infrastructure still have to be built.", "All three bidders on Monday published the detailed candidature files handed to the International Olympic Committee, with the favourite, Tokyo, highlighting its safety, advanced infrastructure and convenience."], "tags": ["Tokyo Olympic Games 2020", "Sport", "Turkey", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-08T17:02:03Z", "title": "2020 Olympics: Istanbul says it would host 'open and affordable' Games", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/08/istanbul-olympic-games-2020", "article": "The leader of Istanbul&apos;s bid to host the Olympics for the first time has claimed that its unique geographical position bridging two continents will give it the edge over its rivals and outlined plans to stage a spectacular opening ceremony in front of more than half a million people lining the Bosphorus. Much like the successful bids from London and Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul&apos;s bid team will make much of the extent to which the Games will be embedded into the city and its culture as part of its attempt to beat Madrid and Tokyo to the prize of hosting the 2020 Games. &quot;We will have an incomparable backdrop, combining natural and architectural beauty like nowhere else,&quot; said Istanbul&apos;s 2020 bid leader, Hasan Arat, a former professional basketball player who is also vice-president of the Turkish Olympic Committee. &quot;That is why it has been a global city of inspiration for thousands of years. &quot;If the IOC awards the Games to Istanbul, in the morning you could watch the beach volleyball in Asia, in the afternoon the rugby in Europe and in the evening you can join a celebration across the continents on the banks of the Bosphorus. There is a unique opportunity for a compact, intercontinental concept.&quot; Adopting other mantras that proved successful for London and Rio, Arat promised that an Istanbul Games would be &quot;the people&apos;s Games&quot; and would be &quot;open, accessible and affordable&quot;. Istanbul, bidding for a fifth time, is seen as a riskier choice than Tokyo and Madrid because many of the venues and infrastructure still have to be built. But Arat insisted that the non-organising committee budget of $19.2bn (\u00a311.9m), much higher than that of its rivals, had been guaranteed by the government and was largely accounted for by major infrastructure projects that would proceed with or without the Games. &quot;Turkey has changed over the past 10 years,&quot; said Arat, who like the other bidders was in London over the summer as part of the IOC&apos;s observer programme. &quot;There is political stability, a very strong economy, big infrastructure projects, a lot of attention on sport. This is a unique opportunity for Turkey. &quot;We learned a lot from London. It is time for Istanbul to promise something incomparable,&quot; he added, insisting that the bid would not be harmed by longstanding corruption allegations in Turkish sport and public life. In 2011 the annual European Fraud Survey by the international accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young found 77% of Turks interviewed thought bribery and corruption commonplace. But Arat said the government was committed to a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy. &quot;They are committed to all these things at all levels of sports administration and to protecting its integrity. The law is very strong,&quot; he said. All three bidders on Monday published the detailed candidature files handed to the International Olympic Committee, with the favourite, Tokyo, highlighting its safety, advanced infrastructure and convenience. It plans to completely renovate the stadium used for the 1964 Games, which will also serve as one of the main venues for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Madrid said its bid was strengthened by Spain&apos;s sporting excellence, the capital&apos;s qualities as an attractive, modern city and the project&apos;s ability to create jobs in the recession-hit country. An IOC evaluation commission inspection team, led by the British executive committee member Sir Craig Reedie, will visit each bidder in March and present its report in July. Each bidder will also present to the IOC executive board in July ahead of the final presentations and vote among the entire IOC membership in Buenos Aires on 7 September."}, {"sentences": ["Meanwhile, a stray cat wandering a small island near Tokyo holds important clues on its collar."], "tags": ["Hacking", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Internet", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-09T13:19:58Z", "title": "The Japanese cat that holds the clues to an internet prankster | Fruzsina Eordogh", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/09/japanese-cat-clues-internet-prankster-hackers", "article": "There is a hacker terrorising Japan with a computer virus, bomb threats and riddles. Meanwhile, a stray cat wandering a small island near Tokyo holds important clues on its collar. This is no movie. This happened this week. An unnamed hacker in Japan really did leave a memory card on a stray cat&apos;s collar, and journalists and authorities really did have to crack a few riddles to locate said ownerless feline. If befuddled agents of the NPA (National Police Agency) didn&apos;t already get the point, they should now: they are being toyed with, and the lack of headway they&apos;ve made after months of taunting is more than a little embarrassing. This is after the NPA &quot;extracted&quot; what appears to be false confessions from four suspects, who have been recently released. The hacker is clearly trying to paint authorities as inept, and succeeding. So far, according to Wired, Japanese authorities have only been able to identify two things about the hacker: one, he or she programs in the popular programming language C#, and two, he or she knows how to use proxies so they can post on the largest text-based forum on the internet, 2channel. While western audiences might not be familiar with 2channel, its US equivalent 4chan should ring a bell . All the authorities have on the hacker is information that could describe any internet prankster in the digital era \u2013 be it Anonymous activists or YouTube trolls. Even the decision to leave an important clue on a cat leaves the tell-tale scent of internet culture on the case. The hacker&apos;s taunting tactics are nothing out of the ordinary for internet pranksters, either. Any time Anonymous defaces a website, they make sure to rub the site owners face in it with codified language, in the form of seemingly random slogans and weird music videos featuring Rick Astley or Oprah Winfrey. They would say they are in it for the lulz, or the act of confusing and enraging their foe. There has always been a cat-and-mouse game between authorities and hackers, with one trying to wrestle control and assert superiority over the other. This dance is not just about evading your hunter, but also humiliating them. One of the most well-known hackers, Kevin Mitnick, was famous for how well he played this game. Mitnick went as far as tapping into cellphone networks to monitor when FBI agents were closing in on him, only to clean his apartment of evidence \u2013 except for a box of donuts in his fridge labelled &quot;FBI donuts&quot;. Gabriella Coleman, author of Coding Freedom: the Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking, describes it bluntly: &quot;If you are being pursued, to humiliate your hunter is pretty sweet, no? I mean, escaping your hunter is great but evading him/her is truly the cherry on top. The hunt becomes a very public game.&quot; The publicness of the Japan hacker&apos;s game is worth repeating: he or she sent both the media and the authorities riddles (much like the Batman villain the Riddler), effectively ensuring that his or her pranks get their fair share of press coverage. No motive for this hacker has surfaced yet, but the possibility that this is a big protest against the country&apos;s new anti-piracy law \u2013 a measure that went into effect in October 2012 that means offenders can be imprisoned for up to two years \u2013 can&apos;t be ruled out. Of course, this could just be a teen flexing his or her cyber muscles and trying to make a name for themselves, an always important cause to a young internet citizen. Given the international press the stunt with the cat has received, future pranks will likely become larger and more complicated, whatever the motive. Either way, this hacker currently has the world as a stage. Pranksters, like most performers, need an audience to survive."}, {"sentences": ["Chinese surveillance vessels have made repeated intrusions into Japanese waters since the government in Tokyo in effect nationalised the Senkakus in the summer, sparking riots in Chinese cities and damaging trade ties between Asia&apos;s two biggest economies."], "tags": ["Drones (military)", "China", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-09T16:50:00Z", "title": "Japan and China step up drone race as tension builds over disputed islands", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/08/china-japan-drone-race", "article": "Drones have taken centre stage in an escalating arms race between China and Japan as they struggle to assert their dominance over disputed islands in the East China Sea. China is rapidly expanding its nascent drone programme, while Japan has begun preparations to purchase an advanced model from the US. Both sides claim the drones will be used for surveillance, but experts warn the possibility of future drone skirmishes in the region&apos;s airspace is &quot;very high&quot;. Tensions over the islands \u2013 called the Diaoyu by China and the Senkaku by Japan \u2013 have ratcheted up in past weeks. Chinese surveillance planes flew near the islands four times in the second half of December, according to Chinese state media, but were chased away each time by Japanese F-15 fighter jets. Neither side has shown any signs of backing down. Japan&apos;s new conservative administration of Shinzo Abe has placed a priority on countering the perceived Chinese threat to the Senkakus since it won a landslide victory in last month&apos;s general election. Soon after becoming prime minister, Abe ordered a review of Japan&apos;s 2011-16 mid-term defence programme, apparently to speed up the acquisition of between one and three US drones. Under Abe, a nationalist who wants a bigger international role for the armed forces, Japan is expected to increase defence spending for the first time in 11 years in 2013. The extra cash will be used to increase the number of military personnel and upgrade equipment. The country&apos;s deputy foreign minister, Akitaka Saiki, summoned the Chinese ambassador to Japan on Tuesday to discuss recent &quot;incursions&quot; of Chinese ships into the disputed territory. China appears unbowed. &quot;Japan has continued to ignore our warnings that their vessels and aircraft have infringed our sovereignty,&quot; top-level marine surveillance official Sun Shuxian said in an interview posted to the State Oceanic Administration&apos;s website, according to Reuters. &quot;This behaviour may result in the further escalation of the situation at sea and has prompted China to pay great attention and vigilance.&quot; China announced late last month that the People&apos;s Liberation Army was preparing to test-fly a domestically developed drone, which analysts say is likely a clone of the US&apos;s carrier-based X-47B. &quot;Key attack technologies will be tested,&quot; reported the state-owned China Daily, without disclosing further details. Andrei Chang, editor-in-chief of the Canadian-based Kanwa Defence Review, said China might be attempting to develop drones that can perform reconnaissance missions as far away as Guam, where the US is building a military presence as part of its &quot;Asia Pivot&quot; strategy. China unveiled eight new models in November at an annual air show on the southern coastal city Zhuhai, photographs of which appeared prominently in the state-owned press. Yet the images may better indicate China&apos;s ambitions than its abilities, according to Chang: &quot;We&apos;ve seen these planes on the ground only \u2014 if they work or not, that&apos;s difficult to explain.&quot; Japanese media reports said the defence ministry hopes to introduce Global Hawk unmanned aircraft near the disputed islands by 2015 at the earliest in an attempt to counter Beijing&apos;s increasingly assertive naval activity in the area. Chinese surveillance vessels have made repeated intrusions into Japanese waters since the government in Tokyo in effect nationalised the Senkakus in the summer, sparking riots in Chinese cities and damaging trade ties between Asia&apos;s two biggest economies. The need for Japan to improve its surveillance capability was underlined late last year when Japanese radar failed to pick up a low-flying Chinese aircraft as it flew over the islands. The Kyodo news agency quoted an unnamed defence ministry official as saying the drones would be used &quot;to counter China&apos;s growing assertiveness at sea, especially when it comes to the Senkaku islands&quot;. China&apos;s defence budget has exploded over the past decade, from about \u00a312.4bn in 2002 to almost \u00a375bn in 2011, and its military spending could surpass the US&apos;s by 2035. The country&apos;s first aircraft carrier, a refurbished Soviet model called the Liaoning, completed its first sea trials in August. A 2012 report by the Pentagon acknowledged long-standing rumours that China was developing a new generation of stealth drones, called Anjian, or Dark Sword, whose capabilities could surpass those of the US&apos;s fleet. China&apos;s state media reported in October that the country would build 11 drone bases along the coastline by 2015. &quot;Over disputed islands, such as the Diaoyu Islands, we do not lag behind in terms of the number of patrol vessels or the frequency of patrolling,&quot; said Senior Colonel Du Wenlong, according to China Radio International. &quot;The problem lies in our surveillance capabilities.&quot; China&apos;s military is notoriously opaque, and analysts&apos; understanding of its drone programme is limited. &quot;They certainly get a lot of mileage out of the fact that nobody knows what the hell they&apos;re up to, and they&apos;d take great care to protect that image,&quot; said Ron Huisken, an expert on east Asian security at Australian National University. He said the likelihood of a skirmish between Chinese and Japanese drones in coming years was &quot;very high&quot;. US drones have also attracted the interest of the South Korean government as it seeks to beef up its ability to monitor North Korea, after last month&apos;s successful launch of a rocket that many believe was a cover for a ballistic-missile test. The US&apos;s Global Hawk is piloted remotely by a crew of three and can fly continuously for up to 30 hours at a maximum height of about 60,000 ft. It has no attack capability. The US deployed the advanced reconnaissance drone to monitor damage to the Fukushima nuclear power plant in the aftermath of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami on Japan&apos;s north-east coast."}, {"sentences": ["Mercury levels in fish from sites in Japan and Uruguay were so high that no consumption is recommended, according to US EPA guidelines, and 95% of the human hair samples taken from individuals tested in Tokyo, Japan exceeded the US EPA reference dose."], "tags": ["Pollution", "Coal", "Energy industry", "Environment", "Japan", "US news", "US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)", "Health", "Water", "Fishing"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-10T13:30:00Z", "title": "Mercury poisoning is a growing global menace we have to address | Robert F Kennedy Jr and Marc E Yaggi", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/10/mercury-poisoning-global-menace-treaty", "article": "Next week, diplomats from around the world will gather in Geneva to negotiate a treaty on global emissions of mercury \u2013 a lethal neurotoxin that includes, among an inventory of grim effects, brain damage and the loss of IQ points in unborn children, injuries to kidneys and heart, and results in tens of billions of dollars in healthcare costs every year in the US alone. The Geneva conference is the final of five meetings, with a treaty expected soon thereafter. While global mercury emissions are on the rise, negotiators, unfortunately, appear to be leaning towards a treaty with soft measures unlikely to prevent continued catastrophic impacts from this deadly and debilitating poison. Ironically, signatories propose to ink their treaty in Minamata, Japan, a town that famously suffered widespread mercury poisoning. Health experts first described mercury poisoning, then called &quot;Minamata disease&quot;, in Minamata city, in Japan, in 1956. Mercury discharges from the Chisso chemical plant contaminated finfish and shellfish, devastating the community&apos;s human and animal population for decades. Many of the region&apos;s citizens died and tens of thousands of people suffered mercury-related illnesses. A former Japanese prime minister proposed naming the treaty the &quot;Minamata Convention&quot; to inspire delegates to reach an agreement that would prevent future mercury poisoning. Sadly, the treaty does not require identification or remediation of contaminated sites, does not require polluters to pay for health damages or environmental clean-up, or provide for protection from similar disasters occurring anywhere in the world. In fact, the treaty is not expected to reduce global levels of mercury in fish and seafood at all. Poisonous mercury raining down from coal-fired power plants has contaminated fish in every US state. Now, a new report from the Biodiversity Research Institute (BRI) in Maine and IPEN, a network of 700 public interest organizations in 116 countries, shows the devastating global impacts of mercury pollution from coal-burning power plants and other mercury sources. The IPEN-BRI Global Hotspots report finds that coal-fired power plants, artisanal small-scale gold mining, chlor-alkali plants, and other industrial sources contaminate humans and fish around the world with mercury levels that exceed health advisory levels. Mercury levels in fish from sites in Japan and Uruguay were so high that no consumption is recommended, according to US EPA guidelines, and 95% of the human hair samples taken from individuals tested in Tokyo, Japan exceeded the US EPA reference dose. The report demonstrates the need for a treaty that effectively addresses mercury releases. The US is only now starting to see progress in reducing mercury emissions. In America, citizen action forced EPA to adopt the first ever mercury and air toxics rule in 2012. This rule will prevent 90% of the mercury in coal burned at power plants from being emitted into the air. Experts estimate the rule will, among other things, prevent annually up to 6,000 heart attacks, 130,000 asthma attacks, 3,000 cases of chronic bronchitis, and 4,000-11,000 premature deaths. Moreover, experts predict the rule will save $40-70bn in healthcare costs annually. Imagine the benefits if these reductions were implemented globally. Coal barons and mining magnates are profiting from poisoning the rest of us. As coal consumption dwindles in the US, these companies are exporting their deadly product to the rest of world. A recent report from World Resources Institute (WRI) estimates that almost 1,200 additional coal-fired plants are planned for development around the world.  But the mercury treaty is likely to call simply for reductions on a per facility basis, rather than an overall reduction in mercury emissions to air and water. As a result, the treaty could legitimize increased mercury pollution as the number of coal-fired power plants increases globally. Moreover, there is no agreement that the treaty should even require existing facilities to apply the best available techniques to reduce mercury releases. We need a mercury treaty that actually reduces global mercury pollution. A treaty that fails to include mandatory mercury reductions overall will dishonor the victims of Minamata disease and accelerate mercury poisoning across the globe. Those of us who care about public health and clean water, must stand strong and shame the spineless diplomats in Geneva into crafting a treaty that truly prevents the devastating environmental and public health impacts of mercury. \u2022 Editor&apos;s note: a number of minor editorial changes were made after publication at the request of the authors; none substantively altered the meaning of the article"}, {"sentences": ["The film follows Jiro Ono, an 85-year-old sushi chef proclaimed to be the best in the world, having dedicated his life to perfecting his craft and creating a 3 Michelin starred restaurant in a Tokyo subway station."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-10T17:12:53Z", "title": "Close up: a veritable frenzy of awards nominations", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/10/close-up-awards-nominations-frenzy", "article": "The big story The film world went awards crazy this week, aided no doubt by the Academy awards&apos; committee craftily bringing forward the announcement of their nominations to today \u2013 probably to spike the guns of the Golden Globes, who hold their results ceremony on Sunday.

Launching Tokyo&apos;s international campaign, its bid leaders dismissed concerns over radiation from the Fukushima nuclear disaster and a territorial dispute with China. They also said that levels of public support, which were lukewarm during the bid for the 2016 Games, have improved considerably since Japan&apos;s impressive showing in London. The Japanese capital, the bookmakers&apos; favourite, is up against Madrid and Istanbul to host the 2020 Games. Inose, who met with London mayor Boris Johnson during the 2012 Games, said Tokyo would provide a similar atmosphere to London. &quot;When a Games is staged in a developing nation, sometimes they bring in so much and make it stuffy and heavy. But in the case of the London Games, they were organised in a sophisticated way and in that sense London and Tokyo deliver a similar image,&quot; he said. Tsunekazu Takeda, an IOC member and president of the Japanese Olympic Committee and the Tokyo 2020 bid team, also highlighted its similarities with London. &quot;London 2012 gave us an additional lesson in how to host. Seb Coe and his team demonstrated the importance of preparation and attention to detail. They showed how early, efficient delivery meant that they had time to focus on the vital extra elements that take any Games from good to great. I&apos;m talking about things like city dressing, cultural events and, of course, the wonderful Games Makers,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, we believe we have plans that will see Tokyo stage Games that will also inspire a generation. We will host a dynamic celebration, fuelled by the amazing passion of Japanese sports fans and that will ignite the imagination of the entire world.&quot; Tokyo has hired a British firm, Seven46, that worked on the successful London and Rio de Janeiro campaigns, to develop its key messages in light of criticism that presentations had let Japan down during its previous bid. As well as emphasising its economic stability, safety and infrastructure, Tokyo&apos;s bid leaders will have to come up with a compelling narrative to secure the votes of IOC members swayed in previous votes by the persuasive cases made by London and Rio. Inose said that the natural and nuclear disasters that had hit the country in the past two years had increased the importance of securing the Games to the people of Tokyo and Japan. &quot;Since the bursting of the bubble economy in 1990, GDP was hovering at a very low range. In that context, a lot people lost their lives from the tsunami and we suffered from the nuclear accident,&quot; he said. &quot;The big question is how we can formulate a new hope for the Japanese people. The most important thing is to set an uplifting objective of the Japanese people.&quot; But bid leaders dismissed questions over whether the knock on effects of the nuclear disaster would impact on its bid, saying radiation levels in Tokyo were of the same low levels as London. In the midst of an ongoing global recession, the launch of Tokyo&apos;s international campaign in London made much of the $4.5bn budget already set aside by the city to pay for new infrastructure. A new main stadium, designed by Zaha Hadid with moveable seats and a retractable roof, is to be constructed on the site of the venue for the 1964 Games, and will be built regardless in time for the 2019 Rugby World Cup which will be hosted in Japan. An IOC inspection team will visit the bidding cities in March and prepare a report for IOC members by July. In the same month the bidders will present their case to the IOC executive board in Lausanne, before the final vote in Buenos Aires in September."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;This will not only undermine the bilateral relationship, but it will also negatively affect China&apos;s economy and society.&quot; Noda had hoped the move would avert a more serious diplomatic fallout from the proposed purchase of the islands by Tokyo&apos;s then nationalist governor, Shintaro Ishihara."], "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-11T08:00:53Z", "title": "Japanese PM criticises China's response to protests over islands dispute", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/11/japan-china-islands-dispute", "article": "Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has sharply criticised China for allowing anti-Japanese protests over the Senkaku islands to turn violent. Demonstrations were held in dozens of Chinese cities in the autumn after Japan&apos;s then prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, announced his government would buy the islands, known in China as the Diaoyu, from their private Japanese owners. Abe, a nationalist who last month became prime minister for a second time, blamed the Chinese authorities for allowing the demonstrations to spiral out of control, and for damaging bilateral business ties. &quot;It was wrong for China, as a country responsible to the international community, to achieve a political goal by allowing damages to Japanese-affiliated companies and Japanese nationals that have made contributions to the Chinese economy,&quot; Abe said on Friday. &quot;This will not only undermine the bilateral relationship, but it will also negatively affect China&apos;s economy and society.&quot; Noda had hoped the move would avert a more serious diplomatic fallout from the proposed purchase of the islands by Tokyo&apos;s then nationalist governor, Shintaro Ishihara. Protesters attacked Japanese businesses, factories and shops, forcing companies to temporarily close their premises and instruct employees to take safety precautions. The four-month standoff over the islands, located in the East China Sea, damaged trade ties between Asia&apos;s two biggest economies and prompted speculation that Japanese exporters would begin shifting investment to other parts of mainland Asia. The riots, together with a Chinese consumer boycott of Japanese products, cost firms more than $100m, according to a Japanese government estimate. Toyota said its sales in China fell 4.9% last year, the first annual decline since 2001, while Nissan said its sales in the country had dropped 5.3%, the first decline since 2003. Next week, Abe plans to visit Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand to strengthen ties as Japanese manufacturers boost investments in the region. His finance minister, Taro Aso, recently made a similar visit to Burma. But the government&apos;s chief spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, played down suggestions that Japan was seeking to challenge Chinese influence in the region. &quot;These countries are engines for growth of the world economy,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;I don&apos;t view respecting relations with the rest of Asia as a countermeasure against China.&quot; Japan&apos;s new 20tn yen stimulus package, announced by Abe on Friday, includes a 100bn yen (US$1.1bn) rise in military spending from 4.6tn yen last year, the first increase in the defence budget for a decade. Part of the extra cash is expected to go towards improving Japan&apos;s defence of the Senkakus following frequent sightings of Chinese surveillance vessels in and around Japanese territorial waters in the area. Beijing recently raised the stakes by sending aircraft into Japanese airspace near the disputed territories. Countermeasures are expected to include the deployment of US-made surveillance drones near the Senkakus by around 2015. In addition, Japan&apos;s coastguard will deploy several hundred officers, equipped with more than 10 patrol vessels, in waters around the Senkakus to deter Chinese incursions, Kyodo reported on Friday. Earlier this week, Japan&apos;s defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said the new defence budget increase would be used to address rising threats to its territory from &quot;neighbouring countries&quot;. Abe, who criticised Noda&apos;s &quot;weak&quot; response to Chinese provocations over the Senkakus, said his position on the dispute was &quot;not negotiable&quot;, saying that Japan would &quot;resolutely protect this water and territory&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Where Tampopo was a satirical paean to ramen, Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a fascinating documentary about a Michelin three-star restaurant in Tokyo, called Jiro, which serves top-quality sushi \u2013 and only top-quality sushi \u2013 starting at 30,000 yen (\u00a3210) for a 20-piece tasting course."], "tags": ["Documentary", "Film", "Culture", "Chefs", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Tokyo holidays", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-11T11:41:00Z", "title": "Jiro: Dreams of Sushi: a film about fish, fine-dining and fatherhood", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/11/jiro-dreams-of-sushi-documentary", "article": "Reading on a mobile?

Yet with its 10 seats, total lack of decor and bizarre location in a featureless, fluorescent-lit corridor down a set of stairs in Ginza metro station, Jiro is as unassuming as its master chef, 85-year-old Jiro Ono. For 75 uninterrupted years, since before the outbreak of the second world war, every day except for national holidays and the occasional Sunday, Jiro has spent all of his time devoted to doing just one thing: making sushi. &quot;I wasn&apos;t much of a father,&quot; Jiro says. &quot;More of a stranger.&quot; His dedication to his tradecraft is guaranteed to put you and everyone you know to shame.

Yet that is how he describes his time among the group of engineers, technicians, soldiers and firefighters who risked their lives to remain at the heart of Japan&apos;s worst nuclear crisis. The international media named them the Fukushima 50, although the actual number of workers who stayed to handle the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant ran into the hundreds. They became the heroes of the disaster. The world feted their bravery and selfless dedication, an antidote to the opprobrium being poured on Japan&apos;s hapless nuclear safety officials and politicians. But at home, almost all of the Fukushima 50 have remained anonymous. Some shun the spotlight, but many others fear reprisals as the public continues to grapple with the environmental and political fallout from the world&apos;s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. In a rare interview, Yoshizawa describes how the crisis unfolded, and why he does not consider himself a hero. When Japan&apos;s north-east coast was shaken by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake on the afternoon of 11 March 2011, Yoshizawa was certain of two things: he would not flee, and he would not die. The 54-year-old nuclear engineer was about to end his shift at Fukushima Daiichi when the first powerful jolt arrived. Violent swaying ensued, causing panels to crash from the ceiling. Yoshizawa, who was in a corridor outside the plant&apos;s main control room, was forced to crouch on the floor before talking shelter beneath a desk. &quot;I managed to look out of a window and saw parked cars bouncing up and down from the sheer force of the earthquake. I had never experienced anything like it,&quot; he said in a recent interview at the headquarters of the plant&apos;s operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco). Yoshizawa, who joined the company straight from university 30 years ago, was one of 6,000 workers on site that afternoon, a third of them in the restricted area near the plant&apos;s six reactors. His immediate thoughts were not with his wife and two daughters, who he assumed were safe at home in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, but with his colleagues, most of whom had families living near the plant.     Atsufumi Yoshizawa, a member of the Fukushima 50 who was in charge of two reactors at Fukushima Daiichi. Photograph: Tokyo Electric Power Company    Tsunami Once the shaking had subsided, Yoshizawa, a slight, bespectacled man who has swapped his anti-radiation suit for a shirt and tie since his transfer last year to the Tepco headquarters, where he is general manager of the nuclear fuel cycle department, headed to an earthquake-proof room where senior staff had gathered to discuss their response. It was there, less than an hour after the quake, that news began to circulate that the plant had been struck by a tsunami much bigger than the 3-metre wave predicted in news bulletins \u2013 and far higher than the facility&apos;s protective seawall had been built to withstand. The evacuation building had no windows, so none of the men inside could see the tsunami as it ripped into the front of the reactor buildings, uprooting everything its path and sweeping them away on a tide of filthy seawater. &quot;The next I heard was that there was a problem with the electricity supply, and there were reports of debris floating in the sea,&quot; Yoshizawa says. But the reality was even more menacing. The tsunami had crippled the plant&apos;s backup power supply, plunging it into darkness. Worse still, it had deprived four of the six reactors of the power required to cool the nuclear fuel rods inside. If Yoshizawa could consider himself fortunate in those circumstances, it was that the two reactors under his control \u2013 units five and six \u2013 were already in cold shutdown for planned maintenance checks. But for as long as the power stayed off, nuclear fuel rods in the remaining four reactors would melt, causing a potentially catastrophic release of radioactive material that would reach far beyond Fukushima.

Photograph: Tepco    Withdrawal The prime minister at the time, Naoto Kan, has since claimed Tepco was poised to pull out all of its employees, believing the situation had become irrevocable. Kan, who has converted to the anti-nuclear cause since leaving office in autumn 2011, told staff a withdrawal would spell the end of Tepco. In his darkest moments, he would later admit, he was making mental preparations for a possible evacuation of greater Tokyo, an area of 35 million people. Disagreements over a possible withdrawal rumoured to have taken place in the capital never filtered through to the men on the frontline, according to Yoshizawa. Some among the vast network of Tepco contractors and subcontractors ordered their employees to leave the plant. They were joined by other workers who lived in the communities in the path of the tsunami or which were imperilled by the reactor meltdowns. None of the workers had been able to communicate with their families; some would return to find their homes had been swept away. But at no point was anyone forced to stay, Yoshizawa said. &quot;I never thought of leaving. I had to stay and get a grip on the situation. I wasn&apos;t thinking about my family, only about the other workers and how worried they must have been about their own families. &quot;We knew that we would not be replaced. No one was forced to stay, but those of us who remained knew that we would be there until the end. We knew that we were the only people capable of saving the plant. Our determination surpassed all other considerations.&quot; Yoshizawa says the hardest part of his job was sending junior colleagues into dangerous situations. The plant was frequently rocked by strong aftershocks, and the proximity of so much water to electrical equipment was an ever-present danger, as was the risk of acute radiation sickness. The day after the tsunami, the plant was rocked again when a hydrogen explosion ripped though the building housing reactor No 2. Within days, two more units would suffer similar explosions. &quot;Several workers were injured during the hydrogen explosions, and telling people to go back into dangerous areas was tough. But [Masao] Yoshida [the then plant manager] never asked anyone to do the impossible; he knew that would only put lives at risk. By taking that approach, he united us all behind our mission.&quot;     Aerial shot of the No 3 nuclear reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Minamisoma. Photograph: Reuters/Digital Globe    Explosions Momentary relief came when Yoshizawa was moved to a disaster-response headquarters 5km from the plant. While he was there, the Fukushima crisis entered an even more dangerous phase, as two explosions in reactor buildings hampered efforts to direct a constant stream of coolant water at overheating fuel rods. After three days off-site, Yoshizawa and several Tepco colleagues decided they had no choice but to return to Fukushima Daiichi. As they left the crisis headquarters, firefighters, police officers, soldiers and nuclear officials lined up to salute them. &quot;We felt like members of the Tokkotai [the kamikaze pilots of the second world war] in that we were prepared to sacrifice everything,&quot; he says. &quot;The people lined up outside never said as much, but I could tell by their expressions that they didn&apos;t think we would return.&quot; By the time Yoshizawa arrived back at the plant, the international media were referring to him and his colleagues as the Fukushima 50, though the actual number of workers probably ran into the hundreds, with each team working shifts shortened by their exposure to constantly spiking atmospheric radiation. &quot;I had heard the term Fukushima 50, but in fact there were many more people at the site, many more than I had imagined. And no one was panicking.&quot; Over the weeks that followed, the Fukushima 50 resigned themselves to a daily routine of long shifts, wrapped head to toe in protective clothing, and uncomfortable nights sleeping on the floor of a radiation-proof building. The scale of the disaster left the plant workers short of vital equipment. At one point there were not enough protective suits to go round, and stocks of personal radiation monitors had been damaged in the tsunami. &quot;In normal circumstances you order what you need from outside, but we were in the middle of a nuclear evacuation, Japan was the scene of a major disaster, so no one could come near the plant,&quot; Yoshizawa says. &quot;The few supplies we did have, we got ourselves.&quot; Initially, the men survived on a diet of biscuits and other dried food. Deliveries of emergency supplies were out of the question while soldiers were still pulling bodies from the tsunami debris and getting aid to hundreds of thousands of survivors. The water shortage meant the Fukushima 50 were denied even bowls of warming instant noodles.     Tepco workers spray a green, resin-based dust protectant on the ground in the common pool area of the damaged Fukushima Daiichi plant. Photograph: Tepco/EPA    Deprivation For the first fortnight of the crisis, each worker was given just one 500-millilitre PET bottle of water that had to last two days. &quot;It was two weeks before I had my first cup of coffee,&quot; Yoshizawa says. &quot;It tasted fantastic.&quot; The long working hours, combined with a poor diet and sleep deprivation, took their toll on his health. He lost a lot of weight and his blood pressure soared. It wasn&apos;t until December 2011, when the government declared the damaged reactors had reached a stable state known as cold shutdown that he and his colleagues could return to anything resembling regular working conditions. Almost two years after the tsunami, the men who stayed behind at Fukushima Daiichi and spared Japan from an even worse fate occupy an uncomfortable place in the country&apos;s post-disaster psyche. While the Chilean miners who spent 69 days trapped deep underground in 2010 were feted as national heroes, most of the Fukushima workers continue to live unseen in the shadow of the disaster. Tepco turns down most interview requests, and all but two of the handful of workers who have commented publicly did so on condition of anonymity. Most have chosen to remain silent, fearing they would be ostracised in the communities they tried, but failed, to prevent from turning into post-nuclear wastelands for years, perhaps decades. Yoshizawa understands their anger. &quot;Generally speaking, people in Japan believe we were the cause of the accident, and it&apos;s important to bear that in mind. As Tepco employees we have to take responsibility for the accident, and ensure that it never happens again. It&apos;s a matter of regaining people&apos;s trust, but it will take time. &quot;Looking back, maybe there were things we could have done better to prepare, but at the time we did everything possible to respond to the accident.&quot; The perception that the workers perpetrated the accident and then botched their response appeared to permeate every level of Japanese society. The Fukushima 50 waited 18 months before the then prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, publicly thanked them for &quot;saving Japan&quot;, a gesture repeated this month by his successor, Shinzo Abe.     Another explosion rocks the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan Photograph: ABC TV/EPA    Gratitude If official expressions of gratitude were a long time coming, the men were buoyed from messages of support from all over the world, some of which decorate a huge Japanese flag that hangs in the Fukushima Daiichi central control room. Yoshizawa said Noda&apos;s visit to the plant last October was an honour, but added: &quot;I don&apos;t consider myself a hero, but when I hear people thanking us for what we did, I&apos;m grateful.&quot; His account of a temporary return to &quot;civilian&quot; life one month after the disaster is perhaps the most telling commentary on the Fukushima 50&apos;s unheralded heroism. As Yoshizawa left the plant, along with several other workers, to spend a few days with his family, he stripped to his underpants, completed a compulsory radiation check and changed into a tracksuit that was at least a size too big. He had grown an impressive beard, and his hair had become greasy and matted after four weeks without a bath or shower. A few hours later, their bus arrived at Tokyo Station, where they were left to catch trains to their respective homes. &quot;We must have looked strange, stepping off that bus in ill-fitting tracksuits, with long beards and dishevelled hair, and each carrying a plastic bag containing a few possessions,&quot; he says. &quot;But as we walked into the station no one gave us a second glance. Life in Tokyo appeared to be carrying on as normal, as if the Fukushima disaster had never happened. I sat down on the train and immediately noticed that people were avoiding sitting next to me.&quot;     A child undergoes a radiation test in Nihommatsu, Fukushima prefecture. Photograph: Newscom/Kyodo/Wenn.com    Choice Yoshizawa declined to divulge his internal radiation levels. They are abnormal, he admits, but not so high that he can never work at a nuclear power plant again. &quot;I am not worried about my health.&quot; He has, by choice, had just one counselling session since he left Fukushima Daiichi. &quot;Others have done it more regularly, it&apos;s important to have someone to talk to freely. But I don&apos;t kid myself that life will ever be the same. As a Tepco employee, returning to a normal life is impossible.&quot; While they slowly withdraw from Japan&apos;s public consciousness, the ranks of the Fukushima 50 say they will never forget their time at the centre of a nuclear disaster that, without them, could have been far worse. &quot;There is a special bond between us,&quot; Yoshizawa says. &quot;I can&apos;t put it into words \u2013 it&apos;s just a feeling we have towards one another. I guess it&apos;s the same as the camaraderie soldiers experience in wartime. In our case, the enemy was a nuclear power plant. And we fought it together.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["So I embarked on a tour of Tokyo&apos;s greatest sushi restaurants with renowned critic Masuhiro Yamamoto and discovered the famed restaurant Sukiyabashi Jiro.", "To make Jiro Dreams of Sushi, I spent eight weeks in Tokyo over the course of two years, gathering footage and delving headfirst into Jiro&apos;s world."], "tags": ["Japanese food and drink", "Chefs", "Food & drink", "Documentary", "Film", "Culture", "Life and style", "Tokyo holidays", "Travel", "Seafood"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-11T15:21:00Z", "title": "Jiro Dreams of Sushi: watch the film and leave a question for the director", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/jan/11/david-gelb-jiro-dreams-of-sushi", "article": "Reading on a mobile? Click here to watch the video My frequent family trips to Japan while growing up ultimately led to my fascination and admiration for the art of making sushi. After college, I saw BBC&apos;s Planet Earth, and immediately thought it would be great if someone made a movie like that about the world&apos;s best sushi chef. I have always felt that sushi is the most visually creative food, and a sushi chef the ultimate showman. So I embarked on a tour of Tokyo&apos;s greatest sushi restaurants with renowned critic Masuhiro Yamamoto and discovered the famed restaurant Sukiyabashi Jiro. Once I had met Chef Jiro and eaten the most delicious sushi of my life, I knew that this man would be the subject of my film. In addition to the amazing sushi, I was intrigued by the fact that not only is he still working at 85 years old, but his sons still work for him. The son of an alcoholic father who was on his own since the age of 10, Jiro has dedicated his life to mastering his craft and providing an environment where his sons can thrive. It&apos;s a very difficult business, and to build the clientele to allow you to provide the quality that Jiro does is not so easy. I&apos;ll point to what Jiro mentions in the film, which is that 95% of the preparation happens in the kitchen before he even gets there. That&apos;s an amazing testament to what a great teacher he is. His sons have picked all of that up, and the quality of Jiro will always be there with them. In a difficult business where fish supply is dwindling and the cost of ingredients is rising, Jiro has gained recognition and a loyal following by mastering the art of making sushi in its purest form. I had the opportunity to taste Jiro&apos;s sushi while shooting the documentary, and the experience was flawless. What sets Jiro&apos;s sushi apart from the rest? The big difference is the rice. In my opinion, a lot of sushi restaurants outside Japan \u2013 even the high-end ones \u2013 overlook the rice. Jiro&apos;s is a little more vinegary than we might be used to and served at body temperature. It is cooked at very high pressure, which allows it to be fluffy; but at the same time, each grain retains its shape. So when you eat it, you get this wonderful blend of fish and rice. Jiro has mastered it. It ends up tasting like something completely new. To make Jiro Dreams of Sushi, I spent eight weeks in Tokyo over the course of two years, gathering footage and delving headfirst into Jiro&apos;s world. The editor and my long-time friend, Brandon Driscoll-Luttringer, worked closely with me to bring out this man&apos;s story, looking to illustrate how his work ethic had shaped his character and that of his sons. Although it is very much about the sushi, this film is not simply a foodie documentary. It&apos;s the story of a man who has devoted his life to mastering a craft. Jiro&apos;s refusal to quit reminds me of my grandparents, who still rise at 5am every morning to write. This is why they are still so sharp. Like Jiro, they never stop improving.

Alongside heralded films such as The Imposter was I Am Nasrine, which had not premiered at Sundance or Cannes, the LFF or even Edinburgh, but at the Berwick film and media arts festival. I haven&apos;t spoken to anyone who&apos;d even heard of the film prior to its nomination, though it did have a limited release in the north east, where its director, Tina Gharavi, resides and where it is partly set. So I tracked Gharavi down and spoke to her, just after she&apos;d finished a call with the ever-voracious Weinstein Company, it turns out. The film is about an Iranian woman who flees Tehran and finds herself smuggled to a rather bleak Tyneside. Gharavi herself was born in Iran and fled, aged six, with her family during the 1979 revolution, which is of course depicted in this year&apos;s somewhat more garlanded film Argo. She came first to Loughborough in the UK and then to New Jersey in the US, and now, via a stint in New Zealand, lives in Newcastle (she must be the only person to understand both reality TV shows Jersey Shore and Geordie Shore). She told me part of I Am Nasrine was shot clandestinely in Iran, with Gharavi and her tiny crew pretending they were the second unit on another feature being shot there, a real-life echo of the incredible scenario behind Ben Affleck&apos;s Argo. &quot;So much of that movie is wrong that I just laughed at it,&quot; says Gharavi. &quot;Iranians never run, that&apos;s for starters. And the scene in the bazaar, just wrong \u2013 an Iranian man would never yell at a woman, not least a Western woman who would be seen as a guest in his country. Even during a revolution, that wouldn&apos;t happen.&quot; Gharavi says she had no idea her film was even in contention and revealed that she only sent it into Bafta at the behest of her composers, the musical collective Wave Media from Leeds, who fancied their chances with what is their first film score. She finds herself nominated alongside doc maker Jacqui Morris, whose documentary debut McCullin featured in this column recently too. ScarJo to show? Hidden away in the Oscar nominations, many will have missed what may be the biggest confrontation of the night. Scarlett Johansson will face Adele in the battle for best song. Johansson sings the ethereal vocals on Before My Time, written by J Ralph, and featured on the beautiful eco-doc Chasing Ice. Despite winning the Bafta for best actress for Lost in Translation, Johansson has never been nominated for an Oscar, and I hear she&apos;s determined to show up and perform her song on the night \u2013 even though she will be in a Broadway run of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof at the time. Before My Time is of course up against Adele&apos;s belting anthem Skyfall, the titular James Bond track, and Everybody Needs a Best Friend from Oscar host Seth MacFarlane&apos;s comedy Ted. The best song category is often woven into the narrative of the Oscar show, although that pattern has been toyed with in recent years. However, it could see MacFarlane, who is well known as a cabaret singer (he even had his own Prom in London last year), take on former host Hugh Jackman, who is nominated for best actor and performs Suddenly, a song composed for the film version of Les Mis\u00e9rables and should on no account be confused with the Billy Ocean ballad. Costume drama I always feel sorry for costume designers on Oscar night. I mean, what on earth do they wear? This year, Jacqueline Durran is nominated \u2013 third time lucky? \u2014 for her sparkling work on Anna Karenina. Can she borrow one of the dresses she designed for Keira Knightley&apos;s Russian beauty? Durran faces a dress-off with 10-time nominee and three-time winner Colleen Atwood, nominated for Snow White and the Huntsman, who has previously designed Helena Bonham Carter&apos;s Oscar night gowns. However, there is much talk that this category could go to the late Eiko Ishioka, the Tokyo-born designer who won for Dracula in 1992 and who did the costumes for the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony. She received a rare posthumous nomination for Tarsem Singh&apos;s Mirror Mirror.

His raw, grainy and impressionistic style signalled a dramatic break with the quiet formalism that defined earlier Japanese photography, and it influenced many younger photographers, including his friend Daido Moriyama and the often controversial Nobuyoshi Araki. In 1974, the great curator and critic John Szarkowski described Tomatsu as &quot;the pivotal figure of recent Japanese photography&quot;, whose images were &quot;an intuitive response to the experience of life itself&quot;.     Shomei Tomatsu in 2009. Photograph: Kyodo/AP    Tomatsu&apos;s best-known photograph is Melted Bottle, Nagasaki, 1961. It looks at first glance like a skinned animal, but is a beer bottle rendered grotesque and muscular-looking by the intense heat of the nuclear blast that devastated Nagasaki on 9 August 1945. He came upon the bottle and other relics of the atomic blast in a local museum while on an assignment to photograph the reconstruction of the city. What Tomatsu found in his wanderings though Nagasaki made him rethink his attitude to his country&apos;s history as well as to photography. In grainy, monochrome tones, he shot broken marble angels in the grounds of a Christian church and a cracked wristwatch, its hands frozen at 11.02am, the exact time of the nuclear detonation. He also took portraits of survivors whose faces had been scarred by the bomb. The surreal and unsettling power of the melted bottle image evoked the almost unimaginable horror of the moment and led him into a place beyond reportage or documentary. Later, the American photographer and writer Leo Rubinfien described Tomatsu&apos;s Nagasaki images as &quot;sad, haggard facts&quot; and noted that &quot;beneath the surface there was a grief so great that any overt expression of sympathy would have been an insult&quot;. Born in Nagoya, Tomatsu came of age in Japan&apos;s turbulent, self-questioning postwar years. He started out as a traditional photojournalist in the early 1950s, but found himself drawn intuitively to the intimate and the everyday. As Szarkowski later put it, Tomatsu was intent on &quot;the rediscovery and restatement, in contemporary terms, of a specifically Japanese sensibility&quot;. In 1958, though, keen to show what he saw as the creeping Americanisation of his country, he began photographing the American soldiers stationed in military bases throughout Japan. In his book The Pencil of the Sun (1975) he wrote: &quot;It was as if America seeped though the gaps in the wire fences surrounding the bases and, in time, soaked the entire country.&quot; While photographing the Americans, though, Tomatsu&apos;s attitude to them became more complex, even conflicted, and he said later that he experienced &quot;a complex mixture of abhorrence and reverence, a certain fond nostalgia&quot;. An outsider by temperament, he found himself socialising with his often extroverted American subjects, who were at ease with his camera. Finally, he produced a series he called Chewing Gum and Chocolate. &quot;In 1945, its cities devastated, Japan was inundated with American soldiers,&quot; he wrote. &quot;We were starving, and they threw us chocolate and chewing gum. That was America. For better or worse, that&apos;s how I encountered America.&quot; The series was wilfully impressionistic, even poetic, its underlying meanings, both cultural and political, suggested rather than spelt out. He told the\u00a0younger Moriyama that photography was akin to the haiku. For a\u00a0brief time, he pointed his camera at the ground, capturing objects trampled into tarmac or embedded in earth. A retrospective book, Nippon, published in 1967, was full of dramatic, often contradictory-seeming, images of landscapes, holy men, traditional actors and half-hidden artefacts. By then, Japan was feeling the tremors of the youth-cultural upheavals in the west, and two series, Protest, Tokyo and Eros, Tokyo, both 1969, reflect that sense of sudden, turbulent social change. The first records the Tokyo student street protests of the time in a blurred, visceral style, while the second portrays the &quot;underground city&quot; of Shinjuku in central Tokyo, where prostitutes, drifters, hippies and artists lived outside the conventions of society. &quot;The town of Shinjuku makes us feel &apos;free&apos; even if this is an illusion,&quot; he wrote in Oh! Shinjuku, which collected the two series and was published in 1969. Tomatsu later said he saw the youthful rebellion of that time &quot;through the eyes of a stray dog&quot; and it is no accident that a grainy image of a stray dog came to define the approach of Tomatsu&apos;s friend and stylistic heir, Moriyama. Moriyama is currently on show at Tate Modern and Tomatsu has been on show at the Barbican, as part of the Everything Is Moving group show, which finished on 13 January. Though not much older than Moriyama and Takuma Nakahira, who was the driving force behind the avant-garde, anti-establishment Provoke photography movement in Japan in the late 1960s, Tomatsu was initially seen as one of the established figures they were reacting against. He is now accepted as their stylistic and even moral mentor, the self-styled outsider who pioneered extreme subjectivity and a visceral approach that elevated the grainy, the broken and the blurred above the formally beautiful. In 2006, a major retrospective of his work was held at the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco. It was called Skin of the Nation. Few photographers have looked so closely and penetratingly at and beneath the skin of a nation as Tomatsu did when he turned his camera on his homeland. The results remain by turns startling, disturbing and complex, imbued with all the contradictions he felt about Japan, photography, himself. \u2022 Shomei Tomatsu, photographer, born 16 January 1930; died 14 December 2012 \u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2013.

Los Altos is our favorite track from La Reserva De Los Lieros, their third album.  AUSTRALIA: Who The Bloody Hell Are They?D.D Dumbo - Tropical OceansOliver Hugh Perry is D.D Dumbo. Perry makes music from his house in Castlemaine, a small rural town 120km from Melbourne. Tropical Oceans is a perfect cue to his unique brand of technicolour lo-fi that spans genres, blues hooks, African folk - and a sound that no one else from anywhere is really making at the moment. Sometimes the best releases never receive as much credit as they deserve, and this is one of them. If music is supposed to make you feel goddamn otherworldly, 2013 is going to be a good year for D.D Dumbo.  AUSTRIA: Walzerk\u00f6nigNowhere Train - AshesNowhere Train is a project of seven folk musicians from different bands. After a train tour through the country and a documentary about it, the supergroup&apos;s first album, aptly named Station, recently saw the light of day. It was featured on national television and Austria&apos;s most popular website. Ashes, a song about a perfect moment, was written on tour by globetrotter Ian Fisher (Missouri/Berlin).  BRAZIL: Meio DesligadoTulipa Ruiz - Cada VozTulipa Ruiz is one of the major new Brazilian singers and is acclaimed by critics and the public alike. Cada Voz is the track that closes second album Tudo Tanto, available for free download on her website, and has its instrumental performed by the experimental band S\u00e3o Paulo Underground.  CANADA: Quick Before It MeltsDaniel Romano - Middle ChildGet out yer hankies, &apos;cuz this one&apos;s gonna make you ball like a baby. Daniel Romano&apos;s transformation into the reincarnated George Jones is now complete, right down to the leisure suit he wears on the cover of Come Cry With Me, his third solo album in as many years. The former Attack In Black frontman has become an impeccable storyteller, and this tale of an estranged son trying to make sense of the senseless will break your heart by the time he gets to the first chorus.  CHILE: Super 45Motivado - FerrerFor lack of a better label, the music of Motivado (Mario Mart\u00ednez) could be classified as &apos;space Latin house&apos;. After the praise he got for Bobby Fischer, his debut EP, Motivado delivered his second EP, Stasi, just as the past year ended and it exceeds what he accomplished on his first work. Yes, this is experimental music, but extremely danceable. Ferrer is one of three tracks on Stasi EP, a free download from the Discos Pegaos netlabel.  CHINA: WooozySummer Fades Away - Thank YouSummer Fades Away is an instrumental/post-rock band from Changsha. They released their second album We Meet The Last Time, Then Departure through 1724 Records last November, which features more classical elements. Though the band announced they were going on hiatus, fans still hope they could be back soon to make more beautiful music.  DENMARK: All ScandinavianNorth Fall - CurveOriginally a one-man project by singer-songwriter and guitarist Anders Belling, North Fall turned into a full indie-rock &apos;n&apos; alt-folk band in 2011 and released their first EP late last year, from which Curve is taken. The whole, excellent thing is yours to download on SoundCloud along with seven tracks from Belling&apos;s time as a lone rider.  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: La CaseteraDkano - El Bolo BoloRapper Dkano mocks the rise and fall of a fictitious dembow artist nicknamed Bolo Bolo, in reference to so many one-hit-wonders that this local genre produces, as opposed to true hip-hop. El Bolo Bolo is taken from Dkano&apos;s upcoming album Se\u00f1ales.  ECUADOR: Plan ArteriaFabrikante - ChanteomaMaking songs only with the voice is a risk that can produce impressive results. Francisco Valdivieso, better known as Fabrikante, is an artist who uses the flexibility of his voice to create unique compositions based on a powerful beatbox and original vocal loops. Chanteoma is the first single from his debut album, which will be out early this year.  ENGLAND: The Guardian Music BlogPublic Service Broadcasting - If War Should ComePublic Service Broadcasting is the operations name of one J Willgoose Esq and his cohort Wrigglesworth. Imagine the Pet Shop Boys if they were obsessed with the war. They&apos;re an electronic duo from London who use samples from old public information films, archive footage and propaganda material from WW2 and ally them to a variety of beats and backing from krautrock to drum &apos;n&apos; bass. If War Should Come, from The War Room EP, is typical of their approach, with its found voices and sense of looming menace as the broadcaster warns of impending battle.  FINLAND: GlueThe Fundamics - Role Of The SoulGuitars, Rhodes piano, Hammond organ, dub vibes and rap merge to create some of the grooviest music. The Fundamics combine 70s funk and soul with straightforward 90s hip-hop plus the addition of some up-and-coming rappers. Role Of The Soul is an instrumental track from the band&apos;s forthcoming album We All Have Our Roots.  FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredSpiders Everywhere - Swing LoopsSpiders Everywhere are a young band whose members hail from France and Switzerland. They released their appropriately titled The First EP last May. With a sense of rhythm as precocious as it is unique, some catchy melodies and soft vocals, this is just what we&apos;d like to hear more often on the French indie-pop scene.  GERMANY: ColtranFraktus - PogomaniaMaybe Fraktus found the best way to jump on the bandwagon of krautrock and neo New German Wave: Say you were one of the most influential bands of that time and a founder of techno but were forgotten about; create a brilliant mockumentary in the style of This Is Spinal Tap and record a &quot;comeback&quot; album. Fraktus&apos; Millenium Edition is in both senses contemporary. The influence of producer Erobique is clearly audible: deconstruction of common patterns, reconstruction to catchy and danceable songs which oscillate between all mentioned electronic music styles.  GREECE: MouxlalouloudaVictory Collapse - She Is More An Idea Than A GirlWhether Victory Collapse experiment with different tones, volumes or styles, they&apos;re always exuding an intensity that never fails to astound. Their debut album Convenience Has Poisoned Our Souls is an exciting mix of audacious post-punk stammering, noisy punk-funk sound and a barrage of buzzing, stinging guitars, chunky bass lines and clockwork beats littered with passionate, sharp vocals held together by such disparate art-rock tendencies as saxophone bits and cowbells with spastic, jagged grooves that are powerful enough to inspire a sea of awkward punk-rock dances.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarRumah Sakit - Bernyanyi MenungguRumah Sakit helped shaped the foundation of Indonesia&apos;s indie-pop scene. The band are back after a very long hiatus with a new album that sparked an all-night party on its release date of 12/12/12. If you love Blueboy you&apos;ll probably love this music too.  IRELAND: Harmless NoisemynameisjOhn - Don&apos;t Mind Me feat. God KnowsIrish hip hop grew steadily more promising in 2012, and not just in the densely-populated urban areas. The internet having pretty much quashed the pervading sense of isolation that separated more remote artists from sharing their work, some of the most exciting sounds came from outside Dublin. Releasing two EPs last year, producer mynameisjOhn is setting out pathways from his base in Ennis, rural County Clare. Collaborating with Shannon MC God Knows, whose delivery exacerbates the keen sense of neglect in Don&apos;t Mind Me, with its strains of sad string samples, it fits a certain disenfranchised mood in austerity-hobbled Ireland.  ITALY: PolaroidPaisley Reich - MargotTheir name makes me think of a parallel universe, where history took a weird and ultrasnob turn. These young kids from Rome really know how to mix psychedelia, shoegaze and indie-pop. From Deerhunter to C86, from Syd Barrett to Captured Tracks, Paisley Reich seem to have listened to a lot of different records. I wonder what will ever stop them. Download a free EP from their Bandcamp and expect beautiful things from them in the future.  JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesOKLobby - Fireworks2012 saw a surge in the number of bedroom-based producers in Japan, as SoundCloud and Bandcamp became flooded with new EPs and albums from artists working from the comfort of their homes. Tokyo-based OKLobby popped up at the end of the year, and his skittery Fireworks (off the recently released Resort album, get it at the link above) ended up as one of the finest home-produced tracks of the last 12 months.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rikaDapuntobeat - Necesito Cambiar feat. Javiera MenaDisco-funk has been the trademark sound of this Mexico City band for more than a decade, spawning international festivals, an inclusion on the FIFA 11 soundtrack and three - very slowly cooked - albums. Always in need of a female voice to be the cherry on top of their dancey instrumentals, Necesito Cambiar sees the all-male quintet join forces with Chilean indie-pop princess Javiera Mena, whom they have backed whenever she tours Mexico.  NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!Herrek - RainThere&apos;s an array of awesome Dutch underground bands planning to release new material in 2013 and that&apos;s why we&apos;re kicking off the year with an exclusive track from Herrek&apos;s upcoming album Waktu Dulu, to be released via Snowstar Records on February 15. Herrek revolves around Gerrit van der Scheer (known as a member of the now-defunct but still legendary post-noise bands Bonne Aparte and Adept) and has seen some different incarnations over the past year. Finding inspiration in childhood years spent in a small, secluded village in Papua, Indonesia, Gerrit (pronounced Herrek by the Papuans) has now delivered a hypnotic and somewhat dark record, lamenting monsoons whilst combining tribal clapping, lulling guitars and mesmerising vocals.  PERU: SoTBDolores Delirio - A Cualquier LugarDolores Delirio formed in 1994. Throughout their career, the sound of the band has shifted from 80s darkwave to gothic rock to hard rock and now simply rock. A Cualquier Lugar is from their first album Cero. This is an essential song in Peruvian rock history.  POLAND: \u0141ukasz Ku\u015bmierz WeblogkIRk - Pies Zdech\u0142In kIRk&apos;s music it&apos;s all about the meeting of electronic and acoustic, mixing free jazz trumpet sounds, frightening beats, vocal samples and sometimes scratches, with plenty of scope for improvisation. Although the trio have been around for a decade, they are gathering praise from listeners all over the world now. Pies Zdech\u0142 is kIRk&apos;s first single from Z\u0142a Krew, the follow-up album of the critically acclaimed Msza \u015awi\u0119ta w Br\u0105swa\u0142dzie.  PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Anarchicks - Restraining OrderAnarchicks are four women (Playgirl, Synthetique Red, Katari and JD) full of energy with different musical tastes and experiences. Following on from their Look What You Made Me Do EP, released in 2012, their debut album Really?! is out this month. From this record, we are privileged to share their first single, Restraining Order. Whether you like CSS, Sleater-Kinney or Pat Benatar, there is something for you in Anarchicks&apos; grrreat music.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndieFof\u00e9 y Los Fetiches - Barquito De PapelJos\u00e9 Luis Abreu aka Fof\u00e9 is a seasoned veteran of the Puerto Rican music scene. El Manjar De Los Dioses and Circo are two of the most recognized rock ventures in part thanks to his iconic voice and powerful stage presence. When Fof\u00e9 announced he was forming a brand new band expectations were high. On Christmas Day, Fof\u00e9 and Los Fetiches presented themselves at seminal music venue La Respuesta and unleashed their debut album Lujo Eterno, which opens with Barquito De Papel. Taking elements from New Wave and La Movida Madrile\u00f1a, their sound is polished but playful and totally danceable.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoiseKaleidonescu - UpperfieldsWe welcome 2013 with a MAP exclusive download of a brand new project on the Romanian market. Kaleidonescu manage to bring us exactly the kind of music we were missing. If you&apos;re into electronic, neopsychedelic and the like then you will surely want to keep your ears on this band. Make sure you check out the video, it definitely matches the sound.  RUSSIA: Big EchoMuc J - lagrng.pntsDiligently following traditions, Muc J creates lounge-friendly abstract hip hop with wonky jazz elements. Dmitry Fedorov, from Saint-Petersburg, has an enviable flair for melody and turns his inner world towards to the listener. It&apos;s a nice example of an album that is better than the sum of its tracks.  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopThe LaFontaines - Light Up The BackgroundYou can&apos;t help but wonder if The LaFontaines would be famous by now had they been from, say, Miami and not Motherwell. Combining Kerr Okan&apos;s rap dexterity with a surprisingly accessible rock/pop sound, the band owe much of their reputation and loyal following to their invigorating, electric live performances. Light Up The Background proves beyond doubt The LaFontaines know how to write a knockout chorus - the video, with its freerunning, is a must-see too. They are currently recording their debut album which should hopefully be out this summer.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean IndieJowall - Night NightJowall is a member of creative collective Byul.org, the Korean artist featured in April 2012&apos;s MAP, but he did most of the work himself before releasing his second solo album Clean &amp; Clear earlier this month. It hosts a variety of styles ranging from post-punk to dirty folktronica. Taken from the record is Night Night, with its convincing melody line and a warm, fuzzy sound.  SPAIN: MusikornerBrunetto - License To BeatBrunetto is from Sevilla but currently lives in Barcelona. We could call him a true electronic explorer as he doesn&apos;t hesitate to discover a new world in the music he makes through layers of sounds, chosen fearlessly. Brunetto has remixed some well-known electronic acts such as The Suicide Of Western Culture (featured in September 2011&apos;s MAP) and is set to release his fourth album later this year.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaSimian Ghost - Autumn Slowmo (For The Dejected Realist)Stockholm-based three-piece Simian Ghost is no stranger to the average lover of Swedish music - or any music for that matter - as last year saw them go from talented to fully-fledged, very much thanks to their magnificent second album Youth. To crown 2012, they released a limited time free EP for Christmas called Autumn Slowmo (For The Dejected Realist), and we&apos;ve been given the go-ahead to share its truly epic title track once more.  SWITZERLAND: 78sThe Fridge - PilotOn their new album Draw The Plot, The Fridge create a fragile sketch of indie-pop meets chamber folk from horns, piano, guitars, bass, percussion, chimes, choral music and different electronic equipment. They offer an intimate yet powerful album.  TURKEY: WEARTBEATB\u00f6brek Soundsystem - Mantarlar\u0131n \u0130\u00e7inde (\u00dcz\u00fcnt\u00fcden Uzakta)B\u00f6brek Soundsystem is an incognito producer/DJ who likes to combine incongruous Turkish sounds from trash movies, forgotten arabesque songs and anonymous Anatolian stuff with all kinds of improbability. Until we saw him live recently, we thought he was fooling around with us, but his show delivered an outstanding, ear-bleeding performance. Superbly creepy but catchy as hell.  UNITED STATES: We Listen For YouDragon Inn 3 - Rocket LauncherDragon Inn 3 is the side-project of Philip Dickey (Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin). The music plays like Beach House if the band existed right when the disco era was melting away. Bubbling synths, glamorous productions and smooth vocals create a soundtrack for the more introspective moments on and off the dance floor.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1s12&quot; Ninjazz - Caracas12&quot; Ninjazz is a hip hop trio formed by Dantes, DDA and DJ Threz. Their first album Boombap Mercenaries was released for free download in August 2012 and by the end of the year was listed as one of the best in the country. Boombap Mercenaries was mixed and mastered by musician Pedro Laprea in collaboration with well-known producers of the underground scene."}, {"sentences": ["Uematsu joined Square, the company behind Final Fantasy in 1986, when an employee from the game developer walked into the Tokyo music rental shop where he was working and asked if he&apos;d like to write some music for a video game."], "tags": ["Final Fantasy", "Games", "Technology", "Classical music", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-15T13:21:00Z", "title": "Final Fantasy given classical twist", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/jan/15/final-fantasy-classical-music-paris", "article": "In 1913, the audience of Paris&apos;s Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es flirted with full-scale riot during the lusty premiere of Rite of Spring. That flirting no doubt felt like uninhibited manhandling for the poor, soon-to-be-bruised souls in the orchestra, pelted with whatever objects were to hand by an audience driven furious at the avant garde-ness of Stravinsky&apos;s work. But no lasting damage was done that night. A century later and the odd Steve Reich knees-up aside (New York, 1973: a performance of Four Organs where an audience&apos;s jeering climaxed with a woman repeatedly banging her head on the stage, wailing &quot;Stop, stop, I confess.&quot; A Steve Reich knees-down, then) rioting and the classical music concert have parted ways. The riot lingered, coiled and brutish for quarter of a century in the rock gigs of nethertowns; spilt-pint punk, grunge brawls, hard-rock suckerpunches backed by guttural power chords. But rock music wears its anger on its sleeve (as a patch?). When you get down to it, the music&apos;s where the real fight takes place, and the mosh-pit provides a peer-refereed boxing ring for those who need to pretend otherwise.

Front-row VIP tickets cost a sharp \u20ac130, and their purchasers are lacking a certain joie de vivre on finding squatters emigrated from the cheap seats into their own, hoping for a better view. It&apos;s a quiet pandemonium, for sure \u2013 the attendants all raspy whispers and fly-swat points as they seek to shepherd disorder into order \u2013 but I can&apos;t help but feel happy I&apos;m not on bassoon tonight. I bruise too easily. That responsibility falls to a member of the The Orchestre Lamoureux, a concert society founded in Paris by Charles Lamoureux in 1881 that performed the premieres of Debussy&apos;s Nocturnes in 1900 and 1901. Tonight they debut in France a selection of pieces from Final Fantasy \u2013 a video game series currently celebrating its 25th year \u2013 under the baton of Chicagoan Arnie Roth at an event dubbed Distant Worlds. Classical music, much to the showy mortification of its most dedicated followers, has kept its well-dressed foot in mainstream culture via film scores for the past 50 years. But for the young audience of the Palais des Congr\u00e8s, it&apos;s the video game medium that&apos;s brought them out en masse tonight. A lowbrow victory perhaps, but it&apos;s difficult to imagine many other classical billings that would assemble a European city&apos;s youth gratis, let alone at these prices. The concert starts 30 minutes late, but at least everyone has a seat. Nobuo Uematsu, the Japanese composer responsible for the vast majority of music found in the series slides onto stage wearing an Axl Rose bandana and Super Mario moustache to riotous noise (the good sort, not the Stravinsky sort), before descending into the audience to howls of excitement to take his position in an un-squatted seat in the crowd. The set (and this is the correct terminology, as Distant World&apos;s conductor has chosen a small selection of greatest hits for the night, pulled from the many hundreds of compositions that have soundtracked Final Fantasy&apos;s 20-odd game releases) opens with the series&apos; signature harp arpeggio before seguing into Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec, an operatic piece sung with gusto by Le Choeur Lamoureux. A screen sprawls high behind the stage displaying visuals from the eighth game in the series, set to the music. I&apos;m surprised to find myself gulping back emotion. Music is all sorts of magic, of course, and in the most literal sense of the mystical word. Music has the power to transform the mood and temperature of an auditorium and, for the individual, it can conjure not just the emotion of memory, but also its very flavour and experience. Music is many spells \u2013 it has the power to reorder the mind, to raise or lower the blood, to produce tears or set teeth on edge \u2013 but its most powerful trick is one of transportation and, the combination of that warm Niagra of sound with these old images takes us individually and collectively to another place. Roth turns to the French and offers a &quot;mercy bow-coop&quot; before asking who in the crowd likes Final Fantasy XIII? This is the most recent core title in the series, one of the first produced without the steer of originator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who left the company under a black cloud worth $120m of lost money at the box office following his movie flop, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. The game was poorly received by many, something evidenced by the crowd&apos;s reluctant applause. But Roth has another surprise for us: Final Fantasy XIII&apos;s creators Yoshinori Kitase and Motomu Toriyama are in the crowd! The spotlight thwacks and swivels; more muted applause. I feel sorry for those guys. The billing&apos;s all wrong, you see. Kitase has worked on Final Fantasy games for 20 years, while Toriyama was responsible for some of the most memorable scenes in the seventh game, widely considered one of the best. Still, I guess you&apos;re only as good as your last game. Uematsu, close friends with Sakaguchi, has had a rough ride of it too in recent years, somewhat unceremoniously dropped from Final Fantasy XIII&apos;s compositional duties. This accounts for the cool response of the crowd to the next piece, composed by his successor. It&apos;s not like Stravinsky, you see. When it comes to Uematsu, this crowd has his back. Uematsu joined Square, the company behind Final Fantasy in 1986, when an employee from the game developer walked into the Tokyo music rental shop where he was working and asked if he&apos;d like to write some music for a video game. Uematsu, a self-taught pianist and graduate of Kanagawa University agreed, but never thought any of it would amount to much. It&apos;s likely these humble beginnings that account for his attractive humility today. He approaches his career with a mixture of wide-eyed wonder and gratefulness. The excitement hasn&apos;t dulled in him with age or accomplishment. A few years ago, after I interviewed Uematsu for a magazine, we stood eating cucumber sandwiches in a hotel lobby when he pulled a CD:R of tracks from his side-project band The Black Mages (the band played arranged rock versions of his Final Fantasy compositions \u2013 the music&apos;s where the real fight takes place), and slotted it into my hand. It&apos;s the behaviour of the wannabe college band member, not the multi-million selling, award-winning classical composer. Uematsu joins the orchestra for just one song. He is a proficient pianist, but the pressure of performing in these surroundings (cavernous, fighty) evidently puts him off. Roth provides some backup on violin (the Grammy-award winning conductor is an exceptional player, despite his faux-protestations) and the crowd is a sea of screens, mobile phones acting as the 21st Century&apos;s lighter of choice, recording for YouTube what was once the preserve of the bootlegger. The piece reaches its delicate conclusion and the lights wink out. Nobuo exits into the audience to yowls of appreciation. The pieces come more eagerly now: boy band fanclub-esque whoops and screams accompanying the audience&apos;s moment of recognition for each. A medley of four battle themes (the looping score that plays out behind fight scenes in each of the games) ends with a victory fanfare and the choir (who we&apos;d forgotten were standing there, present and erect) punch the air in unison with a shout. The night is almost at an end and nothing much has been thrown when Roth asks if anyone has any requests. For the crowd this is an invitation to riot and the Palais des Congr\u00e8s groans and holds a hand to the brow at the detonation of cacophony. &quot;Se-phi-roth!&quot;, &quot;Se-phi-roth!&quot; they scream with the sort of co-ordinated timing that Le Choeur Lamoureux would be pleased to end a fanfare with. Roth, unable to stray from his pre-scripted banter says: &quot;Well, we can do one final song, but it requires you to be able to sing a word? Can you manage that?&quot; The crowd continues, indifferent to his contextually ridiculous question. &quot;Se-phi-roth!&quot; they scream. &quot;Can you guess what it is&quot;, he asks. &quot;Se-pi-roth!&quot; they scream. &quot;Sephiroth!&quot; he says. &quot;Se-phi-roth!&quot; they scream. In Final Fantasy&apos;s peculiar police line-up of arch-villains it&apos;s the seventh game&apos;s antagonist, Sephiroth, that time has proven to be players&apos; fondest. And the piece that accompanies his on-screen swagger is one of Uematsu&apos;s finest. One-winged angel, a brooding, rolling piece of music, all scampering timpani and hysterical brass, backed by a choir repeating the villain&apos;s name over and over: &quot;Sephiroth!&quot; Outside, the venue&apos;s forsaken halls await the impending merch stampede. But in here Roth has found the Final Fantasy series&apos; spiritual centrepoint, one that the games have moved away from in recent years, much to the angst of fans. &quot;Sephiroth!&quot; is a reminder of the passion that brought the crowd here tonight, transporting them en masse to a younger place, where the games did the things they wanted to, where Sakaguchi, like a father, would never leave them, where everything would stay the same and remain just as exciting, despite its constancy. &quot;Sephiroth!&quot; they chant, on their feet now. Music is all kinds of magic. I predict a riot."}, {"sentences": ["It had been bound for Haneda airport in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Boeing", "Airline industry", "Air transport", "Japan", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-16T03:43:00Z", "title": "787 emergency landing: Japan grounds entire Boeing Dreamliner fleet", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/16/787-emergency-landing-grounds-787", "article": "     Japan&apos;s largest airline, ANA, and its competitor JAL have each grounded their entire fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners after an emergency landing due to a smoke alarm in the cockpit \u2013 the most dramatic of a spate of incidents involving the troubled aircraft over the past week and since its inception. All Nippon Airways said the plane had been evacuated, with its eight crew and all 129 passengers exiting safely on inflatable slides. Instruments in the cockpit indicated there had been a battery malfunction and the pilot had noticed a strange smell. ANA said the plane diverted to Takamatsu, western Japan, at 8.45am on Wednesday. It had been bound for Haneda airport in Tokyo. A spokesman for the Osaka airport authority said the plane had left Yamaguchi at 8am and made the emergency landing after the smoke alert. The incident is certain to rock global airlines&apos; confidence in the new aircraft, which went into commercial service just over a year ago after a three-year delay caused by design and production problems.  In the aftermath of the emergency landing, both ANA and JAL said they were grounding all their Dreamliners until satisfied they are safe to fly. The incidents have caused particular concern in Japan, the Dreamliner&apos;s biggest market, with ANA and Japan Airlines (JAL) flying 24 of the 50 planes to have rolled off the production line so far. ANA is the biggest operator of the 787 in the world so far, having taken delivery of 17 aircraft including the first one flown commercially. The aircraft has been hit by half a dozen incidents in the past week, including two fuel leaks, a battery fire, a wiring problem, a brake computer fault and a cracked cockpit window. Before that there had been engine failures during testing and in one case a Dreamliner cargo plane was forced to cancel takeoff when one of its General Electric turbines lost power. US aviation officials said the aircraft was safe and it was not unusual for new models to experience minor mishaps, but the recent incidents have inevitably raised questions over the Dreamliner&apos;s safety. More than 800 Dreamliners have been ordered by airlines around the world. The aircraft was supposed to have heralded a new era in commercial flight. Boeing officials say the plane, which is made of carbon fibre and other lightweight materials, is 20% more fuel-efficient than conventional airliners and 30% cheaper to maintain, and features design improvements for more comfortable medium and long-haul flights. Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel told Reuters: &quot;We&apos;ve seen the reports, we&apos;re aware of the events and are working with our customer.&quot;  On Tuesday, Japan&apos;s transport ministry said it was launching an investigation into the cause of two fuel leaks on a JAL Dreamliner. That came after US transport authorities and Boeing started a joint investigation into the aircraft&apos;s manufacturing, design and assembly. &quot;Looking at this from the point of view of average citizens, having these sort of incidents occur seemingly day after day, one could become very uneasy,&quot; Akihiro Ota, Japan&apos;s transport minister, told reporters. &quot;We plan to look into the scale of these accidents and what the overall situation is. We will convey the message to those who operate [the plane] that it is absolutely necessary to be safe.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["When an All Nippon Airways 787 Dreamliner took off from Tokyo to Hong Kong on its first commercial flight in October 2011, airline executives in Japan were quick to play down the litany of problems that had delayed the aircraft&apos;s arrival from Boeing&apos;s production line by more than three years.", "The incident occurred soon after takeoff on a flight between Yamaguchi in western Japan and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Boeing", "Airline industry", "Business", "Air transport", "World news", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-16T10:03:00Z", "title": "Dreamliner grounding means a nightmare for Boeing", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/16/dreamliner-becoming-nightmare-boeing", "article": "When an All Nippon Airways 787 Dreamliner took off from Tokyo to Hong Kong on its first commercial flight in October 2011, airline executives in Japan were quick to play down the litany of problems that had delayed the aircraft&apos;s arrival from Boeing&apos;s production line by more than three years. But enthusiasm over the Dreamliner&apos;s pivotal role in a new age of fuel-efficient commercial aviation has been replaced with mounting concern over its safety and the prospect of further production delays after the aircraft was hit by several worrying incidents in less than a fortnight. Hours after an ANA Dreamliner was forced to make an emergency landing on Wednesday morning when a cockpit smoke alarm went off during a domestic flight, the airline and its rival Japan Airlines grounded their entire combined fleet of 24 Dreamliners \u2013 about half the global total in service \u2013 to undergo emergency checks. The incident occurred soon after takeoff on a flight between Yamaguchi in western Japan and Tokyo. It is the latest in a spate of problems involving JAL and ANA-operated Dreamliners in Japan and the US since the start of the year. They include an electrical fire, two fuel leaks, a brake computer malfunction and a cracked cockpit window. &quot;Looking at this from the point of view of the average citizen, having these sort of incidents occur seemingly day after day, one could become very uneasy,&quot; Akihiro Ota, the transport minister, told reporters. &quot;We plan to look into the scale of these accidents and what the overall situation is. We will convey the message to those who operate the plane that it is absolutely necessary to be safe.&quot; By Wednesday, the pressure to ground the fleet had become irresistible, with Japan&apos;s transport ministry describing the emergency landing as a &quot;major incident&quot; that could have led to an accident. The ministry had already launched an investigation after two incidents involving Dreamliners belonging to Japanese airlines last week. &quot;Given the fuel leakage incidents occurred in succession, the minister directed the aviation director of the Regional Civil Aviation Bureau to open an investigation and find the causes of the two leaks as soon as possible,&quot; it said in a statement. Japanese authorities said they would work with Boeing and US aviation authorities, which launched their own comprehensive review of the aircraft on Friday. The US Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board said they were monitoring Wednesday&apos;s incident. There have been suggestions \u2013 vigorously denied by Boeing \u2013 that the rush to get the first batch of aircraft off the production line and into service may have contributed to the recent problems. The incidents could cause further delays if the investigations lead to demands for design and other changes in the hundreds of Dreamliners yet to be built. To date, Boeing has received orders for more than 800 of the aircraft from airlines around the world. The possibility of serous design or technological flaws will hit Japan particularly hard. It has been a vocal champion of the plane&apos;s fuel economy, and manufactures about a third of its parts, including its batteries and wings. ANA was heavily involved in the $207m aircraft&apos;s design and is, to date, its biggest customer. ANA flies 17 Dreamliners and has 49 more on order; JAL has seven in operation, with another 38 to come. British Airways has 24 on order and Virgin Atlantic 16. Aviation analysts were divided over the seriousness of the recent incidents. &quot;It is not abnormal for new aircraft to have some teething problems,&quot; Chris de Lavigne, of Frost and Sullivan in Singapore, told the BBC. &quot;There were initial issues with the Airbus A380 as well. Look where it is today. It is flying successfully and everyone seems to be happy with it.&quot; But Richard Aboulafia, a senior analyst with the Teal Group in the US, said: &quot;I think you&apos;re nearing the tipping point where they need to regard this as a serious crisis. This is going to change people&apos;s perception of the aircraft if they don&apos;t act quickly.&quot; The recent fuel leaks and electrical fire occurred while the aircraft were on the ground, and on Wednesday morning, all 129 passengers and eight crew left the plane safely after it landed at Takamatsu airport about 40 minutes after taking off. US aviation officials insist that despite the glitches, the aircraft is safe to fly. But footage of the plane on the tarmac, its inflatable emergency chutes deployed, will have done little to reassure an increasingly nervous flying public. &quot;Particularly worrisome is the fact that problems have arisen with electrical systems, which the 787 is more reliant on compared with conventional aircraft,&quot; Kazuki Sugiura, an aviation analyst, told Kyodo. ANA said its fleet of 17 Dreamliners could be back in the air as soon as Thursday, depending on the outcome of safety checks. The firm&apos;s vice-president, Osamu Shinobe, bowed deeply in apology at a press conference, and confirmed that the battery thought to be behind Wednesday&apos;s incident was of the same type involved in an electrical fire aboard a JAL Dreamliner at Boston&apos;s Logan airport last week. &quot;There was a battery alert in the cockpit and there was an odd smell detected in the cockpit and cabin, and [the pilot] decided to make an emergency landing,&quot; Shinobe said. JAL spokesman Seiji Takaramoto said the firm had cancelled all five scheduled 787 flights on Wednesday. &quot;We will decide what to do after today based on what ANA finds out about the cause of the problem with their aircraft,&quot; he said. Boeing said it was aware of the emergency landing. &quot;We will be working with our customer and the appropriate regulatory agencies,&quot; said Marc Birtel, a Boeing spokesman. The recent scares have so far had no impact on future orders, and neither have they led to groundings by other airlines. The Australian carrier Qantas said its order for 15 Dreamliners remained unchanged, while Air India said it would talk to parts makers but had no plans to take its six existing Dreamliners out of service. Boeing has said it expects to at least break even on the 1,100 new Dreamliners it expects to deliver over the next decade. But some analysts have predicted that the aircraft&apos;s huge development costs mean the company will never make any money from it."}, {"sentences": ["The film follows Jiro Ono, an 85-year-old sushi chef proclaimed to be the best in the world, having dedicated his life to perfecting his craft and creating a 3 Michelin starred restaurant in a Tokyo subway station."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Jodie Foster", "Golden Globes 2013"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-17T16:20:17Z", "title": "Close up: Jodie Foster and the Golden Globes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/17/close-up-jodie-foster-golden-globes", "article": "The big story You know the score: weird little statuettes, fulsome compliments and a few off-colour jokes, evening gowns and tears, yada yada yada.

Reports from the remote desert region said that about 30 foreign contractors at the site have still not been accounted for, following the surprise Algerian assault on the hostage-takers on Thursday. However, it was impossible to confirm that figure independently. David Cameron told the House of Commons on Friday morning that &quot;quite significantly&quot; fewer than 30 British citizens were still at risk. The Guardian understands the actual total of those unaccounted for is believed to be around 10. &quot;We are still dealing with a fluid and dangerous situation where a part of the terrorist threat has been eliminated in one part of the site, but there still remains a threat in another part,&quot; the prime minister said. Radio France&apos;s correspondent in Algeria reported that between seven and 10 attackers armed with explosives were still in the In Amenas plant&apos;s machine room. Algerian forces have freed about 100 of the 132 foreigners who were taken hostage in a gas facility in the Algerian desert, a security source told Reuters. The fate of the others - whether they remained captive or had been killed - remained unclear, he said, as the situation at the plant was &quot;changing rapidly&quot;. Two unnamed British men who were said to have been in the compound during the siege gave interviews on Algerian television about their experience. &quot;I think they did a fantastic job,&quot; one man said. &quot;I was very impressed with the Algerian army. &quot;It was a very exciting episode. I feel sorry for anybody who has been hurt but, other than that, I enjoyed it.&quot; A second man said: &quot;The gendarmes did a fantastic job. They kept us all nice and safe and fought off the bad guys. I never really felt in any danger, to be honest.&quot; The Algerian Press Service quoted a security official as saying: &quot;[The army] is still trying to achieve a &apos;peaceful outcome&apos; before neutralising the terrorist group that is holed up in the [facility] and freeing a group of hostages still being held.&quot; Japan said three of its nationals had escaped but 10 were still not accounted for. The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, who met the prime minister in London, said &quot;somewhere in the vicinity&quot; of seven or eight Americans had been taken hostage. The Norwegian government said one of its citizens escaped from the gas complex overnight and was recovering in hospital, but that it did not know the fate of eight others. A plane carrying a UK foreign office rapid deployment team landed in the desert outpost of Hassi Messaoud this afternoon, and was waiting for Algerian clearance to fly the remaining 300 miles south-east to In Amenas, on the border with Libya. The foreign office said that BP, a partner in the gas field, had taken the lead in organising the evacuation of rescued and escaped British workers but that the government team was there as a contingency to offer support. In the team there were also officials (believed to be from the intelligence agencies) to debrief hostages before they returned to the UK. A US plane has meanwhile flown to the region to pick up freed American hostages, and a US drone was reported to be flying over the gas field. The Algerian government claimed to have killed 18 of the &quot;Signers in Blood&quot; militant group, and reports from the area said the surviving guerillas had been driven out of the gas field&apos;s living quarters, where they had taken hundreds of hostages, and into the gas plant itself. The pumps have been turned off to avert a catastrophic explosion. After sharp criticism from Japan for launching a military assault on the hostage-takers, and from the UK for not informing London before launching the operation, the Algerian authorities defended their actions, saying the militants were attempting to flee the scene with the hostages, who were believed to be in imminent jeopardy. The government in Algiers issued a statement saying: &quot;This operation saved hundreds of hostages lives and averted a disaster at the gas installations.&quot; However, the Mauritanian news agency ANI, which has stayed in contact with the militant group throughout the siege, quoted a source in its ranks as saying they had not intended to leave the gas field but were moving a group of hostages from one part of the complex to another when Algerian army helicopter gunships opened fire on the vehicles ferrying the hostages and their captors. The ANI also quoted the militants threatening more attacks on oil and gas installations in Algeria. A spokesman called on Algerians to &quot;keep away from the installations of foreign companies, because we will suddenly attack where no one would expect it&quot;. France, which is dependent on the co-operation of Algeria for the smooth running of its Mali operation, namely in terms of securing its border and opening its airspace, was positive in its comments on the Algerian assault on the facility. The French interior minister Manual Valls said he &quot;cautioned prudence against criticism&quot; of the Algerian operation and recognised Algeria&apos;s fight against terrorism alongside France. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said he had every confidence in the Algerian authorities to handle the situation, which he referred to as &quot;unfolding in dramatic conditions&quot;. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, cut short a three-nation visit to south-east Asia to return to Tokyo to oversee Japan&apos;s response to the crisis. Abe, who was due to make a foreign policy speech in Indonesia on Friday evening, was expected to return to the Japanese capital early on Saturday. There was irritation, bordering on anger, that the Algerian government had not notified Japan of the rescue attempt. Tokyo was told of the military operation by Britain&apos;s ambassador to Algeria, local reports said. Abe told reporters he had asked his Algerian counterpart, Abdelmalek Sellal, in a phone call to refrain from any moves that could threaten the safety of the hostages. Japan&apos;s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, described the rescue attempt as regrettable, amid unconfirmed reports that two Japanese nationals were among those who died during the assault. The Japanese services contractor operating at the Algerian gas field, JGC, said that of the 61 non-Japanese it employed at the facility, 10 had been accounted for. JGC&apos;s president and other company executives were due to leave for Algeria on Friday."}, {"sentences": ["Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, cut short a three-nation visit to south-east Asia to return to Tokyo to oversee Japan&apos;s response to the crisis.", "Tokyo was told of the military operation by Britain&apos;s ambassador to Algeria, local reports said."], "tags": ["Algerian hostage crisis", "Algeria", "World news", "US news", "David Cameron", "Politics", "UK news", "France", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-18T23:25:00Z", "title": "Algerian hostage crisis: last group of jihadists hold out in gas plant", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/18/algerian-hostage-crisis-jihaists", "article": "A small group of jihadists have barricaded themselves into a corner of the In Amenas natural gas plant in eastern Algeria, where they are surrounded by government forces after a fierce battle that reportedly left 30 hostages dead and a similar number still unaccounted for.

But it was unclear how many hostages they still had with them.

British sources said it was a relief that a line of communication appeared to have been opened between the hostage takers and the Algerian government. The surviving hostages described scenes of turmoil and terror. Some said a number of foreign contractors had been killed by the jihadists. An Algerian worker from the city of Ouargla who escaped when the army stormed the camp said: &quot;There were so many deaths. I was shocked. I can&apos;t say the exact number. Foreign hostages died, Algerian hostages died and there were deaths among the terrorists.&quot; Alexandre Berceaux, an employee of a French catering firm, told Europe 1 radio he had survived by staying in his room, away from other foreigners, hidden behind a barricade of wooden planks. Algerian workers kept him alive by bringing him food and water, and they eventually brought Algerian soldiers to his hideout. &quot;I was completely isolated ... I was afraid. I could see myself already ending up in a wooden box,&quot; Berceaux said in an interview from an Algerian military base.

Some British survivors of the ordeal were instead being flown out of the region through Hassi Messaoud. The Foreign Office said BP, a partner in the gas field, had taken the lead in organising the evacuation of rescued and escaped British workers but the government team was there as a contingency to offer support. In the team there were also officials, believed to be from the intelligence agencies, to debrief hostages before they returned to the UK.

The Algerian government claimed to have killed 18 of the Signers in Blood militant group, and reports from the area said the surviving guerillas had been driven out of the gas field&apos;s living quarters, where they had taken hundreds of hostages, and into the gas plant itself. The pumps have been turned off to avert an explosion. After sharp criticism from Japan for launching a military assault on the hostage-takers, and from the UK for not informing London before launching the operation, the Algerian authorities defended their actions, saying the militants were attempting to flee the scene with the hostages, who were believed to be in imminent jeopardy. The government in Algiers issued a statement saying: &quot;This operation saved hundreds of hostages&apos; lives and averted a disaster at the gas installations.&quot; However, the Mauritanian news agency ANI, which has stayed in contact with the militant group throughout the siege, quoted a source in its ranks as saying they had not intended to leave the gas field but were moving a group of hostages from one part of the complex to another when Algerian army helicopter gunships opened fire on the its vehicles ferrying the hostages and their captors. ANI said the militants were threatening more attacks on oil and gas installations in Algeria. A spokesman for the group called on Algerians to &quot;keep away from the installations of foreign companies, because we will suddenly attack where no one would expect it&quot;. France, which is dependent on the co-operation of Algeria for the smooth running of its operation against Islamists in Mali, was positive in its comments on the Algerian action. The French interior minister, Manuel Valls, said he &quot;cautioned prudence against criticism&quot; of the Algerian operation and recognised Algeria&apos;s fight against terrorism alongside France. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said he had every confidence in the Algerian authorities to handle the situation, which he referred to as &quot;unfolding in dramatic conditions&quot;. Cameron said he would not hide his disappointment at the lack of Algerian consultation, but No 10 sources said the Algerians looked to have faced a well-organised terrorist assault that was probably planned before the French invasion of Mali. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, cut short a three-nation visit to south-east Asia to return to Tokyo to oversee Japan&apos;s response to the crisis. Abe, who was due to make a foreign policy speech in Indonesia on Friday evening , was expected to return to the Japanese capital early on Saturday. There was irritation, bordering on anger, that the Algerian government had not notified Japan of the rescue attempt. Tokyo was told of the military operation by Britain&apos;s ambassador to Algeria, local reports said. Abe told reporters he had asked the Algerian prime minister in a phone call to refrain from any moves that could threaten the safety of the hostages. Japan&apos;s main government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, described the rescue attempt as regrettable, amid unconfirmed reports that two Japanese nationals were among those who died during the assault.The Japanese services contractor operating at the Algerian gas field, JGC, said that of the 61 non-Japanese it employed at the facility, 10 had been accounted for.

Next month sees the start of the year of the snake, which is, he said &quot;a symbol of business prosperity&quot;. The stock and currency markets responded better than perhaps even Abe could have hoped. The Nikkei average has risen dramatically, while the yen is finally ceding ground to the US dollar, bringing relief to Japan&apos;s embattled exporters. On Friday, the dollar rose to its highest level against the yen for two-and-a-half years. Voters in last month&apos;s general election were receptive to Abe&apos;s focus on growth in the world&apos;s third-largest economy, even if it meant setting aside measures to tackle public debt, now more than 230% of its GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund. While &quot;Abenomics&quot; marks a departure from the previous government&apos;s priorities of debt reduction and tax increases to fund welfare spending, Abe&apos;s approach has a familiar ring. It marks a return to old-style spending on public works, a time-honoured Liberal Democratic party [LDP] policy pilloried in the past for funding the construction of cavernous community centres in rural villages and infamous &quot;roads to nowhere&quot;. Abe has promised to put an end to such waste, and instead wants to focus investment on three things: the region ravaged by the March 2011 tsunami; making repairs to ageing infrastructure, highlighted by last month&apos;s fatal tunnel collapse near Tokyo; and quake-proofing schools and hospitals. This month, his cabinet agreed on a stimulus package that includes \u00a510.3 trillion (\u00a370bn) in central government funds. The aim is to add about 2 percentage points to the country&apos;s real growth rate, and create more than 600,000 jobs. Business leaders welcomed the stimulus package. &quot;It was well-timed, as wide-ranging measures were taken with a sense of speed,&quot; said Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of the Japanese Business Federation. Abe has made it clear that he expects government action to be complemented by a more aggressive monetary policy on the part of the Bank of Japan, including raising the country&apos;s inflation target to 2% from 1%. The government and the central bank are expected to issue a joint statement early this week that will largely incorporate Abe&apos;s demands. He will use his power of appointment to ensure that the next Bank of Japan chief, who replaces the current governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, in April, shares his views on easing. &quot;We will choose someone who appreciates my basic policies to beat deflation,&quot; he said. There is a real prospect that the stimulus package announced last week \u2013 the biggest Japan has approved since the Lehman Brothers shock \u2013 will have an immediate impact. That could earn the LDP enough support to secure victory in key upper-house elections due in July, according to Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. &quot;It&apos;s striking how focused they have been on the economy \u2013 they&apos;ve been remarkably on-message and promised not to be diverted by other issues,&quot; he says. &quot;But it could turn out to be the same old story, with money going to familiar vested interests, particularly in the countryside. It&apos;s important to keep an eye on where the cash goes.&quot; Robert Dujarric, director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo, believes Abe&apos;s plan to pull Japan out of two decades of stagnation and deflation &quot;could work up to a point&quot;. &quot;What&apos;s missing in his proposals are microeconomic reforms: to deal with structural problems that would make it easier for women to contribute to the economy and for families to have children,&quot; he says. &quot;Abe comes from a wing of the LDP that really hasn&apos;t paid any attention to these issues. On top of that, his social conservatism is obvious: he has little interest in modernising policies towards women and families.&quot; Polls show that consumers are sceptical about Abe&apos;s ability to turn the economy around. A weaker yen will help exporters, but the price of imports on which Japan is heavily reliant, especially in food and energy, will hit households if incomes fail to keep up with inflation. While doubts remain over job security and wages continue to stagnate \u2013 they have failed to rise for nine of the past 12 months \u2013 consumers are unlikely to embark on a spending spree. &quot;It will take a lot to unleash consumers,&quot; Dujarric says. &quot;After 20 or more years of stagnation or low growth, it will take a lot to convince them that things have changed.&quot; Koichi Hamada, Abe&apos;s special economics adviser, concedes the government and central bank are about to perform a tricky balancing act. &quot;Economics is like medicine,&quot; he says. &quot;We don&apos;t know how much medicine is needed to cure a high fever, so you have to try, and then observe. But you have to do as much as you can to beat deflation.&quot; Even before taking office in December, Abe put pressure on the Bank of Japan to double its inflation target, warning that it could expect a political battle of wills unless it signed up to his vision of monetary easing. Other advanced economies will be closely following the Abe administration&apos;s fortunes. Like Japan, they are struggling with mounting public debt, and face rising welfare costs because of their ageing populations. In many ways, Japan is a test case for the rest of the developed world. In this, the year of the snake, Japan can only hope that it quickly sheds the skin of recession and stagnation."}, {"sentences": ["That number climbed further on Monday when a Japanese government source said the Algerian government had informed Tokyo that nine of its citizens had been killed, the biggest toll so far among foreigners at the plant."], "tags": ["Algerian hostage crisis", "Algeria", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "World news", "David Cameron"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-21T08:23:33Z", "title": "Algerian hostage toll rises with reports of Japanese deaths", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/21/algerian-hostage-toll-rises-81", "article": "The death toll from the four-day siege at an Algerian gas plant deep in the Sahara has risen to at least 81, with nine Japanese nationals also reported killed in an attack claimed by a veteran Islamist fighter on behalf of al-Qaida. The Algerian prime minister, Abdelmalek Sellal, is expected to give details at a news conference on Monday about one of the worst international hostage crises in decades, which left British, American, French, Japanese, Norwegian and Romanian workers dead or missing. A security source said on Sunday that Algerian troops had found the bodies of 25 hostages, raising the total number of hostages killed to 48 and the total number of deaths to at least 80. He said six militants were captured alive and troops were searching for others. That number climbed further on Monday when a Japanese government source said the Algerian government had informed Tokyo that nine of its citizens had been killed, the biggest toll so far among foreigners at the plant. Veteran Islamist fighter Mokhtar Belmokhtar claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of al-Qaida. &quot;We in al-Qaida announce this blessed operation,&quot; he said in a video, according to Sahara Media, a regional website. He said about 40 attackers participated in the raid, roughly matching the government&apos;s figures for fighters killed and captured. The fighters came out of the desert and seized the facility on Wednesday, capturing a plant that produces 10% of Algeria&apos;s natural gas exports and residential barracks nearby. They demanded an end to French air strikes against Islamist fighters in neighbouring Mali that had begun five days earlier. However, US and European officials doubt such a complex raid could have been organised quickly enough to have been conceived as a direct response to the French military intervention. David Cameron has warned that the fight against terrorism in north Africa could last for decades as he confirmed that six Britons and a British resident were believed to have died. The prime minister said the seizure of the In Amenas gas facility by a group of international jihadists was a stark reminder of the threat from terrorism the world over. He pledged a global response to what he described as a global threat. &quot;It will require a response that is about years, even decades, rather than months,&quot; Cameron said. &quot;Tragically, we now know that three British nationals have been killed, and a further three are believed to be dead. And a further British resident is also dead.&quot; He said the &quot;whole country&quot; would join him in sending condolences to the victims&apos; families. Cameron was speaking hours before the first of the British victims was identified on Sunday night as Paul Thomas Morgan, 46. In a statement issued by the Foreign Office, his family described him as a &quot;true gentleman&quot; who &quot;loved life and lived it to the full&quot; and &quot;died doing the job he loved&quot;. Morgan was reported to have been a veteran of the 1991 Gulf war and former French Foreign Legionnaire working as a liaison between workers and local security staff. Originally from Liverpool but living in Spain, he was said to have been in a bus going to the airport to return home following a one-month stint when the attack took place. The prime minister&apos;s statement is a recognition that the Arab spring has irrevocably changed the dynamics of the wider region, ushering in new democratic possibilities but also dangers from unpredictable, ruthless and well-organised extremist groups. Asked if the current al-Qaida threat to north Africa was comparable to the threat in Afghanistan a decade ago, Cameron replied: &quot;It is different in scale but there are similarities.&quot; He added: &quot;What we face is an extremist Islamist violent al-Qaida-linked terrorist group \u2013 just as we have to deal with that in Pakistan and Afghanistan.&quot; A further 22 Britons involved in the crisis at the In Amenas gas facility have returned to the UK, the Foreign Office said. The Algerian authorities said they had captured alive six members of the militant group during a search of the complex. Amid confusion about what precisely happened on Saturday, Algerian forces searching the refinery for explosives on Sunday found dozens more bodies, many so badly disfigured it was unclear whether they were hostages or militants, a security official said. Speaking on Sunday, Alan Wright, who survived the attack, described how he hid in an office after the jihadists stormed the compound last Wednesday. Wright, 37, a BP employee, said he eventually joined Algerian colleagues who fled by cutting their way out through a fence. &quot;If you have been captured, there&apos;s pretty much no escape and it is going to take a miracle to get you out,&quot; he told Sky News. He said the expatriates were surprisingly calm as word of the attack spread with everyone &quot;going into safe mode&quot;. The most chilling moment came when one of the hostage-takers walked past their building and said good morning in a friendly Arabic voice, trying to trick the foreigners out, he said. &quot;That was the first moment when we thought we are in big trouble here,&quot; Wright said. Speaking on the BBC&apos;s Andrew Marr Show, William Hague, the foreign secretary, said it was &quot;quite likely&quot; some of the Britons were executed by the hostage-takers, who identified themselves as the Signers in Blood \u2013 a splinter group of al-Qaida in the Islamic Mahgreb (AQIM). Communications minister Mohamed Said admitted the final death toll &quot;strongly risked being revised to a higher figure&quot;. Earlier, the Algerian authorities had said 107 foreign hostages and 685 Algerian nationals were freed. Among those reportedly shot dead was Abdul Rahman al-Nigeri, a terrorist from Niger, who is thought to have led the jihadist group that attacked the desert plant, initially ambushing a convoy of buses leaving with expats for the airport. The attackers came from six different countries, Said said. At least eight Algerian hostages died, together with nine Japanese nationals and one from France. One American was confirmed dead. Statoil, the Norwegian company that runs the plant alongside Britain&apos;s BP and Algeria&apos;s state oil company, said five Norwegian staff were missing. France&apos;s foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, also expressed solidarity with Algeria, which has battled a major Islamist insurgency since the 1990s. He said: &quot;Faced with terrorism, we have to be unwavering. These are killers, they pillage, they rape, they sack.&quot; The situation was dreadful, he said, adding: &quot;The Algerians know at what point terrorism is an absolute evil.&quot; Fabius rejected suggestions that he was being soft on Algeria because France needed \u2013 and had been given \u2013 permission by Algiers to overfly its territory during France&apos;s military intervention in neighbouring Mali. President Barack Obama said the US would ask Algeria for a full explanation of what happened, but said: &quot;The blame for this tragedy rests with the terrorists.&quot; Cameron will chair a meeting on Monday of the government&apos;s crisis response committee, Cobra, to discuss Algeria, and will make a statement on the attack in the Commons. The National Security Council is meeting on Tuesday to discuss the threat posed by AQIM. &quot;We have already been looking a lot at the threat posed by AQIM, but more work will need to be done,&quot; said a source."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo is considering stationing a fleet of fighter jets closer to the islands.", "But Huang Dahui, director of the centre for East Asian studies at Renmin University in Beijing, argued Abe had already toughened Tokyo&apos;s stance."], "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "China", "Japan", "Hillary Clinton", "US foreign policy", "US news", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-21T18:00:21Z", "title": "China rebukes US over 'ignorant' comments on island dispute with Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/21/china-japan-senkaku-islands-hillary-clinton", "article": "China has criticised comments made by Hillary Clinton about its increasingly complex and fractious dispute with Japan over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. Tensions over the island chain \u2013 known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China \u2013 have escalated since Japan bought the islands from private owners. Chinese ships returned to waters around the disputed islands on Monday, the Japanese coastguard said, for the 24th time since the row broke out. Japan&apos;s defence minister has refused to rule out the use of warning shots to deter Chinese aircraft from flying nearby, a move that would raise the stakes. This month China scrambled fighter jets to tail Japanese fighters that were shadowing a Chinese surveillance plane. The row is shaded by broader concerns: neighbours are anxious about an increasingly powerful China, while China fears the US is seeking to contain it. Beijing hit out at Washington after Clinton said that while the US did not take a position on the sovereignty of the chain, it opposed &quot;any unilateral actions that would seek to undermine Japanese administration&quot;. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a briefing on Monday that the outgoing US secretary of state&apos;s comments were &quot;ignorant of facts and indiscriminate of rights and wrongs&quot;, echoing a statement issued the previous day. He said the US \u2013 which controlled the islands from 1945 to 1972 before returning them to Japan \u2013 had &quot;undeniable historical responsibility&quot; in the dispute. Taiwan also claims sovereignty over the chain. Professor Huang Jing, an expert on regional security at the National University of Singapore, said US credibility in the Asia-Pacific region was at stake and Washington needed to show leadership by convincing both sides to negotiate. &quot;In public it&apos;s China versus the US. In private I think it&apos;s more difficult to convince not China, but Japan. There&apos;s too much at stake for the Japanese leadership,&quot; he said. &quot;I think there&apos;s still a fine line neither side is trying to cross,&quot; he added, pointing out that Japanese patrols had not forced Chinese vessels from the area, while China had kept military ships away. But he said: &quot;Political survival on both sides is more important than avoiding a skirmish or even war.&quot; The countries could take a step back as long as peace endured, but it would be far harder &quot;to catch up or patch up after something happens&quot;, Huang said. Shogo Suzuki, an expert on Sino-Japanese relations and visiting associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, said: &quot;All it takes is one hothead to pull the trigger and the whole thing spirals out of control. It&apos;s a dangerous situation and I think both sides have trapped themselves.&quot; The recent aerial standoff ended without incident, but the proximity of Chinese to Japanese fighters heightens the risk of an accident or pilot error leading to a wider conflict between Asia&apos;s two biggest economies. Tokyo is considering stationing a fleet of fighter jets closer to the islands. The defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, suggested that Japanese pilots could use tracer fire to warn Chinese fighters that their presence had been noted and that further action could follow. &quot;Every country has procedures for how to deal with a violation of its territory that continues after multiple cautionary measures,&quot; Onodera said. &quot;We have response measures ready that are consistent with global standards.&quot; Chinese officials said the use of tracer fire would not go unanswered, and accused Japan of deliberately raising tensions. Chinese media have stressed the need to improve military preparedness, though without making direct reference to the territorial row. Some observers see possible hints of a thaw, such as reports that Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has asked a coalition partner, Natsuo Yamaguchi of the New Komeito party, to bear a personal message to Chinese leaders in a visit that begins on Tuesday. Suzuki said Abe&apos;s hawkish credentials should protect him from charges of being weak on China, potentially allowing him to take the initiative. But Huang Dahui, director of the centre for East Asian studies at Renmin University in Beijing, argued Abe had already toughened Tokyo&apos;s stance. &quot;Japan has intensified the relationship with the US to suppress China, and has made efforts to rope in other South Asian countries which also have territorial problems with China, such as India, and other countries which have different values from China. They are trying to build a network against China,&quot; he said."}, {"sentences": ["Two Japanese scientists, Yuuki Watanabe and Akinori Takahashi at the National Institute of Polar Research in Tokyo, attached video cameras to the birds to learn more about how they hunted in the frigid Antarctic waters."], "tags": ["Animal behaviour", "Biology", "Zoology", "Science", "Antarctica", "World news", "Birds", "Wildlife", "Animals", "Conservation", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-21T19:59:00Z", "title": "Penguins are lethally efficient hunting machines, video reveals", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jan/21/penguins-lethally-efficient-hunting-machines-video", "article": "     Hungry penguins with tiny video cameras strapped to their backs have given scientists a rare glimpse of their spectacular and voracious feeding habits. Footage from Ad\u00e9lie penguins in waters off the coast of Antarctica showed the birds darting at krill, snapping up fish, and hunting down prey beneath sheets of floating ice in the L\u00fctzow-Holm bay area. In more than 14 hours of film captured from 11 birds, not once did a penguin miss its target. Some marine creatures had no time to hide, while others tried to flee and failed. One penguin swam into a dense swarm of krill and captured two of the shrimp-like creatures in one second. Another penguin encountered a school of what appeared to be Antarctic silver fish and caught 14 in 20 seconds. In many cases, the moment the penguin captures its prey is only clear when the video is slowed down. Two Japanese scientists, Yuuki Watanabe and Akinori Takahashi at the National Institute of Polar Research in Tokyo, attached video cameras to the birds to learn more about how they hunted in the frigid Antarctic waters. By attaching small accelerometers to the birds&apos; bodies and heads, the scientists gathered information on the penguins&apos; movements and the fast snapping action they used to capture prey as they swam. The film was recorded between December 2010 and early February 2011. Krill and fish called bald notothens (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) made up 96% of the food the penguins caught. &quot;The foraging behaviour of Ad\u00e9lie penguins is remarkably fast and efficient,&quot; the scientists write in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Some of the footage showed penguins making shallow dives of less than 30 metres that did not involve hunting, but in others they embarked on successful foraging trips. Penguins often swam up towards krill, and then darted down as they struck. Some krill tried to escape, but were too slow. L\u00fctzow-Holm Bay, where the penguins live, has surface ice the birds hunt beneath. On several occasions they spied bald notothens, which grow to around a foot long, and either took them before the fish had time to react, or chased them down. &quot;Escape behaviour of the fish was not evident in most cases, suggesting an excellent stealth approach by penguins,&quot; the scientists write. &quot;However, in two cases, they chased a P borchgrevinki toward the underside of the sea ice and caught it there, as if they used the ice surface as a barrier,&quot; they add. The insight into penguin foraging is vital for scientists hoping to understand the ecology of the birds in the wild. The feeding behaviour of the penguins determines how much energy they spend and gain on hunts, and how fit the animals are."}, {"sentences": ["The chair of Ucas, the universities admissions body, Prof Steve Smith, told a British Council conference in Tokyo last week that following the introduction of higher fees and the unleashing of a real market in higher education, &quot;there is the risk of market failure for institutions&quot;."], "tags": ["University funding", "University administration", "Higher education", "Education"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-21T20:00:01Z", "title": "Could a university be the next HMV?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jan/21/universities-brankruptcy-market-forces-cutbacks", "article": "For many years the idea of a university going bankrupt has seemed impossible. But senior academics are warning that some universities could easily go the way of HMV or Jessops \u2013 and leave a huge dent in the image of British higher education. Data on the number of new students accepted in universities for the 2012-13 academic year, released by Ucas on Friday, revealed that a large number of institutions suffered a drop in numbers compared with the previous year. But some modern universities took a disproportionate beating. Student numbers at the beleaguered London Metropolitan University, which has undergone serious subject cutbacks, were down a huge 43%. They were down 20.4% at the University of East London, 18.4% at the University of Cumbria, 16.3% at the University of Central Lancashire, 16% at Liverpool Hope University and 15.6% at the University of Lincoln. The chair of Ucas, the universities admissions body, Prof Steve Smith, told a British Council conference in Tokyo last week that following the introduction of higher fees and the unleashing of a real market in higher education, &quot;there is the risk of market failure for institutions&quot;. Smith, who is vice-chancellor of Exeter University, warned that if one or more universities did go bankrupt it could cause serious reputational damage to all British universities. Many university heads say they were planning for a potential fall in demand in the first year of higher fees \u2013 and most have a decent surplus to cushion the blow. However, many were also banking on a healthy bounce back in the coming academic year, which, the latest application figures suggest, is not going to come. Senior academics warn that universities which suffer a substantial decline in student demand for two or three years could collapse. Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, says: &quot;Most institutions have lost some home students, but there is a big difference between a drop of 4-5% and 20%. It is those institutions that lose students in double figures for two years running that will get into trouble.&quot; Pam Tatlow, chief executive of modern universities&apos; group Million+, says that beleaguered institutions will definitely be looking to make cutbacks to save money. &quot;They will have to take a hard look at which courses are sustainable. You can&apos;t run a course unless there is demand for it \u2013 and it has to be viable for three years, not just one. This means there could be less rather than more choice for students in the future.&quot; Modern institutions that were especially reliant on mature students have taken more of a hit as numbers have dropped off with the new higher fees. This will be a difficult leak to plug, particularly with the economy showing no signs of imminent recovery. Prof Paul O&apos;Prey, vice-chancellor of Roehampton University, explains: &quot;Pupils in schools have people around to advise them when they are anxious about fees or employment, but if you&apos;re on your own, with a job or a mortgage, you may not have anyone advising you on why university would be a good thing.&quot; University chiefs are slamming the government for failing to explain the new \u00a39,000 fees regime properly to the public in general \u2013 and mature students in particular. O&apos;Prey says: &quot;The government&apos;s advertising campaign about the new fees system was targeted only at school-age applicants and it wasn&apos;t very effective. We did a YouGov poll of 1,000 school-age students in Clearing and 44% thought they had to pay their fees upfront. That is terrifying.&quot; London Metropolitan University is one of the institutions suffering most. The UK Border Agency&apos;s decision last August to remove the institution&apos;s right to take new international students is seen by many as a body blow that the already deeply troubled university will struggle to recover from. Last week&apos;s statistics show student numbers have nearly halved in a year. Malcolm Gillies, the university&apos;s vice-chancellor, says he has a strategy in place to deal with the challenges: &quot;The year 2012-13 is very tough for us. Like the rest of the sector, London Met is down on applications from last year. We have a nine-point action plan to secure the institution&apos;s future and to continue to deliver on our promise of affordable quality education for students.&quot; &quot;The board of governors are fully aware of all of their obligations, as a company, a charity, and an institution, and have no intention of closing their eyes to any of the issues confronting the sector, London Metropolitan University, the current challenge to international student recruitment, or the flat current state of the British economy.&quot; Michael Shattock, visiting professor of higher education at the Institute of Education, says: &quot;I think the funding council are doing their best to keep it afloat, but it will be in serious difficulties \u2013 as will some of the other ex-polys in London.&quot; He adds: &quot;These new institutions were set up as companies, which means that London Met can declare massive redundancies at the drop of a hat. But if the board of governors close their eyes to the trend towards insolvency they might find themselves liable for any debts.&quot; Experts agree that even if ministers wanted a failing university to close, politically it would be hugely controversial. Outside London many universities are the biggest or second biggest employer in their area, and often provide vital local access to students who might otherwise not enter higher education. But many believe the capital, which has 42 higher education institutions, may be a different case. David Palfreyman, bursar of New College Oxford and part of the management takeover team parachuted in to avert bankruptcy at University College Cardiff in 1987, says: &quot;One would have thought in London, where the market is so crowded, there would be more scope for losing an institution.&quot; He adds: &quot;We will get more and more students questioning the so-called graduate premium, which I&apos;m not sure exists for many. Lots will realise they could do apprenticeships instead. Once that momentum gathers, some institutions will surely be knocked out.&quot; But many others are frightened of such a future. O&apos;Prey counters: &quot;It&apos;s easy to say a university that gets into trouble should be allowed to fail, but the economic and social consequences of such an event would be extremely difficult for any community, even in London.&quot; One option that may be considered is the breaking up of a failing university, salvaging only its more competitive areas through a merger or takeover. And if that happens, private providers will almost certainly be waiting in the wings. Carl Lygo, chief executive of private provider BPP, says: &quot;The independent sector does have some interested parties who would probably cherry-pick the best parts of any failed institution. At the moment though the sector is going it alone to compete rather than acquire and merge. BPP remains interested and is watching developments closely.&quot; The Higher Education Funding Council for England might also approach other public institutions to broker a rescue merger. Green says: &quot;There is obviously scope for merger in big city conurbations with lots of institutions. There has been scope in London for many years, but you could also pick places like West Yorkshire and the Greater Manchester region. He adds: &quot;My view is this wouldn&apos;t be desirable. I think the idea that the country would benefit from half as many institutions has nothing to recommend it.&quot; Shattock, who has been involved in some high-profile institutional mergers, is also unenthusiastic. &quot;The costs of mergers are pretty horrendous,&quot; he says. Crucially, it is not even clear that the funding council \u2013 which no longer provides most of the money for teaching and has no explicit planning function \u2013 has sufficient power to intervene and force change to avoid a bankruptcy. Shattock says: &quot;Hefce doesn&apos;t have the money any more. They don&apos;t have the muscle to go to neighbouring universities and say if you take this place over we&apos;ll oil the wheels.

Taro Aso, the finance minister, said on Monday that the elderly should be allowed to &quot;hurry up and die&quot; to relieve pressure on the state to pay for their medical care. &quot;Heaven forbid if you are forced to live on when you want to die. I would wake up feeling increasingly bad knowing that [treatment] was all being paid for by the government,&quot; he said during a meeting of the national council on social security reforms. &quot;The problem won&apos;t be solved unless you let them hurry up and die.&quot; Aso&apos;s comments are likely to cause offence in Japan, where almost a quarter of the 128 million population is aged over 60. The proportion is forecast to rise to 40% over the next 50 years. The remarks are also an unwelcome distraction for the new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whose first period as Japan&apos;s leader ended with his resignation after just a year, in 2007, partly due to a string of gaffes by members of his cabinet. Rising welfare costs, particularly for the elderly, were behind a decision last year to double consumption [sales] tax to 10% over the next three years, a move Aso&apos;s Liberal Democratic party supported. The 72-year-old, who doubles as deputy prime minister, said he would refuse end-of-life care. &quot;I don&apos;t need that kind of care,&quot; he said in comments quoted by local media, adding that he had written a note instructing his family to deny him life-prolonging medical treatment. To compound the insult, he referred to elderly patients who are no longer able to feed themselves as &quot;tube people&quot;. The health and welfare ministry, he added, was &quot;well aware that it costs several tens of millions of yen&quot; a month to treat a single patient in the final stages of life. Cost aside, caring for the elderly is a major challenge for Japan&apos;s stretched social services. According to a report this week, the number of households receiving welfare, which include family members aged 65 or over, stood at more than 678,000, or about 40% of the total. The country is also tackling a rise in the number of people who die alone, most of whom are elderly. In 2010, 4.6 million elderly people lived alone, and the number who died at home soared 61% between 2003 and 2010, from 1,364 to 2,194, according to the bureau of social welfare and public health in Tokyo. The government is planning to reduce welfare expenditure in its next budget, due to go into force this April, with details of the cuts expected within days. Aso, who has a propensity for verbal blunders, later attempted to clarify his comments. He acknowledged his language had been &quot;inappropriate&quot; in a public forum and insisted he was talking only about his personal preference. &quot;I said what I personally believe, not what the end-of-life medical care system should be,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;It is important that you be able spend the final days of your life peacefully.&quot; It is not the first time Aso, one of Japan&apos;s wealthiest politicians, has questioned the state&apos;s duty towards its large elderly population. In 2008, while serving as prime minister, he described &quot;doddering&quot; pensioners as tax burdens who should take better care of their health. &quot;I see people aged 67 or 68 at class reunions who dodder around and are constantly going to the doctor,&quot; he said at a meeting of economists. &quot;Why should I have to pay for people who just eat and drink and make no effort? I walk every day and do other things, but I&apos;m paying more in taxes.&quot; He had already angered the country&apos;s doctors by telling them they lacked common sense, made a joke about Alzheimer&apos;s patients, and pronounced &quot;penniless young men&quot; unfit for marriage. In 2001, he said he wanted Japan to become the kind of successful country in which &quot;the richest Jews would want to live&quot;. He once likened an opposition party to the Nazis, praised Japan&apos;s colonial rule in Taiwan and, as foreign minister, told US diplomats they would never be trusted in Middle East peace negotiations because they have &quot;blue eyes and blond hair&quot;. While figures released on Monday showed a record 2.14 million Japanese were receiving welfare in October 2012, Aso has led a life of privilege few of his compatriots could hope to match. He is the grandson of Shigeru Yoshida, an influential postwar prime minister, and is married to the daughter of another former premier. While campaigning for the premiership in 2008, Aso refused to acknowledge the use of hundreds of allied prisoners of war by his family&apos;s coal mining business during the second world war.

But sometimes, there is a free lunch, in a vitally important sense. And it&apos;s now available to a lot of countries suffering from unemployment and, in some cases, recession. Adam Posen doesn&apos;t want to recognize that this is the case for Japan at present. Posen is president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which is probably Washington&apos;s most influential thinktank on international economics. Posen is not, though, an &quot;austerian&quot; economist: in the second half of the 1990s, he supported expansionary fiscal policy in Japan; more recently, as a member of the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee from 2009-2012, he supported expansionary monetary policy, including quantitative easing and very low interest rates. So it is worth looking at his argument, because it helps us understand how mainstream economists can sometimes be an obstacle to economic recovery, as well as to social goals, such as reducing unemployment and poverty. The Japanese government of Shinzo Abe recently announced a large stimulus program. Its exact size is not clear, but the government is seeking to boost GDP growth by 2 percentage points. That would seem to be a good idea, since the Japanese economy is currently in recession, and the world economy, to which it exports, is not doing so well either. Japanese inflation is currently negative, which means that the government can create stimulus money without having to worry about increased inflation.  In fact, deflation is the much greater concern, and the government wants the central bank to target a 2% inflation rate. (Deflation tends to discourage consumption, because purchases will be cheaper in the future. It also discourages investment, because investors are looking at shaky demand in the future \u2013 especially with an economy already in recession.) This is what I mean by a free lunch. In fact, it&apos;s a free lunch and a five-course dinner, plus dessert. It costs the central bank nothing to create this spending money, and any resulting increase in inflation actually helps get the Japanese economy out of its slump. It also means that the government doesn&apos;t have to add anything to its net debt \u2013 so, there is no increase to the public debt burden for the future. But Posen argues that it&apos;s an idea whose time has passed. Here is the crux of his argument:  &quot;Stuffing bank balance sheets with JGBs [Japanese government bonds] has constrained commercial lending by those banks \u2013 even during the recovery of 2003-08 \u2013 which harmed small and new business development. The persistently low returns on Japanese savings have further squandered investment opportunities, thereby creating a negative feedback loop with deflation and older savers&apos; risk aversion. &quot;The absence of external pressure has fed the combined long-term appreciation of the yen and stagnation of Japanese stock market returns, both severely distorting the economy. Needed public investment and funds for adequate healthcare and disaster recovery have been crowded out by debt payments \u2026&quot;  I find it difficult to believe that Japanese government debt payments are crowding out public spending, much less private investment. Net interest payments on Japan&apos;s public debt are less than 1% of its GDP. (This is also true for the US, incidentally, for those who have debt phobia here.) This is quite small. I am also skeptical about the other problems that he attributes to Japan&apos;s debt accumulation, such as the long-term appreciation of the yen and low stock market returns. These issues have multiple causes, as does the amount of commercial lending by banks. Commercial lending is more likely to be constrained by a weak economy than by government spending. In any case, it&apos;s difficult to see how a new stimulus program, financed by money creation, would worsen any of these problems \u2013 even if we were to accept Posen&apos;s premise of potential risk in quantitative easing measures \u2013 since it doesn&apos;t add to the country&apos;s net debt burden or reduce banks&apos; lending capacity. And a big chunk of the stimulus is targeted toward &quot;needed public investment&quot; and disaster reconstruction \u2013 the things Posen worries would be crowded out by public debt.  From a public interest perspective, the only worries about a stimulus program like Abe&apos;s would be if the money were poorly spent (for example, on environmentally destructive, rather than constructive activities), and to a much lesser extent, if the government were to finance stimulus by borrowing from the public, rather than the central bank (that is, the free lunch). Posen also argues that the stimulus won&apos;t fix Japan&apos;s &quot;real problem&quot;, which is &quot;a return to deflation and an overvalued currency&quot;. But it&apos;s more likely to reduce these problems than to make them worse. Indeed, press reports have noted:  &quot;The expectation of aggressive monetary easing and a much bolder BOJ [Bank of Japan] since Abe, who was prime minister in 2006-2007, returned to power has sparked a bull run in Japanese markets. &quot;Tokyo&apos;s benchmark stock index, the Nikkei 225, has soared more than 20% since mid-November, while the yen has fallen roughly 11% in anticipation of aggressive monetary easing. The Nikkei hit a fresh 23-month high on Friday following the release of the stimulus package.&quot;  I would also take issue with a certain &quot;false equivalence&quot; regarding the alleged dangers of fiscal stimulus (in this case, involving an economy with actual deflation) versus austerity, at a time when Japan and Europe are in recession, and much of the global economy is weak and facing downside risks. Posen writes:  &quot;Persistent fiscal policies that fail to adapt to changing cyclical conditions result in long-term damage. This holds true whether a government errs on the side of excessive austerity, as in Europe of late, or on the side of unjustified indiscipline, as in Japan since its recovery a decade ago \u2026 &quot;Italy, the UK and the US should fear the structural damage of following Japan&apos;s example if fiscal expansion is not timed to end with recovery.&quot;  But the US recovery is too weak: at the current pace, it will take more than a decade to get back to full employment. This is unacceptable. The world economy is projected to grow by 3.6% this year, as compared to its growth by 5.1% in 2010. Japan&apos;s example should be followed anywhere that has the economic capacity to do so, including the US and the eurozone."}, {"sentences": ["The central bank said it would lend the Tokyo government unlimited amounts of yen when the scheme started in 2014 in the expectation it would boost the economy by redirecting bank lending to the private sector, echoing the Bank of England&apos;s \u00a3375bn quantitative easing."], "tags": ["Global economy", "Business", "Economics", "Japan", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-22T18:56:08Z", "title": "Bank of Japan bows to pressure with 'epoch-making' financial stimulus", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/22/bank-japan-financial-stimulus", "article": "The Bank of Japan has bowed to pressure from the new government with a plan for a bigger-than-expected financial stimulus aimed at ending two &quot;lost&quot; decades of economic stagnation.

The scheme is also designed to boost inflation to 2%, after a long period of falling prices, to force down the value of the yen, making Japanese exports cheaper and relieving the pressure on manufacturing giants such as Toyota and Hitachi. The move follows weeks of speculation over the Bank of Japan&apos;s reaction to calls from the newly elected Liberal government for a large stimulus to end two decades of almost zero growth \u2013 a prominent feature of the party&apos;s election campaign. In a joint statement with the government, the central bank promised to reach the new annual inflation goal of 2% &quot;at the earliest possible time,&quot; drawing praise from the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who described the policy as &quot;epoch making&quot;. Abe believes a higher inflation target will allow the central bank more freedom to flood the financial system with a bigger injection of electronic funds. The prime minister also plans to raise government spending on infrastructure and other government projects to boost employment and wages, which have also remained static in recent years. Some economists have warned against such a spending spree when the annual deficit is already exceeding 10% of GDP and the total debt pile is the largest in the developed world, at almost 250% of GDP. The decision to devise policies that depress the country&apos;s currency have also set off alarm bells that a currency war is around the corner. The head of the German central bank, Jens Weidmann, said on Tuesday that he was concerned the Bank of Japan was about to lead the world into a ruinous round of competitive devaluations. Abe has promised to tackle domestic issues that are stalling growth, in particular the web of subsidies and regulations that discourage businesses from making new investments. But several of his predecessors had made the same pledges only to be beaten back by vociferous lobby groups. Masaaki Shirakawa, the governor of the central bank, emphasised that the government had do its part to boost the world&apos;s third-largest economy, which has suffered four recessions since 2000. He commented: &quot;Various government measures to boost Japan&apos;s competitiveness and growth potential are equally important.&quot; Japanese economists are concerned that without some deregulation of the service sector, Japan will succumb to the challenges from South Korea and China for technological markets that it previously dominated. Under the central bank&apos;s current programme it has pledged to supply 101\u00a0trillion yen by the end of 2013 by buying assets and issuing loans. From 2014 it will switch to an open-ended commitment to buy assets, a move many analysts thought would only come later. Joseph Capurso, a currency strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, in Sydney, said: &quot;They&apos;ve gone further than I thought by introducing the open-ended plan. &quot;What surprises me is they won&apos;t start until 2014.

Each year the consultancy firm PwC conducts a survey of the great and good of the business world. The message this year is that the improvement in sentiment seen in 2011 and 2012 has stalled. As far as business confidence is concerned there is a global double-dip recession. It&apos;s not hard to see why. Everywhere executives look there are problems: real or prospective. In Europe, it is the impact of austerity programmes on growth and the frightening levels of joblessness. In India, it is inflation. In the United States, it is the fiscal cliff. In Japan, it is the prospect of a global currency war triggered by Tokyo&apos;s attempts to drive down the value of the yen. David Cameron has done his bit to add to the uncertain mood. Announcing that Britain will have an in-out referendum on membership of the European Union in 2017 ensures four years in which foreign companies will be hesitant about investing in Britain. Unsurprisingly perhaps, the PwC report shows that expectations about strong growth in 2013 are highest in the emerging world and lowest in Europe and Japan, where recent performance has been weak. Dennis Nally, chairman of PwC International, said executives remained cautious about their short-term prospects and the outlook for the global economy. Far from planning for a robust global recovery, there is evidence that companies are hunkering down, concentrating on cutting costs and making themselves more efficient. This matters. Many businesses are cash rich after laying off staff, mothballing investment and keeping the lid on wages, but the PwC report suggests they are in no hurry to invest their accumulated reserves. This also comes as no surprise. Businesses will only invest if they perceive growing demand for their goods and services. But the dilemma for the CEOs gathered in Davos is that the policies they have championed in the past \u2013 fiscal austerity, weaker trade unions, aggressive cost cutting \u2013 have hammered consumer spending. In the past, spending could be supported by rising household debt, but the banks don&apos;t want to lend and consumers don&apos;t want to borrow. This is a recipe for continued economic torpor. Three things would help: fixing the banks, a reining back of austerity and a new social compact to ensure that productivity gains are once again shared by capital and labour."}, {"sentences": ["Click here to view video The Shibuya crossing in Tokyo is said to have roughly a million people crossing it every day \u2013 that&apos;s nearly 365m a year.", "Tokyo is also the world&apos;s biggest city by most standards \u2013 it&apos;s population is roughly equal to London and New York&apos;s combined."], "tags": ["Kumbh Mela", "Life and style", "Hajj", "Film", "Culture", "Religion", "World news", "India"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-23T15:15:01Z", "title": "What is the most trodden-upon place on earth?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/23/most-trodden-upon-place-on-earth", "article": "Where, on earth, have more people been than any other place?

Last year, two teams of scientists in the United States and the Netherlands submitted papers for publication in Science and Nature describing how they had engineered the H5N1 bird flu virus \u2013 which kills half of the people it infects but cannot naturally transmit from person to person \u2013 to spread more easily between mammals. The US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity said that the papers were too dangerous to publish in their original form and demanded that sections of the results be deleted to prevent the information falling into the wrong hands. That sparked a debate on how &quot;dual-use&quot; research should be handled: whether the results should be published in full to help public health officials prepare for future pandemics that might emerge \u2013 in this case if the bird flu virus mutated naturally \u2013 or whether some of the details should be kept secret in order to prevent them falling into the hands of bioterrorists. In January 2012, scientists agreed to a moratorium on research involving lab-created versions of the H5N1 flu virus while scientists, regulators and security experts worked out how best to conduct and publish the work. A year of discussions and considerations of safety protocols later, that moratorium has now come to an end. In a letter published on Thursday in Nature, the lead researchers involved in working on the engineered flu virus said that the pause in research had been useful in that it provided time to communicate the public health benefits of the work and decide how to minimise the risks. The letter&apos;s signatories are Ron Fouchier of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, Adolfo Garc\u00eda-Sastre of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, and Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, Wisconsin, and the University of Tokyo, Japan. The three scientists, writing on behalf of 40 co-authors, said that the past year had seen the benefits of the work on H5N1 explained clearly in publications and meetings and that measures to mitigate the possible risks of the work had been detailed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and many individual countries have also produced safety guidelines for people conducting research on lab-modified H5N1 viruses. &quot;Thus, acknowledging that the aims of the voluntary moratorium have been met in some countries and are close to being met in others, we declare an end to the voluntary moratorium on avian-flu transmission studies,&quot; they write. Understanding how H5N1 might transmit to mammals was important, said the researchers, and properly conducted studies in this area were a public health responsibility. &quot;We want to resume H5N1 virus transmission studies because we believe this research is important to pandemic preparedness,&quot; said Kawaoka. &quot;Research to understand how avian virus is adapted to mammals will lead to better surveillance and vaccines \u2026 We know that in nature H5N1 viruses in birds are becoming more like viruses that infect mammals. Therefore, the greater risk is not doing research that could help us be better equipped to deal with a pandemic. We want the world to be better prepared than we currently are when an H5N1 virus poses a pandemic.&quot; He added that scientists understood the risks associated with their research and took &quot;every precaution to conduct H5N1 virus experiments safely.&quot; &quot;There is probably not a scientific issue in recent times that has not been so widely thrown out for public consultation as this one,&quot; said Wendy Barclay, an influenza virologist at Imperial College London and a signatory to the letter. &quot;The information learned from the two publications that finally made it into Nature and Science last year has been processed by the influenza community and has been hugely informative, not only for understanding the risks from H5N1 but also for illuminating how other subtypes of flu might jump species and even for assessing the zoonotic risks from other pathogens. &quot;The lifting of the moratorium will undoubtedly lead to more scientific revelations that will have direct consequence for human and animal health.&quot; Dr John McCauley, director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research in London, said that a meeting of journal editors, scientists and US and Dutch government officials in February 2012 concluded that research into the lab-created H5N1 viruses would allow for the creation of much better risk assessments of potential pandemic threats in nature. The idea of restricting who could access the research findings or publishing a redacted or cut-down version of the results was rejected at the meeting. At the time, WHO recommended an extension of the moratorium while the benefits of the research and the safety protocols around it were explained to the public. &quot;The laboratories have expanded on their containment and security systems used in the experiments and I think the value of the results has been recognised,&quot; said McCauley. &quot;Therefore, the WHO group&apos;s recommendations were satisfied.&quot; But in their letter in Nature, the researchers advised caution before restarting. American regulators, for example, are still in the final stages of checking and clarifying the safety and security procedures required for work on H5N1. &quot;Scientists should not restart their work in countries where, as yet, no decision has been reached on the conditions for H5N1 virus transmission research,&quot; they wrote. &quot;At this time, this includes the United States and US-funded research conducted in other countries.

She slipped into design through magazines, joining Femina in 1950 at dogsbody level, moving to Elle in 1952, and to the art magazine l&apos;Oeil as interiors editor in 1960. She also worked as an art director for the Prisunic department store chain. In 1958, she married Jacques Putman, a collector and critic with a deep knowledge of modernism and a wide circle of artistic acquaintance, and the couple provided Prisunic with cheap editions of prints by contemporary artists: &quot;beautiful for the price of ugly&quot; was the slogan. Andr\u00e9e became artistic director in 1971 of a new textile-based company, Cr\u00e9ateurs et Industriels, but it, and her marriage, failed a few years later, leaving her alone in a room even more deliberately ascetic than her girlhood cell, &quot;in total austerity, because I no longer knew what I liked&quot;. By the late 1970s, however, Putman had found what she liked, and began to proselytise for classic but then forgotten French modernist furniture of the 1930s; she rescued pieces from flea markets and sold them through her company, Ecart, founded in 1978. Purchasers asked her to create contexts for them \u2013 a room to surround a screen, say \u2013 and she was then commissioned by Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld, among others, to design shop interiors of modern luxury, quite different from traditional gilt or the kooky boutiques of the 60s. Modern luxury was also the brief from Ian Schrager for his Morgans hotel in Manhattan in the early 80s. Putman thought the faux-Versailles cliches of grand hotels vulgar \u2013 (&quot;too much Louis and too many flowers,&quot; she decreed) \u2013 and put together Morgans, which opened in 1984, on a strict budget and with firm discipline. You might call her look minimal, but minimalism was just another trend, and she was beyond that. Morgans was much imitated all over the world, although not by Putnam in her subsequent hotel designs, for the Hotel Le Lac, in Kawaguchi, Japan (1989); the Hotel Im Wasserturm, in Cologne, Germany (1990), and the Pershing Hall, Paris (2001). She provided interiors in 1985 for the office in Paris of the French minister of culture, with its half-moon desk, still in service and loved; in 1990 for Bordeaux&apos;s contemporary art museum; and in 1994 for a revamp of the cabin of Concorde. She also designed the sets for Peter Greenaway&apos;s 1996 film The Pillow Book. In 1997, she set up her own studio - where her daughter, Olivia, took over as art director in 2007. Besides more designs for shop interiors in Paris, New York and Tokyo, and a Hong Kong skyscraper that bears her name, Putman also worked on small domestic objects, including table ceramics, cutlery and jewellery: plain, with a twist of wit. In 2010, she was celebrated with an exhibition, Andr\u00e9e Putman, Ambassador of Style, at the H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris, curated by her daughter. Putman&apos;s bold personal style was based on her imperfections (&quot;Life is made of imperfections&quot;). Her strong features, awry smile and modern dancer&apos;s gestures were theoretically all wrong for the camera, but she photographed superbly, like sculpture; while her tailored, dramatic clothes \u2013 usually Parisian couture, often from designers she had discovered at the start of their careers \u2013 were simply the best, of the family of things that will never date. Her son, Cyrille, and Olivia survive her. \u2022 Andr\u00e9e Christine Aynard Putman, interior designer, born 23 December 1925; died 19 January 2013"}, {"sentences": ["Some northern communities have been saved by inward investment decisions, made as far away as Tokyo."], "tags": ["EU referendum and Brexit", "David Cameron", "Foreign policy", "European Union", "UK news", "Politics", "Conservatives"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-23T21:07:35Z", "title": "In-out EU referendum: Cameron's hokey-cokey | Editorial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/23/eu-referendum-david-cameron-editorial", "article": "The man who once warned his party against &quot;banging on about Europe&quot; yesterday put the EU at the heart of all political discussion for the next five years. But David Cameron did not turn up to Bloomberg to pledge an in-out referendum in the stripy, boatclub blazer associated with the Europhobes of John Major&apos;s day. Instead, he turned up dressed for business \u2013 and deployed all of his eloquence to make his case in a tone of measured pragmatism. There was a respectful nod to the historic achievement of drawing a line under Europe&apos;s war-torn past, and the PM went out of his way to avoid pull-up-the-drawbridge-at-Dover slogans, insisting that &quot;ours is not just an island story \u2013 it is also a continental story&quot;. He targeted fire precisely where the European project is weakest \u2013 in particular, its failure to create any sense of pan-national people power across borders. Who could disagree with the Cameron verdict that there is no European &quot;demos&quot; to speak of? And who would disagree, either, with his commonsensical argument that Europe is in crisis, and that within every crisis are the seeds of wider change. But dig down and this promising topsoil gives way to dust. After hailing &quot;the ideal of co-operation&quot;, Mr Cameron suggested fighting crime as a promising application of that ideal. Listening to him, one would not imagine that his government is moving to ditch 130 police and justice measures, including the European arrest warrant, not because of any real argument about how they operate, but in pursuance of a slogan about bringing powers home. And while no one would dispute the priority of restored prosperity, one might have hoped he would explain the link to a reformed EU. No prosperity plan Explicitly, however, he said next to nothing to explain how his new Europe would create recovery. Implicitly, talk of &quot;unnecessary rules and regulation&quot; suggested that cutting EU employment protections would somehow create jobs. There may be circumstances where there is something in that, but a great recession \u2013 marked not by cost pressures, but sluggish wages \u2013 isn&apos;t one. It is the approach familiar on the domestic front from the dismal Beecroft report, whose &quot;no-fault dismissals&quot; most workers would regard as a plan for Britain to sack its way out of the slump. Get-the-state-out-of-the-way economics always underlay some of the cant about sovereignty. Freeing up managers to &quot;get on and manage&quot; appears a self-evident solution to southern English Conservatives like Mr Cameron, but attitudes differ in parts of the country which faced a chronic dearth of industry before the present slump. Some northern communities have been saved by inward investment decisions, made as far away as Tokyo. For such communities, not to mention Scotland and Wales where devolved administrations voice different priorities, the worldwide perception of Britain as a plausible base from which to serve the single market matters more than any new freedom to hire or fire. The speech&apos;s real concern, however, was not economics but politics \u2013 the politics of a restive Tory backbench, an insurgent Ukip and a mostly Europhobic press. Each routinely claims to speak for Britain, and the country is undoubtedly cross about Europe just as it is cross about Westminster and much else besides. But when voters are asked about their priorities, Europe barely registers. Despite Mr Cameron&apos;s claim that &quot;public disillusionment with the EU is at an all time high&quot;, two recent polls have registered hostility receding. Ed Miliband needs to keep this in mind as he settles Labour&apos;s response. Referendums are hard to resist, as it is always easier to demand that the people be given their say than to ask awkward questions about what purpose is served when no clear proposition is on offer. But in the house yesterday, Ed Miliband displayed some of the steel that has occasionally flashed through in tough moments before. Even though Labour&apos;s briefing later nervously sought to retrieve wriggle room, the leader&apos;s first instinct was to come out against an in-out vote \u2013 a sign that he is now thinking not merely about winning the election, but about what Labour wants to do in power. Two years dominated by a plebiscite does not appeal. False promise Behind in the polls, the calculation for Mr Cameron is different. He urgently needs the brief boost he can now expect. Beyond that, he reasons that Europe is so desperate to keep Britain in that it will to come up with something tangible for him to sell. He should not underestimate the hostile fury he will draw the UK&apos;s way by gratuitously instigating a fresh crisis when the existing one is exhausting enough. Paris could prove much more relaxed about a UK exit than he presumes, and while Berlin will no doubt haggle over non-treaty changes, Britain is not going to get a blanket exemption from everything it doesn&apos;t like. Most likely Mr Cameron will be left securing cosmetic concessions. He then has to follow Harold Wilson in 1975, and claim these are something much more \u2013 or else actually start the march to the door. Either way, the promise of seeking a popular mandate for a radically reformed Europe disappears in the haze."}, {"sentences": ["Cardiff Castle will be the setting for their first Christmas show \u2013 an adaptation of the fairy stories written by former Python Terry Jones for his daughter \u2013 and the company will venture outside Wales with a residency in Tokyo, premiering a new play, The Opportunity of Efficiency, by Alan Harris in Japanese."], "tags": ["Theatre", "Wales", "UK news", "Stage", "Gruff Rhys", "Music", "Music festivals", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-24T08:00:04Z", "title": "National Theatre Wales to go gigging with Gruff Rhys", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jan/24/national-theatre-wales-gruff-rhys", "article": "They have staged Aeschylus in the Brecon Beacons, and transformed the whole of the town of Port Talbot into the scene of Christ&apos;s Passion. Now National Theatre Wales has announced its next step: a new work co-devised by the former frontman of the Super Furry Animals, Gruff Rhys. It takes as its subject the aristocratic, radical Italian publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli \u2013 famous for discovering and publishing, in the teeth of communist opposition, the manuscript of Dr Zhivago, for befriending Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and for being willing to take on Lampedusa&apos;s classic novel The Leopard. He died mysteriously when attempting to blow up an electricity pylon, as part of an ultra-left Italian political group, The work \u2013 somewhere between concept album, gig and play-with-songs \u2013 is co-devised by the playwright Tim Price, the author of The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning. The pair will collaborate with hip-hop producer Boom Bip and director Wils Wilson. According to National Theatre Wales&apos;s artistic director, John McGrath, the show, titled Praxis Makes Perfect, will open in May in a secret location in Cardiff, and then pop up &quot;at music festivals and music venues around the UK. We are known for doing site-specific shows; in this case the site is a music gig and there will be all the excitement of mixing that with theatre.&quot; Rhys was attracted to the idea of writing a biographical show \u2013 which will also have a life as an album \u2013 after reading Senior Service, a memoir of Feltrinelli by his son, Carlo. He said: &quot;A lot of the songs in the show are based around the titles he released as a publisher from the 1950s to 1970s. I suppose the ultimate goal of the show is to make people read more books.&quot; The creators hoped, he said, to shake up the notion of the gig &quot;which can be extremely predictable. Part of the feel of it is that at the beginning it will seem like a concert given by a synth duo \u2013 but then we will put the audience through a lot of unpredictable experiences.&quot; The company \u2013 which, like the National Theatre of Scotland, has no home building \u2013 will also take up residence on the island of Anglesey for the month of June, the highpoint of which will be a show by Hugh Hughes \u2013 the popular Anglesey comic character both resembling, and created by, Anglesey native Sh\u00f4n Dale-Jones. There will also be a &quot;DIY festival weekend,&quot; according to McGrath, in which all-comers can turn up and ply their art. Other highlights of the company&apos;s third season include a month&apos;s residency in a miners&apos; institute in the Rhondda village of Treorchy, with an autobiographical play by Rachel Tresize, who grew up there. Cardiff Castle will be the setting for their first Christmas show \u2013 an adaptation of the fairy stories written by former Python Terry Jones for his daughter \u2013 and the company will venture outside Wales with a residency in Tokyo, premiering a new play, The Opportunity of Efficiency, by Alan Harris in Japanese."}, {"sentences": ["Super Mario returnsNintendo&apos;s EAD Tokyo software development team, previously responsible for Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario 3D Land is working on a fresh Super Mario title."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Nintendo", "Wii U", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-24T17:25:00Z", "title": "Wii U: new Zelda and Mario games announced.

Once again the company&apos;s president Satoru Iwata stood in front of a white background looking friendly yet somehow also faintly Orwellian \u2013 and once again he brought us the latest news from the Nintendo mother brain.  This time, it was a range of new game announcements for the Wii U console. Here&apos;s the lowdown:Two new Zelda titles Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma revealed that two Zelda titles are venturing toward the console. One will be a re-make of the stylised Game Cube classic Wind Waker, featuring HD visuals \u2013 it&apos;s coming out in the autumn and will be playable on TV or GamePad display. More intriguing, though, is a totally new addition, promising to &quot;re-think the conventions of Zelda&quot;. It seems we can expect a more open game world and one that may support collaborative or competitive multiplayer in new ways. We may have to wait until 2014 for this one, though.  Super Mario returnsNintendo&apos;s EAD Tokyo software development team, previously responsible for Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario 3D Land is working on a fresh Super Mario title. Iwata referred to it as a &apos;3D Mario action game&apos;, so no more of that New Super Mario Bros stuff. It will be playable at E3. More Mario Kart!Naturally, the long-running karting series is bound for Wii U. There&apos;s no info at present, but it&apos;ll be interesting to see how the GamePad figures here. It&apos;ll be a steering wheel obviously, but what else? Will we slide our fingers across the screen to launch shells? Again, there will be playable code at E3. Yarn YoshiTakashi Tezuka, director of Yoshi&apos;s Island and Yoshi&apos;s Story, is supervising the first title to feature the loveable dinosaur as a lead character since 1998. It&apos;s being handled by the team behind beautiful Wii title Kirby&apos;s Epic Yarn, and similarly, it pitches the lead character into a cute handicraft world. Sounds adorable. Fire Emblem and Shin-Megami Tensei combine            This is one to get JRPG fanatics frothing at the mouth \u2013 a combination of the two classic role-playing series&apos;, developed by Nintendo and Atlus. Iwata also promised that the company is working on other similar creative collaborations and will be revealing more details soon.  Wii Party continuesThe popular party game collection will return this summer, featuring plenty of interesting GamePad interactivity. In the Nintendo Direct video, we see one mini-game that requires you to shake the pad to roll dice, and another that has two players competing in a teeny baseball sim on one GamePad screen. There&apos;s even a sort of Twister variation that gets a group of competitors to touch different buttons on an array of Wii Remotes and GamePads, entwining their limbs in the process. Saucy. New title from Monolith Soft            The creator of the hugely acclaimed RPG, Xenoblade Chronicles, is working on what looks to be another epic fantasy quest. It&apos;s being directed by Tetsuya Takahashi, a veteran of the Final Fantasy series before setting up Monolith. Check out the video for some gigantic monster battles. Virtual ConsoleNintendo&apos;s retro gaming service is coming to Wii U after a system update in the spring. It will allow users to download classic titles from the company&apos;s lengthy back catalogue. Iwata explained however that we won&apos;t immediately see all the titles currently available for Wii and DS. Instead, we&apos;ll get a selection of NES and SNES titles (at \u00a33.49 and \u00a35.49 each, respectively), &apos;newly developed&apos; for the Wii U \u2013 these will be playable on the GamePad display or on a TV, and will support Miiverse functionality. Other platforms including the Game Boy Advance will be supported later. Advance Wars! There was also a new trailer for Platinum Games&apos; intriguing action strategy title Wonderful 101 and a behind-the-scenes teaser for Bayonetta 2. Importantly, Iwata also conceded that there&apos;s a lack of major Wii U titles in the opening months of 2013; during the video he argues that Nintendo understands the importance of strong first-party games early in a console&apos;s lifecycle. He&apos;s right \u2013 after the initial flush of 20 launch titles and the excitement of discovering asymmetrical multiplayer gaming, there has been a lull, and given the excitement building over Microsoft and Sony&apos;s activities this year, that might not be smart. However, with all the favourites on the way, together with one or two fresh additions and some enhanced services (such as the ability to access Miiverse on your smartphone, and some new community functionality in Wii Fit U), there&apos;s hope gamers will over look this somewhat barren spell. It would be nice, though, to see Nintendo putting its vast development talent to a few completely fresh projects. Of course, we need Super Mario, Mario Kart and the rest, but this is a time of generational change, a time to explore uncharted areas. Iwata must have the faith to allow his teams to introduce some innovative new strands.  It is somewhat ironic that, while Zelda lovers are being kept waiting for a brand new adventure, it is Wind Waker that is being resurrected as a stop-gap. The GameCube struggled to maintain an audience against the might of PlayStation 2, which promised a new era of sleek, mature interactive entertainment via the likes of GTA III, Ico and Gran Turismo 4.

However, there are a number of groups \u2013 tribes, or &quot;kei&quot; in Japanese \u2013 that have managed to evolve while staying relatively true to their origins. Members of these tribes can number into the hundreds of thousands, though more commonly they reach a few thousand youngsters before disappearing entirely. Many kei can be traced back to the Harajuku district, at the centre of which is Takeshita Dori, a street that is to Tokyo what Carnaby Street was once to London (only with added dayglo cuteness), and this should be the first destination for any determined follower of fashion. Here are a selection of the tribes that you would have a hard time missing on any trip to the Japanese capital. The Rollers of Yoyogi Park     Photograph: Alamy    Before we begin, let&apos;s get one thing straight. These guys aren&apos;t rockabillies, even though they might look old enough to have witnessed Gene Vincent in his heyday. They prefer to be known as &quot;Roller-Zoku&quot; (the Roller Family), and they take the business of dancing to old rock&apos;n&apos;roll numbers very seriously indeed (on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, near the gates of Yoyogi Park, without fail). It is thought that the Roller-Zoku have been a part of the Yoyogi furniture since the early 1990s, when a rockabilly revival swept parts of Japan. With their receding hairlines bullied into thinning quiffs, they may not look particularly threatening, but woe betide anyone who tries to join their antiquated dance. Simply do as the massed crowds surrounding them do: watch agog, but from a safe distance. Dolly Kei            On the border of the Harajuku and Shibuya district, you&apos;ll find Grimoire, a fanciful clothing and accessories shop that sits at the centre of the Dolly Kei movement. Followers dress in what might be described as a Tokyo take on Ye Olde Europe, favouring velvets, silks and rich embroidery. Think Little Bo Peep meets Hans Christian Anderson on a set imagined by Hayao Miyazaki, and you might be somewhere close to the mindspace inhabited by the brothers and sisters Grimoire. Having surfaced in 2010, seemingly as the subject of a series of blogs that surrounded the shop itself, the Dollies have survived long enough to be seen as genuine contenders \u2013 quite a feat in the transient world of Tokyo fashion. Lolita Kei     Photograph: Yuriko Nakao/Reuters/Corbis    Japanese tribes may be a disparate bunch, but at some point in each development cycle, one word is guaranteed to surface: kawaii. If it&apos;s kawaii (cute) it sells, and no fashion typifies it more readily than the dubiously titled Loli Kei (Lolita tribe). The Lolis decorate themselves in a riot of pinks, frills, bonnets, aprons and shepherds&apos; crooks \u2013 there&apos;s enough fairyland fantasy here to make Barbie turn away in disgust. The fashion has been flirting with the mainstream for more than a decade, but the unexpected twists in its journey have kept it interesting (see below). Gosurori     Photograph: Damon Coulter/Alamy    Gosurori is an amalgamation of two non-Japanese words, gosu being the Japanese pronunciation of the English word goth, and rori, an abbreviated version of the name Lolita. To become a respectable Gosurori, take the previously discussed Lolita outfit, dye it black, edge it with pristine, snow-white lace and apply makeup to match. The Gosuroris have been a part of the Harajuku scene since the late 1990s, and it is thought their existence may owe something to the cross-pollination of the Lolita tribe and the now defunct Visual Kei movement that took its inspiration from Japanese hair metal bands like Glay and L&apos;Arc En Ciel, both phenomenally successsful in the mid-90s. A more disturbing set of love children it is hard to imagine. Harajuku Kei            The Harajuku district is where it all begins for the majority of Tokyo&apos;s tribes \u2013 so many, in fact, that the Japanese press occasionally refer to the local fashionistas under the umbrella term, Harajuku Kei. In its current form, it appears as though the members have simply woken up, stepped out of bed and been attacked by a variety of brightly coloured and frequently clashing clothes. Homemade and swapped accessories play a huge part, and nobody does this hodgepodge style as well as 19-year-old Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, a young woman who appeared on Takeshita Street in 2010 as a fashion-obsessed high school blogger, and is now the face of her own brand. She sings too, after a fashion, and she&apos;ll be performing at the O2 Academy Islington, in London, on 13 February, though tickets are scarce. Gyaru Kei Longtime observers of Japanese fashion will recall the Ganguro tribe, a frightening army of teenagers who teased their hair into tight afros and wore blackface at weekends. While they have long since expired, the gyaru (&quot;gal&quot;) gangs that sprang up in their place are still a fixture on the Shibuya scene. Essentially fashion-conscious, late-teenage women, their look is defined by a kind of glam sassiness \u2013 sculpted hair, lavish but precise makeup and mini skirts. Ironically, given the fashion&apos;s ancestral roots, the latest incarnation (as dictated by tribal style bible, Egg Magazine) demands that the faithful gyaru whitens her skin. It doesn&apos;t come much more high maintenance than this. Gyaru-Oh Whatever the Gyarus can do, the Gyaru-Ohs can do better. Occasionally known as the Host Kei, these fellas spend as much time in front of the mirror as their female counterparts do, and the resulting ultra-effeminate look makes their Gyaru-Oh moniker fairly apt (the phrase can be translated as &quot;Girl Men&quot;). Such is the strength and number of their tribe that they, too, have been awarded their own tribal bible, the proudly named Mens&apos; Egg, which has a circulation of approximately 300,000 nationwide readers, and has even spawned a secondary publication for older Gyaru-Ohs called Men&apos;s Knuckle (circulation 200,000). The Gyaru-Oh&apos;s are a very striking force to be reckoned with. Kitakore Kei Like the Dolly Kei crowd, the relatively new Kitakore Kei have their own spiritual home, this time in the Koenji district. And what a lowly shed it is, too. The Kitakore Building is a tumbledown shop that looks as though it pays bully-money to the elements just to stay in existence, but this is entirely in keeping with the stock that the crowd flocks in to purchase. As a fashion, it is as random as the Harajuku Kei style, but without the bubblegum aesthetic. Punk seems too harsh a word, though it does share the DIY ethic. Most recently, the tribal manifesto has been described by a local editor as &quot;everyday something new&quot;, and this seems as accurate as you might ever hope to get. Otaku     Photograph: TWPhoto/Corbis    As any self-respecting web denizen will tell you, the otaku are no longer bound within Japan&apos;s borders. Sometimes defined as a form of geek chic, the fashionable wing of this subculture is occasionally referred to as Akiba Kei (named after the district it originated from, Akihabara), but in its nascent form Otaku seemed more like the unlucky hand of fate than a fashion statement. Common to tribe members old and young was a kind of dysfunctional existence spent living vicariously through the windows of a comic book, and a fanatical devotion to manufactured pop groups such as the phenomenally successful, 48-member-strong girl group, AKB48. As if the international reach of this seemingly bedroom-bound subculture needed demonstrating any further, there are now AKB48 franchises as far south as Singapore (SKG48). Cosplay     Photograph: Scilla / Demotix/Corbis    The lot of a Cosplayer is invariably lived out in a blue wig and chintzy fabric. Theirs is a life spent in the dressing up box, determined to approximate the look of their favourite anime character, although \u2013 like the world of the otaku \u2013 it is no longer confined to Japan. Perhaps not as prominent as it once was in its home country, and certainly without the original novelty factor, there are still fanatics to be found, and you&apos;re guaranteed a photo opportunity in the Odaiba district during the weekend of the annual Tokyo Game Show, when the costumes on display are constructed with minute attention to detail and maximum pride. Itasha      Photograph: BSPI/Corbis    As a tribe, the gangs of itasha drivers are increasingly less visible in the capital \u2013 ironic, given what they&apos;re known for. The word itasha refers to the cars they drive rather than the people themselves, and is a mashup of the words itai (painful) and sha (vehicle). The pain described is derived either from looking at the cars themselves, or from the embarrassment of having to drive one \u2013 it really depends on who you ask. Increasingly found out in the sticks, these &quot;pain cars&quot; can be spotted several miles off, commonly driven in small groups, usually decked out in lurid colours, sculpted attachments, and the kind of soft-focus imagery not seen in the west since the Athena poster company went out of business.

It\u00a0is the ultimate megacity: a vast web of suburbs \u2013 of small cities, really \u2013 radiating out from a hub of skyscrapers. More than 30 million people live within 30 miles of its centre. A city this big and complicated can only function because of its extraordinary mass transit system, which shuttles millions of workers to and from its suburbs each day. But I wanted to experience the city at walking speed. Somewhere under the concrete, the tower blocks, the monorails and the overpasses, lie other\u00a0versions of Japan: the culmination of thousands of years of island history, presided over by an imperial family that still traces its descent in an unbroken lineage from the sun god, Amaterasu. This strange combination of modernity and tradition is what&apos;s so intriguing about Japan: bullet trains and tatami mats; pachinko parlours and tea ceremony; concrete ugliness and a reverence for natural beauty; the kitsch of Hello Kitty and the simplicity of haiku. So one bright December morning I\u00a0started my walk across Tokyo from the summit of Mount Takao. Takao is in a nature reserve on the western edge of Tokyo&apos;s municipal boundary. It is roughly 40 miles as the crow flies to the heart of the city. With me that first day was Mr Suzuki, a handsome, 68-year-old former airline steward who had taken up guiding in retirement. We had reached the summit by cable car, after a 90-minute train ride from downtown Tokyo but from here on, we were travelling by foot. Looking west from the summit, we could see mile upon mile of velvety green mountains, home to wild boar, monkeys, barn owls and flying squirrels. But east of us lay the urban sprawl of Tokyo: the city fanning out from the bay, its central district a hub of distant grey spikes.   View Walking the world's megacities: TOKYO in a larger map   It would have been serene, except the mountain was heaving with visitors. Tokyo is short of green spaces and Takao is a popular place for day-trippers. Most had come to admire the late autumn colours of the maple leaves. They were snapping pictures on their mobile phones and &quot;oohing&quot;. Some were in full alpine kit, with walking poles, tin mugs jiggling on their backpacks, and gas stoves. But no one was going as far as me: I had four days&apos; walking ahead of me before I\u00a0reached central Tokyo. At the base of the mountain, Mr\u00a0Suzuki and I ate a bowl of buckwheat noodles at the Maple Leaf noodle shop. Mr Suzuki spoke English with the careful pronunciation and vast vocabulary of the autodidact. He wanted me to clarify a few points of translation: &quot;Marcel-san. Should I say soba with grated taro, or soba with grated yam?&quot; And in return, I\u00a0questioned him about the mysterious Japanese aesthetic principle of wabi-sabi. &quot;Very difficult to explain in simple words, Marcel-san,&quot; said Mr Suzuki. &quot;This is part of the Japanese spirit. Nothing permanent, nothing perfect, nothing finished.&quot; Wabi-sabi is most visibly expressed in the arts that are unique to Japan. There is a hint of it in the apparent artlessness of Japanese flower-arranging; in the wonky teacups that are prized for tea ceremony; and in the sombre colours and weathered old stones of Japanese garden design. Wabi-sabi belongs to premodern Japan: the Japan that predates manga, industrial development and the armies of salarymen riding commuter trains to work. But it retains some significance, particularly to older Japanese people, for whom it also seems like an ethical imperative.     Skyline of Tokyo\u2019s Shinjuku district with Mount Fuji in the distance. Photograph: Alamy    For the next hour or so, we found a few wabi-sabi features in the landscape. Clear mountain streams were running beside the road. There were traditional wooden houses with tiled roofs, citrus trees in their gardens and strings of persimmon drying in the sunshine. In one house, I could see an old woman kneeling on her floor as she worked on a huge piece of embroidery. We were walking along route 20, which follows the line of the Koshu Kaido, one of the five arterial roads of medieval Tokyo. We passed a marker showing 30 miles to Nihonbashi \u2013 the bridge in Tokyo from which all distances were traditionally measured. The road was lined with two rows of gingko trees, which had shed their leaves in piles on the pavement. &quot;The gingko leaves, like heaps of gold,&quot; announced Mr Suzuki, as though roughing out the draft of a haiku. Around us, the city was still on a\u00a0human scale, with small, artisanal shops: a man making tofu late in the evening (&quot;Very difficult work, Marcel-san. Hard to compete with supermarkets&quot;); a woman selling pickled turnips; various wagashi shops, which sell the bean paste sweets with seasonal themes that are served with thick green tea as part of the tea ceremony. But gradually, the city began to grow higher and denser around us. At Hachioji, an overpass over the road seemed to signal the onset of the city proper. Suddenly, we were surrounded by vending machines covered with pictures of Tommy Lee Jones that dispensed cans of hot and cold instant coffee. &quot;No ordnance preventing this,&quot; said Mr Suzuki. &quot;Americans think it&apos;s very funny to find Tommy Lee Jones here. But you know he went to Harvard with Al Gore.&quot; Mr Suzuki and I parted at Hachioji. He had set up his mobile phone as a pedometer. &quot;That is the farthest I have ever walked, Marcel-san. Thirteen kilometres!&quot; I was sad to see him go. I fell asleep at 9pm, exhausted from the walk and jet lag. At some point during the night, my phone rang with vague communications from Britain: a\u00a0child was a speaking elf in a Christmas play, something about my mother-in-law. My jet lag felt less like Lost in Translation and more like Life\u00a0on Mars. The next morning, the weather was raw and grey. I followed the yellow gingko trees along route\u00a020 and over the Asa river. My\u00a0breath came in smoky\u00a0puffs. For the next two days, I walked across grey Tokyo suburbs in light rain, carrying a change of clothes in my backpack and listening to a Japanese tutor tape. I used sign language and half a dozen Japanese words to order lunch and dinner in noodle bars. I\u00a0relied on Tommy Lee Jones for coffee\u00a0and tea. I had the exhilarating feeling of being immersed in a mysterious, distant world. At night, I was reading Richard Lloyd Parry&apos;s book People Who Eat Darkness, and I couldn&apos;t improve on his description of the excitement of being in Japan: &quot;Every morning it takes her by surprise \u2013 the sudden consciousness of profound difference. Is it something unfamiliar about the angle of the light, or the way the sounds register in the summer air? Or is it the demeanour of the people on the street and in the cars and the trains \u2013 unobtrusive, but purposeful; neat, courteous, self-contained, but intent, as if following secret orders?&quot;     A sushi bar in the renowned Tsukiji fish market. Photograph: Blaine Harrington III/Corbis    Even at its most grey and mundane, there was something extraordinary about the city. It manifested itself both in strange absences \u2013 litter, overt conflict, graffiti, noise \u2013 and in the positively unusual: the huge numbers of people in surgical masks, the baffling signage, the sedate cyclists beside me on the pavement, the schoolboys in their Prussian uniforms. No one greeted me, no one tried to talk to me, no one ripped me off, and I never ate a bad meal. It seemed perfectly natural for a gaijin (literally, an outside person) with no Japanese and a big backpack to be yomping through the drizzle. Every now and again, I&apos;d have what I thought of \u2013 no doubt, inaccurately \u2013 as a moment of wabi-sabi. I&apos;d see a little temple, or a tiled house with an orchard of persimmon trees around it. I walked past miles of industrial hangars echoing with the sounds of heavy machinery, and through residential areas that had, within living memory, been open fields. Gradually, I became familiar with the way the city rises and falls. Hotels, skyscrapers and big department stores were clustered around the train stations that link the suburbs to the transport system. Some of them were like miniature Tokyos with high-rises and neon signs \u2013 the suburb of Tachikawa had its own red-light district, where hostess bars and karaoke clubs were housed in the upper stories of tall buildings. But half a mile further on, the architecture would shrink again, and the landscape would revert to residential suburbs of two-storey houses. Modern Tokyo is the product of two cataclysmic 20th-century events: the 1923 earthquake and the second world war. The destruction gave planners a free hand to design a city that was unsentimentally efficient and dynamic. But there is little visible remnant of that older Japan. I looked in vain for the delicate imperfections of wabi-sabi. At times, the urbanisation seemed relentless. Whenever I saw something that wasn&apos;t concrete, I had the urge to snap a picture of it. On my third day, as I raised my camera to take a picture of some aubergines growing on a tiny plot of land, I was struck by a strange\u00a0realisation: I had become a\u00a0Japanese tourist.     Nihonbashi, the bridge where the five arterial roads of medieval Japan meet, and the finishing line for Marcel's walk. Photograph: Alamy    That lunchtime, I found a tiny restaurant, run by a couple who were at least in their 70s and possibly a decade older, opposite the campus of Tokyo Gakugei University. I banged my head on the low pole by the entrance. There were half a dozen tables inside and one other customer, slurping his noodles companionably. Its authenticity was only enhanced by the fumes from a paraffin stove and a television showing a Japanese quiz show. I ordered by pointing at a photo in the menu and using a phrase I had learned from my tape: kore okudasai \u2013 this, please. I watched the quiz show while the elderly chef rattled pots in the kitchen. Then his elderly assistant slowly brought me a pretty lacquered tray with tempura, soba noodles, pickles and a satsuma. I took a picture of it. The number and visibility of very healthy, active older people is another of Japan&apos;s minor oddities. Life expectancy in Japan is very high. But while its citizens are living longer lives, fewer and fewer of them are being born. The country has actually been shrinking at the rate of about a million people a year. The government has projected that the population of the country will have shrunk by a third by 2060. The prospect of a collapsing, senescent population struggling to maintain its living standards and its infrastructure seems like a vision from a dystopian novel, but it&apos;s something the Japanese are having to take seriously. Kichijoji, where I spent the third night of my walk, is only 10 miles from Tokyo and considered the city&apos;s most hip and desirable suburb. It&apos;s Tokyo&apos;s Williamsburg, or Notting Hill. It has little bars and vintage clothing shops, and, best of all, beautiful Inokashira Park, from where I set off in the morning and followed the course of the river Kanda all the way into the city. This was the best walking yet. The sun was bright, the maples and gingko trees red and gold in the light, and the river was full of big, fat carp. There were residential houses on both sides of the river. Just a few hours from my final destination, I felt like I&apos;d found space and tranquillity. From here, I\u00a0emerged into the city proper, close to the big towers of Shinjuku, Tokyo&apos;s administrative centre. After days of steady walking, I was unprepared for the impact of the big city: its chic, black-suited crowds, its towering neon escarpments. Tokyo has a purposefulness and an energy that resembles Manhattan&apos;s, but on an even bigger scale. I gawped at the Blade-Runner world of Akihabara, and went into an eerie maid cafe. Inside, the colours were bright, like the set of a children&apos;s television programme, where desexualised waitresses in French maid outfits speak in put-on squeaky voices. At Tsukiji, Tokyo&apos;s awe-inspiring fish market, I ate sushi and marvelled at the produce: tuna fish the size and shape of human torsos, every kind of crustacean, bivalve, mollusc and invertebrate that this seafood-crazy nation eats. At Nihonbashi, the bridge where the five arterial roads of medieval Japan meet, I officially concluded my walk. The bridge was built in 1911 and seems almost ancient in modern Tokyo. But the city&apos;s lack of sentimentality about the past is evident from the way the bridge&apos;s clean lines are boxed in by a concrete flyover. There was something energising and intoxicating about being in the city, but I missed that sense of an older, more timeless Japan. And then, finally, from the 30th floor of my hotel, I rested my weary feet and looked back across the teeming city to the green slope of Mount Takao. Behind it hovered Mount Fuji, as luminous as a painting on a silk scroll."}, {"sentences": ["The Bank of Japan has caved in to pressure from Shinzo Abe&apos;s new government in Tokyo to double its inflation target and ramp up quantitative easing, which should drive down the yen and improve Japan&apos;s competitiveness."], "tags": ["Davos 2013", "Global economy", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Financial crisis", "Economics", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-27T00:06:43Z", "title": "Davos tackles tax, fracking and zombies in hunt for next big idea", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/27/davos-zombies-tax-fracking-nothing-too-green", "article": "Judging by the heavy concentration of floor-length fur coats, eye-watering perfume and expensively tailored suits alone, life had changed little for the wealthy global elite gathered in the Alpine ski resort of Davos for this year&apos;s World Economic Forum: being extremely rich is as much fun as it ever was. Yet away from the parties, the mood was oddly becalmed. With the euro crisis stabilised for the moment, and the darkest days of the credit crunch passing into history, there was no fin-de-si\u00e8cle feeling that the familiar comforts of the 1% might be swept away. But with a sustainable recovery still eluding the western economies, battle-hardened business leaders, bankers and politicians are warily scanning the horizon for the source of the next crisis \u2013 or, for those of a more optimistic turn of mind, a new Big Idea to catapult them back to the more carefree days before 2008. These were some of the most talked-about issues at Davos this year. CURRENCY WARS George Soros, who has now retired from investing (though he admitted he still has the odd flutter to keep his hand in), held court at a convivial dinner on Thursday night, and shared his fear that the calm that has prevailed in foreign exchange markets will give way to turmoil in 2013. The Bank of Japan has caved in to pressure from Shinzo Abe&apos;s new government in Tokyo to double its inflation target and ramp up quantitative easing, which should drive down the yen and improve Japan&apos;s competitiveness. But one currency can fall only if another rises, and Soros believes a cheaper yen will create severe problems for the eurozone. If the euro rises sharply, he said, &quot;recession in Europe may also affect Germany&quot;. In her appearance at Davos, Angela Merkel admitted that she was &quot;not unconcerned&quot; about Japan&apos;s move. &quot;Currencies have been incredibly stable for the past few years; there&apos;s now the possibility of fireworks,&quot; said Soros, who is most famous for creating fireworks of his own when he shorted the pound in September 1992, helping to drive Britain out of the European exchange rate mechanism. FRACKING The process of extracting shale gas from rocks deep beneath the earth by blasting chemicals into the ground may be extremely controversial with campaigners, but governments are increasingly pinning their hopes on the fuel as a low-cost energy source, releasing them from dependence on the volatile Middle East. Viktor Yanukovych, the president of Ukraine, took the opportunity of his sojourn in Davos to sign a multibillion-dollar deal to throw open his country&apos;s reserves to Royal Dutch Shell. However, despite George Osborne&apos;s hopes of stoking a shale-fired British energy revolution by announcing a new tax regime for the fuel, Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica, which owns British Gas, warned that shale would not be a &quot;game-changer&quot; for the UK, adding that it might be a decade before the first gas is extracted. THE BRITISH PROBLEM David Cameron&apos;s long-awaited Europe speech, delivered in London before he flew to the Alps, was a hot topic in the hotel bars and conference centre corridors at Davos. Publicly, most of the European leaders attending, not least Merkel, were studiedly diplomatic, but away from the stage, many non-Brits were baffled by Britain&apos;s fraught relationship with its neighbours. &quot;My wife&apos;s French: she can&apos;t understand it at all,&quot; said one chief executive. &quot;She says, why do the British hate us?&quot; ZOMBIE BUSINESSES An army of the undead is marching through the crisis-hit economies of the western world \u2013 or that was the alarming picture painted by Nouriel Roubini, the outspoken New York-based economist. Five years after the Great Recession ripped through the global economy, the radical emergency measures implemented by the world&apos;s central banks have started to become the norm. While their actions may have prevented a new Great Depression, central banks are now stuck in a bind: they don&apos;t know when it will be safe to start reversing their policy of quantitative easing without unleashing rising economic chaos. And meanwhile, many thousands of financially shaky banks, businesses and households are being propped up. These are the &quot;zombies&quot;. Cheap borrowing prevents uneconomic firms from going bust, but they can&apos;t invest or expand because they&apos;re still hamstrung by the debts of the boom years. Homeowners can&apos;t move because they&apos;re saddled with mortgages they can&apos;t afford; banks won&apos;t lend because of the holes in their balance sheets; and the result is long-term stagnation. Central bankers are much in need of another Davos buzz phrase, an &quot;exit strategy&quot;, but few in the mountain retreat were willing to offer one. MANUFACTURING Boosting the long-neglected manufacturing sector is suddenly in vogue, even in such countries as the US and the UK, where deindustrialisation was for many years seen as a badge of economic progress. Davos attendees were treated to a mind-boggling description of how manufacturing is being transformed for the 21st century, including (literally) weaving components for aircraft engines from carbon fibre on purpose-built looms, and using 3D printers to execute designs for anything from medicines to car parts. Boris Johnson, speaking to British business leaders, argued that manufacturing could be a key growth area for Britain. &quot;Why,&quot; he asked, &quot;should not we partially reindustrialise our economy?&quot; UNEMPLOYMENT Trade unionists and workers&apos; rights campaigners in Davos had a weary, faintly disbelieving air: they can&apos;t understand why rocketing youth unemployment hasn&apos;t forced politicians to change tack on austerity. Guy Ryder, the new secretary-general of the International Labour Organisation, said: &quot;How can these levels of youth unemployment not be a threat to social stability? You have got whole countries reaching a state of immobilisation and trauma.&quot; Gordon Brown, in Davos to promote global education, warned that young people in emerging countries, with growing access to technology and knowledge about the world, could increasingly start to demand a fairer share of its resources. &quot;We are in a new world where young\u00a0people are no longer prepared to say politely, &apos;I think we have got a case&apos;,&quot; he said. &quot;This is about economic as well as social change, and I think people are recognising that the world economy is not well-coordinated; that we could grow more effectively if the major economies worked better together.&quot; RUSSIA With President Vladimir Putin&apos;s regime taking ever closer control over what the communist party used to call the &quot;commanding heights&quot; of the economy, and anecdotal evidence of corruption and repression, a potential meltdown in Russia is one of the key concerns of global businesses. An apocalyptic document called Scenarios for the Russian Federation, produced by the World Economic Forum, came with an online animation including images of pole-axed Russian dolls. Its message was that falling oil prices risked creating &quot;a crisis in Russia&apos;s economic foundations that threatens the country&apos;s social stability&quot;. Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev sat impassively in the audience of one session where a straw poll showed that 78% of the audience thought improving governance \u2013 including tackling corruption \u2013 was the most important issue facing Russia. When his turn came to speak, he insisted reforms were already taking place. &quot;I knew that most people at Davos would vote that way,&quot; he said. &quot;I voted for another option.&quot; ETHICS Few of the champagne-swilling revellers in the bars of the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re hotel, where most of Davos&apos;s hottest parties are held, appeared stricken with guilt, but at the more sober daytime events there was a general acknowledgement that businesses need to do (a bit) more to show that they&apos;re good for the societies in which they operate. Boosting &quot;transparency&quot; and tightening up the rules on footloose global businesses will be one of the aims of Britain&apos;s G8 presidency, said David Cameron in his set-piece speech at Davos. A plethora of NGOs, there to launch a major anti-hunger campaign called &quot;If&quot;, jumped on the prime minister&apos;s promise to ensure that corporations pay their fair share of tax. SLOW THINKING Nobel prize-winner Daniel Kahneman offered attendees a crash course in his hit book Thinking, Fast and Slow. He encouraged his audience of top-flight business leaders to try to use what he calls the &quot;system two&quot; part of their minds, which makes slower, more considered judgments, rather than relying on instinctive, fast-and-furious &quot;system one&quot; thinking. But as one US attendee mused pessimistically afterwards: &quot;Maybe human beings are hard-wired to jump to conclusions.&quot; TECHNOLOGY Davos types love nothing better than trying to imagine how the latest whizzy gadget will transform the world. TK Kurien, chief executive of IT at Wipro, the Bangalore technology business that employs 135,000 people worldwide, says his research shows the average person in India comes into contact with some kind of electronic device \u2013 from movement sensors in light switches to their own smartphones \u2013 as\u00a0many as 11,000 times a day. &quot;They&apos;ve embedded ourselves in every part of our life.&quot; He believes managing the data gathered from these &quot;touch points&quot; will become a growing global issue. Eventually, he believes, firms such as Facebook and Twitter, whose business model depends on the detailed information they can give advertisers about their users, may end up sharing some of their revenue with those members to persuade them to keep sharing details: &quot;Everybody hates being exploited; but nobody minds participating in the entire process and sharing the wealth.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Restless ambitions then took him to Tokyo for six months as a senior speechwriter at the United Nations University."], "tags": ["Media", "The Guardian", "Newspapers & magazines", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "Environment", "Manchester", "Technology", "BBC", "ITV channel", "Television"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-27T13:12:47Z", "title": "Ian Breach obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/27/ian-breach", "article": "Some Guardian journalists stay for life; others move on. Ian Breach, who has died aged 72, was in the second category at a time when many stayed. He joined the Manchester features department as a young subeditor in May 1964. By 1972 he had already been the paper&apos;s jazz critic, become its first technology correspondent and, indeed, its first &quot;anti-motoring&quot; motoring correspondent. Environmental concern increasingly clashed with road-testing new cars. The story goes that Ian went in to see the editor, the austere Alastair Hetherington, suggesting that what the Guardian needed was a transport correspondent. &quot;Really?&quot; replied Hetherington, &quot;I love driving my Jaguar.&quot; Ian left; a few months later the paper appointed a transport correspondent. Ian&apos;s path to the Guardian had hardly been conventional. As a 16-year-old Manchester working-class lad with a few GCEs, he took a marine engineering apprenticeship via Bolton technical college and Royal Dutch Shell. On leave in summer 1959, he met his future wife, Jacky, and effectively jumped ship to join her in London. Ian found work in PR and technical journalism. His Guardian potential was spotted by Anthony Tucker, soon to be made science correspondent. First-hand knowledge of technology allowed Ian to talk detail with experts such as Walt Patterson at Friends of the Earth, and then describe complex issues in an understandable way. Passionate about arts as well as the environment, witty, contrary yet credible, he had the nerve, for instance, to expose industry &quot;gifts&quot; to motoring correspondents while still with the Guardian. By the mid-1970s Ian, Jacky and their daughter, Emmie, had moved north to Milburn, a Cumbrian village nestling into Cross Fell. His first, typically provocative, act at Milburn was to make a film about village life. Restless ambitions then took him to Tokyo for six months as a senior speechwriter at the United Nations University. Back home, Ian&apos;s speciality, energy policy, equipped him perfectly to cover the 1977 Windscale inquiry hearings into commercial waste reprocessing proposed by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) at Sellafield. Both the Financial Times and the New Scientist moved quickly to employ him. Following the inquiry he declined a staff job with the FT, but wrote a meaty Penguin Special, Windscale Fallout: A Primer for the Age of Nuclear Controversy. The paperback is a balanced account of the inquiry and of the Callaghan government&apos;s decision in 1978 to approve the thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp). However, its conclusion is uncompromising. &quot;The politics of nuclear power and reprocessing will increasingly be those of disillusion, anger, frustration and mistrust. We shall all be the losers.&quot; Meanwhile, Ian became a freelance Cumbria reporter for BBC Newcastle. He saw himself as a natural. But his first attempt at speaking to camera provoked an angry response from his veteran colleague: &quot;It&apos;s too long, too wordy, and you aren&apos;t using your eyes. I don&apos;t care if you&apos;ve worked for the Bible, sunshine. They won&apos;t use it.&quot; He learned quickly, to the point where he was soon making films for Look North and the magazine programme Coast to Coast. His BBC editor there, John Mapplebeck, recalls how he had a &quot;marked effect on the way TV covered places and topics&quot;. Then followed a productive stint with BBC Scotland. Tempted back to the north-east of England by Tyne Tees Television doubling his BBC salary, Ian came to realise that his appointment as a current affairs presenter doing &quot;state of the region&quot; programmes had been a ploy by the ITV company to help secure its franchise renewal. He was left kicking his heels after the franchise was confirmed. So, in 1986, he left to join BBC South West in Plymouth, where he made poignant films, all networked, for a series called Natural Concern exploring disasters such as the Camelford water poisoning incident, issues including stag hunting on Exmoor, and events such as the economic death of a farm. They led to a successful period in Birmingham as chief reporter on Countryfile. In 1989 Ian became one of the BBC&apos;s first environment correspondents, London-based, with responsibilities across radio and TV. After years in the regions he rose to the national and international brief. But his biggest story was again near home. On 15 November 1993, Panorama broadcast A Very British Folly, his film exploring the tortuous political history of Thorp. Perhaps it was the title, because the presentation was even-handed enough: BNFL took the BBC to the Press Complaints Commission and lost. However, his BBC star waning, he compounded matters by writing to the director general, John Birt, demanding more air time for environment. His contract was not renewed. If the mid-1990s proved difficult for him professionally, Jacky flourished, running Chris Mullin&apos;s Sunderland South constituency office. Jacky died suddenly in 1999. She had requested a humanist funeral, which Ian helped plan. Shortly afterwards, he was asked if he was interested in training to be a humanist celebrant. Indeed he was.

The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, will be joined by the prime minister and cabinet colleagues as he outlines his proposed route for the Y-shaped network north of Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds. Well-placed sources believe the route will include a new spur to Crewe and run via Manchester airport, helping to bolster support in critical areas of the north. Fresh controversy may be fuelled by deferring the Heathrow link that was one element of HS2&apos;s logic. David Cameron will stress that HS2 is a &quot;vital engine for growth&quot; while McLoughlin will promise that &quot;HS2 will be woven into the transport fabric of the nation, accessible to all&quot;. Extending the high-speed track to Crewe would mean big savings on journey times between London and Liverpool, where city leaders fear falling further behind Manchester in investment, as well as onward to Scotland. A stop at Manchester airport would help buy off the wealthy Cheshire set with a fast and accessible route to the capital, muting the kind of protests seen across the Chilterns, where residents face the disruption of high-speed rail with none of the benefits. The other question is where stations will be on the eastern branch. Sheffield, the beneficiary of a promised South Yorkshire stop, may have to make do with a station on the fringes at the Meadowhall shopping centre. That would dismay those hoping it would help revitalise urban Sheffield: they say the transfer time would make the high-speed route slower than the Midland Mainline from London for the city centre. The deputy prime minister, Sheffield Hallam MP Nick Clegg, has described any stop in the vicinity as a &quot;major victory&quot;. A new &quot;parkway&quot; station in the east Midlands at Toton, on the edge of Nottingham towards Derby, is tipped to be the only other stop on the eastern branch to Leeds, as planners try to balance the demand for the new track to serve multiple cities with the time losses that would blunt the capabilities of high-speed rail. However, the government is playing down the speed and time savings after a bruising experience selling the benefits of the first phase of HS2 were was derided by opponents as simply shortening the journey times between London and Birmingham. Instead it will stress the need for extra capacity, along with the economic benefits and tens of thousands of jobs that the new infrastructure will bring.     Credit: Guardian graphics    The prime minister will say: &quot;Linking communities and businesses across the country and shrinking the distances between our greatest cities, high-speed rail is an engine for growth that will help to drive regional regeneration and invigorate our regional economies. It is vital we get on board the high-speed revolution.&quot; He will add: &quot;It is a catalyst that will help to secure economic prosperity across Britain, rebalance our economy and support tens of thousands of jobs.&quot; A decision on building a high-speed link to Heathrow, originally destined to be part of the phase two announcement, is to be deferred until the Davies commission on aviation capacity has reported after the next election. Although the logic is to present an integrated transport strategy, HS2&apos;s opponents are likely to seize on the U-turn as more evidence that the plans are ill-conceived \u2013 and possibly as a basis for further legal challenge. However, the government has confirmed that HS2 will immediately connect to Crossrail at a new Old Oak Common station in west London, speeding up links to the UK&apos;s main hub airport. George Osborne, the chancellor, whose Tatton constituency lies on the expected route, is a crucial proponent in unlocking the \u00a333bn spend. A source familiar with his thinking said: &quot;The coalition&apos;s hope is that it will create a mega-city in the north. Osborne&apos;s like a CFO [chief financial officer] looking at his estate \u2013 when he looks at his country, he sees that half of it is overheated and the rest is struggling. &quot;When George goes to Japan, as he likes to do, he sees how the bullet train from Tokyo made Osaka a dramatically different place. And he&apos;s often looked at the fast trains on the southern seaboard of China \u2013 and he thinks, if only Leeds, Manchester, Rotherham, Barnsley, Derby could have the same sort of connections \u2013 if people who lived there could apply for jobs elsewhere, or potential clients in London could source business from those places.&quot; Economists are divided on the benefits.

Due to an inexplicable discontinuity in space-time, on Sunday I turned 50. I have petitioned the\u00a0relevant authorities, but there&apos;s nothing they can do. So I will use the occasion to try to explain the alien world from which I came. To understand how and why we are now governed as we are, you need to know something of that strange place. I was born into the third tier of the dominant class: those without land or capital, but with salaries high enough to send their children to private schools. My preparatory school, which I attended from the age of eight, was a hard place, still Victorian in tone. We boarded, and saw our parents every few weeks. We\u00a0were addressed only by our surnames and caned for misdemeanours. Discipline was rigid, pastoral care almost non-existent. But\u00a0it\u00a0was also strangely lost. A few decades earlier, the role of such schools was clear: they broke boys&apos; attachment to their families and re-attached them to the institutions \u2013 the colonial service, the government, the armed forces \u2013 through which the British ruling class projected its power. Every year they released into the world\u00a0a cadre of kamikazes, young men\u00a0fanatically devoted to their caste and culture. By the time I was eight those institutions had either collapsed (in the case of colonial service), fallen into other hands (government), or were no longer a primary means by which British power was asserted (the armed forces). Such schools remained good at breaking attachments, less good at creating them. But the old forms and the old thinking persisted. The school chaplain used to recite a prayer that began &quot;let us now praise famous men&quot;. Most of those he named were heroes of colonial conquest or territorial wars. Some, such as Douglas Haig and Herbert Kitchener, were by then widely regarded as war criminals. Our dormitories were named after the same people. The history we were taught revolved around topics such as Gordon of Khartoum, Stanley and Livingstone and the Black Hole of Calcutta. In geography, the maps still showed much of the globe coloured red. My second boarding school was a kinder, more liberal place. But we remained as detached from the rest of society as Carthusian monks. The world, when we were released into it, was unrecognisable. It bore no relationship to our learning or experience. The result was cognitive dissonance: a highly uncomfortable state from which human beings will do almost anything to escape. There were two principal means. One \u2013 the more painful \u2013 was to question everything you held to be true. This process took me years: in fact, it has not ended. It was, at first, highly disruptive to my peace of mind and sense of self. The other, as US Republicans did during the Bush presidency, is to create your own reality. If the world does not fit your worldview, you either shore up your worldview with selectivity and denial, or (if you have power) you try to bend the world to fit the shape it takes in your mind. Much of the effort of conservative columnists and editors, and of certain politicians and historians, appears to be devoted to these tasks. In the Origins of Totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt explains that the nobles of pre-revolutionary France &quot;did not regard themselves as representative of the nation, but as a separate ruling caste which might have much more in common with a foreign people of the same society and condition than with its\u00a0compatriots&quot;. Last year the former Republican staffer Mike Lofgren wrote something very similar about the dominant classes of the US: &quot;the rich elites of this country have far more in common with their counterparts in London, Paris, and Tokyo than with their fellow American citizens \u2026 the rich disconnect themselves from the civic life of the nation and from any concern about its well being except as a place to extract loot. Our plutocracy now lives like the British in colonial India: in the place and\u00a0ruling it, but not of it.&quot; Secession from the concerns and norms of the rest of society characterises any well established elite. Our own ruling caste, schooled separately, brought up to believe in justifying fairytales, lives in a world of its own, from which it can project power without understanding or even noticing the consequences. A removal from the life of the rest of the nation is no barrier to the desire to dominate it. In fact, it appears to be associated with a powerful sense of entitlement. So if you have wondered how the current government can blithely engage in the wholesale transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, how its frontbench can rock with laughter as it truncates the livelihoods of the poorest people of this country, why it commits troops to ever more pointless post-colonial wars, here, I think, is part of the answer. Many of those who govern us do not in their hearts belong here. They belong to a different culture, a different world, which knows as little of its own acts as it knows of those who suffer them.

The African-led support mission in Mali, known as Afisma, has already seen troops arriving steadily from several countries including Nigeria and is eventually expected to take over operations from France. But the needs of the sudden and laborious mission have mushroomed and the overall budget is likely to be nearer $960m. Among the biggest donors was Japan, which suffered the heaviest foreign losses in the In Amenas gasfield siege in Algeria last week with 10 workers killed. Tokyo said its pledge of $120m in aid and support for refugees reflected its &quot;unshaken resolve to fight terrorism&quot;. France, which has 3,500 troops on the ground in Mali, is paying for its own initial intervention, codenamed Operation Serval. It has not asked other western nations to contribute ground forces, but there was relief in Paris as Britain, the US and Germany increased their support in terms of logistics, transport and intelligence. There had been tension between France and the US at the end of last week when Washington handed Paris a $20m bill for the use of its transport flights. Irked, Paris calculated that it amounted to $50,000 dollars per hour of flight time, according to Le Monde. The bill was dropped and the differences appeared to have been patched up at the weekend when the US announced it would fly tankers to refuel French fighters and bombers, stepping up the American involvement considerably and effectively directly supporting military attacks. Germany&apos;s offer of a third transport aircraft to carry west African troops to Mali was looked upon favourably by France after the Mali operation initially seemed to put strain on the Paris-Berlin relationship and their different views of intervention abroad. Germany is traditionally reticent to intervene, as it showed by standing back from the recent Libya campaign. Germany pledged $20m to the UN fund for the African mission in Mali, but its foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, pointedly noted: &quot;In the long-term there can only be a political solution&quot; to Mali&apos;s problems. European government officials met in Brussels on Tuesday to decide how to put together a 500-strong military training mission to be sent to Mali in a fortnight, amid growing complaints about how the war in Sahel is highlighting an EU security policy and defence capacity vacuum. Amid speculation that an EU &quot;battle group&quot; of 1,700 troops on constant standby for emergency deployment could be rushed to Sahel, senior officials in Brussels admitted this was a non-starter. The group&apos;s main real function was for practice, senior sources said. The necessary consensus of 27 EU governments on a deployment was impossible to reach in any case and had not been attempted. While use of the battle group had been discussed in Brussels, the issue had not been raised with EU governments as there was no point. General Patrick De Rousiers, the French air force officer who heads the EU&apos;s military committee, said the French-German-Polish group currently on standby was &quot;useful for keeping up the level of the unit. The aim is to foster interoperability between nations.&quot; He added: &quot;When will at last the battle groups be deployed? When the 27 agree.&quot; Since being formed six years ago, the rotating six-month battle groups have never seen action. De Rousiers stressed that France was receiving logistical help from 10 EU countries. &quot;The training mission in Mali is really the sign that the EU is engaged,&quot; he said. &quot;France is not alone at all. France, I imagine, should be happy having what it has.&quot; A French diplomat said of the Mali ground operation: &quot;The decision was taken by France to go in alone. We knew from the start that it would be an operation supported by African forces. It was never a question of a European ground troop mission. But Europe&apos;s role in training the African force has now been accelerated. Things are falling into place, we don&apos;t have any criticisms to make.&quot; Colonel Michel Goya, a senior French officer, told the EUobserver website: &quot;The EU doesn&apos;t know how to wage war. It&apos;s not prepared to launch military operations of this type.&quot; He said it was difficult enough waging war by Nato committee, as in Libya or in 1999 in Serbia and Kosovo. &quot;It would be even worse at EU level. If we do it alone, it&apos;s more efficient in military terms. We have more freedom of action if we do it alone.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Geithner (whose father was a Ford Foundation executive in Asia) was only in his 20s when he joined the Treasury in 1988 and dispatched to Tokyo as the assistant Treasury attach\u00e9 in the US embassy.", "As a senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York put it at the time, he was seen as &quot;a crisis manager par excellence who will hit the ground running&quot;."], "tags": ["US economy", "Economics", "Business", "US domestic policy", "US news", "World news", "US foreign policy", "Financial crisis"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-30T12:30:01Z", "title": "Tim Geithner: a legacy of financial failure containment | Leo Panitch", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/30/tim-geithner-legacy-financial-failure-containment", "article": "As Tim Geithner departs from the US Treasury, it is instructive to reflect on the legacy of a long career which has been unusual for the US, resembling more that of the most successful and powerful permanent civil servants in other G7 countries. Geithner (whose father was a Ford Foundation executive in Asia) was only in his 20s when he joined the Treasury in 1988 and dispatched to Tokyo as the assistant Treasury attach\u00e9 in the US embassy. He rose rapidly through the international division of the Treasury under Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, becoming under-secretary of international affairs in 1998. With the change in administrations he moved his office a few blocks from 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue to the IMF headquarters, where he served as director of the policy development and review department. In 2003 he was appointed president of the New York Federal Reserve \u2013 the pivotal operational position in what has been called &quot;the Treasury-Fed-Wall Street nexus&quot;. This passage to the pinnacle of power in these key institutions of the American state only compares with Paul Volcker&apos;s illustrious career, moving back and forth as he did between the Fed and the Treasury between the 1950s and the 1980s. Indeed, it might be said that Geithner&apos;s key international role at the Treasury in the 1990s was built on the foundation established when Volcker was there in the 1960s, bringing together senior officials from the leading capitalist states to discuss the implications of their governments&apos; policies for international financial markets in suitably &quot;intimate settings&quot;, as Volcker described them. Volcker continuted:  &quot;These people were not politicians; they mainly had long careers in government. They all had an unusual sense of commitment and common purpose, and they built up a reserve of mutual trust that paid off later in an ability to reach quick decisions.&quot;  But whereas Volcker&apos;s career was primarily defined by the need to manage the crises produced by the inflationary pressures of the Keynesian era \u2013 in which the concern to defend the dollar as the key currency of global capitalism stood paramount \u2013 Geithner&apos;s career was defined by the crises produced by the volatility of global finance in the neoliberal era. For all the handwringing that has attended US trade imbalances and fiscal deficits, the dollar has remained very stable in recent decades amid vast foreign capital flows into Wall Street and Treasury bonds. It has rather been the constant danger that a financial spark anywhere could cause the great conflagration that finally occurred in 2007-8 that kept Geithner and his colleagues up at night. Perhaps the most important report on what the Treasury was up to in the 1990s \u2013 prepared in the teeth of some of most dangerous financial crises of the mid-1990s, and published as American Finance for the 21st Century in late 1998 in the wake of the Asian crisis \u2013 made a sharp distinction between the old practice of &quot;failure prevention&quot; and the new one of &quot;failure containment&quot;. To persist in trying to make &quot;the financial system safer by tying the hands of institutions will inevitably put a damper on innovation, at considerable cost to the economy as a whole and potentially to America&apos;s world leadership in financial services.&quot; Supervision and regulation needed to be of a kind that supported the financial sector&apos;s expansion \u2013 and insofar as its &quot;mercurial growth&quot; inevitably gave rise to financial crises, the main goal of financial policy should primarily be &quot;failure containment&quot;. Superintending global finance to this end was always a multilateral exercise, but one in which the Treasury was very much primus inter pares. As the Asian crises began to unfold in 1997, Geithner (then assistant secretary for international affairs and the key Treasury figure at the meeting where Japan&apos;s loans to Thailand were arranged) made a legendary quip to his Japanese counterpart: &quot;How does it feel to be a superpower?&quot; But Geithner also played a major role in ensuring that a proposal advanced by the Japanese finance ministry for an Asian Monetary Fund was defeated. As Business Week revealed (in a piece deliciously titled &quot;The Swat team from Washington: How a trio from Treasury is helping to contain the damage), Geithner orchestrated the opposition to this by other Asian states (including China), thereby ensuring that the Treasury was able to deny &quot;any charge that the imperial Americans were blocking an Asian solution&quot;. As Geithner moved from the Treasury&apos;s international desk to take charge of the New York Fed, he was well aware of the tightrope the Wall Street banks were themselves walking. Indeed, in September 2005, he summoned the bankers doing the most derivative business to attend a meeting at the New York Fed offices for the first time since the 1998 Long-Term Capttital Management (LTCM) crisis, and was able to get them all to agree to overhaul their back-office procedures for confirming trades on credit derivatives. Yet the operative watchwords were still much more &quot;failure containment&quot; than &quot;failure prevention&quot;. It was from his position at the New York Fed that Geithner tried to douse the 2007-8 financial conflagration, together with Henry Paulson at the Treasury and Ben Bernanke at the Fed in Washington \u2013 who, while older, were both neophytes compared to him in the halls of power. Indeed, the New York Fed effectively acted the world&apos;s central bank as the financial crisis unfolded from August 2007 onwards. Not only were the major US banks lining up for loans at its discount window but so were Germany&apos;s Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, Calyon of France, and even the Bank of China Ltd. (The Fed&apos;s loans to the New York branches of foreign banks were only revealed under court order in 2011, having been concealed lest they stir up domestic populist resentments as well as further market turmoil.) When President Obama called on Geithner to become his first treasury secretary, this was enthusiastically greeted on Wall Street, and beyond. As a senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York put it at the time, he was seen as &quot;a crisis manager par excellence who will hit the ground running&quot;. In fact, Geithner&apos;s financial stability plan largely followed what had gone before. The main goal, as he told bankers from 27 countries at a 2011 American Bankers Association meeting, remained to find &quot;better ways of managing the inevitable failures that will happen in competitive markets&quot;, which above all meant recognising that &quot;the challenge of reducing the risk of contagion from a financial crisis requires much more global co-ordination internationally than has ever been the case&quot;. Of course, what also made &quot;failure containment&quot; especially challenging was how to handle Congress at home. A favourite phrase inside the Treasury, as Geithner rose through its ranks in the 1990s, was that of Congress &quot;cutting off the water to the fire department when the city is burning down&quot;. Yet this Congressional opposition had in every instance been overcome. Indeed, Robert Rubin accurately described Congress&apos;s resistance to the Treasury&apos;s loan to Mexico to stop the 1995 peso crisis (the largest bailout of a sovereign in history to that point) as &quot;meant to oppose us without actually stopping us&quot;. We can be sure, as Geithner takes his leave from the Treasury, that he must have regarded his own skirmishes with Congress in much the same light. However harrowing, they were nothing compared to trying to manage the chaotic volatility of global finance over a quarter of a century."}, {"sentences": ["At a restaurant serving soil in Tokyo.", "This is lab-tested-for-safety, first-class agricultural soil from the farmlands north of Tokyo, baked, boiled, triple-filtered and mixed with gelatine to produce mud, which is then used as the basis for various dishes."], "tags": ["Japanese food and drink", "Food & drink", "Food and drink", "Life and style", "Travel", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-30T15:24:43Z", "title": "Mud: Tokyo's latest culinary sensation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2013/jan/30/mud-latest-culinary-sensation-tokyo", "article": "     Age: Fractionally younger than soil and water.

The body that organises Japan&apos;s &quot;scientific&quot; hunts said the fleet had the legal right to enter the zone, and accused Sea Shepherd of using dangerous tactics to stop the hunt. &quot;Since Sea Shepherd has been putting Japanese lives and property at risk, it&apos;s been necessary to move as close to Australian territorial waters as possible to keep an eye on them,&quot; Glenn Inwood, a spokesman for the Institute of Cetacean Research, told Associated Press. Australia, the most vocal international opponent of Japan&apos;s whaling programme, has taken its campaign to ban the annual hunts to the international court of justice in The Hague. The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986, but Japan uses a clause in the moratorium to conduct &quot;lethal research&quot;. Meat from the hunts is sold on the open market. Sea Shepherd, whose members have frustrated the Japanese fleet every winter for the past several years, said it would continue its campaign this season, despite a US court decision late last year banning its vessels from sailing within 500 yards of the whalers."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I think this sort of thing is happening and will keep popping up.&quot; Japan is keen to avoid negative publicity as Tokyo steps up its campaign to host the 2020 Olympics."], "tags": ["Japan", "Olympics 2012: judo", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-01T09:52:19Z", "title": "Japanese women's judo coach resigns over claims he abused athletes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/01/japanese-womens-judo-coach-resigns", "article": "The coach of the Japanese women&apos;s judo team has resigned amid accusations that he physically abused athletes in the buildup to the London Olympics. Ryuji Sonoda is accused of harassing and assaulting female judoka while they were preparing for the summer games. The revelations have rocked the Japanese martial art, coming the same week as a former Olympic two-time gold medallist, Masato Uchishiba, was sentenced to five years in prison for raping a female member of a university judo club in 2011. Uchishiba, 34, won gold medals in the 66kg in Athens and Beijing. The country&apos;s judo federation confirmed that Sonoda, a former world champion in the 60kg category, had used violence against the women. The abuse prompted 15 athletes to send a letter to the Japanese Olympic Committee at the end of last year complaining about Sonoda&apos;s conduct. They said they had been slapped and shoved by him and other coaches, beaten with thick bamboo swords and forced to compete while injured. On Thursday, Sonoda admitted that the allegations were &quot;more or less true&quot;, adding: &quot;I deeply regret that I have caused trouble with my behaviour, words and actions. It will be difficult for me to continue coaching the team.&quot; The federation reprimanded him and the other coaches, but the sports minister, Hakubun Shimomura, ordered the Japan Olympic Committee (JOC) to launch an inquiry into the accusations. The police said they too would investigate. Japan, which invented the sport, failed to win a single gold medal in men&apos;s judo for the first time in London; its only judo gold was won by Kaori Matsumoto in the women&apos;s 57kg division. The country had expected to win at least half of the 14 judo events. The IJF, world judo&apos;s governing body, said abuse of athletes had no place in the sport. &quot;In direct connection with the complaint of a group of athletes from the national Japanese women&apos;s team, reporting the acts from their coach, the IJF strongly emphasises its total disapproval of such behaviours,&quot; it said in a statement. &quot;The IJF is particularly focused on the development and promotion of the moral code of judo. Judo is a method to develop the physical and mental capacities, whose primary concern is to maintain the [physical and mental] health and integrity of the participants. Any action that goes against these principles are banned. The IJF will therefore take all necessary measures.&quot; The use of violence against Japanese athletes has been in the spotlight since the death of a teenage sumo apprentice in 2007. The 17-year-old collapsed after being beaten by three fellow wrestlers, one armed with a baseball bat. Their coach was sentenced to six years in prison for ordering the assault. The death sparked demands for stables to address bullying in sumo, whose practitioners live together and undergo a strict training regime designed to toughen them up for competition in the ring. The problem was highlighted again last December with the suicide of a high school student in Osaka who had been repeatedly beaten by his basketball coach. Commenting on Sonoda&apos;s conduct, the JOC&apos;s president, Tsunekazu Takeda, said everything would be done &quot;so that something like this never happens again in Japanese sport&quot;. But the body&apos;s executive director said he believed Sonoda&apos;s abuse was part of a wider problem in Japanese judo. &quot;This is just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; Noriyuki Ichihara told the Kyodo news agency. &quot;I think this sort of thing is happening and will keep popping up.&quot; Japan is keen to avoid negative publicity as Tokyo steps up its campaign to host the 2020 Olympics.

Yet hours after a magazine published photographs of her leaving his home last month, Minegishi, a member of the wildly popular girl band AKB48, went on to YouTube to issue a tearful apology. &quot;As a senior member of the group, it is my responsibility to be a role model for younger members,&quot; she said, before ending the four-minute mea culpa with a deep, lingering bow. The most striking thing about her apology, however, was her appearance. She had shaved her head, a traditional act of contrition in Japan, but perhaps a step too far for a 20-year-old woman whose &quot;crime&quot; was to have found herself a boyfriend \u2013 19-year-old Alan Shirahama, a dancer in a boyband. Minegishi explained she had decided to cut off her long hair immediately after seeing her photograph, her face hidden behind a surgical mask and a baseball cap, in the weekly tabloid Shukan Bunshun on Thursday. Her dramatic gesture underlined the strict rules to which Japan&apos;s young pop stars must adhere to project an image of unimpeachable morals. In the YouTube video, which has been viewed more than 3m times, Minegishi said the assignation has been &quot;thoughtless and immature&quot;. &quot;If it is possible, I wish from the bottom of my heart to stay in the band,&quot; she said. &quot;Everything I did is entirely my fault. I am so sorry. &quot;I don&apos;t believe just doing this means I can be forgiven for what I did, but the first thing I thought was that I don&apos;t want to quit AKB48.&quot; AKB48&apos;s management agency demoted her to &quot;trainee level&quot; starting on Friday, according to the band&apos;s official blog. Minegishi is among the original members of the band, which since it formed in 2005 has built up a huge following among teenage girls and salarymen who flock to concerts and publicity events for the chance to shake hands with their idols. The group, named after the geeky Akihabara district of Tokyo, has had a succession of million-selling singles and generated sales of more than \u00a3126m in CD and DVD sales in 2011. Together, the AKB48 stable has more than 230 members in their teens and early 20s, with four main bands and several offshoots. Their act is more saccharine than sexual, but the band has courted controversy off-stage in the past year. In 2012, a TV commercial in which the girls seductively passed confectionery from mouth to mouth attracted complaints, and earlier the same year one of the singer&apos;s mothers was arrested for allegedly having sex with a minor. Last month, police launched an investigation after a weekly magazine ran a photo of a young boy cupping the breasts of the former AKB48 member Tomomi Kasai. The publisher was forced to destroy about 670,000 copies of the magazine."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Yet fisheries officials and other government figures continue to siphon off millions of taxpayer yen to prop up an industry that is effectively dead in the water.&quot; Prof Masayuki Komatsu, a former agriculture ministry official who teaches ocean and marine resource policy at the national graduate institute for policy studies in Tokyo, agrees that whaling in its current form is economically unsustainable.", "Whatever judgment the court makes, it won&apos;t change the reality that in the end, the decision on whaling is going to be made in Tokyo.&quot; The Ifaw report calls for the development of whale watching along Japan&apos;s coastline, a move that, unlike the Antarctic hunts, &quot;will turn a profit and directly benefit costal communities&quot;."], "tags": ["Whaling", "Japan", "Whales", "Marine life", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Environment", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-04T12:36:46Z", "title": "Japanese whaling industry 'dead in the water', says animal welfare group", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/04/japan-whaling-industry-dead-water", "article": "Japan&apos;s whaling industry is &quot;dead in the water&quot; and cannot survive without huge taxpayer subsidies, according to a study. The report, to be published on Tuesday by the charity International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw), draws on Japanese government data for the first time to build a case against the use of millions of dollars in public subsidies to prop up the industry amid a dramatic decline in consumption of whale meat. Last year those subsidies included \u00a52.28bn (\u00a315.6m) siphoned off from the budget for reconstructing the region devastated by the March 2011 tsunami. The report, seen by the Guardian, calls on the government to divert resources to Japan&apos;s fledgling whale-watching industry as a &quot;pro-economy, pro-whale&quot; alternative to its annual &quot;research&quot; hunts in the Antarctic. &quot;Whaling is an unprofitable business that can survive only with substantial subsidies and one that caters to an increasingly shrinking and ageing market,&quot; the report says. Annual subsidies, channelled through the Institute for Cetacean Research, average about \u00a5782m (\u00a35.3m), it said, adding that the government spent at least \u00a530bn (\u00a3205m) on whaling between 1987 and last year.     A Japanese whaling fleet's mothership, the Nisshin Maru, seen from Sea Shepherd vessel the Bob Barker. Photograph: Sam Sielen/AFP/Getty Images    In addition, part of a separate profitable fisheries programme is being used, in part, to fund the refitting of the whalers&apos; factory ship, the Nisshin Maru, which will enable the fleet to operate for at least another 10 years. Japan refuses to abandon its whaling programme, despite years of opposition from countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Patrick Ramage, the director of Ifaw&apos;s global whale programme, said that was due in part to the influence wielded by politicians representing coastal fishing communities with links to whaling, and bureaucrats at the fisheries agency. &quot;There&apos;s also the fact that Japan doesn&apos;t appreciate foreigners telling them what to do, and that allows them to play the cultural imperialism card,&quot; he said. The report says official claims that whaling is a historical and cultural necessity are &quot;profoundly and increasingly untrue&quot;. Studies conducted on Ifaw&apos;s behalf by the Japan-based E-Square and Nippon Research Centre show whale meat consumption has fallen to about 1% of its 1960s peak, when it was a vital source of protein. Current stockpiles of unsold whale meat have increased to nearly 5,000 tonnes, about four times greater than they were 15 years ago. &quot;With growing wealth and modernisation, the people of Japan have lost their yen for whale meat,&quot; the report says. &quot;Yet fisheries officials and other government figures continue to siphon off millions of taxpayer yen to prop up an industry that is effectively dead in the water.&quot; Prof Masayuki Komatsu, a former agriculture ministry official who teaches ocean and marine resource policy at the national graduate institute for policy studies in Tokyo, agrees that whaling in its current form is economically unsustainable. His solution, however, is to increase the annual whale catch in the Antarctic and north-west Pacific so prices drop enough to attract a new generation of consumers. &quot;For older Japanese, whale meat is something special that you are happy to pay a premium for,&quot; he said. &quot;But young people have never experienced the taste. It&apos;s not special to them and there are plenty of other sources of protein they can turn to. Japan needs to sell whale meat at a competitive price, similar to that of pork or chicken, and to do that it needs to increase its annual catch.&quot; According to an Ifaw survey published late last year, 89% of Japanese people said they had not bought whale meat in the past 12 months. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986, but a clause in the ban allows Japan to catch up to about 1,000 mainly minke whales in the southern ocean every winter, and to sell the meat on the open market. Komatsu believes the IWC ban should be lifted to allow Japan to catch &quot;at least&quot; 1,000 whales a year. The cost of sending the fleet to the Antarctic and clashes with the Sea Shepherd marine conservation group have forced the fleet to return with a fraction of its quota of about 950 whales in recent years. Late last year, the whalers left port several weeks late and are expected to take only about 300 whales, Komatsu said.     Japan is allowed to catch up to 1,000 mainly minke whales every winter. Photograph: Murdo Macleod    Australia, which last week demanded Japan&apos;s whaling fleet leave its exclusive economic zone as it prepares for this winter&apos;s slaughter, has taken its campaign to end the Antarctic whale hunts to the international court of justice in the Hague. A ruling could come this year. &quot;The fisheries agency is using international opposition to whaling to build domestic support,&quot; Ramage said. &quot;But I don&apos;t think that argument is selling any better than all that whale meat now sitting in warehouses. Whatever judgment the court makes, it won&apos;t change the reality that in the end, the decision on whaling is going to be made in Tokyo.&quot; The Ifaw report calls for the development of whale watching along Japan&apos;s coastline, a move that, unlike the Antarctic hunts, &quot;will turn a profit and directly benefit costal communities&quot;. Ramage said: &quot;Whale watching is an economically beneficial alternative that&apos;s taking off in Japan and deserves government support.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["And there is now a real fear that, in Beijing and Tokyo classrooms, map-making is being marshalled for a revived era of tension."], "tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "UK news", "Tristram Hunt"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-04T19:15:00Z", "title": "Israel, Palestine and the mapping of power | Tristram Hunt", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/04/israel-palestine-power-maps-ptolemy", "article": "&apos;It&apos;s almost comical. The idea of maps is to represent reality; here it represents fantasy.&quot; So Professor Bruce Wexler of Yale University comments on how the vast majority of maps in Palestinian and Israeli schoolbooks omit the existence of the other entity. As a result, children on either side of the Green Line are growing up with &quot;an internal representation of their homeland, in which one does not include the other&quot;. But since when have maps been about objective representation of space? They are about the expression and fulfilment of power. From the age of Ptolemy, all those lofty claims to comprehensiveness have usually succumbed to the promotion of political agendas. As the cartography scholar Jerry Brotton rightly remarks: &quot;A map always manages the reality it tries to show.&quot; Nowhere more so than with the British empire. For in Israel/Palestine, just as in Kashmir and Sudan, postcolonial nations are still wrestling with imperialism&apos;s mixed legacy and its arbitrary lines in the sand. As the colonial unravelling continues, and as rising powers seek to exert their own dominion, the historic confusions of British map-making are fostering all manner of geopolitical tensions. From the outset, cartography and colonialism went hand in hand. The assertion of political control over supposed terra incognita was most effectively realised by drawing up plans and plots. Maps allowed for the expropriation of existing land rights (since indigenous communities often lacked accurate measuring instruments) and an explanation of a colony&apos;s significance. Take Bryan Edwards&apos;s mid-18th century Map of the Island of Barbadoes, with its delineation of the Caribbean landscape into Anglican parishes and sugar plantations. What mattered was Barbados&apos;s role in the imperial project, rather than any realistic representation of its geography or population. Or perhaps the most famous propagation of British colonial power, John Colomb&apos;s 1886 map, Imperial Federation. It placed Britain centre stage, coloured our colonies a distinctive red, inflated the land mass of Canada, left swaths of unconquered terrain simply blank, and at its base posited a serene Britannia surrounded by icons of her Indian, Australian, and African colonies. Resistance to official mapping became part of the story of anti-colonialism. In his 1916 novel Ghare Baire, Tagore has revolutionary hero Sandip ask his hostess, Bimala: &quot;Have I not told you that, in you, I visualise the shakti [power] of our country? The geography of a country is not the whole truth. No one can give up his life for a map!&quot; Instead of British-made maps showing the Raj&apos;s ports and cantonments, Sandip visualises an altogether different map of Mother India, made up of her rivers, jungles, mountains and peoples. It was this anti-rationalist map of India as a maternal bodyscape that would make its way into the Tamil schoolbooks of an independent India. By then, of course, the awful truth was many millions had given up their lives for a map \u2013 thanks to the Mountbatten plan&apos;s partition of India and Pakistan, based on the utilitarian, census-driven mapping of the British civil servant Cyril Radcliffe. The boundaries of India still remain in contention. But today it is a rising China, rather than declining Britain, that is seeking to reshape the map of south-east Asia. New passports issued by Beijing in 2012 counted as Chinese most of Arunachal Pradesh, a north-eastern Indian state that sends parliamentarians to New Delhi. China&apos;s assertive cartography also infuriated the Vietnamese, by claiming ownership of disputed islands in the South China Sea. But it is always school textbooks \u2013 those &quot;weapons of mass instruction&quot; \u2013 that cause the greatest furore. In 2005 textbooks heading for a Japanese school in China were seized by customs officials who objected to the way Taiwan was coloured differently to the mainland and territories in the East China Sea were claimed for Japan. And there is now a real fear that, in Beijing and Tokyo classrooms, map-making is being marshalled for a revived era of tension. So, it is no surprise that officials in Ramallah and Jerusalem are showing once again that space is power by seeking to delegitimise each other. The late Edward Said, chronicler of western constructions of orientalism, understood this more than most. In the last years of his life he published map after map showing Israeli settlements eating into Palestinian land. Because the real problem for Palestinian and Israeli textbooks is that the map keeps changing. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight"}, {"sentences": ["Just back from Tokyo and had the most succulent tongue in a restaurant there."], "tags": ["Chinese food and drink", "Food & drink", "Ken Hom", "Life and style", "Chinese new year"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-07T15:30:00Z", "title": "Live chat: Ken Hom on Chinese cookery", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/feb/07/live-chat-ken-hom-chinese-new-year-cookery", "article": "This Sunday sees the start of the Chinese Year of the Snake \u2013 and to celebrate, the man who transformed the British view of Chinese cookery with hugely popular books and TV series was live online to answer your questions, and inspire you to cook up your own feast to celebrate.

If you had to order a takeaway which cuisine would you go for and why? Ken Hom responds: @TheJoyOfEssex - Morning, I&apos;d probably choose Chinese food, sushi or a great pizza, the main reason for choosing sushi or pizza is that I never make these myself. snelly asks I&apos;m vegetarian now but used to love won ton soup.

I understand stuffed yuba rolls are the more common way to go, but i&apos;ve also read that you can braise the sticks too? Can i use the sheets instead of sticks for braising, and do you have any recipes for either the sheets or sticks? (Ideally, looking for vegetarian recipes, though not essential, just after something tasty!) Ken Hom responds: @normansmee -You are correct, you can braise both. I recommend braising with fermented bean curd for a wonderful, tasty dish.

Ken Hom responds: @MisterA - Good morning, this isn&apos;t really a Chinese dish, usually Chinese restaurants would serve a simple stir fried egg dish which is probably what you&apos;ve had. Have a great Chinese New Year. normansmee asks Hi Ken - any ideas for making the most of the seasonal, British winter veg? I&apos;m thinking things like Kale, Jersualem artichoke (which is kind of like a water chestnut in some ways), and celeriac, all of which are really good at the moment, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Thanks. Ken Hom responds: @normansmee - I love winter vegetables. I think root vegetables are best simply braised with a little bit of stock and hoisin sauce.  richieroma asks: Hi Ken. Just back from Tokyo and had the most succulent tongue in a restaurant there. I asked the waiter how they cooked it so beautifully and he said they boiled it. Surely not? It was like butter. Any cooking tips for this underrated part of the cow much appreciated! Ken Hom responds: @richieroma - Thanks for your question. Tongue is wonderful braised in a savoury Chinese sauce of stock, soy sauce, star anice and cinnamon. Long, slow cooking makes it very tender. Happy New Year to you. owBLD asks Ken, I don&apos;t have a question but I just wanted to tell you that you rock. Ken Hom responds: @owBLD - Thanks so much, you&apos;re very cool too. Have a wonderful Chinese New Year. streakyradio asks Chinese restaurants make stir fried beef melt in the mouth tender, when I try it is like rubber. What is the secret? Ken Hom responds: @streakyradio - A lot of Chinese restaurants marinade their stir fried beef. What I tend to do is to use a tender cut of meat (fillet) for the perfect beef stir fry. SophieAlexandra asks Hi Ken, I&apos;m thinking of having a Chinese New Year party on Saturday night, but I don&apos;t know where to start! What&apos;s the most important aspect of the celebration?

There is a wonderful red pork recipe in Complete Chinese Cook book - which, I think, is exactly what you are looking for. Happy New Year to you too. livingstonia asks The other day I used a ready made black bean sauce to make a rather disappointing beef with peppers and black bean sauce. Turned out the sauce only had 5% beans in it! Have you got a recipe to make this sauce from scratch? Ken Hom responds: @livingstonia - The ideal is to rinse them before use to reduce the salt - and don&apos;t use too many. Ideally they should be coarsely chopped and mixed with garlic and ginger. I hope that helps. Best wishes, Ken Paul A Smith asks Ken is there a healthier way to enjoy fried rice? Ken Hom responds: @Paul A Smith - Morning Paul, yes there is a way to enjoy fried rice. I recommend cutting down the amount of oil that you are use and make sure you stir fry in a good non stick wok. Elizabeth Neal asks Hi Ken, I really enjoyed your recent series, so inspiring!My (half-chinese) boyfriend will be seeing the New Year in by serving a steamboat to some foodie friends. Any tips for making it extra special? Thanks  Ken Hom responds: @Elizabeth Neal - Be sure to use a really dense flavourful broth. Have a great New Year celebration and if you want some tips on traditions please visit my website miranda07 asks I would love to make my own version of char siu marinade for pork rather than buying char siu &apos;paste&apos; - could you please suggest what ingredients would be best to use? @miranda07 - Morning,I have a complete recipe for this in my Complete Chinese Cook book which doesn&apos;t us any artificial ingredients. I think you will enjoy this and it is easy to follow. LaCoccinelle asks I live in sw France an hour south of Chaors and of course, it&apos;s duck country. I like the duck breast in the UK served quite simply with rice in a sauce. Do you have a recipe for that, or a favourite recipe for duck which you made when you lived here. I make your tomato, lemon grass &amp; coconut milk soup and even won a prize (large white soup tureen) with it at a local soup making competition, so thanks for that. Also regularly make a variation on a recipe of yours from Hot Wok, called Thai Chicken, I add mange tout and small new potatoes, and sometimes make it with butternut squash, chick peas and mange tout. Ken Hom responds: @LaCoccinelle - Duck is wonderful sliced and marinated in soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil and corn flour. Stir fry that with onion and oyster sauce for a simple and delicious meal. Congratulations on winning the competition - glad I could help. Enjoy your Chinese New Year. MisterA asks Ken, UK Cuisine has lots of trends and crazes, what are the latest trends in Chinese cuisine and how do you see it evolving? Ken Hom responds: @MisterA - There is more emphasis on regional dishes and even some Chinese molecular cooking, I&apos;m not so keen on this myself though. Hermann asks Question for Ken: I am trying to eat well now - the food has to be tasty but healthy too. I like the look of your salmon and spring onion recipe - it will get a whirl tonight. But is there any such thing as a low-fat duck recipe? Ken Hom responds: @Hermann - If you take off the skin duck can be quite lean so give it a whirl. KenHom says Thank you so much everyone for your questions. It&apos;s been a great morning. I hope you all have a wonderful Year of the Snake. Happy New Year.

The average Big Apple resident can now expect to make it to the ripe old age of 80.6 years \u2013 eight years more than in 1990. No other US city has seen such a leap. Why the spike? The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which conducted the research, is reluctant to draw explicit conclusions. For one, the population of New York isn&apos;t the same today as in 1990 given the millions of migrants that come and go every year. And back in 1990, high levels of HIV/AIDS and murders were skewing the city&apos;s mortality figures. That said, most deaths (87%) are caused by non-communicable diseases \u2013 cancer, heart disease, strokes, diabetes and the like \u2013 and it&apos;s reductions in these that most clearly explain New Yorkers living longer lives. Deaths from heart disease, for instance, are down a whopping 25% from a decade ago. Mounting evidence For Johanna Ralston, chief executive of the World Heart Federation (WHF), the example of New York provides a stellar case of &quot;retrofitting&quot; a city to make it more heart-healthy. She points to numerous public health interventions introduced under Mayor Michael Bloomberg: a ban on smoking in public places, new bicycle routes, calorie labels on restaurant menus, advertising campaigns around the benefits of taking exercise, to name just a few. &quot;This all helps build the body of evidence about what an important platform cities can be&quot;, she states. Ralston is right to be enthused. This time last year, WHF released a report highlighting the link between urbanisation and cardiovascular disease. The report spelt out a five-step approach based on mitigating risks, such as exposure to tobacco and poor diets, and increasing preventative measures, such as taking exercise and educating children about healthy living. Since the report&apos;s publication, more evidence has come to light. A recent study by the London School of Economics finds that people are likely to live longer in cities like Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong, where public transport and walking are favoured over private car use. Furthermore, differences of life expectancy can be found within cities too. West Londoners, for example, are likely to live seven years longer than their East London counterparts. The findings suggest urban form is a &quot;contributing factor&quot; to human health, says Ricky Burdett, director of the LSE Cities programme: &quot;One can begin at least to speculate that these correlations are not just to do with where people of different education or income come from, but that their physical conditions will affect their wellbeing and health.&quot; City planning Policy makers are increasingly beginning to take note. Susan Thompson, who heads the Healthy Built Environment Programme at the University of New South Wales, points to a &quot;groundswell of interest&quot; among planners and health officials in recent years. She points to explicit health and wellbeing provision in the city plans of metropolitan centres such as Portland, USA, and Vancouver, Canada, as well as London. One of the big advances over the past 12 months is the uptake of cardiovascular health in key policy circles. The World Health Organisation, for instance, is dedicating this year&apos;s World Health Day to the issue of hypertension, a major cause of heart-related illness. The Clinton Global Initiative is also pushing for many of the World Heart Federation&apos;s recommendations to be adopted. The reconstruction of New York after Hurricane Sandy marks a prime opportunity. In a similar vein, advocates of cardiovascular health succeeded in including specific language around chronic non-communicable diseases in the Rio +20 summit last summer. The WHF is currently preparing a document for the UN secretary general that calls for cardiovascular health to be factored into the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. &quot;The place where sustainable development and health merge most elegantly is the development of cities and addressing urbanisation&quot;, Ralston says. The big challenge centres on applying this thinking in the mega-cities of the developing world, where unregulated urban growth is driving up heart problems at unprecedented rates. As Ralston notes: &quot;You can sit back and say, &apos;Gee, aren&apos;t organic gardens great. But, guess what? They don&apos;t have them in Shenzhen. They just have 18 million people who weren&apos;t there 30 years ago.&quot; Mumbai, Mexico City, Lagos or any number of other examples would fit just as well. Employers&apos; responsibility What can the private sector be doing? House builders, infrastructure providers and architects are clearly best placed to take direct action in how our cities are designed. More joined-up thinking is required, says Martin Hunt, head of networks and partnerships for Forum for the Future. Take London, he says. The UK capital is currently suffering a housing shortage. &quot;We want to build homes, but we want to build them in the right way. That requires green space, the ability to exercise and move around freely and safely, and being in an environment that&apos;s well-lit, car-free and with good access to public transport&quot;, he states. Heart-healthy cities depend not just on urban design, of course. You can have green corridors linking parks, or calorie-marked menus, but individual residents still need to don their running shoes or opt for the low-fat option. Companies, especially those with large workforces, can play an active role here, says Jenny Hawker, a health management expert at UK consultancy Mercer. Sports clubs, wellness programmes, flexible working options and bike-to-work schemes are just some of the initiatives responsible employers might consider. As public health budgets tighten, the private sector can expect more pressure from government to promote cardiovascular health, Hawker adds: &quot;You can&apos;t exclude the employer in all this. They do have responsibility because they are part of the city environment.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Western consumers and businesses have too much private debt, with Japan serving as an awesome warning of how that can drag an economy down for decades. There is a lot of hand-wringing over why regulation was so light-touch and why bankers were allowed to get away with so much. But those were the mistakes of a bygone world; the big question we face now is what to do next. Last week, the governor-designate of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, and a man who was once a rival for the job, Adair Turner, both argued with one eye on Japan, where I have just spent an intriguing week, that it is time to open a debate about inflation. At the very least, declared Carney, we need to be very flexible about how inflation targets are met, keeping a weather eye on what is happening to growth and employment. In a formidable speech, Turner went even further. The unthinkable \u2013 printing money to finance government deficits \u2013 should no longer be unthinkable, he argued. It should be one available policy tool, a way of countering deflation. In many respects, Britain&apos;s situation is even worse than Japan&apos;s in 1990 when its lost decades began. Our stock of private debt is much higher proportionally; our banks are in much worse shape; our productivity is disastrously low and falling. What&apos;s more, our loss of share of world export markets is the worst in the G20. Incomes per head are set to stagnate for 10 years, the worst in modern times. Our government, unlike the Japanese, is mulishly opposed to increasing public debt to compensate for the private sector trying to reduce its debt. All that has stood between Britain and a Japanese-scale debacle is that at least the Bank of England has been obliged to keep inflation up rather than watch prices fall and it has been moderately imaginative about how it has done so. Nonetheless, it is crystal clear that it could, and should, have done more. In Japan, I was simultaneously aware of what a toll two decades of deflation had levied on Japanese society, but also of the compensatory force of Japan&apos;s underlying economic strength. But gloom and pessimism still suffuse the country. Hiromasa Yonekura, the president of the Keidanren, Japan&apos;s all-powerful employers&apos; association, told me that this lack of confidence, in his view unjustified, had become hard-wired into Japan&apos;s culture by falling prices. It affected even the birth rate and was the chief cause of Japan&apos;s rapidly ageing society. Nor is the birth rate the only sign of a society in stress. Young women&apos;s role in Japanese society is being knocked back by the fashion for coquettishness and cartoon-style prettiness, complete with singsong voices and contrived ways of walking. It is a return to suffocating traditionalism masked as fashionable faddishness. A society worried about its future becomes socially regressive. Yet Japan&apos;s capacity to resist the malign element of deflation is very much greater than our own. It is still the third biggest economy in the world, with some fabulous companies possessing frontier technology, and going global rapidly. Hiroaki Nakanishi, the president of Hitachi, having just bought Horizon Nuclear Power from the Germans and aiming to build nuclear power stations in Britain, was worried that Britain was retreating from our global vocation. Tell your prime minister, he said, that Hitachi would consider it a disaster if Britain withdrew from the EU. I promised him that if the opportunity arose I would. But Hitachi&apos;s commitment to frontier engineering is only one example; others are rail company Japan Central&apos;s investment in the Maglev train, which travels at over 300mph, and textile expert Toray&apos;s commitment to new carbon materials that are many times stronger than anything known to man. Japan is engaging in investment and innovation across the board and on a scale Britain can only dream of. Time after time, as I questioned company leaders about their capacity to do this, I was referred to Japan&apos;s &quot;public interest&quot; or &quot;stakeholder&quot; capitalism \u2013 committed long-term ownership, partnership with the state to drive research forward and corporate leaderships keen to find commercial responses to the giant economic and social problems of our time. It is a world foreign to our own of shareholder value maximisation and gigantic personal bonuses, where interest in social problems is seen as &quot;anti-business&quot;. This dynamism refuses to be submerged by debt deflation; Yonekura pointed out that, while New York had built 20 skyscrapers in the last decade, Tokyo had built 50. But to unleash this dynamism, Japan has had to break out of its monetary and financial trap. The newly elected government has gone some of the way, proposing a huge Keynesian stimulus and lifting the inflation target to 2%. But, as Turner argued, Japan&apos;s stock of public debt is now even more suffocating than private debt. Japan must go further: turn it from onerous debt into free cash by in effect printing money. Done right, this would not create inflation but steady the economy. There is an intense private battle raging between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan. Either the bank starts monetising public debt, as Turner argues, or the Ministry of Finance will launch another unthinkable, unilateral reduction of Japan&apos;s public debt burden by demanding borrowers accept worse repayment terms. Plans are being laid for a managed default unless the Bank of Japan prints money. This is what happens when societies face impossible demands. To sustain the social fabric, investment and innovation, governments have to do non-conservative things \u2013 reframe their capitalism and break conservative financial rules. Japan is now ready to do this, the Liberal Democrat party feeling that too much is at stake not to act. Carney and Turner are pointing the way in Britain. But there is a limit to what a central bank can do by itself. What is becoming clearer by the month is that every Tory maxim \u2013 leaving the EU, belief in smaller government, a hands-off approach to capitalism, junking the welfare state \u2013 is 100% wrong. Britain needs to learn from Japan. We don&apos;t need just a radicalisation of monetary policy \u2013 we need to recast, from top to bottom, how our companies are owned, financed and managed. Otherwise, we face an economic and social calamity. The final shredding of Toryism before brutal economic truths will signal the rebirth of the British economy."}, {"sentences": ["And then one day, when you are sitting in a plush Tokyo hotel room, the call will come with the offer of a support slot on U2&apos;s US tour."], "tags": ["Autobiography and memoir", "Tracey Thorn", "Books", "Electronic music", "Pop and rock", "Biography", "Culture", "Music"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-10T08:00:01Z", "title": "Bedsit Disco Queen by Tracey Thorn \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/10/bedsit-disco-queen-thorn-review", "article": "It is a truism that being in a band is both cool and exciting.

If you are Tracey Thorn \u2013 ex-Marine Girl, the girl in Everything But the Girl, an amber-via-velvet vocalist who sang Massive Attack&apos;s Protection, and the writer of 1995&apos;s club-pop crossover hit, Missing \u2013 you will turn them down. Why? Because the sound levels on your biological clock are way up in the red. Fondly eye-rolling pop memoirs such as these are helped immeasurably when the person at the keyboard is as perspicacious and warm a writer as Thorn. Bedsit Disco Queen is that most satisfying thing \u2013 a book that pulls back the veil for fans with candour and humour, while charting a social history of UK pop with Zelig-like perspective. Pen pals with Morrissey, courted by Paul Weller, stopped on the school run by George Michael, EBTG&apos;s pop success and right-on punk roots meant that the band Thorn shared with her partner, Ben Watt, had a foot in many camps. They jetted around to European pop festivals when these weren&apos;t hip affairs but ghastly televised variety performances. They gathered gold discs but were complicit in an attempt to write a song by committee for the Labour party. In those years, EBTG&apos;s interview technique was spiky and ideological, which confused even those on their side. &quot;Sounding like Astrud Gilberto while coming on like Gang of Four was always going to be a problematic approach,&quot; Thorn now reflects wryly. Very much a creature of the British 80s, Thorn bridles at how that decade is lazily remembered in TV shorthand. It was not &quot;yuppies chugging champagne in City wine bars, toffs dancing around in puffball skirts to Duran Duran&quot;, but the miners, and Meat Is Murder, and benefit gigs for Nicaragua. Throughout, she reflects on the limits of her and Watt&apos;s ideological positions. But Bedsit Disco Queen is marvellously frivolous, too \u2013 Christian Louboutin patent wedges appear near the end \u2013 and emotional. Thorn spends an entire page wishing she had invented Twitter in 1987, so that EBTG could be spared the lonely misery of being caught between a highly critical label and a fanbase whose composition was a mystery. Thorn lays bare the process of being a successful creative as a push-me-pull-you of kismet, endless compromise, false starts, luck and Todd Terry remixes. As misfortune, and fortune, would have it, EBTG got dropped by their UK label, just before Terry&apos;s remix of Missing would tear up dancefloors all over the world. But this gave Thorn and Watt huge creative freedom, as well as money in their pockets. The truly rewarding passages are less about the band&apos;s chart positions (always lower than forecast), and more about Thorn herself, her suburban upbringing, her lyrics, her feminism, her postgraduate interests, and her relationship with Watt. The worldly jazzy boho to her 19-year-old girl-band veteran, Watt contracted a life-threatening illness in 1992, the subject of his own previous tome, Patient (1996). Thorn writes rivetingly about the anxious monotony of a carer&apos;s limbo, and, tentatively, about the love between them, with very little yuck factor. If 80s feminism decreed that the personal was political, then Thorn and Watt&apos;s situation complicated matters further: the musical was domestic, too. The bleep of hospital machines recurs again with the premature birth of Thorn and Watt&apos;s eldest twins. Stay-at-home motherhood suits Thorn down to the ground, and she retires from the music industry until one day the urge to sing, and record, returns \u2013 a\u00a0period glossed over, but summarised with warmth and candour. Her tale rips along, chatty, studded with song lyrics, diary entries, cuttings and snapshots (like the one of the cassette labelled &quot;Massive idea&quot; \u2013 the kernel of the track that would become Protection). But there is a writerly bent here, too, that befits a woman still half-contemplating a PhD on Anthony Powell&apos;s A Dance to the Music of Time. You can&apos;t fail to smile when someone describing the rivalries between teenage bands says: &quot;If at this point it all sounds a bit Enid Blyton, it was about to get a bit Irvine Welsh.&quot; Perhaps the fondest eye-roll of all here is the way Thorn attempts to reconcile &quot;pop star Trace&quot; (her sobriquet at Hull University) with her other job. When Thorn signed up, no one warned her, either, that one day, she might be pushing her youngest around Gap and Missing would come on the stereo. And that her youngest would point to the speaker and say &quot;Mummy!

And now, rubbish bins. Renew, a company co-founded in 2002 by chief executive Kaveh Memari, has developed a newspaper recycling bin which doubles as an open-air information screen. It has placed nearly 100 of the hi-tech bins around the City of London under a 21-year contract with the authority. The bins \u2013 or techno-pods as Memari refers to them \u2013 are made of damage-resistent fibreglass with screens at either end which can relay anything from news to advertisements to information on London underground delays or the number of Boris bikes available in the vicinity. A team of journalists provide the news feed, with other content coming from magazines such as the Economist and Time Out. A group of software developers \u2013 what Memari calls the Geek Squad \u2013 operate from Athens. The initial impetus for the bins came from the City of London authorities, with the capital littered with discarded free newspapers and Brussels putting pressure on for it missing recycling targets. Memari said: &quot;We de-risked it for the City, they don&apos;t pay for the service and the only risk for them is reputational [if things go wrong].&quot; The company had hoped to have 100 pods \u2013 200 screens \u2013 in place by the time of the Olympics, but that target slipped and was finally reached in November. But with the City getting the service for free, how does Renew propose to make money? Memari talks of several revenue streams: advertising, finding a major company to sponsor the pods, attracting publishers, talking to film studios, and even telecoms companies about using its wired connections to carry data services or conversations. &quot;We have killed the idea it&apos;s a grotty place for [advertisers and publishers] to put their messages. We are also talking to seven major film studios and they are very interested in the possibilities.&quot; He believes studios could film special scenes to be shown on the screens, linked to major movies in what is effectively a viral marketing campaign. The pods can also be used for emergency messages, with one recent test showing an alert reaching the system just three minutes after being received at the control room. Now the pods are in place Renew has begun its real push to advertisers and media, with marketing campaigns under way for a number of businesses including CNBC, Qatari Islamic Bank, and Wallpaper, as well as a couple of charities which have been given free or heavily discounted airtime. Renew has raised \u00a34m in total from investors so far, mainly high net-worth individuals including one Premier League and England footballer. It has run up \u00a33m of debt, but received financing to help with the rollout of the pods from the Qatari Investment Authority. &quot;We went to all the high street banks, but nothing,&quot; said Memari. &quot;Perhaps they thought the risk was too great. The Qataris looked at it as a real estate investment, much the same way they looked at the Shard and Harrods.&quot; It will need further funds as it expands overseas. It has one pod situated near Wall Street in New York, is looking at a trial of 100 units in the City, and may need to raise another \u00a35m if this succeeds.

The test, which took place in the north-east of the country just before noon local time, could bring North Korea a step closer to developing a nuclear warhead small enough to be mounted on a long-range missile and possibly bringing the west coast of the US within striking distance. The authorities in Pyongyang said scientists had set off a &quot;miniaturised&quot; nuclear device with a greater explosive force than those used in two previous nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009. &quot;It was confirmed that the nuclear test that was carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturised and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously did not pose any negative impact on the surrounding ecological environment,&quot; KCNA, the North&apos;s official news agency, announced. The agency said the test had been in response to &quot;outrageous&quot; US hostility that &quot;violently&quot; undermined the regime&apos;s right to peacefully launch satellites \u2013 a reference to the condemnation and tighter sanctions that greeted Pyongyang&apos;s successful rocket launch almost two months ago. Tuesday&apos;s test was quickly condemned by the UN general secretary, Ban Ki-moon, who said it was &quot;deplorable&quot; that Pyongyang had defied international calls to abandon it, adding that it was a &quot;clear and grave violation of the relevant UN security council resolutions&quot;. Barack Obama said the test was a highly provocative act that violated security council resolutions and posed a threat to US and international security. The US president called for &quot;further swift and credible action by the international community&quot; against North Korea. China, once North Korea&apos;s closest ally, said it strongly opposed the test and warned North Korea to avoid any actions that could worsen the situation on the Korean peninsula. &quot;The Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea, heedless of widespread international opposition, has again carried out a nuclear test, to which the Chinese government expresses its firm opposition,&quot; the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. &quot;It is China&apos;s firm stance to realise non-nuclearisation for the Korean peninsula and prevent nuclear proliferation and maintain peace and stability in northeast Asia,&quot; the statement said. Russia&apos;s foreign ministry said the Kremlin &quot;decisively condemned&quot; the test. William Hague, the UK foreign secretary, joined the international chorus of condemnation and warned that North Korea faced further isolation if it did not stop developing its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities.   View Larger Map   Officials in South Korea, Japan and the US had earlier announced they were almost certain a controlled nuclear explosion had taken place at or near the site where the North&apos;s two previous tests were conducted. Diplomats said the UN security council was convening an emergency meeting in response, although with so many sanctions already in place against the regime following precious nuclear tests and rocket launches it is not clear what options remain open to the international community. Any push for a fresh round of sanctions could take weeks and come up against opposition from China, the North&apos;s only remaining ally and its biggest aid donor. Beijing had not commented on the test by mid-afternoon local time but had reportedly called on its neighbour not to go through with it. The US, South Korea, Japan and European nations are expected to call anyway for a fresh round of sanctions against the North for defying previous security council resolutions banning it from testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology. A UN body that monitors nuclear tests said earlier it had detected an &quot;unusual seismic event&quot; in North Korea. &quot;The event shows clear explosion-like characteristics and its location is roughly congruent with the 2006 and 2009 [North Korea] nuclear tests,&quot; said Tibor Toth, the executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation in Vienna. The agency said it constituted &quot;a clear threat to international peace and security, and challenges efforts made to strengthen global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, in particular by ending nuclear testing&quot;. Seismic activity had been picked up by the US geological survey and monitoring stations in South Korea. It appeared to be a more powerful blast than the North&apos;s two previous tests. Experts in South Korea, the US and Japan put the quake at magnitudes of between 4.7 and 5.2. Earthquakes of magnitude 3.9 and 4.5 respectively were detected in the North&apos;s 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. The US geological survey said Tuesday&apos;s seismic activity had been of magnitude 4.9. Yosuke Igarashi, an official at the Japan Meteorological Agency, said: &quot;A natural earthquake normally starts with a smaller tremor followed by a larger one. This quake&apos;s strength was the same throughout.&quot; The South Korean government raised its military alert level, while Japan was preparing to dispatch military aircraft to look for signs of atmospheric radiation. In Tokyo, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, called an emergency meeting of his security council to discuss Japan&apos;s response. &quot;I have ordered that we consider every possible way to address this issue, including our own sanctions, while co-operating with other countries,&quot; he said after the meeting. Tensions have been running high in the region since North Korea threatened to conduct a nuclear test in protest at fresh UN sanctions imposed after the regime successfully launched a satellite into orbit in mid-December. The North again raised the diplomatic stakes when its most powerful military body, the National Defence Commission, warned that its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes were targeted at the US. Any progress the North makes in its missile and nuclear programmes is a cause for concern, although it is thought to be some way off having the ability to produce a nuclear warhead small enough to mount on a reliable long-range missile. North Korea has enough plutonium to build between four and eight nuclear weapons, according to Siegfried Hecker, a nuclear scientist who visited the country&apos;s main Yongbyon nuclear complex in 2010. Other reports suggest the country has enough fissile material for about a dozen plutonium warheads. In 2009, the regime said it would begin enriching uranium, giving it another means of building a nuclear arsenal. Speculation had been mounting that this third test could involve a uranium device \u2013 a clear signal that North Korea&apos;s scientists have mastered the ability to produce highly enriched uranium. In October 2012, a spokesman from the North&apos;s national defence commission told state media the country had built a missile capable of striking the US but did not provide further details. A missile featured in an April 2012 military parade appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile but its authenticity has not been verified by foreign experts. Daniel Pinkston of the International Crisis Group in Seoul said: &quot;The question is whether things could spiral. I agree there should be some costs and consequences, but as far as believing the consequences should deter them \u2013 I think that&apos;s wishful thinking. &quot;The [North Koreans] view the world as hostile and menacing; and if even China is hostile, then even more so. Other people might think OK, they will be more cautious and have second thoughts because even China will take action. But from their point of view it reaffirms why they need [a nuclear programme]. When the world is like this, do you not want to be a nuclear power?&quot; Analysts said the test, like the previous two, was designed to strengthen the North&apos;s bargaining position as the US, South Korea, Russia, China and Japan attempt to restart talks on Pyongyang&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. Dr Leonid Petrov, a North Korea expert at the Australian National University, said it would bolster the North&apos;s case for describing itself as a genuine nuclear state. &quot;Obviously the [North Koreans] are not going to bargain and are not going to give up the nuclear options,&quot; Petrov said. &quot;We have passed already the point of no return: North Korea is de facto a nuclear state, all we can do is minimise the damage.&quot; Petrov suggested the North might be willing to freeze its civilian nuclear programme if given sufficient incentives, such as the loosening of international sanctions. It would also need assurances, particularly from the US, that it would not be the target of attempts at regime change or military strikes. The only alternative, he said, was a pre-emptive strike that could miss many of the country&apos;s underground nuclear sites and raise the dangerous prospect of a counter-attack. Petrov said the North&apos;s determination to push ahead with its nuclear programme was a failure of diplomacy that began with the administration of George Bush, who described the country as part of an &quot;axis of evil&quot; when Washington adopted a tougher stance in 2002. &quot;The world is now a much more dangerous place,&quot; Petrov said. &quot;It&apos;s very sad.&quot; Kim Min-seok, a South Korean defence ministry spokesman, said the North had informed China and the US in advance of its intention to conduct the test but could not say when the message was relayed. Petrov said that, if true, the decision to inform other nations in advance was a marked change in the regime&apos;s approach under its leader, Kim Jong-un, who has been in power just over a year. Kim has shown no sign of ditching the nuclear ambitions of his father, Kim Jong-il, but has been more open than the country&apos;s former leader about his regime&apos;s intentions, having also given notice of its recent satellite launch using a ballistic rocket. \u2022 Read the latest developments on this story here"}, {"sentences": ["Earlier on Tuesday, the IOC&apos;s executive board recommended wrestling to be removed from the 2020 Games, which will be held in either Istanbul, Tokyo or Madrid."], "tags": ["Iran", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Sport", "Olympics 2012: wrestling", "Wrestling", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-12T14:34:15Z", "title": "Iran dismayed at proposal to drop wrestling from Olympic Games", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/feb/12/wrestling-dropped-olympic-games-iran-reaction", "article": "Iranians are dismayed at the International Olympic Committee&apos;s proposal to drop wrestling form the 2020 Olympic Games. Earlier on Tuesday, the IOC&apos;s executive board recommended wrestling to be removed from the 2020 Games, which will be held in either Istanbul, Tokyo or Madrid.  But in Iran, where wrestling has a significant following, the ruling committee&apos;s decision has taken many by surprise and shock, prompting the head of the country&apos;s national Olympic committee to say he would lobby against it. &quot;This will be a huge blow to our country&apos;s sports,&quot; Mohammad Ali-Abadi, the head of the Iranian national Olympic committee, said, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. &quot;Wrestling is one of our country&apos;s most popular and dominant sports,&quot; he said, adding that he would pursue Iran&apos;s objection to the decision with the IOC. In the 2012 London Games, Iran came third in the wrestling medal table after Russia and Japan, with three golds, one silver and two bronzes. More than half of Iran&apos;s 60 medals in the history of Olympic games are from wrestling and taekwondo.  Thanks to Iran&apos;s good performance in wrestling, the country was the 17th in the total medal count of the London games, which marked the most successful Olympics ever for Iran.  But if the IOC endorses the ruling committee&apos;s decision in September in Buenos Aires, Iranians will have to invest on a different sport.  &quot;This is not the end of the process, this is purely a recommendation,&quot; the IOC spokesman, Mark Adams, said after the board&apos;s vote. &quot;It is the session which is sovereign.&quot; There were also reactions on Twitter:  This is a big blow for #Iran: Wrestling dropped from Olympics bbc.in/WGxgfa #fb \u2014 Al Garman (@AlGarman) February 12, 2013  and:  Wrestling may be cut from Olympics...but 6 of Iran&apos;s 12 medals from the London Games were in wrestling.

Amid concerns that recent measures by Japan to reduce the value of the yen could escalate into tit-for-tat measures, the G7 said exchange rates should be set by market forces, not deliberately manipulated. The joint statement from G7 finance ministers and central bank governors reaffirmed the &quot;longstanding commitment to market determined exchange rates&quot; and pledged to &quot;consult closely in regard to actions in foreign exchange markets&quot;. It added: &quot;We reaffirm that our fiscal and monetary policies have been and will remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that we will not target exchange rates. We are agreed that excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will continue to consult closely on exchange markets and cooperate as appropriate.&quot; G7 sources said the statement had been aimed squarely at Japan, although Tokyo insisted it had backing from the US, Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy to continue taking measures to reflate its economy. These have included the announcement of additional quantitative easing (QE) and fresh fiscal stimulus, which have led to a sharp fall in the yen. Japan&apos;s finance minister, Taro Aso, told reporters that the G7 had recognised its steps to beat deflation were not aimed at affecting foreign exchange markets. Weak growth across the developed world since the deep global downturn of 2008-09 has prompted central banks to use so-called &quot;unconventional measures&quot; to boost growth. These have included creating electronic money through QE, which effectively drives down the value of currencies. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&apos;s newgovernment in Japan aims to ease pressure on Japan&apos;s exporters by reducing the value of the yen. Chris Turner, head of foreign exchange strategy at ING Bank said: &quot;We doubt this statement will be enough to alter the core trend of yen weakness seen since November. &quot;The G7 has not expressed displeasure with the move, that is, \u2026 it could have described recent FX foreign exchange moves as &apos;disorderly&apos;, which would have threatened FX intervention. &quot;As far as we can make out, we believe today&apos;s statement is primarily aimed at Japan and discourages Tokyo from talking the yen lower. &quot;Abe was voted into power on a ticket of beating deflation and weakening the yen. With Washington having set the bar low for massive monetary expansion and currency weakness, clearly it is difficult for it to preach to Tokyo. And we very much doubt this G7 agreement has any bearing on Tokyo&apos;s domestic policy of aggressive Bank of Japan balance sheet growth and inflation targeting. In effect, the message of this brief statement is that &apos;it&apos;s fine to devalue, but just don&apos;t talk about it&apos;.&quot; Trevor Greetham, Director of Asset Allocation at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: &quot;The G7 ministers put out a statement today arguing against unilateral FX intervention and explicit exchange rate targets. On one level, this is a slap on the wrist to Japanese ministers talking about specific levels but it allows them to carry on with policies aimed at creating domestic inflation. You could argue the clear foreign exchange manipulators out there are the Swiss, with the Swiss National Bank&apos;s Thomas Jordan saying today that the swiss franc&apos;s 1.20 cap against the euro is still in place, the franc will weaken further and they stand ready to take further measures.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;And we have yet to travel to Europe, South America, Japan, anywhere outside of [the] basic 50 cities in the United States.&quot; The band will actually be playing in Tokyo and Osaka this June, but from what Roth has said, Eddie van Halen took a lot of convincing and a fair share of drama."], "tags": ["Van Halen", "Music", "Metal", "Pop and rock", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-13T11:16:47Z", "title": "David Lee Roth tells Van Halen: can we please play somewhere new?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/13/david-lee-roth-van-halen", "article": "It&apos;s been six years since David Lee Roth reunited with Van Halen \u2013 and he&apos;s had enough of simply playing old songs around the arenas of North America. &quot;How long have I been back with the gang?

From Iraq to Afghanistan, via Mali and Algeria, commentators have long argued that we are witness to a clash of civilisations. But in the Philippines, the story is very different. After 40 years of revolutionary struggle over land, resources and religion that has claimed 120,000 lives and displaced more than 2 million people, a hardline Islamist rebel movement is slowly but surely coming in from the cold in the lawless south. Inspired in part by the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland, and encouraged by a reformist presidency in Manila, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) has broken with al-Qaida-linked regional terrorist groups blamed for the Bali nightclub bombings and cast its lot for peace. In a historic break with the past, Benigno Aquino, the Philippines president, visited the MILF stronghold in Mindanao earlier this week to meet rebel leaders and launch a new joint development programme to underwrite the peace process.     President Benigno Aquino, right, shares sweets with rebel leader Murad Ebrahim.    Aquino said the government and MILF leaders were within weeks of finalising agreement on a joint transition commission, chaired by the rebels, that will oversee the creation of a new, self-governing Muslim political and geographical entity, the Bangsamoro \u2013 literally, the land of the Moro (derived from Moors, the name given to Mindanao&apos;s indigenous peoples by Spanish colonialists). &quot;I think we&apos;re very, very close to agreements on all points,&quot; he said. If all goes to plan in the Malaysian-mediated talks and if a new basic law produced by the commission is ratified by the Philippines congress, the Bangsamoro state within a state will come into formal existence by 2016, when Aquino, a passionate advocate of the peace process, is due to step down. &quot;When you look at the confrontations with Islamists in Mali, in Afghanistan, in Syria, and you see what&apos;s happening in Mindanao, it&apos;s a marvellous example of what can be done when you really want,&quot; a western analyst said. &quot;We are almost there on the outstanding issues, we can say we feel guarded optimism,&quot; said Jun Mantawil, head of the MILF secretariat and a member of the front&apos;s negotiating team, in an interview in Cotabato City, in western Mindanao. &quot;There is a big signing ceremony in prospect when the agreement is finalised. We&apos;re confident the president can get it through congress.&quot; Teresita &quot;Ging&quot; Quintos Deles, presidential adviser on the peace process, and Miriam Coronel Ferrer, chair of the government&apos;s negotiating panel, interviewed in Manila, agreed there was a sound basis for optimism. &quot;The road map on the table is real. I don&apos;t get a sense that it will break down now. The annexes [to last October&apos;s framework agreement] will be completed by March at the latest,&quot; Deles said. The transition commission would probably be unveiled this month. But Deles warned against over-inflated expectations. &quot;We are engaged in a race against time. There is a limited window, and this has been transmitted to [the MILF]. The president has always said his capacity to deliver has a limited shelf life \u2026 the MILF can choose to go for a perfect agreement, or to go for a more limited package that you can be sure will be delivered,&quot; she said. Issues under discussion include territory, power-sharing, wealth-sharing, and normalisation, including demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration. Mantawil, the MILF negotiator, said there were &quot;sticking points&quot; over the extent of the maritime area the new Bangsamoro authority would control, and over future revenues from supposedly vast but so far unquantified oil and gas fields that lie beneath the inland Liguasan marsh and off the Sulu archipelago, to the west of Mindanao island. A 2006 cable from the US embassy in Manila, published by WikiLeaks, suggested the energy and mineral resources in MILF-controlled areas of Mindanao could be worth up to $1tn. Unconfirmed reports circulating in 2011, when Aquino kickstarted the peace process with a breakthrough meeting with the MILF chair, Murad Ibrahim, in Tokyo, claimed Washington was pushing Manila for a peace deal in order to open up the area for energy exploitation. What to do with the MILF&apos;s estimated 12,000 armed fighters is another vexed issue. The framework accord calls for the creation of an impartial civilian &quot;police force for the Bangsamoro&quot;, the decommissioning of MILF cadres, and a handover of responsibility for security from the Philippines army to the new police force. International support will be sought to assist &quot;combatant and noncombatant&quot; rebel elements to return to normal life, it says. The negotiators&apos; approach to policing and decommissioning was influenced by the British experience in Northern Ireland, Deles said. In an echo of the Good Friday agreement, the MILF has undertaken to put its weapons &quot;beyond use&quot;. Britain is a member of an international contact group promoting a peace deal, along with Japan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. In his interview with the Guardian, Mantawil said he had visited London, Belfast and Dublin to study the peace process there. &quot;It is a very similar situation to us [in Northern Ireland],&quot; he said. &quot;It was very encouraging for us. The Good Friday agreement is a bit of a model \u2026 decommissioning [of weapons] is very difficult to manage. In Northern Ireland they had a commission. Maybe we should, too.&quot;     Teresita Deles meets with Indonesian soldiers and conflict resolution experts. The presidential adviser has become known for her inclusive approach. Photograph: Aaron Favila/AP    A recent report by the independent International Crisis Group struck a cautionary note. &quot;The pact suggests fighters will help maintain peace and order while decommissioning is under way. But sceptics note there are plenty of thugs under the organisation&apos;s umbrella who should not be allowed to play any kind of policing role, formally or informally. The MILF understands these concerns \u2026&quot; Mantawil said the MILF had severed its ties with Abu Sayyaf, an al-Qaida affiliate active in the lawless Sulu archipelago that has a history of seizing western hostages for ransom, or else beheading them. Clashes last week between a MILF splinter group and Abu Sayyaf fighters in Jolo reportedly left 30 people dead. The MILF leader also distanced his organisation from Jemaah Islamiyah, the south-east Asian jihadist terror group that bombed Bali in 2002 and has launched attacks in Jakarta. &quot;These people do not believe in peace. They are dissidents. We broke with them when they turned to terrorism. They are not one of us,&quot; Mantawil said. The prospective end to violence in Mindanao has inspired civil society organisations to launch an urgent drive to shape the peace, with the emphasis on raising living standards in the Philippines&apos; most impoverished and economically deprived region and on ensuring equal rights for women. The international aid agency Oxfam has developed partnerships with local organisations to improve access to basic education and boost awareness of the peace process and indigenous people&apos;s rights. Known as the Oxfam Mindanao programme (OMP), the scheme is &quot;designed to achieve sustainable livelihoods and greater protection for the Lumad [non-Muslim indigenous tribes], Moro, [and] small asset-holders&quot;. The OMP, due to run until 2014, has disbursed \u00a33m to date. Oxfam is also supporting a coalition of groups intent on securing open and transparent governance. Aid workers said the prospect of a self-governing, semi-autonomous Bangsamoro, replacing the failed autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao set up by government fiat in the 1980s, has received a broad welcome. But they warn it could work to the disadvantage of some groups, especially women. The MILF says, for example, that it plans to extend the use of sharia law. What that will mean in practice is as yet unclear. In the Moro village of Macasampen, outside Cotabato City, Oxfam is backing a local group, known as UnYPhil (United Youth of the Philippines \u2013 Women) whose main aim is to provide assistance to women subjected to violence, sexual and physical abuse, or discrimination. Anna Bai, a UnYPhil activist, said the villagers had suffered greatly during the war between government troops and the MILF. &quot;Sometimes gunfights would force us to leave the village several times a day. We were frightened and didn&apos;t know where to go. We didn&apos;t know whether we&apos;d be alive the next day. The children were badly affected. They didn&apos;t want to go to school. Now they are frightened of loud noises. They have a phobia.&quot; Bai said most people in the village supported the Bangsamoro plan but admitted they did not know much about it. &quot;We don&apos;t have a copy of the agreement. We listen to what the government and the MILF say.&quot; On the question of equal rights, &quot;each woman should have her own livelihood that is protected&quot;, Bai said. But a continuing sense of insecurity meant many women were still &quot;a bit afraid&quot; to go to the fields and forests to work. Another villager, Aida Manpli, said her biggest worry was lack of money, a challenge common to most rural families. &quot;I am a housewife,&quot; she said. &quot;I take care of my four children. I want them to go to college. My eldest is 17. She wants to be a midwife. But I am telling her we probably can&apos;t afford it because my husband is a farmer.&quot; Deles said increased government spending on infrastructure and social and economic development, prioritising education, health and livelihoods, was central to the Bangsamoro road map. Some analysts predict that, if carefully managed, resource-rich Mindanao could one day become the industrial and agrarian powerhouse of the Philippines. &quot;There is big development potential but it must be done in such a way that we do not create new problems and the benefits are shared. We must go carefully,&quot; Deles said. Despite widely shared optimism about the future, many other obstacles to a lasting peace remain. They include possible opposition from Christian settler groups, a stalemate in congress after crucial national elections due in May, a falling off in Aquino&apos;s current, remarkable popularity, and further splintering of the MILF if quick results are not forthcoming. The island rulers of the Sulu archipelago, for example, are notoriously unbiddable. Difficulties may also arise if the MILF does not take full account of the views of Mindanao&apos;s non-Muslim indigenous peoples, or Lumad, also known as the Bangsa-Mamalu, some of whose tribal leaders are now straining administrative coherence by seeking autonomous status within the new semi-autonomous Bangsamoro. Although the MILF has promised an inclusive approach, Mantawil insisted the front would have sole charge of the proposed Bangasamoro transition authority prior to planned elections in 2015. &quot;Of course we must lead it. We fought for it for 40 years. We must have a clear majority,&quot; he said. Groups that opposed this were &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;. Asked about such demands, Deles exhibits a patient smile. &quot;If this process is to work, no elements of the Bangsamoro should feel they are being excluded,&quot; she said. After decades of military campaigning, &quot;the MILF needs to show they can now behave like a political organisation. &quot;Every bit of the government is doing its bit to find a solution.&quot; &quot;We cannot afford more damage to hope and confidence. We cannot afford not to have a happy ending.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["His surprise face-to-face meeting in Tokyo in 2011 with his chief opponent, Ibrahim Murad, leader of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), provided much needed momentum."], "tags": ["Philippines", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Indigenous peoples"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-13T14:56:21Z", "title": "Mindanao peace process has a lot to achieve within a tight time limit | Simon Tisdall", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/13/mindanao-peace-process-time-limit-philippines", "article": "That the peace process in Mindanao between the government and hardline Islamist terrorists has advanced as far as it has is owing to, in part, the personal commitment of Benigno Aquino, the Philippines president, officials and activists say. But his term ends in 2016. This time limit has become, in effect, a deadline for implementing a final settlement. Aquino, son of the former president, Corazon Aquino, tapped his personal popularity to revive talks that had flickered on and off for years, and had been punctuated by periods of extreme violence. His surprise face-to-face meeting in Tokyo in 2011 with his chief opponent, Ibrahim Murad, leader of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), provided much needed momentum. The president is said to view a peace deal with the Catholic Philippines&apos; much discriminated against southern Muslim minority as his key legacy. By pursuing a pragmatic, inclusive approach \u2013 Benigno Aquino insists nothing is agreed that cannot be delivered \u2013 he has so far avoided his mother&apos;s mistake. Her 1987 creation, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), was imposed from above and became a byword for inefficiency and corruption. Crucially, it did not stop the war. The new polity envisaged for the Muslim areas of central and western Mindanao, to be known as the Bangsamoro (land of the Moro), will have considerable autonomous powers, including raising taxes and a police force. It will be run by elected ministers operating on parliamentary lines, in contrast to Manila&apos;s presidential system. But whether the advent of the Bangsamoro can cement a lasting settlement remains an open question. Even assuming a basic law is agreed, the congress in Manila consents, the national constitution is amended, and the MILF honours its pledge to place combatants and weapons &quot;beyond use&quot;, numerous obstacles\u00a0remain. Perhaps the most formidable is under-development. Decades of conflict have impoverished Muslim areas. Poverty rates in the ARMM are 45.4%, nearly double the national average of 24.4%, according to the charity Oxfam. A massive infusion of funds is now required. Aquino is promising just that, and will unveil a big new sustainable investment programme during a visit to Mindanao this week. How to settle vexed land disputes over &quot;ancestral domain&quot;, how to decide exactly which areas or &quot;sultanates&quot; will be included in the Bangsamoro, and how best to manage and share Mindanao&apos;s significant energy and mineral resources are all issues the peace process is addressing but is unlikely fully to resolve. Non-Muslim indigenous peoples in Mindanao, known as the Lumad or Bangsa-Mamalu, and the Catholic settler population that moved there from Luzon in the early 20th century, worry that a new Muslim-led government will override their concerns. &quot;Our main wish is that we have peace in our area, because war leads to hunger. Also we would like a new road,&quot; says Rodel Miguel, head of remote Ranao Pilayan village, a Tenduray tribal settlement in Maguindanao province comprising avowed Pentecostalists. &quot;We have no choice, we have to support the [Bangsamoro] agreement. The MILF has promised they will not ignore our rights. Do we trust them? No, we don&apos;t!&quot; MILF splinter groups, armed cadres of the communist New People&apos;s Army who remain at war with the central government, and Islamist extremists holed up in the Sulu archipelago all pose potential threats to a lasting peace. So, too, does the bloody tradition of &quot;rido&quot;, meaning clan warfare and inter-communal vendettas. &quot;The lack of a political agreement encouraged local clans, family fiefdoms and strongmen to take power into their own hands,&quot; says Snehal Soneji, Oxfam&apos;s country director. &quot;The conflict was not ideological. It was about resources.&quot; These frictions may increase rather than decrease as peace takes hold and Mindanao&apos;s riches become more easily exploited. Guiamel Alim of ARMM Watch, an NGO in Davao City, predicts the mistakes associated with Muslim self-governance in the ARMM would be avoided. &quot;It will be better this time. Even when the political revolution is finished, the cultural revolution will continue. We want the Bangsamoro to be open to civil society participation,&quot; he says. But Alim admitted many aspects of the new arrangements were still up in the air. &quot;It&apos;s all still very risky \u2026 There is long-held prejudice against the Muslim population. This was taught by the Spanish and the Americans. &quot;I think it [the peace process] should lead to national reconciliation and unity. This is the last and the best chance for peace in Mindanao \u2026 But we have a long history of betrayal by Manila. They [the armed groups] won&apos;t be shouting if it fails. They will be shooting with their firearms!&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["He also revealed that the end of his international career was precipitated by his being discovered in bed with two Japanese girls shortly after a friendly defeat in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-15T11:56:34Z", "title": "The Joy of Six: peculiar reasons to give up football | Simon Burnton", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/feb/15/the-joy-of-six-peculiar-reasons-give-up-football", "article": "1) Sex There&apos;s nothing very funny about a profoundly talented footballer drinking, doping and shagging himself into premature irrelevance, but Sasa Curcic&apos;s flair for the totally outlandish somehow manages to make sniggering all but unavoidable.

But most memorable of all were the words with which he announced the end of his football career in 2001, after a brief spell at New York Metrostars (by all accounts he played very well, and was extremely popular with the fans, but still his employers requested that he either be reassigned to another club or released). &quot;I have given up football for sex,&quot; he said. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t sign for another club even if they gave me \u00a310m, but it would be different if they were to offer me 15 different women from across the world. I would tell the club chairman: &apos;Please let me make these women happy \u2013 I will satisfy them like they have never been satisfied.&apos; Nowadays, every time I think about football I feel like throwing up.&quot; Soon he was recanting, landing a short-term deal at Motherwell and insisting the story was &quot;a lot of rubbish&quot;. &quot;Those stories gave me more power for football because they made me want to train harder and play again,&quot; he said. Not very much more power, though \u2013 his career soon petered out, to the extent that he flunked a trial at Tranmere, and, though he was soon to return to England, it was to work as a barman in Soho. Curcic has enjoyed a reality-TV-inspired renaissance in his homeland, winning \u20ac50,000 in Serbian Celebrity Big Brother in 2007. Recent statements strongly suggest that reports of his sex-inspired resignation were closer to the truth than were his subsequent denials. &quot;At one point I had girlfriends in 24 different countries and it was great, but I don&apos;t run after every skirt \u2013 I am very picky,&quot; he said. In 2009 he upgraded even that estimate, insisting he &quot;currently [has] 10 or 15 girls in Belgrade&quot;. He also revealed that the end of his international career was precipitated by his being discovered in bed with two Japanese girls shortly after a friendly defeat in Tokyo. The clues were always there, though, from the time back in 1996 the Mirror told the story of spurned Bolton barmaid Esther Pratt, whose fling with the footballer ended when she found out that &quot;he had a model girlfriend back home&quot;, was &quot;seeing other women in Bolton&quot; and that &quot;he was the sort of bloke who always wanted a blonde on his arm&quot;. Curcic was an unlikely Casanova, not blessed with classic good looks even after the plastic surgery. As Lisa Aldred \u2013 whose marriage to Curcic gave the midfielder British nationality just as he was experiencing work permit issues, lasted only two years and was then investigated by the Home Office \u2013 once put it, with refreshing candour: &quot;Some of my friends couldn&apos;t understand why I&apos;d fallen for someone with such a big hooter.&quot; 2) God One day in 1968 a young footballer named Peter Knowles was sitting at home when there was a knock on the door. When he opened it, two Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses attempted to engage him in conversation. Rather than pretending he was in the middle of a terribly important telephone conversation, or the chip pan was liable to catch fire, or that he was the Queen&apos;s official guinea pig-handler and had absent-mindedly left the lid off the python tank, he decided to listen to what they had to say. &quot;I invited them in and said to this gentleman, who I&apos;d never met before: &apos;Why did my dad and two sisters \u2013 who&apos;d done nowt wrong \u2013 die?&apos; He answered that question,&quot; Knowles said in 2009. &quot;He then answered other questions which I&apos;d never had answered before. I listened to what they said and thought: &apos;Yes, that makes sense.&apos;&quot; The conversation was to change, and soon end, his career. By the beginning of the following season Knowles&apos;s change of focus was clear. &quot;I shall continue playing football for the time being but I have lost my ambition,&quot; he said. &quot;Though I still do my best on the field I need more time to learn about the Bible and may give up football.&quot; Still, he scored in the first three games of the new season, and many thought it likely that he would be in England&apos;s squad for the following summer&apos;s World Cup. But eight games into the season, after a 3-3 draw against Nottingham Forest in September 1969, he left Molineux for good. &quot;Five days in a week I am a Christian but when Saturday comes and I put on a football shirt, I am not a Christian,&quot; he explained. &quot;You have to be Christian every day.&quot; Wolves retained his registration until 1982, just in case he changed his mind. He wavered only once, before the end of 1969. &quot;I went back to Molineux for the first time to pick up my boots to start my new job as coach to local schoolboys,&quot; he explained at the time. &quot;Bill McGarry [the manager] called me into his office and pleaded with me to come back into the game. When I left his office I had begun to think of myself as a Wolves player again. My mind was pretty well made up that I would go back \u2026 When I got home and away from the Wolves atmosphere I began to have second thoughts. I realised at once that as soon as I set foot on the pitch in a Wolves shirt I would never be able to give up football again. I informed Mr McGarry the next day that I couldn&apos;t come back. I still love soccer \u2013 it has been my life \u2013 but I must never go back to the ground again, even to talk with McGarry.&quot; Knowles may have let an immense footballing talent go to waste, but he seems never to have regretted his decision. &quot;There hasn&apos;t been one day in 40 years where I have turned around and said to myself, my wife or my friends: &apos;I wish I hadn&apos;t packed up football,&apos;&quot; he told the Times in 2009, having spent the remainder of his working life working in a Marks &amp; Spencer warehouse. &quot;It&apos;s the best decision that I&apos;ve ever made. I&apos;m content with life \u2026 Basically I work, preach, read the Bible and go to Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses meetings. That&apos;s my life and I&apos;m dead chuffed with it.&quot; Precisely 30 years later something vaguely similar happened again, when the Real Mallorca and Argentina goalkeeper Carlos Roa turned in his gloves in favour of a life of piety. &quot;I asked God to give me the opportunity to play in the World Cup, and He gave it to me. I asked Him to have a chance to play in Europe, and He also gave it to me. I want to fulfil my promises to Him and to retire now,&quot; he said, announcing his decision. &quot;For the people of God and for those who respect His Word, this is a very special day, and soccer does not allow me to do what I must do on that day,&quot; he continued. &quot;One of the reasons I decided to leave was because in Spain we play most of our games on Sundays and that&apos;s the day God rested after creating the world. I am not at the moment becoming a priest of God, but a man of real faith. I am leaving one path and taking another.&quot; A year later he decided to come back to the old path again, only to discover that it \u2013 or rather he \u2013 was no longer any good. &quot;It was a very difficult decision for me to take when I was at the peak of my career, though I was convinced that I was doing the right thing for me and my family,&quot; Roa said last year. &quot;If you look at it in footballing terms it wasn&apos;t a good move: coming back later on wasn&apos;t easy at all. Even now I get people stopping me in the street and telling me I let them down, that I made them cry. But I wouldn&apos;t say that it was a bad decision in every way.&quot; 3) Cricket In November 2002 Rory Allen, then Portsmouth&apos;s record signing, was finally working his way to full fitness after a string of injuries and operations. And then, he was gone. &quot;He&apos;s just disappeared off the face of the earth,&quot; said Harry Redknapp, his bemused manager. He left one clue as to his whereabouts: a letter that said where he had gone. It was, all things considered, quite a good clue. He had gone to Australia to join the Barmy Army in supporting England&apos;s doomed battle for the Ashes. &quot;I&apos;ve no idea whether Rory has gone to Australia or not,&quot; Redknapp continued. &quot;When he said he was going to watch the Ashes I believed him because I know he&apos;s cricket-mad \u2013 he spends every summer watching all the Test matches on the box.&quot; &quot;I have never come across a situation like this during all my years in football,&quot; said Peter Storrie, Pompey&apos;s chief executive. &quot;To say the conduct is somewhat bewildering is an understatement.&quot; So, sadly, were England&apos;s performances in the Ashes, but Allen better enjoyed his next trip to Australia, when he witnessed England win the rugby World Cup in 2003. He explained the thinking behind his departure in an interview with the German magazine 11freunde in 2009, by which time he was employed at the Foreign Office. &quot;My contract had another year to run, but money isn&apos;t everything in life \u2013 happiness is more important,&quot; he said. &quot;I always wanted to travel the world and do something crazy \u2013 like all my friends who went to university. I&apos;ve never regretted hanging up my boots, not for one minute.&quot; Allen isn&apos;t the only person to give up football for cricket, although it is unusual that he was only watching his preferred sport, rather than playing it. Denis Compton, of Arsenal and England, may be the most celebrated case but perhaps cricket&apos;s greatest gain from footer was William Gunn, who won two caps for England, scoring one goal, before dedicating himself to willow-waving and becoming, in the words of WG Grace, &quot;beyond all doubt one of the greatest professional batsmen England has seen&quot;. As his Guardian obituary put it: &quot;You will find in every pavilion in the country today men who speak of Gunn&apos;s batting as musicians speak of Mozart. His was the batting of felicity. It was content with sheer grace.&quot; He also found time to set up a sportswear company, Gunn &amp; Moore, which continues to thrive today. 4) Engineering In 1947 Arsenal&apos;s scouts spotted a 17-year-old full-back playing for Oxford City, and thought him promising enough to sign. A short while later, in the throes of an injury crisis, they asked him to play for the reserve team as a striker, and discovered that he was unusually prolific. By the start of the 1951-52 Cliff Holton was a first-team regular, scoring 17 goals and starting the FA Cup final, where an Arsenal side badly affected by injuries lost 1-0 to Newcastle. The following season he scored 19 goals in 21 appearances as the Gunners won the league, and then he got another 17 in 1953-54. He continued to play regularly, either at left-half or up front (though the player himself considered centre-half his best position), until the start of the 1958-59 season, when the new manager, George Swindin \u2013 a former team-mate who had played in goal in that 1952 FA Cup final \u2013 launched a massive overhaul of the Gunners&apos; squad. Holton scored in his first three games of that season, but still found himself among eight players made available for transfer by Swindin, and the most sought-after of them. Aston Villa agreed a fee, but Holton refused to move to Birmingham. Liverpool agreed a fee, and Holton turned them down too. Then Watford, at that point 10th in the Fourth Division, chanced their arm, and unexpectedly got their man. For what Holton more than anything wanted was to give up full-time football, and dedicate himself to engineering. Holton&apos;s versatility, you see, was not confined to the football field. He was an impressive all-round sportsman, who played cricket for Essex before choosing to concentrate on football, popped up a few times in Middlesex&apos;s Second XI while he was at Highbury, and was to become an accomplished golfer in his retirement. He also had a long-standing interest in engineering, having been cajoled by his father into an apprenticeship at Morris Motors, of Morris Minor fame, before Arsenal came calling. He later admitted that he &quot;always had a feeling that football was something you did in passing&quot;. A few months after his move to Hertfordshire, having become a part-time player, he explained his reasoning to the Express. &quot;I hope to play league football for another 10 years \u2013 I&apos;m only 28,&quot; he said. &quot;But I&apos;m determined to guarantee my security now. Tonight I&apos;m due to sign the legal forms to launch my new general engineering company. I served my time as an apprentice as a boy in Oxford. I&apos;ve been studying for the last four years.&quot; Holton&apos;s business flourished, and he finally sold it in 1990. Meanwhile, for a man not wholly dedicated to the sport, he continued to do rather well at football. In his first full season at Watford he scored 48 times, and by the time he retired at the age of 39 having toured London&apos;s lower-league clubs (and Northampton) he had scored 292 league goals, a tally bettered by only four people (Arthur Rowley, Jimmy Greaves, John Aldridge and John Atyeo) since the second world war. 5) The circus Captain Albert James Prince-Cox was an unusual manager. For a start, he had been a successful child impressionist on the theatre stage, then joined the Royal Flying Corps as a pilot and became a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society, being employed for a while to deliver a daily weather forecast to the king at Buckingham Palace. He wasn&apos;t much of a footballer, playing only to local amateur level, but became one of the country&apos;s most prominent referees, taking charge of 32 internationals in 15 different countries. But knee trouble forced him to hang up his whistle, and in 1930 he applied for the job of manager at Bristol Rovers. On the downside he had absolutely no coaching experience; on the plus side he turned up for his interview in a bright red open-topped sports car, with a large cigar hanging out of his chops, and must have looked impossibly glamorous to gentlemen who had previously been employing the dowdy David McLean. He got the gig, and brought a talent for the theatrical to it, replacing plain blue shirts with the blue-and-white quarters they still wear today so as to &quot;make the players look bigger and more robust&quot;, arranging a friendly against the Dutch national team (Rovers won 3-2) and one night flying the centre-forward Vivian Gibbins from London, where he worked in a school, to a midweek match at Eastville in a chartered aeroplane, which wasn&apos;t really done at the time. In February 1936 he accepted a new five-year contract, and that summer spoke of his excitement at the season to come. &quot;This year we shall be playing with a lot of experience, built up carefully with youth, which will make up a good side,&quot; he said, but he didn&apos;t hang about to find out if he was right. That October he tendered his resignation \u2013 accepted by the club &quot;with sincere regret&quot; \u2013 announcing a plan to become a promoter of boxing, circus and variety shows across the south-west (and, strangely, Leicester). &quot;The whole of the directors wish him every success in his new venture,&quot; the club said. &quot;He leaves with the best feeling possible existing between himself and the board.&quot; The career change wasn&apos;t immediately successful \u2013 he was declared bankrupt just three years later, by which time he had moved back in with his mother in Southsea, and couldn&apos;t even provide his accounts to the court because &quot;most of his books were destroyed in a fire&quot;. But business clearly picked up, and for years afterwards Prince&apos;s International Circus toured the land \u2013 though not without the occasional problem. There was the time, in 1942, that eight-year-old Vernon Head from Bristol went to Prince-Cox&apos;s circus to see &quot;the smallest horse in the world&quot; and was mauled to death by a lion. The next time he made headlines was in 1953, when one of his polar bears clawed a TV producer preparing for a broadcast, and again two years later when Fiery Jack the clown lost an ear and sustained a nasty gash on one arm after being attacked by a tiger at the Davis Theatre, Croydon. &quot;The tigers got loose when a shutter of their cage was left unbolted,&quot; Prince-Cox explained. &quot;They just strolled around backstage. Had Fiery Jack remained still, probably he would not have been hurt. Naturally enough, he ran \u2013 and the tiger just slung a paw in the excitement!&quot; 6) Anything else It can be hard to walk away. Take Mel Nurse, who having just captained Swansea City to promotion from the Fourth Division surprised team-mates on the first-day of pre-season training in 1970 by announcing that he had given up the game to dedicate himself to the seaside guest houses he owned and managed. &quot;I want to concentrate on business outside the game, but it is very hard to make that break,&quot; he said. Very hard indeed \u2013 six weeks later he was convinced to come back, and thereafter became so reluctant to leave that he ended up a director, twice saved the club from financial meltdown and earned the nickname Mr Swansea. Then there&apos;s Roland Nilsson, who in December 1993 announced that he was walking out on his then employers, Sheffield Wednesday, even though he was only 30, had three years left on his contract and was a first choice for Sweden. &quot;My career is over,&quot; he announced. &quot;I feel there is more to life than football.&quot; Though not much more: Trevor Francis successfully convinced him to stay in Sheffield for the remainder of the season, he played in every minute as Sweden finished third at the World Cup, and he was still in football as recently as 2012, when he was sacked as manager of Copenhagen. In October 1949 Celtic&apos;s Charlie Tully declared he was &quot;sick and tired&quot; of football, and the level of attention he received from Glaswegian supporters. Asked about his future at the time, Tully replied: &quot;What would you do if you couldn&apos;t even go for a walk without people shouting and whistling at you? I&apos;ve had enough!&quot; He hadn&apos;t had enough, and was still involved in football when he died, aged just 47, in 1971, while manager of Bangor. But in George Connelly, Celtic found a stroppy star who had the courage of his convictions. It took him a while to find them, to be fair \u2013 he&apos;d already walked out at least five times before \u2013 but one day in training in 1975, and with no obvious provocation, he suddenly spat: &quot;Ah, fuck it \u2013 I&apos;m away,&quot; and literally ran from fame to a life of taxi-driving obscurity. He was just 27, but had already played 254 games for Celtic, and was by all accounts a brilliant ball-playing defender. It was not enough. &quot;I was going home with \u00a359 a week,&quot; he told the Sunday Herald in 2006. &quot;That was the basic wage and, at the end of the day, it was costing me money to play fitba. I had a house to buy, a mortgage to pay, I had two kids, two cars, the gas and the electric bills, and a marriage that wasn&apos;t working so what was the point?&quot; He was asked if he had ever regretted his decision. &quot;Maybe, when I was driving, I would say to myself: &apos;Christ almighty! I played for Celtic, appeared in five Scottish Cup finals, won four league medals and played in four League Cup finals, and won two Scotland caps. I&apos;m still a very famous person, yet here I am driving a taxi.&apos; If I thought about it seriously, I might have parked the car and ran away from it all, eh?&quot; Perhaps running away from it all is a mistake you only make once."}, {"sentences": ["The most desired posts \u2013 London, Paris, Beijing, Tokyo, etc \u2013 are out of reach because they always go to the big fundraisers, usually with a career diplomat at their elbow telling them what to do."], "tags": ["Benefits", "Society", "Horsemeat scandal", "Ronnie Corbett"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-15T16:43:02Z", "title": "Simon Hoggart's week: Diplomat wanted \u2013 must like musicals", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/feb/15/simon-hoggart-week-diplomats-must-like-musicals", "article": "\u2712 The government is embarrassed by this week&apos;s court ruling that prevents people being obliged to work for nothing before they get benefits.

It would lead to a modern, laid-back form of slavery, with slaves being allowed to go home at night, to wear what they liked \u2013 within limits \u2013 and even to bunk off without being subject to 100 lashes. Repealing the act that makes slavery illegal might sound drastic. But it would be open, honest and \u2013 in the politicians&apos; buzzword \u2013 transparent. Or as David Cameron is fond of saying, it would do exactly what it says on the tin. \u2712 Steve Pound MP texts: &quot;A horse walks into a bar.

Our friends would be happy with something quite modest. But they are in competition with hundreds, perhaps thousands of others. And the process is incredibly lengthy and complicated. A single ill-wisher in the state department or the White House can ruin your chances. Even having a close chum in a position of power does not necessarily help. Some time ago, the wife reported: &quot;We were on track for a multilateral position in Vienna, till we received a call from our best friend in White House personnel. Things could go sideways for us. Why? Because The Sound Of Music had just been shown on network TV, leading to &apos;a new surge of interest in Austria&apos;.&quot; \u2712 I love hearing language change. This week, on a train to work, I was earwigging a conversation between a man and a woman. He was describing how he&apos;d arranged a shooting party in North Yorkshire but when they&apos;d arrived the snow was too thick to go ahead. &quot;So I called a mate who has a pub up there&quot; \u2013 he looked like the sort of chap who has &quot;mates&quot; all over the place \u2013 &quot;and he fixed lunch for us. I booked a load of taxis to get us there, and by the end we were well and truly trozzled\u2026&quot; Is this a real new slang word?

Tony Iveson was another winner \u2013 he&apos;s the oldest man to have given away a kidney, and he made an extraordinarily moving short speech about how simple it was and how marvellously it transformed sufferers&apos; lives. He had come with his surgeon; at one point she waved a knife vaguely in my direction, and I feared that she was about to take mine on the spot. General Sir Michael Jackson, the former head of the army, was there, not far from Alan West, now a peer, formerly First Sea Lord. Jackson once told him how much he envied his splendid title, and West replied: &quot;Yes, but you would have to be First Land Lord.&quot; I sat next to Ronnie Corbett, whom I had never met, but who turned out to be as warm and friendly as you would hope. I asked about Ronnie Barker, who used to send in material to The Frost Report and The Two Ronnies under the pseudonym Gerald Wiley because he wanted the sketches to be used because they were good, not because he was in the show. At one point Gerald Wiley was writing three-quarters of the scripts, but Barker would put people off the scent by criticising them, or saying he didn&apos;t understand a particular line. He finally confessed at a big Chinese dinner for the team. I said to Corbett that I assumed he had known well beforehand, and he said: &quot;Yes \u2013 he told me at lunch on that same day.&quot; Barry Cryer was there. He is hard of hearing now, so has the subtitles on when he watches the news, and chortles at the errors that creep in. One he missed, but a friend passed on.

He was renovating his house when he got the call. &quot;Paul, where are you? The first course is coming any minute.&quot; The blogger rushed over to Westminster, walked into the room, &quot;and\u00a0there&apos;s an intake of breath from the\u00a0old guard&quot;. He had paint in his hair, was wearing flip-flops, shorts and an Ireland rugby shirt, &quot;and the whole room went, what the fuck&apos;s that?&quot; It&apos;s an anecdote that helpfully burnishes a fond self-image \u2013 that of a scrappy upstart bursting into the closed and cosy world of Westminster journalism, ruffling feathers. Which was exactly what he wanted his blog to do, and the reason why he called it Guido Fawkes. He is wearing the same (now somewhat battered) shirt when we meet, but the circumstances are different. His readership has increased massively in size, and political blogging has long since come of age \u2013 in fact, despite years of inveighing against the &quot;dead tree press&quot;, Guido Fawkes now has a column in the Sun on Sunday, thus reaching a potential readership of four million, on top of the 50-100,000 readers the blog gets every day. This week, at prime minister&apos;s questions, Ed Miliband used the column as ammunition: &quot;Doesn&apos;t it speak of how out of touch [the prime minister] is, Mr Speaker,&quot; he hooted, &quot;that last week he attended the Conservative ball and auctioned a painting of himself for \u00a3100,000 and then declared without a hint of irony the Tories are no longer the party of privilege!&quot; The hall jeered and howled. Cameron&apos;s reply, it quickly became clear, contained a leak obtained by the Guido Fawkes website: &quot;He [ie Ed Miliband] is making a major speech on the economy on Thursday. It won&apos;t have any policies in it!&quot; And he sat down, to thrilled baying from his benches, looking inordinately pleased with himself. &quot;The Guidoisation of politics continues,&quot; crowed the blog, immediately. Was Staines watching? &quot;Yeah. I was only half paying attention, but Harry, who works with me&quot; \u2013 he now has two co-writers, Harry Cole and Alex Wickham, and says that these days he aims to spend only 20% of his time blogging \u2013 &quot;went, &apos;Ah! that&apos;s ours!&apos; It&apos;s not the first time we&apos;ve seen things we&apos;ve done turn up in PMQs, but it&apos;s bit unusual that we\u00a0get two hits&quot; \u2013 and one of them verbatim, from the prime minister. How did that feel? &quot;We just laughed,&quot; he says, not laughing. Staines is often said to have a highly developed sense of\u00a0mischief, which is no doubt true, but\u00a0he is in person far less playful than one might expect. He is serious, and seriously prepared. He&apos;s also coldly watchful: his left eyelid droops a little, which gives the impression that while half his face is engaged in the conversation, the other is standing sentry. His online persona is relentlessly mocking; it is also, compared to many online offerings, strikingly concise. Few entries, unless they contain a leaked memo or email, are more than 300 words long; you may object to their point, but there is never any doubt what\u00a0it is. In person, however, he speaks in a quick mumble that often requires repetition and clarification. And while his &quot;bread and butter&quot;, as he puts it, is taking a politician&apos;s actions or promises and rooting about for proof of hypocrisy or lying (he has named an alleged mistress of John Prescott; embarrassed William Hague by revealing that he had shared a hotel room with his driver; forced the resignations of cabinet minister Peter Hain and of Damian McBride, a key aide of Gordon Brown; and last year was hauled before the Leveson inquiry for publishing a draft of\u00a0the witness statement Alastair Campbell was preparing before his own\u00a0appearance there), any attempts to\u00a0discuss certain youthful indiscretions of his own are met with a distinct lack of\u00a0humour. His history reveals a man with an instinct for retribution and vendetta. He\u00a0talks of a run-in with Jeremy Paxman and the Guardian&apos;s Michael White (in which the latter named him on air) as a\u00a0&quot;spit-roasting&quot;, and an unfavourable profile in the Telegraph as a &quot;punishment beating&quot;; &quot;I detest Suzanne Moore and Julie Burchill&quot; ran a recent tweet (he\u00a0has more than 94,000 followers, and\u00a0the comments on his posts, about which he has distinctly inconsistent opinions, are often strikingly misogynistic). When I ask whether he\u00a0regrets anything about the terrible familial fallout from Chris Huhne&apos;s trial\u00a0he says, &quot;No. He was a bastard and\u00a0I\u00a0hated him and he deserves everything he gets.&quot; The day before Damian McBride was\u00a0exposed in the papers, Staines reportedly sent him a text quoting Conan the Barbarian: &quot;What is best in\u00a0life? To crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women.&quot; He says that, while he regrets the fact that some of his actions \u2013 and the resultant press coverage \u2013 have given his wife, a solicitor in the City, &quot;some pretty awful Mondays in the office&quot; (after the Telegraph profile, &quot;she closed the door and cried&quot;), it&apos;s not going to make him any more charitable. &quot;No. I&apos;m just Irish, and that&apos;s the way we do it. Fuck with me, and I\u00a0fuck with you.&quot; The blog runs on a clearly defined timetable: a story by 9am, to get people as they sit down at their desks in the morning, another at 11am or so; then lunchtime, sometime in the afternoon, &quot;and at 5pm we try to have something funny \u2013 the &apos;and finally&apos;, something light.&quot; How much involves trawling the archives and how much involves actual calls, meeting contacts, basic legwork? &quot;Oh, to get hard news you can&apos;t just sit there watching Twitter, as I tell the guys all the time.&quot; His aim, when the blog began in 2004, was a combination of the\u00a0gossipy tone and insider knowledge of Popbitch, mixed with the news sense\u00a0and populist instincts of Kelvin MacKenzie&apos;s Sun \u2013 &quot;that old [MacKenzie] thing of &apos;Amaze, amuse or anger&apos; \u2013 if they say, &apos;I don&apos;t believe it,&apos; you&apos;ve got &apos;em; if they laugh, you&apos;ve got &apos;em, and if you make them angry you&apos;ve got them \u2013 so we try to do all three. I bumped into him at a party recently, and told him he was our ethics adviser.&quot; At the beginning, he says, his sources were lobby journalists, who &quot;would go, &apos;No, it&apos;s really like this \u2013 and draw back the curtain a little bit. That never happens now. It&apos;s too competitive. And the tone of reporting has changed. They&apos;re pulling back the curtain on themselves now.&quot; Their main source now is &quot;the bag-carrier class \u2013 advisers, press officers obviously \u2013 and you know, Harry drinks with them, sleeps with them, whatever, and Alex \u2013 Wiki, as we call him \u2013 same thing. And I&apos;m kind of less out night after night&quot; \u2013 although, two small daughters notwithstanding, he was out till all hours on Monday, singing karaoke with &quot;a gang of Westminster people&quot;. So you&apos;re really part of the Westminster bubble, aren&apos;t you? &quot;Oh, the days of\u00a0us being able to say we&apos;re complete outsiders are long gone. When\u00a0you&apos;re on first-name terms with cabinet ministers it&apos;s very hard to say you&apos;re on the outside. The one thing we\u00a0are outside is the lobby system \u2013 we\u00a0don&apos;t play by those rules, which I\u00a0think are bad rules.&quot; And they are? &quot;A\u00a0politician can tell you that this policy that his party has come up with is rubbish. That politician will then go on\u00a0Newsnight and say this policy is the best thing since sliced bread, and the journalist, who was told on lobby terms, is going to have to attribute it to &apos;a senior Downing Street source&apos;. And that, I\u00a0think, is unhealthy for democracy.&quot; Has he found things harder now that the Tories are in power, and he is harrying people he theoretically agrees with? &quot;I still hate politicians. My contempt for them is undiminished. I mean, we&apos;ve got a coalition. People screw up quite a lot. The government isn&apos;t really doing things I&apos;d like them to be doing.&quot; Except\u00a0for Michael Gove, and perhaps Iain Duncan-Smith. Cameron is not anti-Europe enough for Staines, and &quot;not going to deliver on anything&quot;; Boris has a decent amount of popular appeal, &quot;but\u00a0he&apos;s not very right-wing&quot;. Staines has, in his time, been a member of the Young Conservatives, and at college in Hull, the Federation of Conservative Students, who, he once\u00a0wrote, &quot;spoke a language I could understand \u2013 Thatcher on drugs \u2026 anti-Communist, anti-Wet and mainly reactionary \u2026 I\u00a0never wore a &apos;Hang Mandela&apos; badge, but\u00a0I hung out with people who did \u2026 We were so obnoxious the Conservative party decided to close [us] down&quot;; he was\u00a0a member of the now-defunct Progressive Democrat party in Ireland\u00a0(socially liberal, economically neoliberal) and of the SDP. &quot;When I\u00a0was\u00a0younger,&quot; he says now, &quot;I\u00a0was &quot;anarcho-capitalist, [then] libertarian, then pragmatic libertarian.&quot; He is now, he says, closer to the Tories and Ukip. Staines&apos;s father was a Fabian who went to work for John Lewis because it was a cooperative; he is Anglo-Indian, from Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh; his mother is from working-class Dublin. Staines himself grew up in Sudbury in Suffolk. &quot;My dad is a kind of moderate Tory now, but when I was a YC, in my teens, he just went to me \u2013 &apos;Enoch Powell?&apos;&quot; And what did you say to that? &quot;I didn&apos;t know who the fuck Enoch Powell was.&quot; He went to Catholic school in Harrow, and although he lost his faith at 13, he and his wife intend to raise their daughters with all the rituals of the Catholic church. Staines has had what a counsel to the Leveson inquiry drily called a &quot;diverse career&quot;: student politics was followed by work for Tory fixer David Hart, which involved, as he tells it, spending the last years of the cold war chasing around Angola and Central America &quot;firing off AK-47s. It was bloody exciting.&quot; Some of the funding, he says, &quot;came from the American taxpayer; we\u00a0were involved with the kind of anti-communist rebels Reagan&apos;s people were pushing \u2013 the kind of Ollie North end of the business.&quot; And now? &quot;I&apos;m still pretty gung-ho. We were on the right side of history. I don&apos;t have any problem with having raised money to kill communists.&quot; His work with Hart began to overlap with helping an old friend who organised acid-house raves. &quot;I spent a couple of years going around the M25, playing merry hell with the cops.&quot; This was followed by work as a professional blackjack player, a futures broker, a bond dealer, a hedge fund manager in Hong Kong and Tokyo, and then two years suing his main backer and finally bankruptcy. It was during the two years of resulting litigation that his blog, Guido Fawkes, was born. He once said that his aim was to be an\u00a0unignorable right-wing voice, like Rush Limbaugh in the US. &quot;Like the Rushies [Limbaugh fans], I want the blogs to be a constituency politicians have to factor in.&quot; These days he goes further. &quot;I think the internet means you can raise funds online in a different way. Labour goes to the union barons to get big cash-flows; the Tories go to the City. But I think the internet means they can get thousands of small donations. I\u00a0know a lot about people online \u2013 you can raise money. If you raise money, have a parallel organisation, you can have much more influence. And that&apos;s where I see us going.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Japan will escape censure from the G20 group of nations meeting in Moscow this weekend despite widespread unease at Tokyo&apos;s aggressive intervention into currency markets to drive down the value of the yen.", "A draft communique seen by Reuters suggests that Tokyo would not be singled out for criticism, as had been suggested.", "Some European countries have accused Tokyo of signalling its intention to buy billions of euros in order to drive up the value of the eurozone currency."], "tags": ["Currencies", "Business", "G20", "World news", "Yen", "Japan", "UK news", "Sterling", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Economics", "Christine Lagarde", "Euro", "Euro", "Eurozone crisis"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-15T18:22:36Z", "title": "G20 meeting: Japan won't be singled out for currency depreciation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/15/g20-meeting-japan-currency-wars", "article": "Japan will escape censure from the G20 group of nations meeting in Moscow this weekend despite widespread unease at Tokyo&apos;s aggressive intervention into currency markets to drive down the value of the yen.

An unnamed delegate was quoted as saying: &quot;There wasn&apos;t anybody putting Japan on the spot.

Some European countries have accused Tokyo of signalling its intention to buy billions of euros in order to drive up the value of the eurozone currency. In a barely disguised swipe at Japan, US Treasury undersecretary Lael Brainard warned the world&apos;s biggest economies against taking unilateral steps when it comes to exchange rates. &quot;All the members of G20 need to deliver on a commitment to move towards a market-determined exchange rate and refrain from competitive devaluation,&quot; he said. The G20 has previously asked nations to refrain from market intervention. Finance ministers, including the UK chancellor George Osborne, and central bank chiefs are meeting in Moscow under the chairmanship of Vladimir Putin&apos;s Russian government to discuss how to support the global recovery ahead of a leaders meeting later in the year. The pound has fallen 20% against the dollar and euro since the financial crisis, though with little of the hoped-for boost to exports. Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale said on Friday that the benefits could merely be delayed as exporters begin the process of turning to growing markets and away from recession-hit continental Europe. Weale, a member of the bank&apos;s interest-rate setting committee, said the cheaper currency could still bring rewards, though he warned that a fall in foreign investment income could bring another drop in the exchange rate. He said that while this will raise import prices and spur inflation, it could support exporters further and help re-balance the UK economy away from financial services and towards manufacturing."}, {"sentences": ["The questions 1 Which US religious group is named after Jakob Ammann?2 Who is tipped to lead Team Sky in this year&apos;s Tour de France?3 Queen Pasipha\u00eb was the mother of which monster?4 Which TV character&apos;s full name is Camilla Cholomondely-Browne?5 Which day is the traditional start of the agricultural year?6 What stage announcement was first made by Horace Lee Logan in 1956?7 Tokyo Sexwale is a minister in which government?8 An Angel At My Table was whose\u00a0autobiography?What links:9 Terry Neill and George Graham; Sol\u00a0Campbell and Pat Jennings?10 Wechsler-Bellevue; Stanford-Binet?11 Nubian; reticulated; Masai; Rothschild; Kordofan?12 Pontchartrain; Borgne; Maurepas;\u00a0Salvador?13 James Watt; Simon de Montfort; IK Brunel; Robert Gordon?14 The Fat (6); Saint (9); Universal\u00a0Spider (11); Sun (14); Well-Beloved (15)?15 George Burns; Morgan Freeman; Alanis Morissette?"], "tags": ["Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-16T08:00:01Z", "title": "The Weekend Quiz", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/feb/16/quiz-general-knowledge-guardian", "article": "The questions 1 Which US religious group is named after Jakob Ammann?2 Who is tipped to lead Team Sky in this year&apos;s Tour de France?3 Queen Pasipha\u00eb was the mother of which monster?4 Which TV character&apos;s full name is Camilla Cholomondely-Browne?5 Which day is the traditional start of the agricultural year?6 What stage announcement was first made by Horace Lee Logan in 1956?7 Tokyo Sexwale is a minister in which government?8 An Angel At My Table was whose\u00a0autobiography?What links:9 Terry Neill and George Graham; Sol\u00a0Campbell and Pat Jennings?10 Wechsler-Bellevue; Stanford-Binet?11 Nubian; reticulated; Masai; Rothschild; Kordofan?12 Pontchartrain; Borgne; Maurepas;\u00a0Salvador?13 James Watt; Simon de Montfort; IK Brunel; Robert Gordon?14 The Fat (6); Saint (9); Universal\u00a0Spider (11); Sun (14); Well-Beloved (15)?15 George Burns; Morgan Freeman; Alanis Morissette?

The profoundly macho culture he grew up in spans racial groups and provides some explanation for the country&apos;s shocking rates of domestic violence. &quot;Black South African men are expected to prove their manliness by carrying knives and having lots of girlfriends,&apos;&apos; said Rachel Jewkes of the South African Medical Research Council. &quot;White Afrikaners like Pistorius do not need to have several girlfriends. But his love of guns speaks to the same hunger to prove his masculinity in the South African context.&quot; The full facts about the death of model Reeva Steenkamp have yet to emerge, but to South Africans her death came on the eve of the Black Friday Campaign for Rape Awareness in honour of Anene Booysen. The 17-year-old died after her ex-boyfriend and others allegedly gang raped and disembowelled her on 2 February. &quot;The massive problem we need to understand in South Africa is the level of men&apos;s violence against women and against each other,&apos;&apos; said Lisa Vetten, a researcher who specialises in domestic abuse. Police statistics on domestic violence are limited. But 15,609 murders and 64,500 reported rapes in 2011-12 suggest massive levels of violence in South African homes. Household surveys by the MRC have found that 40% of men have hit their partner and one in four men have raped a woman. Three-quarters of men who admit to having raped women say they did so first as teenagers. The MRC found that, while a quarter of women had been raped, just 2% of those raped by a partner reported the incident to police. Experts say South African society features all the known causes of rape and violence, including a historical culture of &quot;might is right&quot;, a wealth gap that makes men feel weak, an unequal relationship between women and men, lack of adequate childcare, which results in the neglect of boys, and high male unemployment. Jewkes, a British doctor and director of gender and health at the MRC, said: &quot;Having a father at home is really unusual here. South African children are more likely to be raised by a non-biological parent than by both biological parents. So you see high levels of neglect, humiliation and abuse, which develops into domestic violence. We also have a high rate of teenage pregnancies and those young mothers are not equipped to raise their children. &quot;South African men think women should be under their control. There is an idea that violence is justifiable as a means to keep women in their place. This has not changed in 20 years and even though the South African murder rate has dropped by 50% since 1999, rape figures have not,&quot; said Jewkes. Jewkes and Vetten argue that Pistorius&apos;s love of guns and fast cars illustrates his relationship with South Africa&apos;s macho culture. &quot;Afrikaner men are very patriarchal,&quot; said Jewkes, &quot;and within that culture gun ownership is seen as part of masculinity.&quot; Vetten believes that the pressure on Pistorius may have been compounded. &quot;Disabled men and women often struggle with their sense of masculinity or femininity because they are to some degree dependent. I have seen examples of them placing particular pride on physical attractiveness. Maybe he struggles with that. The guns and sports cars gave an impression that he was over-compensating so as to be seen as &apos;normal&apos;.&quot; But the tragedy in South Africa is that the most &quot;normal&quot; thing of all is violence against women. Under the polygamous President Jacob Zuma, known for his traditionalist and sexist remarks, there is also a sense of men getting away with it. Minister of human settlements Tokyo Sexwale is currently fighting a divorce case by his wife Judy which cites emotional mental and verbal abuse. But his political career has been unaffected. The media raise the issue with regularity. Column inches were occupied last month with wonderment at the outpouring of grief in India over the rape of a New Delhi student on a bus. Commentators asked why such a reaction in South Africa, where gang rapes are a daily occurrence, is unthinkable. Black Friday, during which radio chat show hosts called on listeners to wear black, was a media attempt to create a reaction. But South Africa appeared largely unmoved. While the country has a Domestic Violence Act that enables police to intervene if a woman fears attack, it is poorly implemented. Jennifer Williams, director of the Women&apos;s Legal Centre, said: &quot;There is a problem of resources and police training. Too often the women who come to us have been told by the police, &apos;He seems like a nice guy, surely you can sort it out&apos;. Other women are turned away from courts because there is a shortage of magistrates. We have a national emergency, yet rape crisis centres are closing.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["There&apos;s no parallel to his achievement in British fashion, but it&apos;s akin to John Lewis setting up a flagship store in Tokyo&apos;s Ginza district."], "tags": ["Handbags", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Women"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-17T06:00:11Z", "title": "Reed Krakoff \u2013 Coach's driving force", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/feb/17/reed-krakoff-coach-driving-force", "article": "Coach&apos;s HQ is situated in a bright and airy building on the West Side of Manhattan. The brand&apos;s leather goods and bags used to be manufactured here, but the old factory is now home to the corporate echelons that oversee the Coach empire, which has grown since its foundation in 1941 from a family-run business into a $4.9bn accessories giant with more than 500 stores in America, and over 400 in Asia. As I sit waiting in the foyer I watch a gaggle of people head out for lunch. Each carries a Coach bag. More follow. Some have two or three. Brightly coloured totes and classic tan duffles bob past at eye level, a damson-coloured clutch embossed with the brand&apos;s signature &quot;C&quot; print. When Ginger, the cheery publicist, arrives to escort me up to the top floor, there are more bags than people in the lift we take. The confined space is crammed with smooth leather, patterned fabrics and lots and lots of shiny buckles and clasps. After a pause, Ginger leans forward to explain that the company&apos;s holding a sample sale today. &quot;We don&apos;t make staff carry the bags.&quot; Reed Krakoff, Coach&apos;s executive creative director and the man I&apos;ve come to meet, would be pleased with his staff&apos;s devotion to the product. That they want to take their work home is a compliment, and Krakoff understands that desire is key in fashion; that now women in particular buy bags because they want them not because they need them. When he joined Coach in 1996, it was the nice, reliable choice of middle-class American mums, but he has transformed it into a phenomenally successful fashion-accessories label. The range increased from 12 perennial styles to a dizzying array of colourful and decorated bags in all shapes and sizes. Scarves, perfumes and shoes soon followed and the brand became an international success \u2013 not just with nice mums, but with their fashion-conscious daughters and the celebrities those daughters aspire to look like. There&apos;s no parallel to his achievement in British fashion, but it&apos;s akin to John Lewis setting up a flagship store in Tokyo&apos;s Ginza district. Krakoff himself describes Coach 2.0 as everyday chic luxury. &quot;I think the idea of American design is that form follows function, and that design is responsible to functionality. Coach now is rooted in a sense of American functionality, but that has been overlaid with style, colour, optimism.&quot; This is a verbatim quote from Krakoff. He talks at an unusual level of meta analysis and is coy about discussing the nuts and bolts of creating accessories. He calls himself a brand architect rather than a designer and he refers to new collections as adding to the Coach story. It&apos;s odd but strangely soothing. The name Reed Krakoff sounds like that of a Marvel Comics scientist, but he grew up in smart Connecticut, where Martha Stewart catered at his mother&apos;s parties. His early memories of design come from when he was four or five \u2013 leafing through a book of Picasso&apos;s posters and loving his parents&apos; Mies van der Rohe chair. His wife Delphine, an interior designer, is the daughter of Jacques Chirac&apos;s minister of defence. Krakoff&apos;s office at Coach is filled with elegant furniture. He perks up when I admire it, then looks a little sad when I confess ignorance of the designers. &quot;You don&apos;t need to know, just enjoy it. That&apos;s the best way to look at it. If you have to explain it to people, that&apos;s not very interesting.&quot; Collecting 20th-century furniture is one of his hobbies, alongside photography, designing furniture \u2013 in his office I sat on a couch he&apos;d made, very comfortable; he&apos;s contributed to books on Ron Arad and Mattia Bonetti \u2013 and loves sport, especially boxing. (&quot;I don&apos;t do it, well I&apos;ve boxed my older brother, but I\u00a0like the personal aspect of it, the idea of being able to make your body and mind do anything. It&apos;s a good lesson.&quot;)     The Yellow Mini Tanner: one of Coach's distinctive handbags. Photograph: Observer    He channels these more personal interests into the fashion label that bears his name. Reed Krakoff ready-to-wear clothing is backed by Coach, but is a separate, upmarket concern. The label is very luxe. Though it&apos;s only two years old, its place in fashion history has already been cemented: Michelle Obama wore one of his dresses to Barack&apos;s inauguration last month. The fact that Krakoff simultaneously produces well-priced leather goods for the international masses and refined clothing for the elite seems to annoy some commentators, as if it&apos;s somehow an affront to the art of fashion that someone can be so commercially successful yet aesthetically focused. It is unusual for a mid-market accessories brand to launch a ready-to-wear designer label. But Krakoff believes it&apos;s the way the world is headed. &quot;It&apos;s just a different sort of creativity,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s unsophisticated to think that because fashion is more about business then it&apos;s less creative. Every generation thinks the next is less pure, too commercial. It&apos;s the same in art, design.&quot; And Coach is set for another level of expansion this year. The old West Side factory will be deserted for a purpose-built tower in Hudson Yards in Midtown and, yes, Krakoff has been intimately involved in the new building&apos;s design. Coach is also set to become a lifestyle brand, increasing its footwear offering and adding clothes to the range. He is typically opaque about the new developments. &quot;We need to keep the brand exciting,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s about telling a different story in a different way and having a more head-to-toe woman and man to talk about. It&apos;s more about style because accessories always have to have function.&quot; For a man whose clear thinking is changing the rules of fashion, Reed Krakoff is rather abstruse. But maybe what he said about his beautifully designed office holds true in other concerns. You just have to look at what he&apos;s doing. If you have to explain it, that&apos;s not very interesting."}, {"sentences": ["Born in Tokyo to rich parents."], "tags": ["Yoko Ono", "Art", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-18T06:00:45Z", "title": "Yoko Ono: happy 80th birthday!", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2013/feb/18/yoko-ono-happy-80-birthday", "article": "Age: 80 today.

Click here to view the video Opening with the sound of Tom Courtenay&apos;s feet thudding against a bleak rural lane, Tony Richardson and Alan Sillitoe&apos;s 1962 British New Wave classic is one of the most poetic running films in cinematic history. As Colin Smith, a petty delinquent, Courtenay gives a compelling perfomance in this class-conscious commentary on late-50s British society. After being sent to a reformatory for his part in a bakery robbery, Smith turns to long-distance running to escape the drudgery of his confinement. His talent is spotted by the governor who offers the promise of early release if he runs for the reformatory in a race against a public school. In the final, stunning denouement, Smith&apos;s freedom and independence are resolved by his race performance in the most unpredictable way. Marathon Man            Reading this on mobile?

Dustin Hoffman plays Columbia grad student and running obsessive Thomas &quot;Babe&quot; Levy, who is hounded by Laurence Olivier&apos;s sinister Dr Christian Szell over a briefcase of missing diamonds. An early scene shows Hoffmann pushing himself around Central Park. All that training and his ability to recall the feats of Ethiopian Olympic legend Abebe Bikila winning in Rome and Tokyo give him the endurance to escape his tormentors.

Both deal with Pre&apos;s bolshy frontrunning tactics, spectacular 1972 Munich Olympic disappointment and tragic, fatal car crash at 24.

He has been announced as the latest designer of the Serpentine Gallery&apos;s annual pavilion commission and he promises to bring a vision of airy lightness, in marked contrast to last year&apos;s subterranean grotto by Herzog &amp; de Meuron and Ai Weiwei. His proposal is for a delicate lattice structure of 20mm-thick steel poles, which will form an irregular, shape-shifting mass in front of the gallery, a misty wire-frame blur that will dissolve into the park. &quot;Within the pastoral context of Kensington Gardens, I envisage the vivid greenery of the surrounding plant life woven together with a constructed geometry,&quot; says Fujimoto. He describes the project as &quot;an architectural landscape: a transparent terrain that encourages people to interact with and explore the site in diverse ways.&quot; Many architects like to think their buildings dissolve and &quot;dematerialise&quot; into their surroundings. They talk in earnest about &quot;fluid space&quot; and the continuity of inside and out \u2013 the simple use of a window or door endowed with the rhetoric of free flow. But Fujimoto actually does it. His buildings and structures are composed of multiple layers and levels, creating permeable enclosures that only loosely suggest rooms and routes \u2013 what he describes as &quot;formless form&quot;. He talks of his projects taking on the characteristics of a &quot;cave or nest&quot;, a primitive shell to be defined by the user&apos;s occupation, &quot;just a raw space, which people need to explore and find their own comfort within.&quot;     On cloud nine \u2026 the nest of steel rods will provide shelter for a cafe    One of his first projects, the Final Wooden House, was made from a simple stack of timber beams, creating a series of nooks and hollows, perches and ledges where &quot;inhabitants discover, rather than being prescribed&quot;. His recent NA house in Tokyo continued these ideas on a much larger scale, with an open scaffold-like structure of staggered platforms and shifting levels, in which rooms, landings and staircases merge as though suspended in the branches of a tree. His proposal for the Serpentine promises to be a similarly beguiling place to explore. Fujimoto is the third Japanese architect to design the Serpentine pavilion, following Toyo Ito in 2002 and Sanaa in 2009, and at 41 he is the youngest yet. It is a welcome choice for the annual commission, which has too often shown that the biggest names are least likely to produce the best small buildings \u2013 Frank Gehry and Jean Nouvel&apos;s offerings providing painful proof. Let&apos;s hope Fujimoto sets a precedent for selecting architects who are not just concerned with arm&apos;s-length gestures, and whose offices have not yet swollen beyond the capacity to think about the human-scale experience."}, {"sentences": ["Two currencies took a thumping when trading reopened on Monday: the Japanese yen, which is being deliberately depreciated by Tokyo, was one; sterling, which dropped to a seven-month low against the dollar at one point, was the other."], "tags": ["Sterling", "Currencies", "Business", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-18T18:58:23Z", "title": "Sterling no longer a safe haven | Larry Elliott", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/feb/18/sterling-no-safe-haven-pound-speculators", "article": "Sterling&apos;s days as a safe haven currency are over for now. Hedge funds are selling more pounds than they are buying for the first time in five months. The speculators are heading for the exit. The diminished status of the UK currency in the eyes of international investors was illustrated by the reaction to the weekend&apos;s hollow words about currency manipulation. Two currencies took a thumping when trading reopened on Monday: the Japanese yen, which is being deliberately depreciated by Tokyo, was one; sterling, which dropped to a seven-month low against the dollar at one point, was the other. To be sure, there will be good trading sessions for the pound, and Wednesday may be one of them if the latest unemployment figures show a fresh fall in joblessness and the minutes of the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee&apos;s February meeting suggest no hurry to give the economy a fresh stimulus. But the smart traders will sell into any rally, knowing it is unlikely to last. That&apos;s not just because the outgoing Bank governor, Sir Mervyn King, made it clear last week that he favoured a cheaper currency in order to help exports. Nor is it because King&apos;s successor, Mark Carney, has hinted that he will take an even more relaxed approach to hitting the government&apos;s 2% inflation target than the current regime. These factors have certainly done nothing to provide support for the pound but the selling had been occurring before King or Carney opened their mouths. Nor, for that matter, is the sell off due to a sudden reappraisal of the UK economy&apos;s strengths and weaknesses. The prospects for rapid growth in Britain look poor, but they looked poor a year ago when the hot money was flowing into London and all the talk was of sterling as a bulwark of stability. Some analysts say the threat of one or more of the credit rating agencies stripping the UK of its AAA status has led to the smart money getting out well ahead of any announcement, but this sort of talk has been around for months. Instead, the explanation for the pound&apos;s fall is simple: the negative factors depressing the value of other currencies have gone away leaving the negative factors affecting sterling evident for all to see. So while few wanted to take a punt on the euro a year ago when it appeared to be on the brink of collapse, the soothing words of Mario Draghi have removed that threat, at least for the time being. A second risk, that the US would stumble off the fiscal cliff, has also been removed, as has a third: a hard landing in Japan. Investors have not suddenly woken up to the idea that Britain is a flat-lining economy with a twin deficit problem. They have known that for some time. The difference is that a year ago there were other more pressing things to worry about. Now there are not.

The justice ministry said the executions were carried out in the early hours of Thursday in three different locations. One of the condemned men, Kaoru Kobayashi, had been sentenced to death for the abduction, sexual assault and murder of a seven-year-old schoolgirl in 2004. He sent a photograph of the murdered girl to her mother. The executions, the first since September 2012, could signal a return to more regular hangings under the current justice minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki. &quot;I ordered the executions after giving them careful consideration,&quot; Tanigaki told reporters. &quot;These were extremely cruel cases in which the victims had their precious lives taken away for very selfish reasons.&quot; Amnesty International Japan condemned the executions. &quot;The Japanese government cannot be excused from abiding by international human rights standards, just by citing opinion among the public,&quot; it said in a statement. Opinion polls put support for capital punishment among the Japanese at about 80%. Earlier this year Tanigaki indicated he would have no hesitation in signing execution orders; some previous holders of the post had refused to approve them, leading to a de facto moratorium. &quot;I will have to do what needs to be done according to the rule of law,&quot; he told journalists, adding that the secrecy surrounding hangings would continue. Inmates are given very little notice before they are led to the gallows and their families are informed only after the executions have taken place. &quot;Even death row inmates have guarantees of privacy and we have to consider the feelings of their relatives,&quot; Tanigaki said. &quot;I don&apos;t think it is necessarily a good idea to release more information.&quot; At the end of last year Japan had 133 inmates on death row, the highest number since records were first kept in 1949. They include Shoko Asahara, leader of the doomsday cult behind the 1995 sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway in which 13 people died and thousands were made ill. The previous government, led by the left-of centre Democratic party of Japan (DPJ), executed nine people during its three years and three months in office. That included an 18-month period from July 2010 in which no hangings took place. In the three years to 2008 there were 28 executions under LDP administrations. The DPJ raised hopes among abolitionists in 2010 when it established a panel to look into Japan&apos;s use of capital punishment but the body was disbanded without reaching a conclusion in January 2012. Japan, which along with the US is the only major industrialised country to retain the death penalty, has come under mounting pressure to abandon it. In December the UN adopted a resolution calling on Japan and other countries to impose a moratorium on capital punishment and to be more transparent about executions. In a recent open letter campaigners called on Tanigaki to &quot;immediately introduce a moratorium on executions and initiate a national public debate aimed at promoting full abolition of the death penalty in Japan&quot;.

He was best known for his books on cinema, including The Japanese Film: Art and Industry (1959), the first major English-language study of the subject, co-written with Joseph L Anderson; The Films of Akira Kurosawa (1965); Ozu: His Life and Films (1974); and A Hundred Years of Japanese Film (2001). Richie played a pivotal role in introducing the director Yasujiro Ozu to foreign audiences and curated, in 1963, the first international Ozu retrospective, at the Berlin film festival. In 1983, he received the first Kawakita award, for individuals or organisations that have contributed to Japanese film culture. Though recognised as the most important figure in introducing Japanese cinema to the west, Richie saw himself as a writer foremost and a film critic secondarily. His fictional work includes Memoirs of the Warrior Kumagai: A Historical Novel (1999), A View from the Chuo Line and Other Stories (2004) and Tokyo Nights (2005). His interests stretched to topics as diverse as the country&apos;s literature (Japanese Literature Reviewed, 2003), modern fashion (The Image Factory, 2003) and travel. Twenty years after its publication, his personal travelogue The Inland Sea (1971) was turned into an award-winning documentary by Lucille Carra and Brian Cotnoir. Richie narrated the film himself. He cultivated the persona of a stranger in a strange land, self-consciously positioned between two cultures. His early posting as a civilian administrator with the occupation forces provided an escape route from the small-town provinciality of Lima, Ohio, where he was born. Richie openly embraced the country that would fuel his art over the next six decades, flouting rules against fraternising with the locals. As he wrote in a 1947 entry in his candid memoir Japan Journals (2004): &quot;Little America, try though it does to impart democracy and individualism, is always a territory where the Japanese are worried over, and are made objects of condescension \u2026 I soon see I will experience nothing, learn nothing if I stay within these commodious and American folds.&quot; In the late 1940s, Richie&apos;s articles on such topics as kabuki drama, ikebana (the art of flower arrangement) and Japanese festivals were published in the Pacific Stars and Stripes US military magazine, and marked the beginning of a lifelong exploration of the country&apos;s culture and lifestyle. However, he always remained strongly aware of his intermediary status, as he explained when I interviewed him in 2003 for the website Midnight Eye: &quot;My interest in Japan is \u2013 in a literal sense of course, but in sort of a metaphorical sense \u2013 that I&apos;m using the idea of the outsider, the foreigner, as my own vehicle as well. He flourishes here because he knows he can&apos;t join.&quot; Upon returning to Japan in 1954, after taking a degree in English from Columbia University, he supported himself by teaching at Waseda University, in Tokyo, and writing film and literary criticism for the Japan Times, which he continued to do until suffering from a stroke in 2009. Over the decades he mingled with the novelists Yukio Mishima and Yasunari Kawabata, the actor Toshiro Mifune, the composer Toru Takemitsu, the Zen Buddhist scholar Daisetz Suzuki and another great western chronicler and translator of Japanese culture, Edward Seidensticker. Richie also played host to foreign guests including Truman Capote, Igor Stravinsky, W Somerset Maugham, Susan Sontag and Francis Ford Coppola. Yet, apart from his marriage to the American writer Mary Evans between 1961 and 1965, the openly bisexual Richie spent his time in Tokyo living alone. From 1969 to 1972, he was curator of film at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Richie&apos;s own experimental short films, such as Wargames (1962) and Five Filosophical Fables (1967), revealed a more ribald side, often hidden in his writings on Japanese culture, and inspired visual artists such as Takahiko Iimura, Yoichi Takabayashi and Nobuhiko Obayashi, alongside whom he received a group award at the Knokke-le-Zoute experimental film festival in Belgium in 1964. In 2007, an exhibition of Richie&apos;s paintings from the 1970s and early 1980s was held at the Nippon Gallery in Tokyo. For generations of scholars, critics and artists who have made Japan their field, Richie was a hugely influential and inspirational presence, opening a window on a ceaselessly fascinating world. Those who knew him personally will remember him for his endless approachability, enthusiasm, energy and generosity with his time, even in his final years of illness. Richie is survived by a sister, Jean.  \u2022 Donald Richie, author, film critic and artist, born 17 April 1924; died 19 February 2013"}, {"sentences": ["Having touched its highest level since September 2008 on Wednesday, Tokyo dropped 1.4%."], "tags": ["Fiscal cliff", "US news", "US taxation", "World news", "US economy", "Economics", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-21T19:06:41Z", "title": "US uncertainty over QE3 threatens markets", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/21/us-uncertainty-qe3-threatens-markets", "article": "Fears that the US will hit the brakes on its QE3 stimulus measures have cast a pall over global markets, threatening the new year rally that took many share indices to four-year highs. Leading stocks in London, which have been enjoying their best prices since October 2007, were pushed 1.62% lower, with the FTSE 100 closing nearly 104 points down at 6292. Having touched its highest level since September 2008 on Wednesday, Tokyo dropped 1.4%. Wall Street exchanges opened lower and continued to fall, extending the previous session&apos;s steep declines, which pushed the Standard &amp; Poor index of 500 leading companies to its biggest slump in three months. The new year rally began when a last minute agreement on the national budget saved America&apos;s economy from plunging over the fiscal cliff, and economic uncertainty from the US could now bring it to an end. However, markets were spooked when minutes from the US Federal Reserve&apos;s January meeting released on Wednesday showed its officials are divided over how long to continue QE3, as its third round of quantitative easing is known. The current round of asset buying, aimed at keeping long-term interest rates low in order to stimulate borrowing, was launched in September with a promise that it would be sustained until the labour market improved substantially. With the Fed spending $85bn (\u00a355.7bn) a month buying securities, and its balance sheet now at $3.078tn, many officials are concerned about the costs and there are signs the open-ended purchasing programme could be curtailed. The minutes stated: &quot;A number of participants stated that an ongoing evaluation of the efficacy, costs and risks of asset purchases might well lead the committee to taper or end its purchases before it judged that a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labour market had occurred.&quot; Any uncertainty over a core financial policy in the world&apos;s largest economy will unsettle investors whose confidence had been returning as Europe stepped back from the prospect of a break up of the single currency. &quot;What Wall Street wants to hear is an absolute sign that the Fed will continue with QE for the indefinite future,&quot; said Todd Schoenberger at Landcolt Capital in New York. &quot;When it says we may end it faster, that just raises the uncertainty and the market hates that.&quot; Confidence was further shaken by poor economic data released on both sides of the Atlantic on Thursday. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, while consumer prices were flat in January. In Europe, hopes the region could emerge from recession were dashed by the Purchasing Managers Index, which in February showed conditions in the dominant services sector had deteriorated.

While some were intrigued by the company&apos;s vision of a powerful PC-like console at the centre of a broad range of connected devices, others were frustrated by the lack of a physical product reveal, and by the familiar range of games on offer. Stage-managing the development and roll-out of the console is Shuhei Yoshida, Sony&apos;s head of worldwide studios. A vital cog in the PlayStation R&amp;D machine since the very beginning, Yoshida is a passionate gamer and habitual tweeter, providing a human face to the corporate edifice that is Sony.  I got chance to talk to him on Thursday, in his last interview of the day before returning from New York to Tokyo. Here&apos;s what he had to say. During the conference on Wednesday, Andrew House [Group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment] talked about how the PS4 was designed in conjunction with developers. This reminded me of PlayStation 1 and how Sony went around the world visiting studios and gathering opinions. Were you consciously returning to that way of doing things?It&apos;s interesting you ask that \u2013 and yes, when you look at it that way, we did a similar thing to when we made PS1. We kind of stopped doing that in later years, but this time, we made a conscious decision. Kaz Hirai instructed our development studio to be part of the hardware and platform group for PS4 and PS Vita in 2008. And also SCEI brought in Mark Cerny \u2013 who has been our longest partner, all the way back to the Crash Bandicoot days \u2013 as the system architect for PS4. He has had some part in the PS Vita development as well.  The initial brief from Kaz was, take the ideas and desire from game developers both internally and externally to create the new hardware. Yes, in retrospect, that is similar to our approach with PlayStation 1. What were the fundamental things that developers were asking for? From chatting to a few studios it seems social connectivity was a key element, but then the PC-like architecture has also been mentioned\u2026 Were these the two most common requests?Yes, I can say that. Development on PS3 was very hard because of the unique architecture, so we made the decision use a more popular architectures so developers would be able to use the same tools and engines, and make a seamless move to PS4 \u2013 that was a big focus. They also wanted a larger amount of system memory as well!  Connectivity was a big area, both between players and between devices. Developers are very far ahead in thinking how they can use different platforms and social network services with console games \u2013 we thought yes, that&apos;s what we want to do as well. These things can be done on the game side, but as with any other network features, gamers don&apos;t want to have to set-up lots of different accounts when they play different games. We wanted to provide these features from the system side so that people only have to download the application once, allowing them to connect their iOS and Android handsets to PS4. It&apos;s an additional option for developers to create their own dedicated applications on these devices, but I expect more developers will choose to use our app as it&apos;s so easy. It was interesting to see the indie game designer Jonathan Blow on stage at your event. How important is it to you to support smaller studios?I believe it&apos;s very important for the platform to have a wide variety of developers making things that are unique and creative. We&apos;re shifting our platform more and more to the digital side \u2013 PS4 will be similar to PS Vita in that every game will be available as a digital download, and some will also be available as a disc. The Witness will be a digital release and because of the flexibility of the digital distribution scheme, we can have more small games that might be free or available for a couple of dollars, or different services like free-to-play or subscription models.  On that subject, I really expected you to announce a &quot;Spotify for games&quot;-type service, allowing gamers to sign up and pay a monthly fee to access as many titles as they like. Is that something we can look forward to?As more and more services and contents become available digitally, we&apos;ll have more of an option to create attractive packages. So hypothetically we can look at different models \u2013 like a cable TV company. We could have gold, silver or platinum levels of membership, something like that. We can do subscription services when we have more content \u2013 especially now that we have the Gaikai technology available. With one subscription you have access to thousands of games \u2013 that&apos;s our dream.  What are you hoping to see from developers for launch?From the first-party standpoint we want to have titles that show the unique capabilities of the hardware \u2013 that&apos;s part of our remit. In terms of the number of titles, we don&apos;t control third-party publishers, but they&apos;ve been working on PS4 games for a long time. I expect many games \u2013 that&apos;s what we hear from our external development teams! It&apos;s not our role to pile on lots more titles.  How do you think developers will embrace your five guiding principles of PS4 gaming?These five key principles were the things that developers wanted \u2013 they&apos;re avid gamers too. They want simplicity and immediacy \u2013 it gets frustrating if you have an hour to play and have to spend half of that updating your game. We want to eliminate all of that. Our internal teams are the harshest critics of what we do \u2013 so we made immediacy the focus.  Some pundits say that consoles are dead or dying, that there&apos;s no need for dedicated games machines when we have smart TVs and tablets. How do you answer that?They need headlines! And they want us to say &quot;no, consoles are important&quot; so they can write more stories! Seriously, unless we show something unique and amazing, consumers won&apos;t be interested in dedicated hardware because they can play on devices they already own. So if the experience on PS4 is not greater than tablet, why bother? It&apos;s our responsibility to provide that, with the hardware and system features as well as game development. The game experience is not just playing, it&apos;s talking about games, it&apos;s watching other people play - that&apos;s all part of the enjoyment and we wanted to make that easier. It&apos;s like Media Molecule said \u2013 they want to make creativity easy for everyone. well, in the same way, we want to make sharing great moments of gameplay easier. Sony has been criticised for not actually showing the PlayStation 4 at the launch event. Was this because you wanted to save something for E3 or because you still have six different prototypes on your desk and can&apos;t decide between them?[Laughs] We have not finalised the hardware yet and decided not to try to get it finished in time. Also, it&apos;s a long time from February to launch, we have to design our communication in phases. Our focus here was to show some games and talk about the key principles \u2013 we wanted to save the unveiling of the actual console.  But is the design of the final console important to Sony? Is it a major consideration?I think if you asked different people within our company that question, you would get different answers! I was criticised when I said, why bother show the case? Who cares? Some said I was disrespecting people&apos;s curiosity \u2013 I apologise for that. But as a game developer, I&apos;m much more into how the games work, and the controller is crucial for us developers \u2013 without the input device we can&apos;t make games of the best quality. A box is a box to us! But yes, I appreciate that it&apos;s symbolic, people want a games console to look good so they can be proud of owning it and of course our hardware design team are working hard on that. This whole idea of removing the barriers to content seems to be a vital one. People can just switch on a TV and watch a programme, but deciding to play a game can be an arduous process of finding it, downloading it, downloading updates \u2026 Do you think that can all be consigned to the past?Absolutely. Yes. I find myself spending more time playing Vita games and I think part of the reason for that is it&apos;s immediate. I can stop at any time without quitting and it&apos;s instantaneous to start again. I don&apos;t have to quit out or reboot. It&apos;s wonderful. That&apos;s one part of immediacy \u2013 the other is waiting for downloads. That&apos;s ridiculous, that&apos;s crazy! We want to get out of this madness with PlayStation 4. The games are big, they&apos;re 50GB; download isn&apos;t instantaneous. So we&apos;re making purchase available from any device, so when you&apos;re at work, you can spend a couple of moments looking at PlayStation Store and choosing a game, and straight away it starts to download at home. It may take a couple of hours but that&apos;s okay because you&apos;re still at work.  Also, similarly to progressive download on some movie services, you don&apos;t have to wait for all the data to download before you start playing. Once you have the minimum amount of data downloaded you can begin the game, and while you play, the remaining data downloads. It takes some engineering input from developers so we&apos;re talking to the community. We&apos;re evangelising it.  We&apos;ve seen a lot of familiar brands \u2013 it seems that shoot-&apos;em-ups and driving games are still dominating. But I love games like Journey and Tokyo Jungle \u2013 how important is it that you ensure developers can explore offbeat concepts?I love these kinds of games! My top three favourite games last year were Journey, Tokyo Jungle and Sound Shapes. They&apos;re wonderful games. I spend lots of times tweeting about these games \u2013 I wish more people knew about them! What we&apos;re doing with PS4 is we&apos;re trying to serve the right content to the right people. So Sound Shapes and Tokyo Jungle might not be for everyone, but there are certain people who love those types of games \u2013 once we know you like games like Tokyo Jungle, when a game like that comes out, we can push it onto your main screen, and suggest you try it \u2013 that&apos;s what we mean by personalisation. We want more games like this on PSN, but these games have to reach the right people in order to be successful. We want to use our network services to achieve that. If you need any ideas for Tokyo Jungle 2, I have a lot.(Laughs) Well you know, the beauty of these games is that we never make sequels \u2013 there will be no Journey 2, I don&apos;t think. These developers tend to want to do new things. In a year&apos;s time, what will the PS4 gaming experience look like?In a couple of years I&apos;d like to be playing PS4 games on all my devices, with the main experience on the big screen, and smaller sections on mobile screens \u2026 It will all be connected."}, {"sentences": ["16:05: We&apos;ve yet to hear back from Pete in China about the oddest thing he has ever eaten but it will take a lot to beat Conor Aherne in Tokyo, Japan."], "tags": ["Premier League", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2012-13"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-23T14:06:09Z", "title": "Saturday Premier League Clockwatch \u2013 live! | Ian McCourt", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/feb/23/saturday-premier-league-clockwatch-live", "article": "That&apos;s all from me for today folks. Thanks for all the emails and especially the weird food riff. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday, where ever you happen to be. See ya! Full-time! Arsenal 2-1 Aston Villa Norwich 2-1 Everton QPR 0-2 Reading 0-3 Wigan WBA 2-1 Sunderland 16:50: Goal! Norwich 2-1 Everton (Holt) Oh Everton! You were winning! You were cruising to three points! But Grant Holt has scored his fifth of the season \u2013 and his first in nine \u2013 and so Norwich are going to take what was once yours. 16:48: Matthew Cobb&apos;s friend in Cameroon &quot;ate chili paste from a severed monkey hand, dipping it in the jar then sucking its bony dead fingers.&quot; I&apos;m not sure where to start with that one. 16:43: Goal! Arsenal 2-1 Aston Villa (Cazorla) From ten yards out, the Spanish midfielder gets his second of the day and may have just got his side all three points. 16:42: Goal! Norwich 1-1 Everton (Kamara) I told you it would be a draw. Kamara did the honours with a header. 16:42: Goal! WBA 2-1 Sunderland (Sessegnon) Sessegnon has given Sunderland some hope, cruel hope. 16:41: Goal! QPR 0-2 Manchester United (Giggs) Welbeck robs the ball in midfield, plays it to Nani and Nani puts Giggs through. The Welsh wizard sends the keeper the wrong way and that is that. 16:38: &quot;I live in Guangzhou and once ordered a dish called &apos;Snake Bite Chicken&apos;.&quot; says Will. &quot;It was fresher than I thought. It turned out that in the kitchen they get a living snake to bite and kill a chicken and then cook them both. The restaurant kitchen had big windows where you could view your dish being &apos;prepared&apos;. Interesting stuff.&quot; 16:37: Goal! WBA 2-0 Sunderland (Lukaku) Why did Chelsea let this guy go on loan? He is a great player and he has just got his second goal of the game. That one should give his side an insurmountable lead and all three points. Sorry for the delay on that goal being reported, more technical problems here in the GU. 16:30: By the way, if you think some of things people are confessing to eating here are strange, you should see the amount of emails that are simply unprintable. Honestly, it has opened my eyes wider than the Grand Canyon. 16:26: Goal! Arsenal 1-1 Aston Villa (Weimann) Villa break quickly from an Arsenal corner and Weimann, leading the break, has team-mates either side of him. But he don&apos;t need them, oh no. He looks up and he hammers one past Szczesny from about 25-yards out. The keeper really should have done better despite the lack of defensive cover. Oh Arsenal. 16:22: Remy has come on for QPR and sparked his side into life. They have just missed a decent opportunity as they pour the pressure on the Manchester United defence. Dave in Hong Kong has some culinary tips for all of us. &quot;I&apos;ve eaten caterpillar larvae encrusted in fungus. Steam for 15 minutes with a little salt added. Tastes like turnip but less crunchy.&quot; 16:18: You know that feeling you get when your stomach turns because you&apos;ve got some bad news or you have to fly or you&apos;ve just watched 90 minutes of Scottish football, well that&apos;s how I feel having read what Michael from Cork ate when in Japan. Let me share that feeling with you by printing his email. &quot;At the risk of infuriating eco-warriors when I lived in Japan the strangest thing I had was undoubtedly raw whale ovaries. It was vile \u2013 extremely rubbery&quot;. 16:15: RED CARD! It&apos;s a high tackle, it&apos;s up Figueroa&apos;s leg and Pogrebnyak is off for an early shower after what can only be described as an industrial tackle. Just when you thought it couldn&apos;t get any worse for Reading, it does. Figueroa was lucky to leave that challenge with his leg intact. 16:11: &quot;Strangest thing I&apos;ve eaten?&quot; asks Pete in China &quot;Deep-fried ice-cream was surreal. Scorpion is crunchy. Bees served in honey was most apposite and probably the weirdest taste sensation so far.&quot; Conor Aherne&apos;s title for eating the oddest thing ever is safe for now me thinks, though bees does come close. 16:07: Goal! Reading 0-3 Wigan (Figueroa) Figueroa picks the ball up at the half-way line plays a lovely-jubbly one two and then slots the ball home. Game! Over! Reading are heading for the second slot form the bottom of the table and very possibly relegation. 16:05: We&apos;ve yet to hear back from Pete in China about the oddest thing he has ever eaten but it will take a lot to beat Conor Aherne in Tokyo, Japan. &quot;As for the strangest thing I have put in my mouth in Japan: Shirako \u2013 Fish Sperm! What a night that was!&quot; 16:01: We&apos;rrrrrrrrrre back. By the way, in all the madness of the Wigan goals, forgot to mention that Manchester United fans should be down on their knees and saying their prayers as RVP has been taken off injured. It looked like a hamstring-gah! but he did run off the pitch so maybe it won&apos;t be too bad. Eeeeep. 15:56: Much to my amazement, there seems to be loads and loads of people out there in China reading this blog. One of them is Liam. &quot;Greetings from China! Shanghai in fact. Monday is the Lantern Festival, the final day of the New Year Festival, so the fireworks are going off again. Fireworks &amp; Footie and a few cans of Tsing Tao at midnight. Can&apos;t beat it. Kung hei fat choy!&quot; Tsing Tao is an absolute belter of a beer, from what I remember. 15:50: Pete in China, are you still out there? The questions are flooding in for you. Nick Williamson was first so we will start with him. &quot;Can you ask Pete what the strangest thing he has eaten (at least to Western eyes) since he has been there? And did he enjoy it?&quot; I once ate scorpion in China, beat that Pete! Some half-time scores: Arsenal 1-0 Aston Villa Norwich 0-1 Everton QPR 0-1 Manchester United Reading 0-2 Wigan West Brom 1-0 Sunderland 15:46: Goal! Reading 0-2 Wigan (Kone) Oh this is nice and there is no doubt over who got the final touch this time as Kone dinked the ball over an Federici. There is little better than a dink is there? Wigan are well on their way to their fourth away win. 15:44: Goal! Reading 0-1 Wigan (Kone) There is some confusion over who got this for Wigan but from here, it looks like Kone was the man with the final touch though Figueroa is trying to claim it. 15:39: Goal! Norwich 0-1 Everton (Osman) Baines whips one from the wing and Leon Osman rises above the defence to nod it home and his side into the lead. So a few minutes ago when I asked if someone was out there, someone in China perhaps? Well, Pete is in China and has emailed in to say hello. &quot;What would you like to know?&quot; he asks. I&apos;ll level with you Pete. I didn&apos;t expect someone from China to really email in so I don&apos;t really have anything to ask. Does anyone else have a question for Pete? 15:36: Goal! WBA 1-0 Sunderland (Lukaku) Steve Clarke was angry a few minutes ago but he can smile now that his side have been awarded a penalty for a handball by a Sunderland defender. Lukaku steps up and slams the ball down the middle of the goal and into the welcoming arms of the net.   15:31: Ben Roberts was at the early game today and he has some very positive things to say about his experience. Here&apos;s what he has to say. &quot;I just went to watch Fulham vs stoke in the &apos;neutral zone&apos; for a fiver. What a bargain! I&apos;m a Huddersfield Town fan, so even though I&apos;m used to a higher quality of football, this was decent enough. It&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve watched Berbatov live, and I kept an eye on him throughout the march. A few neat passes aside, he really did spend most of the match propping up the advertising hoardings with a fag and a pint. But then all of a sudden, there he was, underneath the ball as it ballooned out of the 6yard box. He almost seemed offended that he had to lift his leg up to send the ball arcing and fizzing into the top corner. Fulham fans and neutrals alike leapt to their feet in awe. A wonderful moment.&quot; Steve Clarke, meanwhile, looks angry. How angry? Very. The reason? WBA have just had a goal disallowed when the referee called them back instead of playing advantage. 15:26: Goal! QPR 0-1 Manchester United (Rafael) Oh wow! Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow. Rafael has scored the goal of his life. He has just belted one from about 25-yards out. It&apos;s an absolute screamer. He will never do anything better than that. Never. He should just walk off the pitch right now and never play football again. 15:22: There be may no action out east or in the middle of the country but there is quite a bit in west London with Hernandez and Manchester United at the centre of it all. The striker has just had two good opportunities but the deadlock remains in place. 15:18: Aston Villa, and Agbonlahor in particular, has just missed a decent chance to bring his side back into the game. Meanwhile, Rohit Kapur has been in touch. &quot;I&apos;m sitting at my girlfriend&apos;s house in rural Wisconsin, with no cable, and the only internet connection available on the computer being dial-up. DIAL-UP. My cellphone is infinitely faster. So today, I&apos;m totally reliant on your text-based updates to guide me.&quot; I apologise in advance Rohit. Elsewhere, there is zero goalmouth action at Norwich v Everton. The same applies for WBA and Sunderland. 15:13: Speaking of leagues we don&apos;t like to mess with on Clocko, Simon McMahon has just sent in his standard Saturday Scottish email update. Here&apos;s the words he has typed out on his fancy iPad for your pleasure. &quot;Afternoon Ian. Game of the day in Scotland is tomorrow when the upwardly mobile Dundee United FC take on Hibs at Tannadice. If other results go our way in today&apos;s games involving Kilmarnock, Aberdeen, St. Johnstone and Inverness we could go third with a win tomorrow. It is ON!&quot; 15:10: Ehhhhhhh, we don&apos;t generally mess with the lower leagues in this here Clocko business but it&apos;s probably worth mentioning that Bolton are already 3-0 ahead of Hull. Three! After 10 minutes! Woof! 15:06: Goal! Arsenal 1-0 Aston Villa (Cazorla) Well that did not take very long did it? Santi Cazorla drives low and hard past Brad Guzan to record his 10th goal of the season for the Gunners. After an awful few days, Wenger can finally smile and smile like he means it. 15:05: Hellllllloooooooo. Anyone out there? China? There has been an early chance at Reading by the way. Federici pulled off a magnificent save to keep it level however. 15:00: Herrrrrrrrre we go! Big Stan is at the Arsenal game by the way, that&apos;s the Kroenke version of Big Stan, not the ex-Ireland manager version of Big Stan. 14:55: The first email of the afternoon comes from Ryan Dunne, who really should have better things to do today. Here&apos;s what he has to say: &quot;Hawrite Ian! Ooh, with all the tech troubles it&apos;s like a post-apocalyptic MBM! Don&apos;t worry, if robots, monkeys or mutants ever rise up and become humanity&apos;s overlords, I&apos;ll still be here, bashing F5 and invoking romantic desperation and the Glorious Glasgow Rangers! Given that you&apos;re a family friend of Daniel Day-Lewis, I was wondering if you could tell us if he&apos;s planning any special hat-trick celebration if he wins his third Best Actor Oscar tomorrow. Is he essaying Tardelli as we speak? That would be cool!&quot; I think &quot;family friend of Daniel Day-Lewis&quot; is stretching it just a tad so I&apos;m afraid I am unable offer any insight into his celebrations for tomorrow night. Ho hum. I haven&apos;t been to the cinema since Holy Motors so have no idea re the upcoming Oscars. Is he going to win? 14:40: Fulham have taken all three points from Stoke by the way, thanks to an absolute belter of a goal from Dimi Berbatov. 14:34: Folks, a word of warning, we are having something of a technical meltdown here in GU Towers in a cloudy north London, that has me, at least, weeping like a new-born baby. We have limited access to just about everything but we&apos;ll be doing our best to bring you all the usual jazz and bells and whistles that accompanies the Saturday Clockwatch. With that warning out of the way, here are today&apos;s teams. Arsenal v Aston Villa Arsenal: Szczesny, Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Monreal, Arteta, Wilshere, Cazorla, Walcott, Giroud, Diaby  Subs: Koscielny, Rosicky, Podolski, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ramsey, Mannone, Gervinho Aston Villa: Guzan, Lowton, Clark, Baker, Bennett, Westwood, Delph, Agbonlahor, Weimann, N&apos;Zogbia, Benteke Subs: Marshall, El Ahmadi, Holman, Sylla, Bowery, Dawkins, Lichaj.

Subs: Bardsley, Kilgallon, Vaughan, Mangane, McClean, Cuellar, Westwood. 14:16: So back to that panning out question. Starting in order of the home team that has the least letters in their name, it&apos;s the battle of the As as anxious Arsenal altercate against atrocious Aston Villa. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will have quite the job on his hands to motivate his players for this encounter after, you know, what happened the other night. Luckily enough for him, Aston Villa should not provide anything like the challenge posed by the Bavarian boys. Paul Lambert&apos;s lads have won just two games on the road this season and are not exactly in the form of their lives, with just the width of a paramount point separating them from the rest of the relegation fodder. Despite that, they do have hope and that comes in the colossal constitution of Christian Benteke; the forward has now scored six goals in his last five all-competition games for the Villains (this is most consistent form of his entire career). Not bad, not bad at all. Will he still be there next season? Eh, no. Next up then is what is going to be the most exciting game of the day *insert sarcasm here* as Reading welcome Wigan to Junction 11, M4, Reading, Berkshire, RG2 0FL. OK, OK, maybe it won&apos;t be that bad. There will be goals after all, especially with cALamity Habsi in goal (see what I did there? Clever, eh? What do you mean, no?) \u2013 the Wigan keeper has made more errors leading directly to a goal than any other player in the Premier League this season, consistently costing his side points and places in the league. The only thing is you&apos;re going to have a long-ass wait for those goals to come. You can&apos;t be relying on Wigan to score \u2013 they only average one per game away from home this season \u2013 while a whopping-would-you-believe-it 42% of Reading&apos;s goals have come in the finishing 15 minutes this season. 42! Seriously. After all that jazz, all signs point to a draw at Carrow Road where the Canaries host Everton. &quot;If you have a problem, if no one else can help and if you can find them \u2013 maybe you can hire the A-Team,&quot; ran the introductory voice over for the greatest TV programme ever but the A-Team wouldn&apos;t have been able to help you eke out a 0-0 draw in the Premier League like Norwich could. No other side has managed as many of them this season than these birds. Added to that, the last three games between them and Everton have all ended in draws (1-1, 2-2 and 1-1) and the fact that neither are in sparking form and you see why all signs point to a draw. Finally, nothing else is surer today than Queens Park Rangers will get stuffed by Manchester United which leaves us with West Bromwich Albion v Sunderland, a match that will cure any insomniacs within a 1,000 mile radius and West Brom will win 2-0. All in all, should be more fun than a weekend with Banana Man. 14:00: In episode 3F17, when Martin Prince earns $600 from &quot;Go to work with your parents day&quot; he decides to treat himself to a sinful shopping spree of the goods on offer at Wee World. The young man buys Flipsy the flipping, yelping, tartan-dressed dog and, as he approaches Bart, Milhouse and Nelson to inquire about their various days at &quot;work&quot;, he can clearly be seen holds a stuffed-bag of other assorted goods from the shop. But then a strange conversation takes place: Bart: We are having the best spring break of our lives and we don&apos;t need you around nerding it up. Milhouse: That job is taken Martin: But surely I and my $600 could play some part in your vacation fun? I mean, what are we to believe, that this is some sort of a *snorts and chuckles* magic wad of cash or something? And when Homer meets George Harrison, he sees that the best Beatle has a brownie in his hand. Given Homer&apos;s predilection for all things sweet, he squeals in delight, and when Harrison point him in the direction of a massive bank of brownies, he displays sprinting skills usually devoid in a man of his girth. However, when Homer rushes over and starts cramming his kisser with the good stuff, the pile doesn&apos;t get any smaller. I mean, what are we to believe, that this is some sort of a *snorts and chuckles* magic mountain of cash or something? Those are two thundering questions that need answering ASAP but there is an even more pressing one than that \u2013 yeah I know, I am surprised too \u2013 and that&apos;s how is today&apos;s football going to pan out? But before we answer that, let&apos;s have a look at what&apos;s on offer today: Arsenal v Aston Villa Norwich v Everton QPR v Manchester United Reading v Wigan West Brom v Sunderland"}, {"sentences": ["He also made regular appearances with Tokyo&apos;s NHK Orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris and the Israel Philharmonic."], "tags": ["Classical music", "Opera", "Berlin Philharmonic", "Music", "Germany", "Europe", "World news", "Conducting"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-24T18:19:14Z", "title": "Wolfgang Sawallisch obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/24/wolfgang-sawallisch", "article": "Once described as &quot;a sphinx in a tailcoat&quot;, the German conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch, who has died aged 89, conducted supremely idiomatic performances of Richard Strauss. His personality always melded seamlessly with the music he conducted. Though he enjoyed great veneration, the suave and personable Sawallisch did not cultivate it. &quot;He never made a star of himself,&quot; said the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. &quot;He wants to make music \u2026 untrammelled.&quot; She added: &quot;It&apos;s a wonderful sensation. It&apos;s as if you&apos;re in private.&quot; Sawallisch&apos;s restrained physicality, contradicted by the occasional, discreet leap at the end of The Firebird, later gave way to a particularly intense passion. In middle age he had a certain emotional aloofness, yet his readings of Shostakovich and Brahms symphonies in his 70s were described as &quot;suffocating&quot; in their extremity. His Beethoven Pastoral symphony left hardened recording engineers in tears. While his early 1970s recordings of the Schumann symphonies with the Dresden Staatskapelle had long been considered classics, Sawallisch eclipsed even his own standard with the Philadelphia Orchestra&apos;s 2003 live recording of the Symphony No 2 \u2013 despite such ill health that some feared he would collapse mid-performance. The spur of this Indian summer was a personal sadness. Sawallisch&apos;s change in temperament \u2013 which showed itself only in certain repertoire \u2013 dated from the death of his wife of 46 years, Mechthild, in 1998. In the months following, the maestro was known to break down during rehearsals of Austro-Germanic repertoire, but he refused to discuss his inner life, aside from saying: &quot;I&apos;ve never felt such a close relationship with\u00a0music.&quot; Born in Munich, Sawallisch studied at the city&apos;s Wittelsbacher-Gymnasium and the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik. His training as a pianist was interrupted by the second world war, during which he was a radio operator in the German army stationed in Italy. He was captured and spent time in both American and British PoW camps. After the war, he started as an opera house r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur in Augsburg, Bavaria, then graduated to conducting there. He furthered his operatic activities as general music director in Aachen (1953-58), Wiesbaden (1958-60) and Cologne (1960-63). He had early success with the Berlin Philharmonic and at the Bayreuth festival and was among the youngest to ever conduct those orchestras. However, Sawallisch turned down offers from the Metropolitan Opera and Vienna State Opera early on, claiming he lacked experience. In doing so, he risked alienating two of the industry&apos;s great power brokers, Herbert von Karajan (who offered the Vienna invitation) and the Met&apos;s Rudolf Bing. Instead, Sawallisch pursued three careers concurrently. He headed the Vienna Symphony Orchestra (1960-70) as principal conductor, and was music director of the Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra (1961-73) and artistic director of Geneva&apos;s Orchestre de la Suisse Romande (1973-80). He also made regular appearances with Tokyo&apos;s NHK Orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris and the Israel Philharmonic. He crowned his career with his 10 years as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra (1993-2003), succeeding Riccardo Muti in the role. Sawallisch&apos;s primary opera appointment was as music director of the Bavarian State Opera (1971-92), where he conducted 1,156 performances, including virtually every Strauss opera with the curious exception of Salome. Though Sawallisch&apos;s pianistic activities were mainly limited to chamber music and lied recitals with artists such as Schwarzkopf, Hermann Prey and Thomas Hampson, he played the entire first act of Die Walk\u00fcre from the keyboard \u2013 nearly note perfect \u2013 when a snowstorm prevented Philadelphia Orchestra members from showing up on one occasion during the 1993-94 season. Sawallisch made hundreds of recordings, his early efforts including concerto outings with the violinist Johanna Martzy that were suppressed because of tempo disagreements. He expressed affection for his recordings of\u00a0Strauss&apos;s Capriccio with Schwarzkopf,\u00a0Mozart piano concertos with Annie Fischer and his set of Schumann symphonies with the Dresden Staatskapelle. Though his recording repertoire was mostly standard and conservative, his concert repertoire was full of contemporary music. In his late 70s, he premiered major orchestral pieces by the American composers Aaron Jay Kernis and Jennifer Higdon. His taste could be surprisingly idiosyncratic and he championed obscure Richard Strauss, such as The Happy Workshop. Although he most wanted to revisit late Schumann works, such as the Requiem and Scenes from Goethe&apos;s Faust, the Philadelphia Orchestra&apos;s management prevailed upon Sawallisch to consolidate his many years with the Schumann symphonies in new recordings of them. Critics in New York as well as Philadelphia greeted the performances from which they were recorded with deep gratitude. But even as he was months away from his 80th birthday, Sawallisch would have preferred to push into less familiar repertoire: that was music that needed him more, and Sawallisch always put the needs of music first in his priorities. Made conductor laureate of the Philadelphia Orchestra in 2003, he went on to spend many years in retirement in his country house in Grassau, southern Germany. His primary musical outlet was playing the piano, which he did excellently and mostly for himself. For many years, until ill health prevented it, he received Philadelphia Orchestra musicians in his home when the orchestra was touring Europe. His son J\u00f6rg died earlier this year. \u2022 Wolfgang Sawallisch, conductor, born 26 August 1923; died 22 February 2013"}, {"sentences": ["Just like tiny Goto, the city struggles to hold on to young talent as graduates seek employment in Tokyo or elsewhere."], "tags": ["Local government", "Communities", "Society", "Japan", "World news", "Renewable energy", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-26T13:30:00Z", "title": "A Japanese economic-growth plan shows the benefits of local autonomy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/26/japanese-economic-growth-local-autonomy", "article": "Goto, a remote island off the coast of south-west Japan near Nagasaki is an unlikely birthplace for a model society. But with local industry struggling and a population in decline, it has been selected as a testbed for the region&apos;s new social and economic strategy. On the mainland, Nagasaki faces the social and economic problems that British former industrial strongholds such as Liverpool and Sunderland would recognise \u2013 problems writ large across the whole region. The city was once the nation&apos;s shipbuilding hub and although major players such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries remain, they offer fewer jobs than ever before. Just like tiny Goto, the city struggles to hold on to young talent as graduates seek employment in Tokyo or elsewhere. Its population (now 1.43 million) has been shrinking since the early 1980s, the workforce is ageing and land values are also heading south. There is an urgent need for economic growth. Yet, unlike many British cities, Nagasaki has a convincing vision for its future. Its prefectural government (comparable to a large county council or combined regional authority) has set out a \u00a542bn (\u00a3295m) &quot;green deal&quot; for the region that links plans to increase tourism and improve its record on sustainability to its economic and industrial future. The plan is this: make up the population gap by encouraging tourism and use the tourist industry to spread sustainable behaviour such as driving electric vehicles (on Goto, for example, all hire cars are already EV or PHV vehicles). Then use this expertise in eco-sustainability to develop a new industry in green technology (Mitsubishi is already gathering expertise in offshore wind) to create jobs. If this &quot;green deal&quot; succeeds, it could convince the Japanese government to site a new offshore green energy hub within the prefecture, turning the region&apos;s fortunes around. As Takahiro Suzuki, director general of the Nagasaki prefectural government, says: &quot;This is a challenge to create a new society model from the island region \u2026 harnessing Nagasaki&apos;s character and strengths to simultaneously promote twin goals of industrial development and job creation, and lowering carbon and going green.&quot; The strategy could solve many of the region&apos;s problems at a stroke. On Goto, the small-scale test of the approach, tiny electric mobility vehicles have been designed for older residents, reducing the number of cars on the island. Local energy powers these vehicles, with a floating wind turbine working just off\u00a0the archipelago. The policy has not been without problems \u2013 there has been no true community engagement in its design and consultation with local business extends only as far as sharing information. In this respect Japanese councils could learn from some British counterparts. One obstacle is that Japanese society, based on a culture of hierarchy and respect for authority, precludes any genuine consultation for fear of causing offence. As a result, the work in Goto has focused almost exclusively on tourists and attracting new business, rather than changing the behaviour of households and developing existing local business \u2013 with more than one car per household on the island, no sustainable society can be built by tourists alone. There are lessons, in return, for British authorities from the bold vision of Nagasaki&apos;s senior officers and politicians. Imagining and believing in a different future for an area in decline takes strength. Of course, it is easier to think big when central government is still providing investment (two-thirds of the funding required for Goto&apos;s electric vehicles was provided centrally). But though tussles between the two power bases are still common, Japanese local authorities have a greater share of responsibility, autonomy and fiscal control than British councils. The message for Whitehall? Give councils their freedom and they could grant you that elusive prize: economic growth. \u2022 Hannah Fearn&apos;s travel expenses in Japan were covered by the Japan Local Government Centre"}, {"sentences": ["It&apos;s no longer designed in an Ivory tower somewhere in Tokyo, it&apos;s shared with us, with Naughty Dog, with Sony San Diego \u2013 and together we&apos;ve built the machine."], "tags": ["PlayStation 4", "PlayStation", "Games", "Technology", "Sony", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-27T10:00:00Z", "title": "PlayStation 4: how developers helped build the console of the future", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/feb/27/playstation-4-developers-console", "article": "The Cell processor must have seemed like a good idea at the time. A complex, proprietary setup, with a central PowerPC core and eight independent co-processors, it was powerful and multifaceted, but difficult for under-pressure studios to get to grips with. The major problem was, the design ran against the prevailing trends in PC architecture and, in an era of multiplatform development, this meant developers rarely got the chance to push it to the maximum.  Sony learned its lesson. Four years ago, when the company started R&amp;D on the console&apos;s follow-up, a different approach was decided on. While Cell was an internally devised project, co-developed with IBM and then presented to the development community, PlayStation 4 would take a more democratic approach. Just as it did with the original Playstation in the early 90s, Sony would go on the road, and ask studios what they wanted. Or at least that&apos;s the story hinted at during the PS4 launch event last Wednesday.  But was that the reality? It seems so, according to Sony&apos;s first-party teams. &quot;We&apos;ve been very closely involved in the development of the machine,&quot; says Herman Hulst, the co-founder of Guerrilla Games. &quot;We&apos;ve had [PS4 system architect] Mark Cerny over several times. We got the entire group of core developers together and gave deep feedback on everything system-related. It&apos;s no longer designed in an Ivory tower somewhere in Tokyo, it&apos;s shared with us, with Naughty Dog, with Sony San Diego \u2013 and together we&apos;ve built the machine. As Mark said at one point during the launch event, it&apos;s a console for gamers by gamers.&quot; And it turns out developers were pushing for two things: tighter, more seamless social connectivity, and a design philosophy more in line with modern PC innards, so that teams immediately understood and could work with the hardware. &quot;This platform is great to work on because of the PC-like architecture,&quot; confirms Hulst. &quot;It&apos;s very easy for the engineers to get their heads around. We had the game up and running very early. We&apos;ve now had two and a half years of development time, which was about what I&apos;d want for a title of this scope \u2013 and the team size is about 150 people, it&apos;s only a little bigger than Killzone 3. We&apos;ve invested a lot in tools, and in various clever ways of having more and more detailed assets, but tools are the key - we&apos;re getting smarter.&quot; Killzone: Shadowfall game director Steven Ter Heide reckons that PS4&apos;s shift toward the PC, with its eight cores, AMD GPU and 8GB of memory, will lead to an accelerated rate of evolution \u2013 in other words, the gap between PS3 and PS4 games performance will widen much more quickly. &quot;If you look at the transition between PlayStation 2 and PS3 and the launch titles on the latter machine, then look at the launch titles for PS4, I think you&apos;ll see a much more impressive leap in quality,&quot; he says. &quot;I think the console and the ability for us to work with it has shown that we can make that leap much faster \u2013 we as developers are much closer to the insides of the thing.&quot;  For Ubisoft it seems, the concerns were more about game design, and about how Sony would need to shift focus to appeal to a more connected generation. &quot;We were pushing for social,&quot; says its chief executive Yves Guillemot. &quot;The features that exist today with the PC and smartphones, we wanted to make sure we could use those elements on the console. The PS4 lets you have friends watching and helping you in the game \u2013 you&apos;ll be able to have an experience that&apos;s more connected all of the time. When you have millions of people playing something, achieving things together, you can introduce meta games \u2013 some really interesting features.  &quot;It will mean community games rather than playing games alone. When my children play, they always have their friends popping up on screen, and they&apos;re pushed out of their single-player campaigns because they want to play with friends. Now we have the possibility of merging multi- and single-player components. If your friend pops up you can play the single experience, but within that, your friends can help you progress.&quot; Perhaps it&apos;s ambitions like this that inspired Sony to make its $380m bid for Gaikai, the cloud computing company whose technology is built into the PS4 infrastructure. It allows streaming access to game demos of course, but also (we&apos;re promised) more integral remote play connectivity with Vita \u2013 as well as the ability to take control of a friend&apos;s game, helping out if they&apos;re stuck. Seamless cross-platform communication with smartphone and tablet devices also seems to have been something Ubisoft was interested in \u2013 and something that Sony is set to deliver. Guillemot envisages a new era of collaborative gaming in which players draw non-gaming friends into specific group challenges. &quot;You could have a game that requires certain resources, and to get them you have to perform actions that could only be achieved using smartphones or tablets,&quot; he says. &quot;You could encourage friends to do these, and give them rewards on their own devices. It&apos;s an exchange.  &quot;We could have big global meta games which require people with smartphone connections. You may have a game that requires language decryption so you could have specialists helping online \u2013 a whole community can work together. That&apos;s just an example, but many games could use communities in this way.&quot; According to Matt Southerns of Evolution, developers have also been involved in the design of the peripherals, especially the new Dual Shock, with its new touchpad and LED light array. Evolution apparently pushed for more exact tilt controls, so now the pad functions well as a steering wheel. &quot;One of the most positive parts of the development was the work on the controller,&quot; he says. &quot;We all had a secret meeting after E3 last summer and shared our own prototypes, we called it our science fair! There was lots of very open feedback and constructive criticism from a wide variety of studios. That was important because it meant we could build a controller that was a design classic but also embraced a new age.&quot; Steven Ter Heide talks about how Guerrilla&apos;s key concerns were the ergonomics \u2013 they suggested changes to the triggers, adding an outward curve for better tactile feel. &quot;We also pushed for the headphone jack because we wanted to lower the threshold to multiplayer gaming,&quot; he says. &quot;Everybody should be able to go online and chat. It ended up on there and it&apos;s awesome. These sounds like really simple features but it makes all the difference; and just those little tweaks to the indentations on the sticks \u2013 they&apos;re slightly raised so there&apos;s more positioning. It feels really nice.&quot; Guillemot hints that, alongside Watchdogs, Ubisoft is preparing to announce an original IP for next-gen machines this year, probably at E3. &quot;Each time a new console arrives, you have the possibility to come in with new creative ideas \u2013 so we will try to bring in those new ideas,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;ll know more in the future. The goal is to take advantage of what those consoles bring.&quot; This is vital. Both Sony and Microsoft have to produce hardware that will inspire developers as well as impress consumers: this is a much more complicated industry now; consoles are having to compete for development support with a whole host of devices \u2013 we&apos;re seeing a huge migration of small and mid-sized studios to PC and smartphone. They need to be seduced again \u2013 hence the consultation on architecture, and the placing of a developer, Mark Cerny, in a key position of power on the engineering side.  We as gamers should remain sceptical until the machine arrives but despite a downbeat press response to last week&apos;s event, positivity is emerging from the development community. &quot;We have a double revolution,&quot; says Guillemot. &quot;The revolution of graphics, AI and animation, but we also this huge social revolution, of making sure the game understands who the player is and what they want \u2013 a more personalised experience.  &quot;This is the future. If we manage to combine these elements, the industry is back on track for the next ten years.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The top two Asian based teams in each pool get together in Tokyo for the second round, which is a modified double elimination format - Miami hosts the games for the teams based in the Western Hemisphere."], "tags": ["World Baseball Classic", "MLB", "US sports", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-01T12:00:00Z", "title": "The World Baseball Classic is back", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/mar/01/world-baseball-classic-2013-preview", "article": "In the run up the World Baseball Classic all the talk has been about what player from which country isn&apos;t going to play for whatever reason. If the likes of Yu Darvish (Japan), Justin Verlander (USA), Travis Blackley (Australia) and several Cubans playing in MLB, effectively banned from their national team aren&apos;t in, then why should I be? Well, I hear ya, but I&apos;m here to tell you that you&apos;ll be making a mistake if you ignore the Classic, which will be played out for a third time starting Saturday.  Back in 2006, the WBC became the first tournament in baseball history to put professional players in national team colors after the International Baseball Federation, Major League Baseball and professional leagues from participating countries came together to produce an event that would crown a true world champion for the very first time - not to be confused with a World Series champion of course. It was also one of several reasons that baseball got canned from the Olympics a few years later, the WBC serving official notice that active Major League players would never play in the Games because Major League Baseball would never, ever pause its season to accommodate the IOC as the NHL has done in recent years.  Finally, those of us who were pining for such an event had reason to celebrate, others were about to be exposed to something as close to top flight international baseball as we are ever going to get, while Major League Baseball team officials began their new quadrennial past time of complaining about how many of their players were leaving Spring Training for over two weeks (the Twins and Brewers are among teams sending the most players, the Mets are only sending David Wright while the A&apos;s are sending no one).  Personally speaking, I was hooked (although I am an easy sell) from the very first WBC game I watched - Panama vs the mysterious Cubans in March &apos;06. I had just arrived in Costa Rica, finding the first round contest on the hotel television despite the protests from my future wife who, for some reason, wanted to leave the hotel room and get to the beach. I wasn&apos;t moving - locked into a chaotic ninth inning.  Panama gave up two runs in the top half of the frame before rallying to tie it up in the bottom of the inning. Cuban hurler Yuniesky Maya came within a hair of gifting the Panamanians an upset victory, just missing Ruben Rivera with a bases loaded pitch. &quot;It&apos;s March and it feels like October,&quot; I thought. &quot;This is incredible.&quot; Cuba, which needed special permission from the United States government to even compete at the event would win it in the 11th - I began our vacation in the doghouse.  At some point during this World Baseball Classic that Fall feeling will return, along with a postseason atmosphere that makes you wonder how and why it took so long to get this tournament together in the first place. (It&apos;s worth mentioning that according to Growing the Game by Alan M Klein, MLB officials began discussing a World Cup as early as 1993, with drug testing and dealings with the Japanese and Korean leagues amongst the reasons it took 13 years for the WBC to come to fruition).  There will be drama, as we saw when Japan beat South Korea in the 2009 final - Ichiro belting a two out run-scoring double in the 10th, helping to secure his country a second straight title in front of nearly 55,000 at Dodger Stadium.             There will be intrigue, like when the Dutch wiped the smiles off Jose Reyes&apos; and David Ortiz&apos; Dominican Republic team, not once, but twice four years ago, proving that a European team could indeed do damage against a baseball powerhouse.  Yes, these moments will come, and you will be into it, despite an imperfect tournament with its share of flaws. Loose citizenship requirements mean that players have an easier time representing countries they could never play for if it were, say, a FIFA World Cup. There are restrictions on pitch counts that remind us of the leash around the necks of the players, many of whom are out of form following the offseason. Then of course are the players that opt out, some due to pressure from their teams, who keep a watchful eye on their assets.  There is also room for debate as to what is the right timing for the WBC. I wouldn&apos;t mind seeing it played out in November after the World Series, with players not involved in MLB and other leagues&apos; post-seasons keeping warm in training camps. Yes, the powers-that-be would prefer to not take on the NFL, not to mention the start of the NBA and NHL seasons, and there are doubts that players, already exhausted from a full season, would want to stick around and wait for a tournament, but, a November tournament could potentially allow for fewer restrictions on players who could go all out and still have around three months to rest and recover from any injuries.  Still, despite the lack of a perfect time to play the event and the issues surrounding a tournament in its infancy, the WBC&apos;s glass is more than half full - there are some 45 all-stars set to play while it is set to feature two qualifying teams, baseball outsiders Brazil and Spain, for the first time. The WBC&apos;s creation of a qualifying round helps to legitimise it as a truly global event - it&apos;s now an open door affair that includes countries such as Thailand, Israel, Great Britain, Germany and New Zealand, after they battled for those two spots late last year. That&apos;s good news for countries where the sport is seeking to plant roots.  So, how does it all work? I&apos;m glad you asked.  The two opening rounds are split up geographically, with eight teams based in Asia and eight based in North America and the Caribbean. Starting out east, in Pool A, Japan, Cuba, China and Brazil are in Fukuoka, Japan while Taichung, Taiwan hosts Pool B, where Chinese Taipei, South Korea, Australia and those pesky Dutch are setting up shop. Those games are first up starting on Saturday.  On March 7th, Pool C and D get going - Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Spain and PR will play in San Juan while Phoenix plays host to the USA, Mexico, Canada and Italy.  The top two Asian based teams in each pool get together in Tokyo for the second round, which is a modified double elimination format - Miami hosts the games for the teams based in the Western Hemisphere. Two teams advance from each group to the Championship Round which will be in San Francisco from March 17th - 19th.  Who will take the colorfully named World Baseball Classic trophy? Well, it probably won&apos;t be Spain or Brazil, especially with the first Brazilian born player to reach MLB, Yan Gomes, disappointingly not participating. I&apos;d like to say it&apos;s wide open, but it&apos;s not, the Japanese will make it a trifecta as the US disappoints, again. Despite the fact that Japan will be without any MLB players, meaning Ichiro and Yu Darvish are out, they send the best men from their league and take this very, very seriously. That&apos;s not to say other teams don&apos;t care, because they do, and even though many players aren&apos;t in mid-season form, when the chips are down, I trust they&apos;ll be sliding head first into first base (even though we all know it isn&apos;t very smart when it comes to staying healthy).  Part of what makes the WBC so welcome is the change of pace - different uniforms, teammates facing off, Cubans hugging during pitching changes, a refreshing change from the norm, not to mention the monotony of Spring Training. It&apos;s early days, and the event still needs baseball outsiders such as Italy and Australia to become competitive to really boost baseball to another level globally. Still, coming into its third edition, the WBC has at the very least carved a substantial niche in the sporting calendar, something that seemed a distant possibility only a short time ago."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;You know that I&apos;m gonna come back around,&quot; promises singer (crooner) Anthony Calonico, adding: &quot;No pressure, don&apos;t worry,&quot; before ever so slightly losing his cool: &quot;You know that I don&apos;t want to fuck around.&quot; The urge to share his affections with the female population of Little Tokyo increases on Don&apos;t Stray, a deeper foray into downtempo electronic balladry and, at seven minutes and 45 seconds, an epic of etiolated rhythm and sorrow."], "tags": ["Indie", "Music", "Pop and rock", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-05T16:56:16Z", "title": "New band of the day: Rare Times (No 1,465)", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/05/new-band-day-rare-times", "article": "Hometown: Los Angeles.

I&apos;m constantly re-seeing my city through the excitement of others.&quot; Bernhardt, who witnessed the dotcom frenzy, sensed perilous froth in the current boom. &quot;It does feel very bubbly to me, the salaries, the rents, the sheer number of companies starting up.&quot; Many if not most of the startups would fail, he predicted, but that did not necessarily spell disaster since they would probably &quot;fail faster and cheaper&quot; than dotcom predecessors, and regenerate.     Jack Rikess is facing eviction from the flat he's called home since 1984 as his landlord hopes to raise his rent and attract the younger, richer potential residents.

Fleets of company buses with Wi-Fi allow them to commute and live in the city, prompting intense competition for apartments. &quot;Call it rebellion, but they don&apos;t want to live in Pacific Heights or Russian Hill or Nob Hill, the traditional desirable areas,&quot; said Turner, the realtor. Instead they moved into previously dilapidated areas such as SoMa, the Mission and Dolores Park, often paying cash. &quot;You can&apos;t judge by appearances. A guy in torn jeans and a t-shirt could be the founder of a big company.&quot; Hip bars, cafes and in some cases bike lanes followed in their wake. The Mission district, once seedy and violence-prone, was changing fast, said Sandy Cuadra, a longtime resident. &quot;Before I&apos;d hear conversations about a fight here, a fight there. Now it&apos;s iPod this, Google that.&quot; Average home prices in San Francisco jumped 15% to $725,000 last year. Average rent jumped 12.9% to $2,734 per month. Realtors expect that to accelerate this year. One consequence is the building of pint-sized 220 square foot apartments which rent for $1,300 per month, pricier than Tokyo and Manhattan&apos;s equivalents. The property scramble spelled trouble for the poor and middle-income earners, said Ted Gullickson, director of the San Francisco Tenants Union, an advocacy group. Landlords were using a state law to override rent control and expel tenants: so-called Ellis Act evictions had tripled in recent months, he said. The same thing happened during the dotcom bubble, but Gullickson said the current boom&apos;s apparent sturdiness meant the trend may continue indefinitely. &quot;It&apos;s outsiders who come to work for Facebook, Google and Twitter and the like and they&apos;re sucking up the property. We need to restrain the tech companies to mitigate the impact on the existing community.&quot; Jack Rikess, 56, a poet and magazine writer, and his wife pay about $1,000 in controlled rent per month for a flat in the Haight-Ashbury district they have called home since 1984. The Grateful Dead and the 1967 summer of love blossomed a few blocks away, and a hippie vibe endures to this day. Three months ago the landlord sent Rikess, and his elderly neighbours in two adjacent apartments, letters requesting they leave because he wished to sell the building. &quot;Google kid&quot; arrivals to the neighbourhood, said Rikess, had driven the market rental rate to over $4,200 and the landlord wished to cash in. &quot;We&apos;re being evicted because we&apos;ve been here too long.&quot; Rikess is fighting the eviction but bracing for exile. &quot;If we lose we&apos;ll have to leave the city, way out, 50 miles.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["It is not just about sushi and rice, according to Professor Kenji Shibuya and colleagues at the University of Tokyo, writing in the Lancet in 2011."], "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Health", "Life and style", "Society", "Alcohol", "Smoking", "Fitness", "Transport", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-05T18:13:33Z", "title": "Ten ways to live longer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/mar/05/ten-ways-to-live-longer", "article": "The British are less likely to live long and healthy lives than the inhabitants of most European countries \u2013 and we also trail Australia and Canada, whose people are more likely to be dancing a jig at a lively old age than we are. This is the daunting conclusion of an analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease study of the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle, comparing the UK with 18 other comparable countries and published in the Lancet medical journal. The UK ranked 12th out of 19 countries of similar affluence in 2010. We have the NHS and much of the rest of the world envies us for it, but how long and healthily we live is not so much about how hospitals look after us \u2013 medical care contributes only about 20% to our healthy lifespans \u2013 as how we care for ourselves before we get there. Here are 10 tips for a longer, healthier life. 1 Move to Japan With the highest healthy life expectancy in the world, as well as the longest lives for women (men in Andorra just pip their Japanese counterparts to first place), Japan is clearly the place to buy a 1LDK (one room apartment with a living, dining and kitchen area). Space may be limited but a healthy life is not. On average, Japanese women can expect 75.5 years of good health while men enjoy 70.6 years. In the UK, we get 70.1 years and 67.1 years respectively. It is not just about sushi and rice, according to Professor Kenji Shibuya and colleagues at the University of Tokyo, writing in the Lancet in 2011. &quot;Japanese people give attention to hygiene in all aspects of their daily life,&quot; they said. &quot;This attitude might partly be attributable to a complex interaction of culture, education, climate [eg humidity, temperature], environment [eg having plenty of water and being a rice-eating nation] and the old Shinto tradition of purifying the body and mind before meeting others.&quot; (Not something we can replicate with a little bottle of hand sanitiser on the desk.) They have regular health checks.     We weren't designed to sit around \u2013 so get running. Photograph: Hero/Corbis    2 Get your blood pressure checked Like checking the pressure of the tyres on your car, this is a very good idea. Some people have high blood pressure in the family. Others eat too much salt, don&apos;t take enough exercise, are overweight, stressed, smoke or drink too much. Most of this you can do something about, but for those who don&apos;t, a trip to the GP, who will prescribe pills, may prevent a heart attack or stroke. High blood pressure is the No 1 risk factor for early deaths and years of poor health in Europe. But if you have low blood pressure and none of the above risk factors, just a routine check on any visit to the GP for other matters is enough. 3 Eat seeds \u2013 not junk Curiously, the Global Burden of Disease lists not only eating too little fruit (sixth-highest risk factor for early disease and death) but too few nuts and seeds (not far behind, at eighth). Too few vegetables are 12th, and low omega-3 (in oily fish, not tablet form), high processed meat and low fibre follow in that order. Too much trans fat is 19th, low calcium is 22nd and low milk consumption 23rd. So, yes, diet matters a lot and not just because eating too much makes you fat \u2013 high BMI or body mass index has a separate ranking as the fourth highest risk factor, causing heart disease, strokes, diabetes and cancers. But on a diet of nuts and seeds it is also pretty difficult to get overweight. 4 Drink in moderation One or two units a day may help reduce heart disease, but most people drink a lot more and it is doing us an increasing amount of damage. Alcohol can cause cirrhosis, which is now the 12th-highest cause of death and ill health in western Europe, fatty liver disease and liver cancer. It is also implicated in other cancers \u2013 mouth, throat and breast. And then there are all the accidents and fights in which people get hurt or killed. 5 Get your running shoes on We were not designed to sit around and it&apos;s not good for us. The chief medical officer (CMO) says there are both mental and physical benefits to exercise. It reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes, but it also improves our self esteem and reduces the symptoms of depression and anxiety. Exactly how much exercise we need is a trickier question. The CMO says adults should be active every day. Over a week, we should be &quot;moderately active&quot; for a total of at least two and a half hours, which means brisk walking and cycling at a pace that warms you up and makes you breathe harder but still allows you to chat. Thirty minutes for five days of the week would do it. Or you can get really physical and take 75 minutes (total) of &quot;vigorous activity&quot; in the week, such as running, swimming or playing football. But we should all be either using weights or carrying heavy shopping bags to improve our muscle strength on at least two days a week as well. Got that?     Only half of long-term smokers see age 70. Photograph: PA    6 Don&apos;t smoke Predictable but true. Smoking is likely to shorten your life and worse, make you suffer before you die. It is responsible for the miserable last years of most people with lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as triggering one in six cases of heart disease \u2013 the biggest killer in the UK. Only half of long-term smokers live past 70. 7 Stay out of hospital Hospitals are dangerous places. There is always a risk of catching something when you are there, even though the superbug MRSA and C Difficile rates have come down and are not so much discussed at the moment. Falls in hospitals are also not uncommon, because patients can be both unsteady on their feet and uncertain of where they need to go. Good hospitals try to ship out elderly people as quickly as possible. Keeping fit and healthy \u2013 see smoking, drinking, diet and exercise above \u2013 will keep most of us off the wards for longer. 8 Don&apos;t get stressed We do anxiety far too well in the UK. We were 15th worst out of 19 countries in the Global Burden of Disease tables for years lost to its disabling effects. One option would be to move to Spain, which scored highest in Europe for long and healthy lives (70.9 years compared to 68.6 in the UK) and also had the least anxiety. Remarkable, when you consider their economic woes and the numbers of people now out of work. Their lives appear to be healthier than ours in a number of ways \u2013 their rates of ischaemic heart disease (where the blood supply to the heart is reduced because of furred up arteries) are much lower and they score better on asthma, breast cancer, alcohol misuse and self-harm. Could it be something to do with sunshine or is it olive oil, tomatoes and fish? Perhaps both. Alternative ways to reduce stress and anxiety include exercise (see above), time to yourself and, says the NHS Choices patient website, talking to the boss about changing your working hours. Oh \u2013 and developing a sense of humour. 9 Take the train Road injuries were the 12th-highest cause of years of life lost in the UK in 2010, but if you take just adults aged 20 to 54, they were fifth \u2013 after heart disease, self-harm, cirrhosis and breast cancer, and just above drug use. According to the independent Oxford healthcare journal Bandolier, which used 2006-7 data from sources including the World Health Organisation and the Department for Transport, the lifetime risk of dying before the age of 75 are one in 976 in a car, one in 54,433 on a plane and one in 131,313 in a train. 10 Live in the south of England, not the north The north-south divide is for real. A major study published by the British Medical Journal in 2011 found that people who live in the north of England are 20% more likely to die before the age of 75 than those in the south. The researchers from Manchester University said the gap had reached its widest point for 40 years. The reasons are complex. The researchers said that &quot;socioeconomic, environmental, educational, genetic and lifestyle factors&quot; needed to be looked at \u2013 as did the reasons why government efforts to bridge the gap fail. On the other hand, it is far easier to find a stunning and uncrowded beach for a jog on the north-east coast \u2013 but swerve the fish-and-chip restaurants and make do with a packet of unsalted peanuts."}, {"sentences": ["A series of British Council workshops and seminars in Hong Kong and Tokyo have been exploring the reasons behind what remains a considerable equality gap in virtually every country in the world."], "tags": ["International", "Higher Education Network", "Professional development", "Recruitment and HR", "Management and administration", "Higher education", "Education", "University administration"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-06T15:50:33Z", "title": "Gender equality in higher education must be made a global priority", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2013/mar/06/gender-equality-universities-global-issue", "article": "Around one in five UK university professors are female. That&apos;s better than 3%, which was the figure in 1989. But it&apos;s nowhere near parity \u2013 and in many parts of the world, the number of women working at the top level of academia or in senior university management positions is far worse. The failure of higher education institutions to fully accept women into their most senior structures has led female academics to demand a radical solution. At the British Council&apos;s Going Global conference in Dubai, an international grouping of senior women called for equality to be made a key performance indicator in quality audits of higher education institutions. The fewer women at the top table, the idea goes, the lower down the league tables a university would slide. It&apos;s the first demand of six in what is being called a Manifesto for Change for Women in Academic Leadership and Research. Female academics, the manifesto says, must also start getting a lot more of the big money for research projects, with &quot;gender implications and impact&quot; being included by grant making bodies as criteria against which funding applications are assessed. Other points include a requirement for &quot;mainstreaming&quot;, so that diversity is fundamentally incorporated in all of a university&apos;s practices and procedures, and the creation of a global database on women and leadership in higher education, so that it&apos;s easier to see how slowly \u2013 or indeed how fast \u2013 the situation improves country by country. A series of British Council workshops and seminars in Hong Kong and Tokyo have been exploring the reasons behind what remains a considerable equality gap in virtually every country in the world. Evidence from an international group of female academics has been analysed by Professor Louise Morley from the Centre for Higher Education and Equality Research, who says that patterns of discrimination appear similar across national boundaries. &quot;Barriers include the failure to recognise, identify and nurture women&apos;s talent, the gendered division of labour inside the academy, with women frequently responsible for the organisational housework, [and the] view that men are more suited to leadership authority,&quot; says Morley. In regions which seem to show less discrimination against women academics with ambitions to progress, a range of factors come into play. Sometimes those factors are not particularly positive: in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, Morley explains, female academics have been able to rise up the career ladder because the profession isn&apos;t perceived as desirable, prestigious, or sufficiently well-remunerated by men. Some barriers apply globally, but others are distinct and particular to a region. Indonesian PhD student Lishia Erza-Evans notes that because her country is made up of 17,000 islands, access to university level education is the first problem to be solved. &quot;Women in eastern parts of Indonesia tend to find bigger challenges in pursuing postgraduate degrees as they might have to travel long distances,&quot; she says. &quot;Culturally as well, men usually get the first option to go outside of their island to pursue higher education. Distance and technology enhanced learning is not impossible in this day and age, but for this to be accessible, infrastructure plays a huge role. The government must take the lead in pushing for more infrastructure development.&quot; Building better infrastructure is expensive, but other actions to support women can be simple and cheap. Morley cites Norway&apos;s mainstreaming practices, which include gender analysis, development programmes, mentoring, and quota systems, and Austria&apos;s Excellentia programme, which offers financial incentives to universities that appoint women to the professoriate. In Sweden, where women make up 43% of vice-chancellors, Morley says &quot;the appointments system has made a difference [with] more accountability and vice-chancellors appointed by the state, rather than by individual universities.&quot; Where women have gained significant seniority \u2013 no matter which country they work in \u2013 they will often have had to fight against powerful expectations of the role they should prioritise: that of mother and home-maker. &quot;Whilst my children needed time and attention from me, I also had to establish myself and prove my capabilities at work,&quot; explains professor Rohayu Abdul-Ghani, now deputy director at Universiti Kebangsaan, Malaysia. &quot;There was no support from the university, at least none that I was aware of other than the flexibility in my work hours, which was a great help but in itself not enough.&quot; Without her husband&apos;s unstinting (and in Malaysian culture, highly unusual) support for her career \u2013 which came at some cost to his own \u2013 Abdul-Ghani says she would most likely have found it impossible to progress into senior management. If a woman is building her career, she cannot bear the workload of family life alone, she continues. &quot;It would be utterly ridiculous to expect career-women on leadership paths to continue to play the role of traditional women. Such expectations and any attempt to fulfill them would only lead to additional conflict, stress and possibly burnout.&quot; While some Malaysian government appointments mean that women have gained vice-chancellor positions \u2013 there is a stated target of 30% \u2013 more action needs to be taken, says Abdul-Ghani, not least because some women have declined senior administrative roles when they have been offered. Mentoring, though it may sound soft and fluffy, can be enormously influential, she believes, and there must be more of it. The need for a space in which female academics can share experiences and support each other&apos;s ambitions is all too evident in Morley&apos;s response to a question over the costs of pursuing seniority in academia. &quot;Leadership is perceived as unattractive by many women,&quot; she explains, &quot;not just because of the long-hours culture \u2013 many women work very long hours anyway \u2013 but because senior leadership can involve implementing unpopular neo-liberal reforms, being in the minority as a woman, and having to constantly prove one&apos;s worth in cultures that do not respect women&apos;s authority. Women have the additional workload of dealing with sexism and discrimination. All of this takes a toll on one&apos;s work life balance, health, social life and general well-being. Many women report a sense of fragility and precariousness and always feeling at risk.&quot; As a high-flying businesswoman able to see the world of academia from an outsider&apos;s perspective, Erza-Evans agrees. &quot;To build a career, academic or others, women tend to have to work harder and longer. We have to endure various external and internal challenges. We are expected to do everything all at once and to be flawless at that too \u2013 for example, if you miss a paper deadline because your child is ill, you&apos;re not cut out to be an academic because you are an emotional woman who cannot prioritise!&quot; Policy measures are needed, but so are practical and imaginative ideas that can be applied globally, not just in one country or region. And it&apos;s not just tinkering at the edges that will make the difference in the end, says Abdul-Ghani. &quot;Higher education must make appointment of women academic administrators and development of young female academic talents part of their strategic goals. I have seen this to be effective at [my university] with the setting up of gender diversity as a key performance indicator. In addition, the institutes are held accountable for gender diversity and for the remedial measures to be taken where necessary. Until this is done, women academics will continue to be excluded and marginalized from becoming senior, influential players in HE.&quot; &apos;Going global&apos; Manifesto for change \u2022 Equality as quality \u2013 equality as key performance indicator in audits, and gender equity included in reputation league tables \u2022 Research grants \u2013 monitoring of applications and awards made to women, with gender implications included in assessment criteria \u2022 Journals \u2013 editorial boards, and appointments of editors, need more transparent selection processes, and policies on equality \u2022 Data \u2013 establishment of global database on women and leadership in higher education \u2022 Development \u2013 more investment in mentorship and leadership development for women and gender included in existing programmes \u2022 Mainstreaming \u2013 review of work cultures to ensure diversity is mainstreamed into all organisational practices and procedures We will be hosting a live chat on gender equality in global higher education on Friday 8 March, 2013 from 12\u20132pm GMT \u2013 email claire.shaw@guardian.co.uk if you are interested in joining our panel This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Inside the wrecked facility, construction workers rush to complete state-of-the-art equipment that will remove dozens of dangerous radioactive nuclides from cooling water. Soon, a steel shield will be driven into the seabed to prevent contamination from the plant from leaking into the Pacific Ocean. Almost two years after a deadly tsunami crashed into the plant, crippling its backup power supply and triggering the world&apos;s worst nuclear crisis for a quarter of a century, the gravest danger posed by Fukushima Daiichi has passed. But for all the signs of progress since the Guardian visited the atomic facility a year ago, the biggest, and most complex, nuclear decommissioning operation the industry has ever seen has barely begun. The pipes, cables and other equipment strewn across the plant&apos;s grounds this time last year are now functioning components in a complex, technologically fraught mission to cool the crippled reactors, while experts struggle to figure out how to extract the melted nuclear fuel lying deep inside their basements. The three reactors struck by meltdown and hydrogen explosions two years ago were brought to a safe state known as &quot;cold shutdown&quot; in December 2011, nine months after the tsunami left almost 20,000 dead or missing along Japan&apos;s north-east coast. Now, Japan is about to embark on a clean-up that could cost at least $100bn \u2013 on top of the cost of compensating evacuees and decontaminating their abandoned homes. Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s manager, Takeshi Takahashi, conceded that decommissioning the plant could take 30 to 40 years.     Fukushima's reactor No. 3 (left) and No. 4.  Photograph: Asahi Shimbun/Getty Images    &quot;Even though we are still faced with a difficult task, we&apos;ll keep pushing on with the decommissioning process,&quot; he told a small group of visiting foreign journalists on Wednesday. &quot;It will take a long time to complete our work, especially on the three reactors that suffered meltdown, but we&apos;ll do our best to keep them stable.&quot; The clean-up operation will begin at building No 4, where the fuel rods inside survived unscathed after it was hit by the tsunami, then badly damaged by a hydrogen explosion. By the end of this year, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) says it will begin removing fuel assemblies from the reactor building&apos;s storage pool and placing them in a nearby cooling pool, where they will remain for four years before being stored in even safer dry casks in a purpose-built facility on higher ground. In total, workers will have to extract more than 11,000 new and used fuel assemblies from seven badly damaged storage pools. Work to remove melted fuel won&apos;t begin until 2021, and the entire decommissioning project is expected to take up to 40 years. Managers from firms contracted by Tepco to help decommission the 40-year-old plant say they are confident progress is being made, despite the radiation hazards faced by their employees. Perhaps the most dangerous job on the site has fallen to Hiroshige Kobayashi and his colleagues. As a manager at Kajima Corp, Kobayashi is responsible for clearing and processing the rubble and debris from reactor No 3, where radiation levels easily outstrip those at other parts of the site. On the ocean side of neighbouring reactor No 4, where a meltdown did not occur, Tepco recently measured radiation at 172 microsieverts/hour; but in the same area outside reactor No 3, levels soar to 1,710 microsieverts/hour. By comparison, a chest X-ray is equivalent to 50 microsieverts and a return flight between Tokyo and New York 200 microsieverts, according to the Japan Atomic Energy Agency. The dangers associated with working in highly radioactive areas of Fukushima Daiichi prompted the World Health Organisation (WHO) to warn last week that one-third of the plant&apos;s workers face an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer, leukaemia and all solid cancers during their lifetimes. Kobayashi declined to comment on the WHO report, but acknowledged that workers face unprecedented danger from persistently high radiation levels. &quot;It&apos;s a fact that the levels in reactor No 3 are very high, so we are trying to deal with that by using remote control technologies and staying as far away from the reactor as possible,&quot; he said. Hopes that robots would quickly be able to reach areas of the plant inaccessible to humans suffered a setback when Quince, a $6m robot, lost contact with its operators while monitoring inside one of the reactors in October 2011. &quot;We&apos;re in a situation where we&apos;re using technologies we&apos;ve never experienced before, such as GPS and lasers when we&apos;re dealing with the debris,&quot; Kobayashi said. Although Tepco has managed to insert remote-controlled cameras into the damaged reactors&apos; outer vessels, it is still no closer to gauging the state of the damaged fuel \u2013 a prerequisite for removing it. To add to Tepco&apos;s troubles, irradiated water is increasing at such a pace that the utility is running out of space for the tanks it needs to store it. Several strong quakes have shaken north-east Japan since 11 March 2011, but Takahashi insisted that the reactor No. 4 building \u2013 where 1,500 fuel assemblies stored in a pool on the top floor have drawn concern because of their vulnerability to seismic activity \u2013 could withstand an earthquake of similar intensity to the one that destroyed the plant two years ago. Despite those reassurances, Takahashi conceded that the plant has become the focal point of a nuclear crisis whose victims, like the facility itself, are a long way from returning to any semblance of normality. On the drive through the 20-kilometre evacuation zone to Fukushima Daiichi, visitors pass entire villages that remain frozen in time. Half a dozen cars sit abandoned in a supermarket car park, shops and restaurants lie deserted, and thousands of black bags filled with contaminated soil and grass cover fields once used to grow rice, while authorities decide how, and where, to dispose of them. The only movement comes from lorries carrying equipment and building materials, and buses ferrying workers in protective blue and white clothing to and from the plant. Meanwhile, the tens of thousands of residents who once called this forbidding landscape home still have no idea when, or if, they will be able to return. Repeating Tepco&apos;s mantra of the past two years, Takahashi apologised &quot;to the world&quot; for the &quot;inconvenience&quot; caused by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. While he shared his colleagues&apos; optimism over decommissioning, it was tinged \u2013 as his surroundings demand \u2013 with realism. &quot;It will be a long time before this power plant becomes a part of history,&quot; he said."}, {"sentences": ["San Francisco, Beirut, Melbourne, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur."], "tags": ["Chefs", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-07T16:06:00Z", "title": "Live chat: Yotam Ottolenghi", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/mar/07/live-chat-yotam-ottolenghi", "article": "Yotam Ottolenghi, the Guardian&apos;s fantastic food columnist, will be live online to answer your cooking questions from 12-1pm today, Friday 8 March.

Yotam Ottolenghi    His TV series, Ottolenghi&apos;s Mediterranean Feast, is currently showing on Channel 4 on Sunday nights. Feel free to post a question about the first two episodes, on Moroccan and Turkish cuisine, or the forthcoming programmes about Tunisian and Israeli food. Ottolenghi has also published three recipe books, Ottolenghi, Plenty and Jerusalem. If you struggled with any of the recipes, or just want to sing the praises of a great dish, let him know below.

Top with water and cook covered on very low heat for 15-20 minutes. Once done, fold in freshly chopped herbs. Sparebulb says: I&apos;m a caterer and I need some vegetarian soup recipes that could be made ahead and would keep warm for up to four hours of service. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Sparebulb - Thank you. I always find that adding a herby paste to a soup that sat a while adds a necessary freshness. I&apos;d make chickpea or butterbean (or both) soup with diced carrots, harissa, coriander seeds, thyme and garlic.

In the summer za&apos;atar is the best thing you can add to a simple chopped salad of tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes. Juneowl asks:  If you could use a time machine to bring four people to dinner and prepare a meal for them, who would you invite? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Juneowl - that&apos;s a hard one. Perhaps I&apos;d try to get Jesus, Mohammad and Moses to sit together and sort out our problem. twistedtwister asks: What are your thoughts on meat &apos;politics&apos; eg frequency of eating it versus land required for animal protein? And do you have an opinion on the horse meat &apos;scandal&apos;?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @twistedtwister - People should eat what they like. That&apos;s my basic conviction. However, it is hard to justify the amount of meat and fish we consume these days. The world&apos;s population just cannot afford to eat meat three times a day anymore.In my mind, if you are not a vegetarian, the best thing you can do for the planet and for yourself is eat less meat and fish. Instead of a steak have meatballs with lots of other stuff added to them. Have fewer meals with meat and less meat per meal. Consider making meat or fish something reserved for special occasions, like dinner or the weekend. rackham10 asks: Why do you use so much salt in your cooking? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @rackham10 - must raise my hand up, I do love salt. It just brings out all the other flavours. Still, I will keep an eye and see where, if possible, we can reduce. julieoakley says: I just wanted to write to say how much I love, love, love your recipes \u2026 and you are the only person (in your book Jerusalem) who has shown me how to get chickpeas soft enough to make hummus without boiling them for hours and hours. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @julieoakley - thanks so much. I love hearing this and even blush a little. John Watters asks: What is the secret to the perfect falafel? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @John Watters - Number one secret, which isn&apos;t really a secret: fry it and eat it. Never let is stand. The chickpeas are soaked, not cooked, before being ground, ideally in a meat grinder, or, if using a food processor, don&apos;t overwork. The rest is almost immaterial. Salt, spices, that&apos;s it. EllaEllaEllaAA asks: If you were asked to prepare a classic British plate of food, what would you prepare and why? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @EllaEllaEllaAA - Some great British creations are the Yorkshire pudding, which I can have anytime, anywhere, a good trifle and a rich fish pie. These are immortal classics that I love. Rachaelworld asks: I have difficulty getting the timing right when using fresh herbs and spices. Are there &quot;rules of thumb&quot; that you use, and do they vary depending on the ingredient?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Rachaelworld - My trick is adding the aromatic (ginger, garlic, herb, grated citrus etc) both at the beginning and a small amount at the end of the cooking. This way you get the mellow, cooked aroma in the background and the more punchy immediate flavour in the foreground. Squeakyball says: I just wanted to say thank you for Jerusalem (the book not the city). For Christmas last year we ignored tradition and instead had some 14 dishes all from your book.  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Squeakyball - pleasure. Well done for being brave and straying away from tradition once. lowtide55 asks: What is your favourite vegan dish? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @lowtide55 - mejadra! I love rice and lentils with tons of spices and fried onion. Though I often spoil its vegan-ness with a dollop of yoghurt on top. Sorry.... JamieLondon89 asks: If you only had 30 mins to prepare and cook a quality dish, what would it be? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @JamieLondon89 - Asian noodles (soba or udon), simmering away, at the same time I saut\u00e9 some mushrooms in veg oil. Once cooked I add rice vinegar, sugar, lime juice, ginger and salt. Remove from the heat and pour over the cooked and drained noodles. Leave to cool down a little before adding picked coriander, basil, little bit of sesame oil and sesame seeds. FreddyP asks: Are there any good non-virgin olive oils you can recommend for day-to-day cooking? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @FreddyP - I wouldn&apos;t be a purist when it comes to olive oil. Okay, for a good dressing I&apos;d spend a little more but for everyday cooking you can use cheaper varieties. wmffra asks: What would be your ultimate dinner party three course? Also, Heraclitus said that &apos;One can not step twice in the same river&apos;, why is that exactly? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @wmffra - this main course you can prepare in advance and just stick in the oven when ready: http://scrapbook.channel4.com/bookmarkBar/50aa1acfe4b09b08528a6da7 Serve it with bread and a lemony green salad.For a starter go for some fresh figs (when in season), serve with a young goat&apos;s cheese.The 3rd time you step in the river you may drown I suppose. niamhie asks: Parsnips - help please! I can&apos;t get on with their cloying sweetness. Is there something that will make them a bit less nauseating? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @niamhie - why eat them then? But if you insist, cut into batons and blanch them until soft. Dress immediately with lemon juice, a little vinegar, chives, olive oil and salt and pepper. When cool, fold in feta chunks and rocket and serve. nabisco asks: Was that wasabi-in-the-guacamole inspired by Dr Steve Brule? Have you tried making sushi with peaches? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @nabisco - no to both, I&apos;m afraid. MrSnickers asks: I have a severe intolerance to wheat and when it comes to your recipes that feature freekeh and bulghur etc, I&apos;m generally stuck with what to use as a substitute. Any suggestions and/or general advice would be much appreciated! Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @MrSnickers - first, thank you! Very often you can replace wheat with rice or barley. If you can have it, you may want to try faro, which is low in gluten. Quinoa is fantastic too. Just adjust the cooking times. Good luck! farofa asks: What is the secret of good melawach? And, knowing it is buttery, why do Yeminis live so long?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @farofa - I don&apos;t think I know the secret. Sorry.I don&apos;t think longevity has got much to do with diet, though. It is much more about a healthy mind. LondonRevisited asks: Do you know why Rick Stein can&apos;t make a program about foreign cuisine without saying &quot;It&apos;s so much better than how we cook it in Britain&quot;, or some other xenocentric cliche about the food he encounters? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @LondonRevisited - I am not sure. I am inclined to say something that may sound diplomatic but I truly believe in. There are good cooks and crap cooks everywhere. There isn&apos;t such a thing as bad cuisine. Harrynilsson asks: What is the secret to making the best hummus? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @harrynilsson - hah! Smooth smooth smooth chickpea paste. Enough tahini paste, lemon juice and salt. No oil in the actual hummus mix. Lancuna asks: What is your go-to, easy pasta dish that we can replicate on lazy days? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Lancuna - I cook a basic tomato sauce (tomatoes, onions, celery carrots, thyme, olive oil) and add a tin or two of smoked oysters, with their oil. Can&apos;t beat that one. Meepmeep asks: Which is the best vegetable? I say onion, my girlfriend says tomato, but we both suspect it might be the aubergine. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @meepmeep - gosh, how do I answer that? Kholrabi? ;) IamMichieBoo asks: I was curious how you came to make your Tofu-fa dessert at Nopi, as it is incredibly similar to the beancurd custards that we have in Singapore. Were you inspired by a trip out to South East Asia? Are there other South East Asian dishes that you&apos;d like to replicate or adapt for Nopi? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @iamMichieBoo - definitely. The tofu-fa was inspired by a trip to Malaysia. Scully, our head chef, is of Malaysian origin and includes many chilli pastes and regional pickles. Toruhaslostacat asks: Is falafel a social construct or does it exist in nature? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @toruhaslostacat - they grow on trees. Gingerinlondon says: You inspire me to be better cook; to be a better person (you are so humble and so genuine with the people you have visited on your tv programme) and to travel more extensively. Please keep doing what you are doing - you have such integrity. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @gingerinlondon - thanks so much! BadUsername asks: Where do you get your great shirts? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @BadUsername - love your question. Paul Smith, Vivienne Westwood, Gant, Ralph Lauren. Pricey, I know, but hey, I&apos;m gay. Vespermartini asks: What is it that drives / motivates you and the seemingly endless enthusiasm and passion for what you do and what would your one piece of key advice be to someone who would like to emulate your success? Also, as you have covered the Eastern Mediterranean is there any chance of you heading over to the West and exploring the cuisine and working the Yotam magic?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @vespermartini - Thank you. I am constantly inspired by the people who work with me at Ottolenghi and NOPI. They come from all over the world and always have something new to offer. Traveling is also a constant source of inspiration. Westward - def one day. Samanthat123 asks: What&apos;s your favourite way of making sweet potato? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @samanthat123 - thinly sliced and fried, sprinkled with salt. Susannah_M asks: Do herbs and spices go stale over time? Is it better to make your own blends (eg za&apos;ater), pestle &amp; mortar vs machinery. I notice you use many fresh herbs. What are your thoughts on dried herbs and things like frozen garlic/ginger cubes?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Susannah_M - ta. You should always smell your spices. Once they have lost their aroma there&apos;s no way back. I say buy ground spices if you haven&apos;t got much time, or grind your own if you can. Dried herbs are good substitutes to fresh only in some occasion but not often. Chloemae asks: Do you have any recipes for Middle Eastern sweets, as an idea to give as presents at Easter? Also, I&apos;m looking for a recipe for a leg of lamb.  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Chloemae - For sweets I really recommend ma&apos;amul. There are recipes online and in our book Jerusalem. This lamb dish fits the bill, I believe: http://scrapbook.channel4.com/bookmarkBar/50a0f9ace4b09b085289c048 BodenVictim asks: Do you have any tips for the perfect muhammara? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @BodenVictim - Thanks. Funny, muhammara is also one of my favourites and I never managed to get it quite right. I think it has a lot (!) to do with the quality of the walnuts. I&apos;d try the recipe when walnuts are fresh, during the autumn. Thewhisperingeye asks: I ate at Nopi the other day and it was fantastic - how do you get the Kale side dish so full of flavour? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @thewhisperingeye - Thank you! The kale is cooked with lots of good olive oil, julienned ginger and finished with lemon juice. Judy63 says: I just wanted to thank you for what you do with vegetables Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @judy63 - thank you. peeledapples asks: Do you have any recommendations on how to get the best out of celeriac?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @peeledapples - my favourite is raw celeriac. Cut into matchstick size and dress with lemon juice (of course), chopped capers, crushed garlic, a little mustard, olive oil, chopped chive and chopped tarragon. DimSumYum asks: London/Jerusalem excluded, is there a town/region that you would choose to live for it&apos;s cuisine? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @DimSumYum - a few. San Francisco, Beirut, Melbourne, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur. Katchuri asks: I&apos;m intolerant of lettuce (possibly the stupidest food intolerance I&apos;ve ever heard of, but sadly true) and have recently discovered I can eat things like pak choi. Any ideas for livening up pak choi etc? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @katchuri - At least you can eat bread! Treat Pak Choi it as you would spinach or chard. Cook, drain well and blitz with eggs, breadcrumbs and feta to make fried patties. Or shred finely (raw) and male a slaw using other shredded veg (cabbage, beet), lime juice, veg oil, sesame oil, a bit of maple syrup. lantos csenge asks: Do you have any secret tips about what kind of dishes should we add pomegranate molasses; and preserved lemons? Thank you. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @lantos csenge - molasses - marinade for chicken, salad dressings, dressings for legumes such as butterbeans, drizzle over crushed sweet potato.Preserved lemons - all stews, spicy sauces, when making mayo. Bellagiornata asks: l managed to get some sumac &amp; some pomegrante sauce, how best could I put these ingrediants to good use with what type of meat? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Bellagiornata - mix them together and marinate lamb cutlets, or chicken, or rabbit. Use more later to freshly drizzle once cooked. Squashy asks: One of my favourite items from your shops is the savoury muffin (basil, pine nuts, cherry toms, etc) but I can&apos;t find the recipe anywhere. Care to share? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Squashy - would love to! But it ain&apos;t gonna happen... ;-) langley_becky asks: Whenever I&apos;ve made falafel they&apos;ve always fallen apart during cooking. Does the method above prevent this? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @langley_becky - it&apos;s tricky. Try pressing well to compact. You&apos;d also need to add a little flour and water. Make sure the oil isn&apos;t too hot or it will blow them away. LaCoccinelle says: I&apos;ve been buying your books for presents for the past few years and introducing you to my friends and family. Everyone loves them, thanks from all of us. My favourite recipe is butternut squash, red onion, tahini and za&apos;atar. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @LaCoccinelle - thanks for sharing! Zordkhan asks: All my family and friends have fallen for chocolate krantz cake. What does krantz mean?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Zordkhan - I am glad you say that. Quite a few people are too intimidated to try. I think, but not sure, that krantz is similar to crunch. The nutty mix in some variation is pretty crunchy. SheikRhatElAnrhol says: I have bought four of your books and took Jerusalem to Toronto for my sister in law who loves it. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @SheikRhatElAnrhol - Thanks for spreading out the word."}, {"sentences": ["And on and on, through the slashing blades of Heavenly Sword and the hip Tokyo fashion of Killer 7 and Jet Set Radio; the glittering swirl of galaxies in Eve Online, the geometric mountain-scapes of Minecraft."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "PS3", "Xbox", "PC", "Indie games", "Wii", "Museum of Modern Art", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-08T12:59:00Z", "title": "The absolute and inarguable beauty of video games", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/mar/08/beauty-of-video-games", "article": "And here we are again, the familiar argument, repackaged and re-worked: games are not art and never could be. This time it&apos;s a piece by Brian Moriarty, a professor in game design who once worked on titles such as Beyond Zork and the early LucasArts adventure, Loom. Unlike Jonathan Jones, whose recent polemic against games relied on notions of authorship, Moriarty takes a historical stance:  A survey of the past 2,500 years of art philosophy offers no support for the classification of games as art. If games are mentioned at all, they are dismissed as a pastime, harmless at best, and an evil destroyer of youth at worst.  He goes on to quote Schopenhauer who condemns games of all kinds and calls playing cards, &quot;in the truest sense an expression of the wretched side of humanity&quot;. This of course, is from an arch misanthropist who once threw an old lady down the stairs because she was talking too loudly on the landing outside his apartment.  And anyway, if we are to go to the philosophers, we should also consider Plato who freely uses draughts as a metaphor for discourse in the Republic and considered leisure and play to be vital elements of a healthy life. It was Plato who reportedly suggested, &quot;You can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation&quot;. Which of course, doesn&apos;t tell us anything about games as art, but does tell us that Plato valued gaming and that philosophers, however brilliant and perceptive they are, often hold opposing views. When I last wrote about this, I suggested that we shouldn&apos;t worry; that games are beautiful and important, and categorisation is irrelevant. I stand by that. MoMA&apos;s controversial decision to display a handful of games in its gallery seems to have awoken in art critics and some game designers a sense of unease: on one side is intellectual snobbery on the other is anti-intellectual approbation. Games aren&apos;t art, leave us alone, stay away. MoMA, I would suggest, has been more motivated by concerns of contemporary culture than art per se \u2013 a possibility that seems to be ignored whenever this matter arises. They are exhibited in the gallery&apos;s Department of Architecture and Design and this seems to me enormously sensible and relevant. All games are works of virtual architecture; they are designed spaces assembled both for practical purpose and aesthetic appreciation. They are like buildings in this way. But they are also works of graphic design, utilising all the theories and practices of printed media. Consider this: elsewhere in the gallery, MoMa exhibits a work named Champagne by the French artist Pierre Bonnard. It is wonderful, but it is also a poster, a work of graphic illustration. Is that art? Should it be there? You see how complicated this gets? And how dull?  This is a better way of looking at things, I think, and in the end what matters: games are inarguably beautiful. From the iconic minimalism of Pac-Man and Space Invaders, with their perfect shorthand environments, to the abstract wonderlands of Super Mario and Final Fantasy. From the touch of the fingers and then the clasp of hands between Ico and Yorda; through the metallic screech of an opening door in Doom and the swish of Ecco&apos;s tail. Beyond the smash of zombie dogs through windows in Resident Evil; the visual poetry of Rez, the plaintive sorrow of The Graveyard. And on and on, through the slashing blades of Heavenly Sword and the hip Tokyo fashion of Killer 7 and Jet Set Radio; the glittering swirl of galaxies in Eve Online, the geometric mountain-scapes of Minecraft. The kiss between George and Nico at the close of Broken Sword; the desperate sense of impending loss in Uncharted 3 as Nathan leaves Elena at the air strip, refusing to help her over the fence, worried he&apos;d lose her again, her hands slipping from the wire lattice between them; three seconds of Super Hexagon; 30 Flights of Loving. The art deco interior of Bioshock&apos;s doomed utopia. The Aperture lab, a pure construct of puzzle design and aesthetic skill, a world in which architecture is task, and every visual motif on every wall is perfect and meaningful. It&apos;s not all for science, you monster. It is for beauty too. And on and on and on; over the rolling plains of Skyrim and into the azure blue SKies of Arcadia. On and on until the whole idea of arguing over art diminishes before the spectacle and the magnificence of it all. When you look out in awe over the burning spacecraft of Mass Effect, the hazy, fecund forests of Far Cry, the undulating wireframe seas of Mercenary don&apos;t wonder, is it art? Just wonder. Just take it in. That&apos;s the value and the purpose. Exist in it.  Thirty years of gaming have taught me to interrogate games, but not to classify and fret; I have little time for the aloofness of academia. I know this much, and it is silly and slightly indulgent, but it explains my standpoint, for what that&apos;s worth. When I listen to the song Video Games by Lana Del Ray, and she sings in that wavering luscious tone, &quot;It&apos;s you, it&apos;s you, it&apos;s all for you,&quot; I imagine that it is not the boy she&apos;s singing to, but the games. It&apos;s all for you, I tell you all the time.

In Tokyo and along the tsunami-battered coastline people gathered at memorial services to remember those who died after a magnitude earthquake struck offshore at 2:46pm on 11 March 2011. Millions across the country stopped work or paused on the street to observe a moment&apos;s silence, while the emperor, Abe and relatives of the dead were among 1,200 who attended a ceremony at the capital&apos;s national theatre. &quot;I pray that the peaceful lives of those affected can resume as soon as possible,&quot; Emperor Akihito said. Rin Yamane, 18, who lost her mother in the tsunami, said: &quot;Young people from the disaster-hit areas will act so that the disaster will not be a painful memory but a memory that leads to the future.&quot; Almost all of the 26m tonnes of debris left behind by the tsunami has been removed from the three worst-hit prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima, but Monday&apos;s remembrance events were tinged with frustration at the slow pace of reconstruction. In an address, Abe promised to speed up the reconstruction effort, which has been delayed by bureaucratic bungling, labour shortages and a lack of land on higher ground to accommodate residents crammed into tiny temporary shelters. &quot;Japan will never experience a true spring if spring does not come to north-eastern Japan,&quot; he said. &quot;I promise never to forget the weight of each day and to speed up the reconstruction of the region.&quot; Abe, who has made several visits to Fukushima and the tsunami zone since taking office last December, said he planned to increase the budget for rebuilding from 19tn yen (\u00a3133bn) to 25tn yen. &quot;I pledge to achieve reconstruction of the disaster-hit areas and restore the lives of affected people as soon as possible. I will make Japan a country resilient to disasters and stand with the people who were affected,&quot; he said. Two years on, more than 300,000 people are still living in temporary accommodation, and practically no rebuilding has taken place near areas where whole communities once stood, now flattened swaths of land blanketed in grass and weeds. The earthquake, so powerful it was &quot;heard&quot; by an orbiting satellite 162 miles above Earth, destroyed or damaged 400,000 homes and other buildings. So far, only 10% of permanent homes for displaced survivors have been built. Among the displaced are 160,000 people from Fukushima prefecture, where radiation levels near the crippled Fukushima Daiichi power plant are still too high for them to return home. Decontamination work is behind schedule, while some residents have accepted they may never return to neighbourhoods that were irradiated when three reactors went into meltdown, sparking the world&apos;s worst nuclear crisis for a quarter of a century. Tsunami survivors are attempting to put the events of 11 March behind them as they struggle to regain some semblance of normal civic life. &quot;It&apos;s scary living here when there is an earthquake \u2026 but I don&apos;t plan to go anywhere else. I want to give my very best, somehow, towards rebuilding this city,&quot; Kenichi Oi, 75, a fisherman in the city of Kesennuma, told Associated Press. As the country marked the anniversary, the search continued for 2,668 people still missing. More than 2,300 of the recorded deaths have been attributed to the stress of living in evacuation shelters after the disaster or temporary housing. In Fukushima, frustration is mounting over the lack of progress decontaminating communities at the outer edges of the 12-mile exclusion zone established around the crippled nuclear power plant. A partial, phased return to some neighbourhoods is under way, but most people who were forced to flee radiation at the height of the crisis have no idea when, or if, their former homes will be fit for human inhabitation. The mayor of Kawauchi, Yuko Endo, said further delays in work to reduce radiation levels could deter residents from ever returning and put his village&apos;s future in doubt. &quot;If I were told to wait for two more years, I might explode,&quot; Endo said. &quot;After spending a huge amount of money, with the vegetable patches all cleaned up and ready for farming, we may end up with nobody willing to return.&quot; Expert opinion is inconclusive on the impact long-term exposure to low-level radiation could have on human health. In a recent report, the World Health Organisation said Fukushima residents faced only a tiny increased risk of developing cancer during their lifetimes. A more immediate threat to health comes from the stress caused by life in small temporary shelters, few job opportunities and the long, complicated process of applying for compensation from the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power. On Monday, 800 evacuees said they were suing the utility, demanding 50,000 yen a month each until radiation levels are brought down to normal levels \u2013 a process that authorities conceded could take decades."}, {"sentences": ["To make a donation towards the \u00a3108,000 needed for a Tokyo-style &quot;cat cafe&quot; to open in London."], "tags": ["Managing your cashflow", "Guardian Small Business Network"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-11T16:39:00Z", "title": "Live Q&A: A guide to crowdfunding", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/mar/11/managing-cashflow-crowdfunding-small-business", "article": "Earlier this year, one woman&apos;s business idea began to draw hundreds of excited cat lovers to the crowdfunding site Indiegogo.

It was a crazy enough scenario to begin daydreaming about the details - those games are played in September and November before a WBC, putting the presence of MLB players in doubt. &quot;Hey David Wright, I know you just played an entire season, but can you come back from Tahiti to make a November game against Thailand? We could really use you man.&quot;  In the end, Team USA, flat as a pancake in their loss against Mexico, bailed out by a Wright grand slam against the red hot Italians, came through with a late inning rally against the punch drunk Canadians (more on that below), who with a one run eighth inning lead and second round games in their sights may have been daydreaming a bit themselves.  And so much to the delight of tournament officials, one of the pillars of WBC attendance advanced, securing decent crowds in Miami as Joe Torre took that familiar walk to the mound to congratulate his men on a victory. With seven runs in two innings, and overcoming the appearance of Heath Bell in a big spot late vs eliminated Canada (Scott Schoeneweis wasn&apos;t available), perhaps Team USA, which will face Puerto Rico on Tuesday, are gaining the kind of momentum they&apos;ll need to secure their first WBC title.   &quot;It would have been embarrassing if we had lost,&quot; said Brandon Phillips. &quot;USA, this is where baseball started. We have to represent our country. And I feel like if we had lost, we didn&apos;t do our job. &quot;This is a blessing in disguise, man. We shouldn&apos;t have been here. But we picked ourselves up. It&apos;s a beautiful thing. It&apos;s a dream come true.&quot;  Base-brawl The World Baseball Classic entered new territory when Mexico&apos;s and Canada&apos;s benches cleared on Saturday night (it&apos;s alright for fighting) during its very first brawl. Mexico were disappointed with Canada&apos;s lack of adherence to the &quot;unwritten rules&quot; of baseball when catcher Chris Robinson bunted for a hit looking to get a run-scoring inning going in the top of the ninth. This upset Mexico because the bunt came with the Canadians ahead by six runs, and so it was seen as something of a baseball crime. Arnold Leon threw at the next batter, Ron Tasoni, and all hell broke loose. There were multiple haymakers, police involvement with even some of the crowd getting involved - seven ejections in all. It was an entertaining scrap if I am allowed to say that, even if it was asinine, if I am allowed to say that. Ties between teams in pool and second round play can be broken on run difference, and with Pool D airtight, Canada were well within their right to try and tack on runs despite their lead. It should also be noted that six runs is not what I would call an insurmountable lead, so while the bunt was a bit unusual for a team in a commanding position, it wasn&apos;t like they were throwing into the endzone up by 40 points with five seconds left.  Anyway, both managers used the occasion to complain about runs figuring into the tie breaking procedure because it can interfere with rules that aren&apos;t written - a new one for me. None suggested alternatives as far as I know. The WBC schedule is already tight and so extra games are out of the question. How else are they supposed to break ties? A coin flip? Corner kicks?  The good news for the teams is that there were no suspensions.   &quot;Because at least one club -- and potentially both -- will not advance to the second round, WBCI has determined that disciplinary measures would not have a meaningful corrective impact. Thus, discipline will not be imposed beyond today&apos;s seven game ejections.&quot;  That&apos;s another way of saying that we are not prepared to trash our tournament because of these idiots. Tournament officials almost got it right - Leon should have been sent home for taking three pitches to hit Tosoni. Honk if you love honkball! The Netherlands advanced to the Championship Round for the first time after defeating Cuba 7-6 at the Tokyo Dome in a game that had all the benchmarks of a high stakes playoff encounter.  The Netherlands came into Monday&apos;s game down two regulars, including the Washington Nationals Roger Bernedina, losing a third after Yurendell de Caster was carted off the field after running to first base. No matter, Kalian Sams&apos; walk-off sac fly scored Andruw Jones, sending the Cubans home in a loss that will be taken hard in Habana. They had their chances. With the two on and no out in the 7th, Cuban manager Victor Mesa, who is a baseball reality show waiting to happen, had one of their best offensive players, Yulieski Gurriel, bunt. He popped it up for the first out, and then Jose Fernandez bounced into a double play - inning over, inexplicable managing. Cuba would take a 6-4 lead later, but in the bottom of the eighth, with the Netherlands four outs away from elimination, Andrelton Simmons shocked the favorites with a two-run blast that tied the game for the third time. Mesa was up to his Tony La Russa-ish tricks in the bottom of the ninth, changing pitchers three times before the Netherlands completed their fifth consecutive victory over the IBAF&apos;s top ranked team and booked their ticket to AT&amp;T Park, where a European(ish) club will compete for the title for the first time. It was more than enough to make front page headlines in the Algemeen Dagblad.  Rising Sun Taiwan had the two-time WBC defending champions Japan on the ropes in the first game of second round play. At the Tokyo Dome, Taiwan were a strike away from putting away the home team (actually, Taiwan were the home team, even though they weren&apos;t home), when Hirokazu Ibata (1.500 WBC OPS) came through with a clutch RBI base hit that tied the score at 2-2. Moments earlier, Takashi Toritani had stolen second to get into scoring position, which reminded me of Dave Roberts&apos; steal for Boston at Fenway against the Yankees in Game Four of the 2004 ALCS. Perhaps that&apos;s a bit of a stretch, but when I ran it by a friend of mine who is a Red Sox fan he informed me that Roberts was actually born in Okinawa and that his mom is Japanese. Go figure.  Japan took their first lead of the game in the 10th, and survived a two on, one out jam in the bottom of the inning, Toshiya Sugiuchi inducing a game ending double play to end, what was until Monday&apos;s Netherlands/Cuba contest, the game of the tournament, sending the crowd at the Big Egg into even greater hysterics (if that&apos;s possible).  Taiwan, a team that had looked like one of the best while playing at home in the first round, ran out of gas after the dramatic, crushing loss, getting pummeled by Cuba 14-0 in their next game. Still, Taiwan showed progress, with Chien-Ming Wang in particular standing out - the free agent tossed 12 scoreless WBC innings while seeking a new professional contract.  Japan are now rounding into form behind Kenta Maeda (2-0 0.00 ERA 15K 10IP), Ibata and Yoshio Itoi (1.066 OPS). They cracked a record-tying six home runs against the Netherlands in a statement 16-4 victory, crushing a team that helped oust South Korea and had beaten Cuba to boot. There&apos;s no reason to believe that Japan, despite having no MLB players on their roster, won&apos;t continue their WBC success at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco when they begin Championship Round play on March 17. Spaghetti Western In 2009 it was the Netherlands that shocked the WBC by getting out of the first round before ushering out the Dominican Republic. In 2013, the upset special are the Italians, who made themselves at home out in the Arizona desert. Their victory over Mexico set the stage for a second round appearance. Anthony Rizzo hit a two-run ninth inning double off Giants closer Sergio Romo to put them ahead. Then Jason Grilli, dealing at 96 MPH, in one of the tournaments many &quot;this ain&apos;t Spring Training moments&quot;, got out of a bases loaded jam to secure the upset win.  Italy followed the landmark victory by jumping all over Canada in a 14-4 rout, then taking a lead over the US into the fifth inning in their final Pool D game. Italy have been on the international baseball scene for sometime but have always played second fiddle to the Netherlands in Europe. Their second round berth marks a significant advance for the program, as does producing the likes of Alex Liddi, the first Italian raised player to reach the Majors. How much news their WBC efforts are making back home isn&apos;t clear, but La Gazzetta dello Sport did include WBC coverage, at least online. It featured the google translate quote of the tournament, which came from Canadian manager Ernie Whitt after their pummeling at the hands of the Azzurri. &quot;Italy has taken us a hot ass.&quot;  Venezuelans mourn Chavez and baseball Pool C made hardly a peep with the Dominican Republic cruising to a second round berth, with Puerto Rico also advanceding with a pair of wins while playing home at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan. Some in Venezuela still in mourning following the death of Hugo Chavez, who was a better baseball fan than pitcher, would have hoped for a bit of a pick me up from their national baseball team. Instead, they were eliminated quietly, sending home a talented squad that included Miguel Cabrera, Marco Scutaro, Pablo Sandoval, Elvis Andrus, Carlos Zambrano and Anibal Sanchez.  Honorable mention goes to Barry Larkin&apos;s Brazilian team that played well in their first WBC and actually had a 3-2 lead against Japan heading into the eighth inning of their game in Fukuoka.

As if to back him up, Liam Fox yesterday obligingly decried Tony Blair&apos;s &quot;great socialist coup&quot;, and called for a \u00a3345bn cut in public spending, as well as a complete suspension of capital gains tax (this last measure doesn&apos;t actually feature in General Pinochet&apos;s Little Book of Counter-Revolution \u2013 but from tiny acorns and all that). Fox fits snugly into his former cabinet colleague&apos;s pigeonhole. Yet if the business secretary really is on the hunt for austerity jihadists in the government, he&apos;d better pack a giant butterfly net. If one definition of an ideologue is one who clings on to a strategy long after it&apos;s been proven to be a failure, then on deficit reduction David Cameron is as swivel-eyed as they come. Last week, the prime minister claimed &quot;signs that our plan is beginning to work&quot;, but next Wednesday will see George Osborne deliver yet another budget in which growth forecasts are lowered, borrowing projections raised and even more spending cuts laid out. This will be completely in line with every other budget and mini-budget the chancellor has delivered since he first laid out Plan A. To revisit those debut budget predictions from June 2010 is as tantalising as a glimpse of heaven to a fallen sinner. Back then, Whitehall assumed that Britain would now be amid a roaring recovery, with GDP growing 2.8% in 2012 and 2.9% this year. Instead, national income shrank in the last three months of last year and we will be lucky to see a 1% increase this year. Back then, it was assumed that unemployment would now be drifting downwards, businesses would be investing like billy-o, while public debt would be about to peak before heading south and the government would be on its way to the polls in 2015, the work of fiscal consolidation done. Clearly, none of those things are going to happen, which is partly why Tory backbenchers are now so restive. But you would have to be one of the austerity jihadists to believe that you could cut your way out of a slump. The entire modern history of expansionary fiscal contraction, as coalition ministers used to call it, is that it almost never works. Instead, severe austerity tends to turn recessions into depressions, consign millions to the dole or under-employment and lead to frightening political turbulence. The most famous episode of austerity was during the interwar years, as Germany, Britain, France and Japan all fought to stay on the Gold Standard even amid the Great Depression. The deflationary impact of keeping their currencies pegged to gold, along with the austerity policies they followed to do so, was disastrous. In Britain, unemployment jumped from 10.4% in 1929 to 22.1% by early 1932, even while government debt surged. In Germany, the Social Democrats stupidly clung to the orthodoxy of austerity, pushing joblessness up to to 30% by 1932, and opening the door to the Nazis. In Japan, the Showa Depression saw household incomes more than halve within two years between 1929 and 1931. Tokyo cut spending by nearly 20%, with the military bearing the brunt of the privations. The result was a wave of assasinations of government ministers and bankers and attempted coups. As the political scientist Mark Blyth says in his new book, Austerity: &quot;Austerity didn&apos;t just fail \u2013 it helped blow\u00a0up the world. That&apos;s the definition of a very dangerous idea.&quot; And yet when Europe&apos;s crisis began in earnest in 2009, rightwing politicians across the continent adopted the line that the best governments could do was cut spending to encourage the private sector to spend. Two of the leading proponents of the argument, economists Alberto Alesina and Silvia Ardagna were invited to present their ideas to European economy and finance ministers. Yet as Blyth points out, their counter-examples of successful austerity were nothing of the kind. Ireland&apos;s cuts from 1987-9? The economy piggy-backed on the Lawson boom in Britain and a global upswing. As for Australia, Alesina and Ardagna mysteriously ended their happy story just before the worst recession in its postwar history. Even now, austerity merchants scratch around for poster children. There&apos;s Latvia, whose cuts over the past few years have been described by IMF boss Christine Lagarde as &quot;a success story \u2026 an inspiration for European leaders grappling with the euro crisis&quot;. Yet around one in 10 of the labour force have emigrated, a further 16% are unemployed and, on IMF estimates, the country will not get back to its pre-crisis trajectory for another decade. When austerity fails to deliver economic recovery. its proponents fall back on exactly the kind of naked ideology attacked by Cable. Last week, I attended a meeting of Syriza Cambridge and heard the party&apos;s central committee member Stathis Kouvelakis describe how Greeks had been forced to accept the most painful austerity programme in recent European history. The parallels with Britain were striking. Where Athens lost its sovereignty to the IMF and Europe, the coalition claims it must placate financial markets. Where ordinary Greeks were branded as lazy and cosseted, Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith want to end the &quot;culture of welfare dependency&quot;. And where in Greece, historic cuts were rolled out in the name of economic modernisation, here Cameron wants to whip us into a &quot;global race&quot;. If Cable thinks he has to fend off a few austerity jihadists, he should think again; he&apos;s in\u00a0a\u00a0government full of them."}, {"sentences": ["In the mountains of Shima Onsen, three hours north of Tokyo, the night is quiet, cold and starless."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-12T14:02:31Z", "title": "Letter from Japan: Deep heat", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/12/letter-from-japan-hot-springs", "article": "In the mountains of Shima Onsen, three hours north of Tokyo, the night is quiet, cold and starless.

The region&apos;s name explains its attraction: shima means &quot;forty thousand&quot;; and onsen means &quot;hot springs&quot;. I have come here to experience old-school hospitality and bathing at a traditional Japanese inn, or ryokan. It&apos;s my first time at an onsen, but fortunately a large poster lists all the do&apos;s and don&apos;ts. The pictures and captions explain the importance of washing thoroughly, leaving no room for ambiguity. After scrubbing my skin pink in a steamy communal bathroom, I slip on my cotton yukata robe and wooden-soled sandals and head outside, up a narrow wooden staircase that climbs the steep hillside to a small onsen overlooking the ryokan. I deposit my yukata, towel and sandals in a wicker basket in the changing room, as onsen must be enjoyed naked. I arrive at the edge of the small, rectangular pool, desperate to escape the cold. But as I dip my quickly numbing foot in, I recoil: the water is insanely hot. Tiny snowflakes melt on my skin as I hesitate awkwardly, unable to advance or retreat. The intense heat stuns my mind and body and I remain stone-still for a minute, clasping my knees. Only my eyes move, tracing the falling snowflakes as they disappear into the clouds of steam on the water&apos;s surface. I soon acclimatise to the water temperature, and feel comfortable enough to stretch out my limbs, deepen my breathing and let my muscles relax. All day I have been looking forward to this unique feeling of heat in the cold, and as I savour the all-enveloping warmth my thoughts drift back to the 12-course Japanese dinner I am still digesting. But the heat overwhelms me, after five minutes my body can no longer cope. As I stand up, I sway light-headedly for a second before stepping carefully from the pool. Retracing my steps towards the changing room I know the memory of the nocturnal onsen will linger long after the heat subsides, but for now I just want to be back indoors. \u2022 Every week Guardian Weekly publishes a Letter from one of its readers from around the world.

They were protesting two days before the second anniversary of the meltdowns at the Fukushima Da-ichi power plant, which resulted from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.  &quot;I am going to fight against those who act as though Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Fukushima never happened,&quot; Nobel Prize-winning author Kenzaburo Oe told the Tokyo crowd. A class action suit involving 800 plaintiffs was filed Monday demanding that the government and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which operated the Dai-ichi facility, restore the natural environment and people&apos;s homes to their pre-disaster state. The Fukushima site remains one of the most radioactive places on earth, and the devilishly difficult cleanup there is expected to take 40-plus years and cost tens of billions of dollars. Some 160,000 evacuees still live in temporary housing, having lost their livelihoods and land to the contamination, which may render some of it unfarmable for centuries to come. In response to the accident, Japanese authorities shut down the nation&apos;s 54 nuclear power plants, a popular move in a country that lost two of its cities to atomic bombs at the end of the last World War, and where anti-nuclear sentiments run deep. But in the face of power shortages and mounting industry pressure, oil and coal-poor Japan, has begun re-opening its closed nuclear facilities and plans to restart six more reactors by the end of 2013. The pro-nuclear government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office in December, has even talked about building new plants.  This gradual return to business as usual has led some to question how much has been learned from Fukushima. Not much, if one believes a commentary published in Bloomberg View on Sunday which trumpets, &quot;Fukushima Radiation Proves Less Deadly Than Feared&quot;. Professor Robert Peter Gale and author Eric Lax argue that more people die from air pollution created by oil and coal-fired power plants than from radiation released during nuclear accidents.  Their takeaway from the second largest nuclear accident in history (after Chernobyl) is that outside of the badly contaminated plant site and the temporary dislocation of the area&apos;s residents, not much harm was done. Public &quot;fears of health risks from radiation,&quot; they concluded, &quot;have little basis in fact.&quot; The Japanese government has also been eager to play down Fukushima&apos;s impact. Critics charge that after the accident the authorities were slow to extend the narrow exclusion zone around Fukushima, and withheld critical information about contamination levels, which delayed the evacuation. The New York Times reported:    &quot;After the nuclear disaster, the government raised the legal exposure limit to radiation from one to 20 millisieverts a year for people, including children \u2014 effectively allowing them to continue living in communities from which they would have been barred under the old standard.&quot;   The truth is that nobody can say yet what the effect are of the Fukushima accident on public health in Japan and beyond. Typically, chronic illnesses, like cancer and Leukemia which are associated with radiation, take several years after exposure to appear. But a report released in late January gives early cause for concern. The Fukushima Prefecture Health Management Survey revealed that 44.2% of 94,975 children tested by ultrasound had small thyroid nodules and cysts, which may in some cases be a precursor of cancer. The number of abnormalities has been increasing over the past two years that the surveys have been conducted.  Scientists at Stanford University estimated that the radiation from the meltdown might result in \u2013 at the upper limit \u2013 as many as 2,500 additional cancer cases (mostly in Japan) and 1,300 cancer deaths globally. Last year&apos;s study, which used 3D global atmospheric modeling, predicted that the impact would have been ten times greater if the prevailing winds had not swept most of the radiation relatively harmlessly out to sea. &quot;There was a lot of luck involved,&quot; said Mark Z. Jacobson, co-author of the report. Should America be depending on luck to protect us from potential future Fukushimas? Not according to Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Lyman told me that after Fukushima, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) set up a task force to identify the lessons the US should learn from the accident. The task force recommended, among other things, that nuclear plants should upgrade their ability to deal with extended power outages, such as occurred at Fukushima, without their reactor cores melting down. But the nuclear industry balked at the proposed new NRC regulations and proposed its own voluntary program dubbed &quot;FLEX&quot; (Diverse and Flexible Coping Strategies) instead. Lyman says that FLEX, which involves purchasing more reliable equipment, and sprucing up emergency backup systems, is a step in the right direction. But he believes that it is not nearly as stringent as it needs to be to prevent future Fukushimas. The nuclear industry is lobbying the NRC to accept the FLEX programs &quot;half measures,&quot; according to Lyman, in lieu of the tough new regulations that its own task force devised.  And there is growing pressure from Congress to comply. Michigan Republican Fred Upton, chairman of the House Energy Committee, whose biggest campaign contributors include several nuclear and electric industry pacs, is one of the leaders of the move to get regulators to sign off on the industry plan.  Ironically, Upton&apos;s district includes the Palisades nuclear power plant located on the shores of Lake Michigan, an aging facility that has been notorious for a series of shutdowns, leaks, and equipment failures in recent years. The facility suffered three &quot;near misses&quot; in the past three years.  In a scathing report issued late last year on the NRCs regulatory failures, the UCS says that a cooling water leakage at Palisades was allowed to continue for nearly a month in a critical location where regulations require the plant to be shut down within six hours. The report goes on to allege that, &quot;the NRC routinely allows violations of this type to go unpenalized, thus enabling poor decision-making by plant owners.&quot;  With few new nuclear plants being built at present, America&apos;s nuclear infrastructure continues to age and grow increasingly more accident-prone. Spent fuel rods also accumulate and pose unaddressed safety risks. Many plants are located along rivers or coastlines, where they face dangers from flooding. Others are in areas prone to earthquakes, like the one that initiated the Fukushima meltdown. One hundred and eleven million Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear plant. So far they have been lucky. Nobody can say how long that luck will last."}, {"sentences": ["The decommission work continues at the crippled plant in Fukushima, their operator Tokyo Electric Power Co and Japanese government plan to complete in around 2050."], "tags": ["Environment"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-13T11:47:43Z", "title": "Green news roundup: Fracking, Cites and pesticides", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/13/1", "article": "Fracking \u2022 Lord Browne promises to invest &apos;whatever it takes&apos; in UK fracking\u2022 Prospect of fracking in Somerset unites unlikely coalition of protesters\u2022 Shale gas rush: the fracking companies hoping to strike it rich\u2022 Yoko Ono and Susan Sarandon star in new anti-fracking music video\u2022 No Dash for Gas campaigners set up anti-EDF website Illegal wildlife trade conference Cites     Loading the rosewood on trucks at the port of Toamasina (Tamatave), Madagascar, 24 November 2009.

It is the largest possible space-time symmetry of nature and it relates space and time with a fundamental quantum property of elementary particles, the spin. Supersymmetry predicts a wealth of new particles, superparticles, some of which could constitute the mysterious astrophysical dark matter. There is only one small problem: so far, supersymmetry is not supported by any experimental evidence. This week at a conference in the small Italian ski resort of La Thuile, the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider LHC have reported new results of their quest for supersymmetry. Unfortunately, no signal has been detected, and only new lower limits on the mass of the superparticles have been presented. These limits are based on many years of theoretical calculations by many theorists, including myself and my colleague and friend Herbi Dreiner, who most likely infected me with the supersymmetry virus. We were hoping that our calculations would help to pin down the exact nature of supersymmetry in the case of discovery, but unfortunately so far they were only useful to derive limits, limits, and more limits. Personally, I am frustrated about the lack of any evidence for supersymmetry, but actually there is no reason for despair. So let&apos;s see why theorists love supersymmetry and why it is still alive. The fundamental laws of nature are determined by very few and simple theoretical principles: quantum physics and symmetries. Symmetries are familiar from everyday life: when we rotate a circle about the centre it will look the same after the rotation. We say that the circle is symmetric, or invariant, under rotations. In physics, symmetries are often used to derive theories and to determine the structure of physical laws. We believe, for example, that physical laws are independent of time and place: it does not matter if we perform an experiment in New York or Tokyo, today or tomorrow, provided of course that all external conditions are identical. Remarkably, this symmetry of physical laws under a change of place or time implies that momentum and energy are conserved, that is to say they cannot be created or destroyed.  Could there be an even more fundamental space-time symmetry in the world of microscopic particles? Yes, but only if we consider not only changes in space and time, but also take into account a specific quantum property of particles, the spin. Spin is a peculiar quantum feature: particles behave as if they have an inner magnet, so depending on their spin they are deflected when passing through a magnetic field. As always in the quantum world, spin cannot take on just any value, but comes in multiples of 1/2 (in specific units). All known matter particles, like the electron, have spin 1/2, while the particles which mediate the forces, like the photon, have spin 1. In fact, only three types of fundamental particles have been discovered in nature so far: matter particles with spin = 1/2, force carriers with spin = 1, and the recently observed Higgs particle with spin = 0. The most fundamental and encompassing space-time symmetry can be formulated if we consider both changes in space or time as well as a change in spin by a quantum unit of 1/2. This largest possible symmetry of nature is supersymmetry. For each known fundamental particle, supersymmetry predicts a partner with spin different by 1/2. There is, for example, a superpartner to the electron with spin 0 and a superpartner to the photon with spin 1/2. Supersymmetry is thus not only the largest possible symmetry of nature, it also provides an intriguing extension of space and time by linking it with the quantum property of spin and thereby relating matter particles (spin = 1/2) and force carriers (spin = 1).  Perfect supersymmetry implies that particles and their superpartners have the same mass. A superpartner of the electron with the electron mass, however, has been experimentally excluded. Supersymmetry can thus not be realized as a perfect symmetry of nature, but must be imperfect or broken in some way. This seems disappointing at first. However, we know many situations in physics were symmetries are only approximate. Water molecules in steam, for example, can move freely, and everything looks the same from any direction. As the steam cools down, the water molecules freeze and form patterns, like the ones you see on cold windows. The symmetry of the freely moving water in the steam has been reduced or broken to the lesser symmetry of the ice pattern. It is thus not necessarily surprising that supersymmetry may only be an approximate symmetry of nature, and that superparticles have not been observed with the expected masses. Unfortunately, it is not clear how supersymmetry is broken. Different theoretical assumptions on the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking lead to different specific models with different superparticle mass spectra.  So why do we expect to find superparticles at the LHC? The two main reasons are the so-called &apos;&apos;naturalness criterion&apos;&apos; and the existence of the astrophysical dark matter. What is the &apos;&apos;naturalness criterion&apos;&apos;? Through the interaction with the quantum vacuum, the mass of the Higgs particle should be about 1017 times higher than the actual Higgs mass measured at the LHC. So what keeps the Higgs mass light? Is it some tremendously large and thus unnatural cancellation between different effects, or rather a new theoretical structure like supersymmetry? Supersymmetry fits the bill. Supersymmetry modifies the quantum vacuum and can explain naturally why the Higgs boson is light, provided that the mass of the superparticles is not too large, i.e. in reach of the LHC. Remarkably, such superparticles could also constitute the dark matter of the universe: many supersymmetric models predict the existence of a massive, electrically neutral and stable superparticle, which provides just the right amount of dark matter!  Supersymmetry, however, has one rather serious problem: there is so far no experimental evidence for the existence of superparticles. Superparticles should modify numerous observables through quantum fluctuations, and it should be possible to find superparticles at the LHC, provided their masses are not too high so that they can be created from the energy released in the proton-proton collisions. So, let us look in more detail into the searches at the LHC. The superpartners which feel the strong interaction should be produced most copiously in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, and they would decay practically instantaneously into other, lighter, superparticles and into ordinary particles. In many supersymmetric models, the lightest superparticle is neutral and stable, and may constitute dark matter. This dark matter particle is produced at the end of any supersymmetric decay chain and leaves the detector without a trace. Thus the generic signature for supersymmetry at the LHC is the production of ordinary, tough highly energetic, particles from the decay of the heavy superparticles, together with missing momentum from the invisible dark matter particles. From the absence of any signal in the current LHC data one can deduce lower limits on the masses of the strongly interacting superparticles of more than one tera electron volt (short &quot;TeV&quot;, about 1000 times the proton mass).       ... but experiments refuse to collaborate and only produce limits, limits and more limits! (ATLAS and CMS results, CERN)    With such high superparticle masses, it is difficult to naturally explain why the Higgs particle is so light. And while supersymmetric models with superparticle masses close to or beyond one TeV can still accommodate dark matter, it will be very hard to directly detect such particles and to confirm the supersymmetric solution to the dark matter mystery. So should we give up on supersymmetry as a solution to the naturalness problem, or give up the hope to directly observe superparticles and dark matter? No, we should not! Where and how could supersymmetry hide? Essentially, there are two possibilities: either the probability for producing superparticles at the LHC is smaller than in the simple models that have mostly been studied so far, or the superparticle decay pattern is different, such that the standard experimental searches do not capture the specific signatures. One example of a class of models that could have escaped detection at the LHC has been labelled &apos;&apos;natural supersymmetry&apos;&apos;. In these models only the superpartner of the top-quark is relatively light, with a mass well below one TeV, while the superpartners of all the other quarks are too heavy to be produced at the LHC. (We know six types of quarks, the heaviest of which is called top-quark.) &quot;Natural supersymmetry&quot; may be hard to find: first, the probability for producing only the top-quark superpartner is smaller than producing the superpartners of all the quarks, and second the decay signatures are more difficult to detect than for other supersymmetric models. Such models are &quot;natural&apos;&apos; because a superpartner of the top-quark with a mass well below one TeV is actually sufficient to keep the Higgs mass naturally light. One particular focus of the current and future experimental program at the LHC is thus the search for the superpartner of the top-quark.  Given that there are many well motivated and rather natural models of supersymmetry which would have escaped detection at the LHC so far, there is no reason for despair! The decisive quest for supersymmetry really only starts in two years time when the LHC is resuming operation at much higher energies. A fascinating aspect of the search for supersymmetry is the interplay between LHC physics and astrophysical observations. Supersymmetric dark matter particles may not only be produced and detected at the LHC, but they also leave traces in cosmic rays and may be observed in nuclear reactions in highly sensitive experiments deep underground. Through the interplay between LHC searches and astrophysics we are now able to explore supersymmetry as an explanation of the dark matter of the universe. And what if no sign of supersymmetry is found? Then we theorists have to go back to the drawing board and develop completely new ideas to understand why the Higgs is so light and what dark matter really is! * Michael Kr\u00e4mer is a theoretical particle physicist at the RWTH Aachen University and an associate at CERN and the Edinburgh Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics.

Eirik Glambek B\u00f8e and Erlend \u00d8ye&apos;s Kings Of Convenience proved that acoustic guitars and delicate melody needn&apos;t lead to New Boring-induced comas, and they were followed into pop hearts by another Bergen resident, Annie, who made fools out of the global charts when glacial nuggets like Chewing Gum and Heartbeat failed to do anything much. Add &quot;friends of Bergen&quot; R\u00f6yksopp and the jazzy indie of Sondre Lerche and \u2013 boom! \u2013 there was a scene. The Wave soon receded to the briny but Bergen pop thrives, and there are encouraging signs that it&apos;s about to break again. The roots go back further than Kings Of Convenience. Threads of Bergen&apos;s musical tapestry can be traced to Edvard Grieg, who mastered the heartstopping melody 150 years before B\u00f8e and \u00d8ye, or to lively 70s troubadour Jan Eggum, still active 40 years later.

Young Dreams occupy a dreamy sweet spot in the rhombus of reveries cornered by the Beach Boys, Prefab Sprout, Animal Collective and Destroyer, using synths and African-influenced guitars to create something obviously brainy but lush enough to lose yourself in. There&apos;s a freedom to their music that is characteristic of Bergen. &quot;I think it&apos;s the way our city is surrounded by mountains,&quot; explains Tellez, &quot;but also the fact that the &apos;industry&apos; is in Oslo, so we don&apos;t relate to that aspect.&quot; He credits Kings Of Convenience with fostering the scene: &quot;When they tour they always try to spread the word about new acts. Everyone helps each other.&quot; Tellez himself helps out, too, producing Program 91, the 2011 debut from all-girl Bergen ska-pop band Razika, whose second album P\u00e5 Vei Hjem gets an international release later this year. Singer Marie Amdam thinks there&apos;s something in the Bergen water. Specifically the rain. &quot;When it&apos;s rainy outside people stay in and figure out other things to do,&quot; she says. &quot;Also, the music scene is small and tight. People are more into helping each other out than competing.&quot; Both Tellez and Amdam mention another Bergen band, Verdensrommet. Their name means &quot;outer space&quot; and they make cosmic pop that stations Brian Wilson somewhere on the other side of Jupiter. Local colleagues the Megaphonic Thrift are heavier, fusing stargazing and shoegazing to form a beautiful noise that slots nicely alongside My Bloody Valentine&apos;s second coming.

Biculturalism, water, death, memory, the female predicament, conscience, the nature of time and tide? Tick. All there. Throw in the second world war, the reader-writer relationship, depression, ecological collapse, suicide, origami, a 105-year-old anarchist nun and a schoolgirl&apos;s soiled knickers, and you have Ruth Ozeki&apos;s third novel, A Tale for the Time Being. Ozeki&apos;s meditative, era-flipping story starts with a chance discovery by\u00a0a Japanese-American novelist called Ruth. Ruth lives on an island in British Columbia. Walking on the beach she stumbles on a barnacle-studded wad of\u00a0plastic bags protecting a Hello Kitty lunchbox. Inside are some old letters and the diary of 16-year-old Nao (pronounced &quot;now&quot;) Yasutani, who describes herself as &quot;a little wave person. Floating about on the stormy sea of life&quot;. By either coincidence or karma, Nao also happens to be a kind of Japanese-American, and therefore a bit like Ruth. She was born to Japanese parents, but her heart belongs to Silicon Valley, where she spent her happy formative years, and she feels just as at ease in English as Japanese. She is now back in\u00a0Japan, miserable, and contemplating &quot;dropping out of time&quot; altogether. Just how long has her testament been bobbing about on the waves? Is\u00a0Nao a tsunami victim, or does her possible suicide predate the tragedy? The fact that Ruth is itching to know may make her decision to read Nao&apos;s story episodically, in the on-off rhythm in which it was written (rather than to speed-read to the end and find out), feel\u00a0contrived. But it gives Ozeki the chance to switch between the now of Ruth&apos;s quietly claustrophobic life with her artist-naturalist husband Oliver and the turbulent now of Nao, whose story begins in Tokyo at the turn of the\u00a0new century. The two protagonists are chalk and cheese. Ruth&apos;s daily life consists of Google searches, speculations about a mysterious crow, pedagogically driven information-exchanges with her husband and neighbours, internet access breakdowns and missing cats. No wonder she&apos;s hooked on the sad soap opera of Nao&apos;s Tokyo life. Nao (&quot;I&apos;m a time being. Do you know what a time being is? It&apos;s someone who lives in time&quot;) may be irritating, with her constant tugging on the reader&apos;s sleeve and her hysterical emoticons, but it&apos;s hard not to feel sympathy for this beleaguered teenager, or to admire the power with which Ozeki evokes her plight. Nao&apos;s father, unemployed and depressed, reads western philosophy, constructs origami insects and makes failed suicide attempts, while her mother absents herself completely: one day she&apos;s a zonked housewife tuning out in front of aquarium jellyfish, the next she has a job in publishing. Meanwhile Nao is bullied by baroquely sadistic schoolmates: the abuse culminates in a staged funeral, a\u00a0near-rape and a humiliating online knicker auction that sends her into a vortex of despair. But thanks to the Universe, help is at hand in the form of Jiko, Nao&apos;s ancient, anarchist-feminist great-grandmother. The tiny bald nun invites Nao to her mountain temple where fresh air and Zen wisdom work their magic. Here Nao is taught to sit straight, empty her mind, scrub old-lady skin, and offer prayers of gratitude to toilets: &quot;As I go for a dump / I pray with all beings / That we can remove all filth and destroy / The poisons of greed, anger and foolishness.&quot; In an environment as fertile as this, more stories are bound to sprout, and sure enough they do. Old Jiko had a\u00a0kamikaze pilot son who left secret letters \u2013 also in the Hello Kitty lunchbox \u2013 written in a code language called French. At this point Ruth, normally a keen advocate of Google&apos;s many useful applications, seeks out Benoit, a waste disposal worker, who translates the doomed pilot&apos;s words with the finesse of an award-winning interpreter. And finally, all \u2013 or rather a\u00a0set of parallel alls \u2013 is revealed. Seen from space, or from the vantage point of those conversant with\u00a0Zen principles, A Tale for the Time\u00a0Being is probably a deep and illuminating piece of work, with thoughtful things to say about the slipperiness of time. But for those positioned lower in the planet&apos;s stratosphere, Ozeki&apos;s novel often feels more like the great Pacific gyre it frequently evokes: a vast, churning basin of mental flotsam in which Schr\u00f6dinger&apos;s cat, quantum mechanics, Japanese funeral rituals, crow species, fetish cafes, the anatomy of barnacles, 163 footnotes and six appendices all jostle for attention.

But it has always struck me as having far less to do with greediness, and more to do with machismo and a particularly self-regarding form of faux sophistication. I was thinking about all this as the scandal over horsemeat in beef ready-meals broke. Because lurking behind the important questions that it posed \u2013 about supermarket economics and our hidden food chain \u2013 there was another narrative, dripping with snobbery and disdain: about the &quot;lower orders&quot; being both stupid enough to buy this cheap crap and unsophisticated enough not to recognise that eating horse is fine, as any fool who has holidayed in the Dordogne knows. Of course, this scandal wasn&apos;t actually about the identity of the animals, but the fact that we knew nothing of its life or death. No matter. What was really in play here was the cult of gastro-adventurism, which puts experience for its own sake far beyond whether things are nice to eat. Of course I&apos;ve eaten horse, they bellow. Hasn&apos;t everyone? It even has its own genre of food writing, produced by self-styled foodie Indiana Joneses who boast of scarfing deep fried insects, sashimi of a fish that is still alive and twitching as the slices are taken, or the still-beating heart of the just-slaughtered cobra. And we are supposed to swoon. So brave. So clever. So what? It is the worst kind of showing off, and has absolutely nothing to do with greed. Occasionally, I have been invited to try exotic meats, ostrich say, or kangaroo or alligator. And I always make the same discovery: they are eaten less often than sheep, cow or pig because, while fine, they aren&apos;t quite as nice. Which is why that triumvirate dominates. A few years ago, a restaurant serving insects opened in London. It lasted just a few months. While some people were interested in trying their menu once, few wanted to go twice. They&apos;d eaten locusts. Now they wanted a bacon sandwich. At which point someone bawls j&apos;accuse and points out that I&apos;m forever bigging up offal: wobbly trotters, calves brains in frothing puddles of butter, kidneys and liver and tripe. And yes I do. But these are fundamentally different. First, they are a part of our culinary heritage that has been forgotten.

Much of the media coverage concentrated on the details of the information published, but perhaps the more intriguing detail is that hackers chose to build their site with the domain suffix .su \u2013 the suffix for the former Soviet Union. The .su suffix \u2013 or country code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD) \u2013 has been around since 1990, when it was assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the governing body which allocated global IP addresses and domain names to &quot;countries, sovereign states or dependent territories&quot;. Despite the dissolution of the Soviet Union a mere 14 months after its ccTLD was allocated, .su has lived on and is administered by the Russian Institute for Public Networks (RIPN), the Russian organization that controls domain name registration with the .ru and .su suffixes. Russia was granted its own .ru domain in 1994. But &quot;owners of &apos;.su&apos; sites stubbornly resisted switching, on commercial, political and patriotic grounds&quot;, according to this USA Today story from 2008. The fledgling RIPN was forced to compromise and agreed to stop issuing new .su sites, while existing ones were allowed to continue. In early 2012, abuse.ch, a Swiss cybersecurity blog, noted that increasing numbers of &apos;domain hacks&apos; \u2013 ie unusual uses of a ccTLD \u2013 were popping up with the .su suffix, namely by hackers. This was to get around a 2011 crackdown by RIPN which began systematically shutting down suspected hacking sites. But .su is not the only curious nation-state domain name: .ly Libya&apos;s suffix proved to be popular before the Arab uprising that ousted Gaddaffi, because it was comparatively cheap. URL shortener Bitly started the .ly domain hack trend by registering bit.ly; inspiring others like brief.ly, adf.ly and ow.ly to follow suit. However, the Libyan domain name governing body (nic.ly) has very strict regulations, namely: &quot;Domain names must not contain obscene, scandalous, indecent, or contrary to Libyan law or islamic morality words, phrases nor abbreviations.&quot; This policy has resulted in websites being shut down, such as Vb.ly a &quot;sex-positive URL shortener,&quot; seized by the Libyan government in 2010.  .aq Though Antartica has no permanent human residents, it does have a ccTLD. This is available to government organizations who are signatories of the Antarctic Treaty or others who have a physical presence south of latitude 60\u00baS. The Vatican also has its own ccTLD, .va, to serve its 832 residents. .am, .fm and .tv .am is the official ccTLD for Armenia, but AM radio stations have encroached on this domain. According to Armenia&apos;s Network Information Chapter, the local regulating body for .am domains, an .am suffix can be acquired for a mere $29.01 a year. Creative domain hacks have also been used by companies such as Instagram, which owns own instagr.am. .fm is the Federated States of Micronesia&apos;s official suffix. But the domain is popular and clearly valuable to FM radio stations. Anyone can purchase an .fm suffix, for an annual fee \u2013 proceeds of which apparently go to the government and people of micronesia \u2013 though calls to Micronesia&apos;s IANA representative went unanswered. The Polynesian island of Tuvalu, home to fewer than 11,000 people, was granted .tv. But given the suffix&apos;s popularity with television companies, it is in far wider use than the size of its population might suggest. The suffix. .tv was bought by American company Verisign in 2000, with Tuvalu retaining a 20% stake. Tuvalu signed a 12-year leasing contract for .tv for a $50m payout. .eh This ccTLD has been the subject of a power struggle between Morocco and Western Sahara, a disputed territory. Both have laid claims to the domain, but the IANA has ruled to keep the domain inactive until &quot;the two contesting applicants work together to find a mutual solution that will serve the needs of the local Internet community in the best possible fashion&quot;. An unlikely scenario, given the two parties have been fighting since Spain released Western Sahara as a colony in 1975. .yu The suffixes of countries that disappear from the map usually just expire. Yugoslavia&apos;s .yu was in use until 2010, but was ultimately retired when both Serbia and Montenegro were granted new domains.

Though it was forbidden to publish documents such as these without the court&apos;s permission while the case was active, those responsible for the site understood that hosting the site through Christmas Island guaranteed a lengthy legal process if prosecutors wanted to shut it down.

As the sixth architect from Japan to receive the award \u2013 following Kenzo Tange in 1987, Fumihiko Maki in 1993, Tadao Ando in 1995, and Sejima and Nishizawa \u2013 Ito is perhaps the hardest to pigeonhole. He has no house style, and his projects have veered dramatically between different techniques in a process of constant experimentation. Treating his office as an open laboratory, his employees are encouraged to pursue their own directions, and each project takes a radically new approach to developing a different kind of structural system, specific to the building, programme and site at hand. One of his earliest buildings, now demolished and much mourned for by architects, was the White U house in Tokyo, which he built for his sister and her daughters in 1976 after the death of her husband. It was a monolithic, tyrannical house \u2013 a contemplative tube of white space wrapped around a solitary courtyard in a U-shape. It turned its back on the world with high windowless walls, the interior spaces lit only by chinks of daylight. One by one, the family left the house, describing living in it as being &quot;imprisoned in a coffin&quot; \u2013 an attitude seemingly shared by their pets, who all refused to be alone in the enclosed courtyard. It is a project that might appear to sit unhappily with the Pritzker jury&apos;s citation that Ito&apos;s architecture &quot;projects an air of optimism, lightness and joy, and is infused with both a sense of uniqueness and universality&quot;. But a house for a mourning sister is a very different creature to a public library, and Ito designed one of the most transparent, open and uplifting of recent years in the city of Sendai in 2001. The culmination of a decade-long preoccupation with the effects of emerging digital technologies on architecture \u2013 which he has called &quot;the body of electronic modernism&quot; \u2013 the Sendai Mediatheque was his first substantial exercise in &quot;fluid space&quot;. A reinvention of Le Corbusier&apos;s domino house, the seven-storey glass box replaced columns with cores of woven tubes, threaded though the floors in clusters of worm-like capillaries. Their integrity was dramatically put to the test when the city became the epicentre of the Tohoku earthquake two years ago \u2013 the library remained standing, only suffering minor damage.            While the structure for Sendai was brought inside the building to liberate the facade, in other projects Ito has employed precisely the opposite strategy. His 2002 Serpentine Gallery Pavilion was purely an exercise in developing a structural skin around an empty box of space, its irregular diagonal lattice forming a bold graphic envelope. He did the same two years later for the Tod&apos;s store on Tokyo&apos;s Omotesando shopping street, using only a slender skin of concrete in an abstract pattern of tree branches. A concern with the organic has run through much of Ito&apos;s work, which often uses geometries from nature in order to battle against the prevailing forces of modernism. &quot;I thought of myself as a dropout robot,&quot; he has said (after initially naming his practice Urban Robot), styling himself as the iconoclast of his generation, the maverick inventor in a sea of uniformity. At a lecture entitled Liquid Space, given at Princeton in 2009 and transcribed in the book Forces of Nature, Ito describes how he has spent the last decade working against the generic grid imposed on our buildings and cities by 20th-century modernism. &quot;By modifying the grid slightly, I have been attempting to find a way of creating relationships that bring buildings closer to their surroundings and environment,&quot; he said.     Barbapapa house? A model of the Taichung Metropolitan Opera House. Photograph: designboom    His most ambitious project yet, currently on site in Taiwan, will represent the ultimate outcome of his organic modifications of the grid. The Taichung Metropolitan Opera House will stand like a vast sponge of a building, a 3D warren of cave-like spaces, connected vertically and horizontally in a labyrinth of smooth white walls that melt into floors which in turn melt into ceilings. It will be the closest we have come to a real-life Barbapapa house, and will look as if some amorphous creature had wriggled free of its concrete skin, leaving a network of cavernous voids.  So what can we expect next? No doubt another radical reinvention: &quot;When one building is completed, I become painfully aware of my own inadequacy, and it turns into energy to challenge the next project,&quot; he said this week in response to the announcement. &quot;I will never fix my architectural style and never be satisfied with my works.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Bill&apos;s boss, who arrives by supersonic jet, is Japanese, and Bill is constantly on the phone to colleagues in Tokyo, which is named (correctly) as one of the world&apos;s top financial centres and described as much more congested than LA."], "tags": ["Los Angeles Times", "Media", "Robots", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-19T15:55:00Z", "title": "Robot maids and not a mobile in sight \u2013 what the experts predicted for 2013", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2013/mar/19/what-experts-predicted-for-2013", "article": "In 1988, Nicole Yorkin of the Los Angeles Times interviewed 30 futurologists for a piece looking ahead to &quot;a cold, sunny spring morning in April 2013&quot;, imagining the life of the fictional Morrow family in the far-off world of 21st-century LA. Just how accurate were they in predicting life today? What they got right The article&apos;s most strikingly accurate prediction is its description of satnavs: &quot;Autos will \u2026 come equipped with electronic navigation or map systems,&quot; Yorkin writes. &quot;Once the driver programmes a destination, the system will pick the fastest route, taking into account traffic information, then give the driver the estimated time of arrival, continually plotting the car&apos;s position on a map.&quot; Teleconferencing and Skype-style video calls are the norm in the article&apos;s 2013 \u2013 although strangely each Skype call doesn&apos;t start &quot;Have you turned the camera on? I can&apos;t quite hear you&quot; \u2013 and teleconferencing involves a Star Wars-like 3D hologram. But Yorkin is almost spot on about email and the internet: electronic mail allows Alma Morrow to &quot;send and receive messages, graphics, illustrations and animated figures over her computer screen&quot;, while later her mother-in-law conducts &quot;video-banking&quot; using &quot;the Integrated Services Digital Network, which allows the same cables to simultaneously transmit diverse types of information \u2013 voice, data and video&quot;. And her future newspaper is a personalised product featuring only the stories that interest her, which is pretty similar to the Guardian&apos;s mobile app with its sections hand-picked by each reader. Yorkin&apos;s version, however, is &quot;printed by laser-jet printer off the home computer&quot;, which feels pretty stone age today. Mobile phones are notable by their absence, although the Morrows&apos; son Zach has a &quot;personalised portable computer&quot; the size of a credit card. What they got wrong Yorkin&apos;s article avoids the temptations of flying cars and commuter space travel, but it trips up when it comes to robots. Each year we&apos;re told that robotic helpmeets are just around the corner, but sadly specimens such as the Morrows&apos; slightly unreliable robotic manservant Billy Rae, who cooks, cleans, does the washing and makes the bed, haven&apos;t materialised. &quot;Convenience robots that can perform a variety of household tasks may start hitting the marketplace by the late 1990s,&quot; an expert predicts in the article, while at one point Bill Morrow calls the fridge to ask what it&apos;s low on and tells it to have any missing items delivered to the house. Similarly in the morning the house &quot;turns itself on, as it has every morning since the family had it retrofitted with the Smart House system of wiring five years ago&quot; \u2013 although disappointingly this turns out to mean turning the heating and hot water on, which my house can do, and starting up the coffee machine and oven by themselves \u2013 surely a disaster waiting to happen. Perhaps taking a lead from these robotic slaves, there&apos;s a slightly dystopian edge to some of the rules and regulations in the future 2013 \u2013 residents are ordered to leave for work in the morning at staggered times, and 20 minutes&apos; exercise a day is mandatory during work time. But most interesting is the fact that the article reflects the panic of the late 80s and early 90s about the idea that Japan could soon overtake the US as the world&apos;s No 1 nation \u2013 something that can be seen in Michael Crichton&apos;s 1992 novel Rising Sun, for example. Bill&apos;s boss, who arrives by supersonic jet, is Japanese, and Bill is constantly on the phone to colleagues in Tokyo, which is named (correctly) as one of the world&apos;s top financial centres and described as much more congested than LA. But past predictions of the future always include the fears of the present. A 1967 US News and World Report article called &quot;The Wondrous World of 1990&quot; included bodypaint that could protect against radioactivity, while in 1987, with the cold war still dragging grimly on, science fiction writer Frederik Pohl predicted that by 2012 we would see a &quot;world without weaponry&quot; run by the UN. All those references to Japan in the LA Times piece would surely be about China if the paper ran a similar article today."}, {"sentences": ["It&apos;s a unique way to learn, I guess, by playing against Fiji and New Zealand and the best in the world.&quot;  Thirty-two American sevens players (16 men and 16 women) now work full-time at the US Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, near San Diego; Isles has thus been able to spend his time since the USA Sevens in February preparing for Hong Kong and the Tokyo tournament that follows."], "tags": ["Rugby union", "USA rugby union team", "US sports", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-21T12:45:28Z", "title": "Carlin Isles sets out to be new star in Hong Kong rugby sevens heaven", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/21/carlin-isles-usa-hong-kong-sevens", "article": "The Hong Kong Sevens, which takes place this weekend, has a long history of introducing new stars to the rugby world \u2013 Jonah Lomu shone there, as did Christian Cullen; the great Waisale Serevi made the event his own. This year, thanks in large part to a YouTube video that has gone viral, Carlin Isles is the man most people will be watching. The &quot;fastest man in world rugby&quot; is not, however, your average oval-ball phenomenon. For one thing, he&apos;s American and for another, until the summer of 2012, he hadn&apos;t picked up a rugby ball in his life. Asked how he finds his new-found fame, the preternaturally relaxed 23-year-old from Massillon, Ohio, who set records as a college running back and tried out for the 100m at the London Olympics, simply laughs. &quot;It feels good, it feels great,&quot; Isles, says. &quot;I like it. Who wouldn&apos;t? But you know, you have to stay humble with it and keep working hard. I have to be determined to learn my sport.&quot; Wherein lies the key to Isles&apos; story \u2013 though he says that &quot;sometimes, I feel like I was made for rugby&quot;, like many of his countrymen, he is rather new to the game. In the summer of 2012, knowing that as the 36th-fastest man in the US he would not reach London or Rio as a sprinter, Isles watched some sevens online. All he knew was that the sport had a tempting, newly-acquired Olympic status and that &quot;it was a little bit scary&quot;. He adds: &quot;I saw some people with teeth out, bandaged up \u2026 I knew it was a tenacious sport, that you had to be strong physically and mentally to play it.&quot; Showing admirable tenacity, Isles contacted the chief executive of USA Rugby and asked if he could have a game. Nigel Melville, being a former England captain, an elite coach and no fool, looked at Isles&apos;s 100m PB (10.13sec, enough for an Olympic semi-final) and his football CV (good enough to attract NFL scouting) and thought that would be a good idea. After a spot of preparation with the Gentlemen of Aspen rugby club and the Atlantis invitational team, Isles made his US Eagles debut against New Zealand at October&apos;s Gold Coast Sevens. After less than a minute on the pitch, the new boy tackled back, forced a turnover, took a pass and exploited the tiniest of spaces on the wide outside. In a flash, Isles had scored his first international try. He tried to give the referee the ball for the conversion, but such small misunderstandings were quickly ironed out. More fireworks followed in Dubai, Port Elizabeth, Wellington and Las Vegas, and a YouTube video of his tries, entitled &quot;Carlin Isles&apos; Olympic Dream&quot;, headed for 3m hits. &apos;I have to explain the game to my friends and family&apos;            Reading on mobile? See the Carlin Isles video here &quot;It&apos;s a little strange,&quot; Isles says, with another laugh, &quot;to be, or to become, famous in America for playing rugby. I have to explain the game to my friends and family sometimes, when I don&apos;t know it that well myself. We watch it and I try to explain about different teams and all that. A lot of people I know watched the tournament in Vegas who didn&apos;t ever watch rugby before, so perhaps they will now have a little more of a concept about the game. I don&apos;t know if that would come from me explaining it \u2013 I haven&apos;t got the visionary thing about it, but if they see it, they&apos;ll know.&quot; Isles, a stunning athlete who did not make it to the top in the NFL or on the track, might well be the harbinger of an exciting future for American rugby. If Melville and his coaches can find 30 or so more like him \u2013 tight ends or linebackers for back-five forwards \u2013 Haydn Smith, a second row, has recently gone the other way to join the New York Jets, wide receivers or running backs for centres and wings, a new rugby power might be born. Isles also proves the importance of sevens&apos; Olympic inclusion as a magnet for talent worldwide; furthermore, the growing competitiveness of the HSBC Sevens World Series, of which Hong Kong is a part and in which teams such as Kenya, Spain and indeed the USA now challenge strongly, is in part due to the sport&apos;s endorsement by the IOC. &quot;We just keep getting better,&quot; says Isles, when asked about the Eagles&apos; displays this season, which have included a draw with England and near misses against New Zealand and Fiji. &quot;We&apos;re getting closer to the bigger teams and beating the teams we should be beating. I think we&apos;re close to a breakthrough. We need one or two more balls to bounce our way and we need to take a few chances better and we&apos;ll be getting there.&quot; Isles sees his own progress as comparable to that of his team. &quot;I think I&apos;m coming on as a player real good,&quot; he says.  &quot;I&apos;m learning all the time. Now, in a way, I&apos;m going back to the drawing board and looking at a lot of things I&apos;ve learned in order to become better. It&apos;s a unique way to learn, I guess, by playing against Fiji and New Zealand and the best in the world.&quot;  Thirty-two American sevens players (16 men and 16 women) now work full-time at the US Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, near San Diego; Isles has thus been able to spend his time since the USA Sevens in February preparing for Hong Kong and the Tokyo tournament that follows. He&apos;ll do the same, all being well, before Glasgow and London in May and the World Cup Sevens in Moscow in June. The occasional longueurs of such a life aside \u2013 &quot;I don&apos;t enjoy those long sessions in the classroom,&quot; he says of video analysis meetings, given that he &quot;prefers to be out on the field&quot;, and he admits to missing family and friends \u2013 his game and his team can only benefit. That&apos;s just as well, as the Eagles have a tough draw at what will be the biggest Hong Kong Sevens ever \u2013 sharing Pool B with Kenya, France and New Zealand. &quot;I know that it&apos;s a big tournament and that a lot of people like Hong Kong, going there to watch as much as to play,&quot; Isles says, the easygoing generality of his answer betraying an understandably patchy knowledge of rugby and its culture. &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to experiencing it.&quot; It&apos;s safe to say, however, that he won&apos;t be sampling too much of the former colony&apos;s famously social side. &quot;I enjoy relaxing with the guys and chatting about the game and so on,&quot; he says, discussing his grateful acceptance into &quot;the rugby family&quot;, &quot;but I don&apos;t drink, so I can&apos;t have a few beers if they do. I&apos;ll have a glass of water.&quot; Expect, then, an enthralling new chapter in Isles&apos;s story \u2013 and, quite probably, many more. The man himself is as much amused as bemused by the stories linking him to teams in Europe that appeared when he burst on to the scene; he has, after all, never played a game of 15-a-side. But, he says, &quot;15s is on my radar and it&apos;s definitely something I&apos;m going to pursue. I&apos;ve never played a game yet, but I&apos;ve been watching it online, you know.&quot; The world knows, as the Hong Kong Sevens will most likely show, what happened the last time Carlin Isles watched some rugby online."}, {"sentences": ["Graham Ovenden, 70, whose work has hung in Tate Britain and galleries from Paris and Vienna to Tokyo and Peru, rejected allegations in Truro crown court that he blindfolded girls before forcing them to take part in oral sex or explicit games."], "tags": ["UK news", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-21T18:26:00Z", "title": "Artist Graham Ovenden denies abusing young models", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/mar/21/artist-graham-ovenden-young-models", "article": "  A celebrated artist best known for his candid images of children, often unclothed, has denied in court that he sexually abused any of his young models and passionately defended his right to create such paintings and photographs. Graham Ovenden, 70, whose work has hung in Tate Britain and galleries from Paris and Vienna to Tokyo and Peru, rejected allegations in Truro crown court that he blindfolded girls before forcing them to take part in oral sex or explicit games. Asked if he found children sexually attractive, Ovenden replied: &quot;No.&quot; Questioned about why he had described children as &quot;sensual creatures&quot; during a police interview, he said everything from a child to the bark of a tree had sensuality. The artist, who works from a rambling estate on the edge of Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, went on the offensive, accusing the prosecution of being &quot;neurotic&quot; about nakedness in children and claiming that he had sent off a file of his own to the attorney general on how Scotland Yard had investigated his case over the years and warning there would be a &quot;reckoning&quot;. Ovenden, who denies offences of indecency and indecent assault relating to four children \u2013 now all adults \u2013 between 1972 and 1985, told the court of his own idyllic childhood growing up in Hampshire. The poet John Betjeman was a family friend and by the age of 14 Ovenden said he was a &quot;very serious&quot; painter. After school he went to the Royal College of Art, where he studied under Peter Blake. Ovenden said his main interest was English landscapes. But he also took photographs and made paintings of young girls. He told the jury he had created a series based on Nabokov&apos;s character Lolita and had worked with Blake on a project around Lewis Carroll&apos;s Alice books. The artist, bespectacled and white-bearded, said that in the early 70s he and his wife, Annie, also a talented artist, moved with their two children from west London to a 22-acre estate called Barley Splatt in Cornwall. Ovenden said the estate was &quot;a garden of Eden&quot; with beech woods and a &quot;tumbling&quot; stream often visited by other artists, writers and musicians. Families with children stayed there and youngsters tended to discard their clothes &quot;pretty regularly&quot;. He told the jury he took photographs of girls, sometimes clothed, sometimes in Victorian dress and at other times semi- or totally naked. Often these were studies for paintings. Ovenden said the point of the nude images was to show children in a &quot;state of grace&quot;. He claimed he had a &quot;moral obligation&quot; to take such images. The idea of pictures of naked children being obscene was &quot;abhorrent&quot;, he said, and criticised what he saw as a &quot;witch-hunt&quot; over them. Grabbing the collar of his own jacket he said clothes were a &quot;mask&quot;, adding: &quot;What one is is underneath. One of the great qualities of art is to go back to the point of innocence.&quot; Questioned about an image of a girl on a stool with her legs parted, he said it was the natural way to pose when sitting on such a piece of furniture. Ovenden was asked about another alleged victim whom he had photographed clothed and naked from the age of three to around 11. He denied having once got into a bath with her and asking her to wash his penis. Had he put his thumb or penis into her mouth? &quot;Absolutely not,&quot; he replied. Had he taken hold of her breasts? &quot;Certainly not.&quot; During cross-examination, the jury was shown explicit images of child sexual abuse that were found by police on a disc and that the artist accepted he had created. Ovenden claimed the images \u2013 composites of pictures from pornographic magazines and his own drawings \u2013 were made for a project called Through a Glass Darkly that dealt with the corruption of the &quot;state of grace&quot;. Ovenden said he found the images &quot;utterly vile&quot; but that they were the product not of a deviant mind but one that wanted to confront evil in a &quot;clear-eyed&quot; way. He said the work was not complete and would never have been shown in that form. The police were the first publishers of them, he said. Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife put it to Ovenden that he was &quot;sexually besotted with young girls&quot;. The artist replied that the last image he had created of a girl was 24 years ago.

This outstanding debut has all the\u00a0hallmarks of an efficient police procedural \u2013 the initial investigation is\u00a0of a murdered prostitute \u2013 but it&apos;s also a vivid and sensitive depiction of an alarmingly volatile situation, riven with tribal divisions, in a place where glittering towerblocks and shopping malls sit cheek-by-jowl with tin shacks. This, however, is more than mere local colour, with traditions, beliefs and conflicts being properly defining factors in the characterisation of a strong cast, from the vulnerable but dogged Mollel and his partner Kiunga to an evangelical power-couple (&quot;Calling George Nalo ministries a church is a bit like calling the Maasai Mara a petting zoo&quot;) and Superglue Sammy the blind vagrant. The good news is that it is the first in a projected series \u2013 more, please. There&apos;s more tribalism and corruption in Black Irish, the debut novel from New York Times bestselling non-fiction author Stephan Talty (Headline, \u00a319.99), this time in the less\u00a0exotic but equally well\u2011rendered setting of Buffalo, NY. Like other cities in the American rust belt, Buffalo suffers from a beleaguered economy, a\u00a0crumbling infrastructure and a dwindling population, and it&apos;s also home to a clannish community of Irish-Americans who exist in a permanent state of truculent paranoia, clinging to the revolutionary dream of the Old Country. Police officer Abbie Kearney is investigating the death of Jimmy Ryan, whose corpse has been\u00a0found in a local church. He&apos;s been\u00a0tortured, and a toy monkey has been stuffed inside his mouth \u2013 an indication, for those familiar with the genre, of a serial killer with a motif as well as an agenda. The setting, the atmosphere, and the character of Kearney \u2013 prickly and keen to prove herself \u2013 as well as a nice twist at the end, add up to a compelling read. Sheldon Horowitz, an 82-year-old Jewish widower, uprooted by his granddaughter and her husband from New York to Oslo, is the marvellously cantankerous hero of Derek B Miller&apos;s first novel, Norwegian by Night (Faber, \u00a312.99). A veteran of the Korean war, Horowitz puts his memories of military\u00a0training to good use when a neighbour is murdered and, rescuing her six-year-old son from the killer&apos;s clutches, he goes on the run with the boy. Norwegian by Night has all the ingredients of a top-notch thriller, but it&apos;s the superb characterisation of the protagonist that fuels true suspense. Funny and moving as well as thoroughly gripping, this is crime fiction of the highest order. Another accomplished debut, this time set in Wales, is The House on the Cliff by Charlotte Williams (Macmillan, \u00a316.99). Shrinks in literature have an unfortunate habit of becoming overly involved with their clients, and psychotherapist Jessica Mayhew is no\u00a0exception. Beset by trouble at home, she finds herself drawn to a handsome young actor. Gwydion has revealed an\u00a0unusual phobia, and Mayhew is determined to discover the\u00a0reason for the symptoms \u2013 which, she suspects, may be linked to his witnessing, as a child, the drowning of his au pair. Williams, who is training to be a psychotherapist, doesn&apos;t flinch from depicting the dodgier aspects of the\u00a0profession as Mayhew becomes increasingly involved with Gwydion&apos;s family, and her attempts to uncover the truth make for a pacey, intriguing psychological thriller. Salvation of a Saint (Little, Brown, \u00a312.99) by bestselling Japanese author\u00a0Keigo Higashino, translated by\u00a0Alexander O Smith with Elye J Alexander, is less a whodunit, more a\u00a0how-the-hell-did-she-do-it. As with\u00a0Higashino&apos;s earlier novel, The\u00a0Devotion of Suspect X, the plot revolves around the unravelling of an\u00a0apparently watertight alibi by Tokyo detective Kusanagi and his sometime consultant, physicist Yukawa.

Last year saw the lights go out in homes and businesses in more than 6,950 cities and towns. The campaign even went into space when astronauts reduced power on the International Space Station. This year, more than 150 countries and territories are expected to participate, with Palestine, Tunisia, Galapagos, Suriname, French Guyana, St Helena and Rwanda joining the movement for the first time. Some of the key landmarks that will mark the event include the Sydney opera house and Harbour bridge, Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore&apos;s Marina Bay Sands, Tokyo tower, Taipei 101, the Bird&apos;s Nest in Beijing, the Gateway of India, the world&apos;s tallest building the Burj Khalifa, the Ancient Citadel of Erbil in Kurdistan, Table Mountain, the Bosphorus Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, the Brandenburg Gate, the UK Houses of Parliament, Buckingham palace, the Empire State Building, Niagara Falls and Los Angeles airport. Landmarks switching their lights off for the first time for Earth Hour this year include Copenhagen&apos;s Little Mermaid statue and Florence&apos;s Statue of David.            At the global media launch for Earth Hour 2013 in Singapore last month, CEO and co-founder, Andy Ridley, highlighted the grassroots nature of the movement:  &quot;People from all walks of life, from all nations around the world, are the lifeblood of the Earth Hour interconnected global community. They have proven time and time again that if you believe in something strongly enough, you can achieve amazing things. These stories aren&apos;t unique, this is happening all over the world.&quot;  Earth Hour has its share of critics, who say it symbolises environmentalism as living in the dark. Author George Marshall wrote in 2009:  &quot;Asking people to sit in the dark plays very well to a widely held prejudice that &apos;the greens&apos; want us all to go back to living in caves.&quot;  This year, Prof Bjorn Lomborg, a prominent critic of the economic cost of dealing with climate change, has warned the gesture will do little to help the planet and gives people the wrong impression about how to address climate issues:  &quot;Global warming is a real problem, but Earth Hour is not the answer. Taken to its logical conclusion, if switching the lights off for one hour is a good idea, why not for all the other 8,759 hours of the year?             Some energy experts have also said that Earth Hour could result in an increase in carbon emissions and place great strain on electricity grids. Fossil-fuelled power stations could be required to fire up quickly when everyone turns their lights back on, &quot;rendering all good intentions useless at a flick of a switch&quot;. But WWF maintains Earth Hour is not about saving energy but raising awareness. Part of this year&apos;s campaign is &quot;I Will If You Will&quot; \u2013 where you can pledge to take action beyond Earth Hour and get your friends, family and colleagues involved. WWF also wants to spread the word using social media. Earth Hour events around the world Organisers in the United Kingdom hope to break the record of 7 million people who took part last year. Landmarks that will turn off their lights include Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, Trafalgar Square, BFI Imax, the London Eye, the Gherkin, Edinburgh castle, Brighton Pier, Westminster abbey, Durham cathedral, Old Trafford, Canterbury cathedral, Windsor Castle and Tewkesbury abbey. WWF-UK is hosting a night at the Southbank in London that will stream live content from around the world and feature a live acoustic performance by the band McFly, who have done the Harlem Shake in panda onesies to launch the campaign. Celebrity chefs including Raymond Blanc, Gordon Ramsay and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall have created special recipes for families to prepare and eat by candlelight, and WWF has teamed up with a Kevin McCloud, Miranda Richardson and Alistair McGowan, who have recorded readings of Rudyard Kipling&apos;s famous Just So stories.            Earth Hour organisers and WWF affiliate Fundaci\u00f3n Vida Silvestre is encouraging participants in Argentina to support a senate bill to make Banco Namuncur\u00e1 (Burdwood) a marine protected area. If passed, the 34,000-km sq area will raise the protected area of Argentina&apos;s seas from 1% to 4%. In 2007, 2.2 million people took part in the first Earth Hour in Sydney. This year, some of Australia&apos;s most famous landmarks will glow green to symbolise their commitment to renewable energy. Sydney Opera House, the Arts Centre in Melbourne and Council House in Perth will be all be powered by 100% clean energy and organisers are asking Australians to &quot;switch off for good by switching on to renewable energy&quot;. Towns and suburbs with the highest number of pledges will win solar power systems for their councils from Sungevity. Community events are also being planned, from stargazing Sydney to night runs in Queensland and BBQ bushwalk in Canberra. In Botswana, former president Festus Mogae has marked a four-year commitment to plant 1 million indigenous trees with the planting of 100,000 trees in Goodhope, a severely degraded area in southern Botswana. The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada will dim its lights for the sixth year running \u2013 the city was the second ever to back the campaign. Vancouver was named this week as the winner of the Earth Hour city challenge, for its &quot;overall holistic and strategic approach to climate action&quot;. It beat 16 other finalists including Sydney, New Dehli, San Francisco and Olso. The Indian subcontinent will switch off the Gateway of India lights at the same time as four villages in Madhya Pradesh receive solar lanterns, the first form of energy they will ever use. WWF says Earth Hour will be the first piece of environmental action taking place in Palestine since its UN recognition as a state. Earth Hour is being coordinated from both Gaza and the West Bank, with switch-off events taking place at Al-Jundi and Palestine squares, in Gaza City, and the cities of Nablus, Bethlehem, and Ramallah. Russia will switch off the lights at around 100 landmarks across 50 cities and towns. Following a successful petition last year that was instrumental in the passing of a law to protect the seas from oil pollution, this year WWF Earth Hour Russia is turning its attention to forest protection. Organisers are on their way to securing more than 100,000 signatures for a petition to change forest legislation. The amendments would reinstate a ban on industrial logging and protect almost 18% of all Russian forests \u2013 equal to an area of land twice the size of France. In Tunisia, which is taking part in Earth Hour for the first time this year, 11 cities and towns will turn their lights off, with the main event taking place at Avenue Habib Bourguiba, the site of the initial protests that sparked the Arab Spring. It will be attended by Tunisia&apos;s president, Moncef Marzouki. In Uganda, where 6,000 hectares of deforestation occurs every month, WWF Uganda is aiming to fill close to 2,700 hectares of degraded land with at least 500,000 indigenous trees as part of Earth Hour 2013. In the United States, New York city landmarks taking place include Times Square, the Rockefeller centre and the Empire State Building. The bright lights of the Las Vegas strip will also go dark for the hour, as well as Los Angeles airport and Niagara Falls. \u2022 Follow Earth Hour live"}, {"sentences": ["The majority of its 1,000 staff works in the company&apos;s London offices, but international secondments are available to one of 15 global offices, including Tokyo, Singapore, Melbourne and Johannesburg."], "tags": ["Employers list"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-22T17:19:25Z", "title": "IG Group Holdings", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/careers/ig-group-holdings", "article": "    A member of the FTSE 250 and listed on the London stock exchange, the IG Group is a world-leading provider of online financial derivatives, including spreadbets and contracts for difference (CFDs).

He does not look his age, more like an amiable ascetic with a tidy moustache, medium-length grey hair, dressed in a shirt and jeans. Not a man of many words, his eyes casting slightly anxious glances here and there, but he is very attentive to others. In 1969 he founded Edition of Contemporary Music, aka ECM, in Munich. Okwui Enwezor, the head of Munich&apos;s Haus der Kunst, recently curated ECM \u2013 A Cultural Archaeology, assisted by historian Markus M\u00fcller. The exhibition has been a huge success, but what is there to show about a record label? Does ECM represent a work, an action, perhaps even an exception? &quot;No,&quot; Eicher replies gently, &quot;it&apos;s my life. What matters to me is the sense of being alive every day.&quot; So what was it all about? A retrospective, an installation, a display of record sleeves, photographs? &quot;I&apos;m not sure Munich remembers us,&quot; Eicher adds. He often says &quot;us&quot;. Much to my surprise the exhibition manages to conjure up much of ECM&apos;s magic. It centres on a room decorated with red neon lights, where a Jean-Luc Godard film loops endlessly. &quot;To begin with I was puzzled by the idea of an exhibition,&quot; Eicher says. &quot;I just let them get on with it. It&apos;s very moving.&quot; From Tokyo to Vancouver, ECM is known for its top-notch artists, arty typeface, old-style photos, in short its style. Being an ECM artist allows self-expression in a community no-one would disown. Eicher must read a lot because in an attempt to explain the sort of independent label he wanted to set up, he describes it as &quot;the equivalent of Gallimard, POL [as in Paul Otchakovsky-Laurens], or Minuit&quot;. He grew up on the shores of Lake Constance. Discovering jazz turned him into a double-bass player, the linchpin of any band. He could have joined the Berlin Philharmonic or worked as a sound engineer for Deutsche Grammophon, but he preferred free jazz and revolt. In See the Music, the 1971 film by Theodor Kotulla which opens the exhibition, we see Eicher on bass accompanying Marion Brown (alto sax), Leo Smith (trumpet), Fred Braceful (percussion) and Thomas Stowsand (cello). This was definitely free jazz, pushing the limits in every sense. ECM invented itself as part of this exploratory process, in the art of listening to fellow musicians, of subconscious communication and experiment. Free At Last, its debut release in 1969, featured Mal Waldron, piano, with Isla Eckinger, bass, and Clarence Becton, drums. Now the ECM catalogue boasts 1,515 items, spanning 11 centuries of music, a vast range of styles and genres. It is home to the Art Ensemble of Chicago and some very loyal contributors including Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Gary Burton, Carla Bley, Charlie Haden, Jan Garbarek, Ralph Towner, Jack DeJohnette and Pat Metheny. Here too we find the 12th century polyphonist P\u00e9rotin, Carlo Gesualdo and JS Bach, but also Luciano Berio and John Adams. And of course there are quite a few outstanding boxed sets, in particular 10 albums devoted to Jarrett in Japan. There are militant acts: The Ballad of the Fallen, a flamboyant opera; Escalator Over the Hill with Carla Bley and Paul Haines; and priceless recordings by Paul Bley, Lester Bowie, Ed Blackwell, Billy Higgins and Charles Lloyd. ECM attracted the greatest stylists, such as Gary Peacock, Steve Swallow, Eberard Weber and Miroslav Vitous, but also some daring adventurers, John Surman, Louis Sclavis and Rava, and American minimalists, notably Steve Reich. Eicher \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 opted to treat the soundtracks of Nouvelle Vague films as a form of modern-day opera. But there was Arvo P\u00e4rt&apos;s ground-breaking Tabula Rasa too, and of course the Codona Trio, with Don Cherry, Collin Walcott and Nana Vasconcelos. The story behind Tabula Rasa is revealing. In 1977, with the iron curtain still firmly in place, the work was first performed in Tallinn. Eicher heard it on the radio in Armenia. He set out to track down the composer and finally produced the record in 1984, adding two versions of Fratres by Jarrett, on piano and Gidon Kremer, on violin. The album was a revelation. The same could be said of Facing You, Jarrett&apos;s 1972 solo recording, and of course the K\u00f6ln Concert three years later, which sold 4 million copies. But success made no difference to Eicher. He carried on his wandering existence, with a Nagra tape-recorder in his backpack, always on the look-out for musicians. And wherever he went he would listen to the radio at night. &quot;To begin with I just wanted to record the musicians I liked,&quot; Eicher explains. &quot;I didn&apos;t know such a small label would grow so big.&quot; In his drive to bring avant-garde music to the attention of the largest possible audience, he achieved a remarkably consistent mixture with extremely diverse ingredients, pulling in free jazz, classical, cutting-edge contemporary, ethnic, vocal and meditative strands. This in turn he enhanced with beautifully designed artwork. ECM must be &quot;the most beautiful sound next to silence&quot;, said Canada&apos;s Coda magazine. For more than four decades Eicher has done as he likes, guided by his tastes alone, simply seeking new musical encounters, with an ongoing concern for mutual respect between performers and technicians, in short responding to the pleasure principle. Some might complain that Eicher has no regard for demand, that he flouts market pressures. If so he does it without acting the hero, without twisting anyone&apos;s arm &quot;for the cause&quot;, and without ripping off his business partners. He has produced a wealth of music, with a very well organised distribution network and commercial savvy largely on a par with the label&apos;s reputation. He has notched up several global successes, made some stunning discoveries, working with people who set a fair number of trends. But above all what remains is a sound, a way of doing things and limitless imagination. \u2022 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde"}, {"sentences": ["Hyber&apos;s show has travelled from the\u00a0Palais de Tokyo in Paris, and now fills the Baltic&apos;s top floor with his ruminations on climate and stem cells, sunshine and storms, cycles of growth and decay."], "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-26T18:30:00Z", "title": "Fabrice Hyber: but is it fruit?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/mar/26/fabrice-hyber-baltic", "article": "A big, inflatable cloud hangs\u00a0overhead, and a slanting rain falls inside the Baltic in Gateshead. It&apos;s only cartoon rain, made from yards and yards of fishing line, which tether the cloud to the gallery floor. Where would artists be\u00a0without nylon monofil? It&apos;s a lumbering idea, as dreary as the weather Fabrice Hyber is trying to emulate. Hyber&apos;s show has travelled from the\u00a0Palais de Tokyo in Paris, and now fills the Baltic&apos;s top floor with his ruminations on climate and stem cells, sunshine and storms, cycles of growth and decay. There&apos;s a lot of weather here, though it isn&apos;t a comment on our terrible climate or the drizzle in the English soul. The singular pleasure of this exhibition lies in what happens behind the three closed doors of the little sheds he has built in the gallery. One contains a scatter of rainbow blips of watery sunshine. Another shed contains a thunderstorm, with lightning flashes, dark rumbles and water falling on the sodden duckboards at your feet. The third had me backing out with a yowl, my scarf unfurling behind me. I don&apos;t want to spoil it for you, but do note the enormous electric fan built into the shed&apos;s side-wall, which turns itself on as you enter. Then there&apos;s the mountain of cocaine. Actually, it is salt, but it looks like the biggest pile of coke in the world. I am allergic, but do try some. Then go and flush out your sinuses in the two side-by-side sinks installed near the sheds. These are a surprise, too. Turn the tap in one sink, and the water gushes from the faucet in the other. I had a plumber who did things like that. The salt sits alongside mounds of red chilli peppers, natural sea sponges and 400,000 shiny copper coins, borrowed from the Paris mint. All that lovely lucre makes me go all giddy, though it could be the heady aroma emanating from the big polypropylene vats nearby, half-filled with apples and grapes, just beginning\u00a0their process of decay and fermentation. Flowers wilt and rot in metal cages. All this reminds me of Anya Gallaccio&apos;s early work, but seems more thrown together and much less poetic. Standing among it all is a life-sized man made of fruit and veg, like an Arcimboldo painting come to life. I guess the point is that we are what we eat. The whole thing is tripe, really, as unoriginal as it is indigestible. Hyber also draws and makes what might be taken as paintings. They look a bit like Joseph Beuys&apos;s diagrams, without all the heavy breathing and Beuys&apos;s mental baggage. Beuys&apos;s thought was largely claptrap, too, yet\u00a0it\u00a0evidenced a rich and baggy imagination, and he produced some wonderful things. Hyber has a lighter touch, but there doesn&apos;t seem to be a lot going on in there. Lets talk about lipstick. There&apos;s a whole cubic metre of the stuff, and it&apos;s not my colour. Waxy and red and dumb-looking, it is in fact a wooden cube with a thin covering of Yves St Laurent No 1 rouge lippy, like a transvestite bit of minimalism. But this is no queering of the minimalist aesthetic, nor a critique of macho 1960s art. Hyber sees it more as a cubic metre of beauty. If only. Anti-sexy and inert, the red cube is a distant cousin to Beuys&apos;s famous lump of lard on a chair. Hyber used to be called Hybert, but\u00a0chopped off the final &quot;t&quot; for some reason. He is trifling with us, and this show of lo-cal ideas and casual gestures may be full of stuff, but is lacking substance. A self-portrait sculpture has\u00a0the artist looking like a monk in a habit, in a fishtank full of water and gurgling bubbles. The figure could almost be a plaster saint, its bland face lost among the froth. The weather improves a bit towards the rear of the gallery, where it&apos;s a good drying day, as evidenced by row after row of closely spaced washing lines draped in scrim and translucent cloth, on which Hyber has written little phrases and made cursory drawings. You are invited to wander on fake grass through the 20 rows, as if rummaging through the artist&apos;s brain. Pictographic suns, spirals, the odd portentous phrase: &quot;Heavy time&quot;; &quot;virus slave&quot;. These are thoughts hung out to dry. Hyber recently accepted the 2014 Monumenta commission for Paris&apos;s Grand Palais \u2013 following Richard Serra, Christian Boltanski and Daniel Buren \u2013 although it looks likely the French government will cancel the project due to the economic climate. At the back of the gallery is another little chamber. Entirely constructed from empty fridges, with their lights on and doors open, I thought about the\u00a0profligate use of electricity and the\u00a0effect on the planet. Hyber thinks of his show as a &quot;mental spa&quot;, so I suppose all this is cleansing. I just got a\u00a0bit hot under the collar, as well as hungry, my toxins raging."}, {"sentences": ["Penny wise and pound foolish.John KennedyTokyo  \u2022 The Cyprus bailout deal seems iniquitous."], "tags": ["Cyprus", "Europe", "Euro", "European Union", "Economics", "Angela Merkel", "Germany"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-26T21:00:03Z", "title": "Letters: Fallout from the Cyprus bailout", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/26/fallout-cyprus-bailout", "article": "The EU, after spending hundreds of billions on the European banking crisis, has decided that for less than \u20ac20bn they will force a member state to confiscate depositors&apos; money (Report, 26 March).

Analysts said the company could list with a valuation of up to \u00a33.5bn, three years after it walked away from a planned \u00a3bn initial public offering (IPO). Expansion in the US and Asia helped offset tougher times in Europe last year \u2013 where it was hit by miserable weather and competition from the London Olympics \u2013 lifting revenues by 15% to \u00a31.07bn in the year to December. Operating profits rose 16.5% to \u00a3258m as visitor numbers to the group&apos;s 94 international theme parks and attractions rose 16% to 54m. Nick Varney, the chief executive, said: &quot;We are currently giving active consideration to potential options for an IPO which preferably, but not definitely, would be in the UK.&quot; He said Merlin, which pulled plans for a public listing in 2010, was talking to potential investors and weighing up whether to list in London or the US some time in this year or next. &quot;We are well invested with a strong brand, world-class quality product and the City is familiar with us as a company,&quot; he said. Analysts agreed that Merlin would be an attractive proposition for investors, if priced correctly. They said they would like the level of debt, which is about 3.5 times underlying earnings, to come down slightly but that would not stand in the way of a successful flotation. Merlin ended 2012 with \u00a31.27bn of debt, broadly the same as a year before, after spending \u00a392m on improving its existing sites and \u00a371m on new businesses. &quot;IPO markets are open again in the UK and Merlin is a very good business that has been well run. Despite the recession, people continue to spend money on leisure and Merlin has some great assets that it would be difficult to replicate,&quot; said Nick Batram, an analyst at Peel Hunt. Visitor numbers at Merlin&apos;s UK attractions were flat last year as the weather hit outdoor parks such as Alton Towers but benefited indoor attractions such as the London Dungeon. Legoland Windsor, boasting a new themed hotel, was one of the few outdoor parks to see a rise. The group&apos;s top performers were overseas ventures such as its Madame Tussauds attractions in Asia and Legoland in California. A fifth of turnover now comes from North America and 14% from Asia and the Pacific region, which accounted for just 2% of sales two years ago. Varney said he expected a bounce back in the UK this year as there would be no competition from the Olympics, which drew 10m visitors away from alternative days out. Elsewhere, Merlin is opening Legoland Discovery Centres in Canada, Germany and Westchester, New York; a new Madame Tussauds in Tokyo; a Dungeon in Berlin and a Sea Life Centre in Manchester. It will also open a 250-bedroom Legoland hotel at its California park, as it continues its strategy of adding themed accommodation at its parks. The scariest new ride will be The Smiler at Alton Towers, which is still under construction. &quot;It&apos;s the first ride I&apos;ve looked at and wondered if I could go on it,&quot; said Varney. &quot;It&apos;s a spaghetti of twists and turns and loops and we&apos;ve been adding psychological tricks that make you feel like you&apos;ve been hypnotised.&quot; Merlin worldwide: Numbers of attractions \u2022 44 Sea Life centres, including the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and Germany \u2022 14 Madame Tussauds, including Bangkok, Shanghai and Las Vegas \u2022 10 Legoland discovery centres, including Manchester, Tokyo and Chicago \u2022 8 Dungeons, including The London Dungeon and Hamburg Dungeon \u2022 6 Legoland parks, including Windsor and California \u2022 5 theme parks, including Alton Towers and Chessington World of Adventures \u2022 It also owns two ski resorts, The London Eye, Blackpool Tower \u2022 Tree Top adventure parks based in Australia and Warwick Castle"}, {"sentences": ["The US Eagles will compete in this weekend&apos;s Tokyo Sevens."], "tags": ["Rugby union", "USA rugby union team", "Rio 2016", "NFL", "Denver Broncos", "College football", "College sports", "US sports", "US news", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-27T21:50:00Z", "title": "Maurice Clarett details decision to swap football for rugby in Rio Olympics bid", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/27/maurice-clarett-football-rugby-sevens-olympics", "article": "     Maurice Clarett, the former Ohio State Buckeyes running back who was drafted by the Denver Broncos before going to jail, then re-emerging in the United Football League with the Omaha Nighthawks, has spoken about his decision to attempt a switch to rugby in time for the Rio Olympics in 2016. Speaking on CBS Sports Radio&apos;s The Doug Gottlieb Show, Clarett, 29, said: &quot;I&apos;ve never played rugby, I&apos;ve always watched it and been intrigued by it, because I thought it resembled football in a lot of ways. I have ventured over to something that is very physical, very fast, very like football.&quot; Clarett said he had not yet played a game of rugby, but added that it was &quot;very humbling to learn another skill set. It&apos;s not about big guys with brutal force, it&apos;s about angles and positioning. It&apos;s a lot of fun.&quot; Clarett is training at Tiger Rugby, an academy based in Columbus, Ohio that aims to produce Olympic-standard players. Announcing Clarett&apos;s decision last week, Tiger Rugby coach Paul Holmes said: &quot;He&apos;s ridiculous. That&apos;s all I can say. His footwork is phenomenal. He&apos;s nowhere near conditioned for rugby, but that will come \u2026 The stuff he&apos;s doing in the gym right now, he&apos;s just ridiculous.&quot; On Wednesday, Clarett said: &quot;My ultimate goal is to become an Olympian, absolutely. You take yourself as a student, like you would be in football. I started off at home watching YouTube videos. You watch guys who are in front of you, who are better than you, and you try to mimic them.&quot; Asked about his new training regime, he said: &quot;Rugby&apos;s been beating me into the ground these last few days \u2013 the cardiovascular, the anaerobic system is completely different to football.&quot; Asked if anyone had switched to rugby to become an Olympian before, Clarett said &quot;I haven&apos;t the slightest clue.&quot; In fact, the path from American football to rugby sevens \u2013 which gained Olympic status in 2009 \u2013 is becoming rather well trodden. Carlin Isles, a former Ashland University running back and national top 40 sprinter, has made a considerable splash on the HSBC Sevens World Series circuit this season as &quot;the fastest man in rugby&quot;, thanks in part to a YouTube video of his exploits which has attracted close to 3 million views. Miles Craigwell, a former Brown linebacker and Miami Dolphins safety, has also played for the US Eagles sevens team, and the USA Rugby national coaches Mike Tolkin (15-a-side) and Alex Magleby (sevens) and chief executive Nigel Melville have made no secret of their aim to recruit athletes from more established US sports. In 2003, Clarett scored the winning touchdown in the 2002 National Championship Game, against Miami. After failing in an attempt to enter the NFL draft early he eventually joined the Broncos, only to be released during preseason. He was jailed in 2006, over aggravated robbery and concealed weapons charges, and released in 2010.  Rugby sevens, which has been played at the Commonwealth Games since 1998 and has had its own World Cup since 1993, will be played in the Olympic Games for the first time in 2016. A short-handed version of rugby&apos;s usual 15-a-side format, it prioritises pace, fitness and spacial awareness.

When curator Shamita Sharmacharja visited Japan to speak to the artists who made the works she found them slightly\u00a0surprised that their work was considered art. To them it was just what\u00a0they do, often in almost all their waking hours. &quot;In Japan, the concept of outsider art does not really exist,&quot; she said. &quot;It is something they are learning about from European interest in it.&quot; Outsider art was coined as a term to describe art created beyond mainstream culture, such as in mental health institutions, although it now more generally defines work made by artists without art school training and outside the market. In the Wellcome show all the work has been made in institutions or day care\u00a0centres. As well as tapestries and paintings, there is an army of diminutive superheroes made from bin ties, pottery lion dogs with bristling manes, and life-size rag dolls representing people who have been kind to Sakiko Kono in her 55 years in an institution. None of the works was made to be exhibited, and some of the artists gave their treasures up reluctantly. Takahiro Shimoda, who makes suits painted and embroidered with his favourite foods, sent his fried chicken, salmon roe and pigeon-shaped cookies pyjamas, but insisted on keeping the ones he likes best. Shota Katsube, the wire tie sculptor, loaned a collection of hundreds of tiny warriors, but couldn&apos;t bear to part with an even more elaborate piece. The youngest artist in the show, 17-year-old Norimitsu Kokubo, was uneasy about sending his huge map of the world because it&apos;s not finished after two years of solid work. Although made up of hundreds of thousands of minutely detailed drawings, of skyscrapers, Ferris wheels, train tracks, car parks, prisons and office blocks \u2013 he has sourced images of many buildings on the internet, so the works of some well-known architects including Zaha Hadid are quite recognisable \u2013 he has only covered 8.3 metres of his intended 10 metre scroll, and was worried that it would look silly. It doesn&apos;t. Some of the work has been made at the artists&apos; homes, but most comes from workshops and studios in care centres, where art is considered to have therapeutic powers. The staff are charged to give free rein to the creators, without giving any direction as to what they should make. Many of the imposing ceramics, some looking like ancient museum pieces, were made in the pottery at Omi Gakuen, which used to make domestic crockery until it was taken over in 1954 by the renowned ceramics artist Kazuo Yagi. This is the last major exhibition at the Wellcome before the interior of the building, a victim of its own success, is torn apart in a \u00a317.5m project to create new display and public spaces. It opened five years ago expecting around 100,000 visitors a year, but has been attracting five times as many. Recent blockbuster exhibitions have often been gory, with shows devoted to brain surgery, open-heart surgery and, most recently, death \u2013 which pulled in more than 3,000 visitors a day in its last, packed weekends. Souzou is a gentler, happier experience. This time the walls are blazing with colour, despite the fact that some of the artists have had desperately sad lives. Kenichi Yamazaki, who makes exquisitely coloured blueprints of fantasy engineering projects, pierced with tiny holes so they are as lacy as cobwebs, explains in an interview filmed in his hospital that he used to work as a building labourer in Tokyo, &quot;but I worked too much and I broke down&quot;. Masao Obata&apos;s elegant crayon drawings on cardboard represent to him his yearning to be married, now unlikely to be realised. The exhibition has deliberately been given an untranslatable title, Souzou, which in Japanese can mean either creation or imagination, depending on how it is written.

The world&apos;s most advanced passenger plane has been grounded since January after battery fires on two of its jets. This week Boeing announced that it had completed the first successful test flights after making changes to its lithium-ion battery systems. &quot;We have a high degree of confidence in the technical solution we are testing right now with the Federal Aviation Administration,&quot; said Jim McNerney. &quot;I think it will be sooner than later.&quot; He expected the tests to conclude in a few days and said the data should be conclusive enough to persuade regulators to let the plane fly again. He called the grounding a &quot;frustrating experience&quot; but said regulators were putting safety first. &quot;They have the best interest of the flying public in mind,&quot; McNerney said. Boeing is believed to be testing a new casing for the batteries and a venting system to disperse potentially flammable gases. The Dreamliner has been built with a radical carbon-fibre structure designed to make the plane as light as possible, generating savings on fuel that have made the jet an attractive proposition to customers such as Thomson Airways in the UK. The first serious incident to affect the plane saw a 787 battery burst into flames on 7 January while it was parked at Logan airport in Boston. The second incident took place on 16 January when a battery triggered a smoke alarm while in flight in Japan.

The Art Treasures of Great Britain may still be the biggest exhibition of fine art ever held in Britain, comprising over 16,000 works, from Michelangelo to Hogarth. It drew over 1.3 million visitors \u2013 four times the population of Manchester at the time \u2013 including Gladstone and Disraeli. This was the world&apos;s first blockbuster art show \u2013 a massive, temporary collection of works put on for a crowd. Most of the features of the blockbuster exhibition as Britons know it today were already present at that Old Trafford show. Then as now, there was the borrowing of work from disparate, usually private, collections. (&quot;What in the world do you want with art in Manchester?&quot; asked the Duke of Devonshire. &quot;Why can&apos;t you stick to your cotton spinning?&quot;). There was fine art as must-see, with Bradford mill-owner Titus Salt chartering three trains for his workers, followed by the complaint that too few were looking at the paintings. Popping his head into the second-class refreshment room, American novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne noted: &quot;John Bull and his female may be seen in full gulp and guzzle, swallowing vast quantities of cold boiled beef, thoroughly moistened with porter or bitter.&quot; It became the holy grail for any blockbuster curator: a cultural event that grips the public imagination. As Engels reported to Marx: &quot;Everyone up here is an art lover just now and the talk is all of the pictures at the exhibition.&quot; Those queuing up for Manet at the Royal Academy this weekend (40,000 advance tickets sold) or for Pompeii at the British Museum (71,858 visits booked before this week&apos;s opening ) are continuing the traditions begun in Old Trafford. Today, aeroplanes make it easier to transport valuable pieces. And the formula of the big show \u2013 the investment bank sponsorship, the themed lecture programme, the well-signposted giftshop \u2013 is now firmly established. But the controversies remain the same. What&apos;s changed is the number of blockbuster shows \u2013 and how widely spread they are. The Art Newspaper recently found that the three most popular exhibitions of last year (based on daily attendance) were in Tokyo, Rio and St Petersburg respectively. The RA&apos;s David Hockney show came in at number five. It was the spread of the blockbuster model that alarmed the late art historian Francis Haskell. He warned that these shows were supplanting the traditional role of the permanent collection and would mean that museums were judged on ticket sales. That still sounds like a warning rather than an accurate prediction. The V&amp;A may have its own blockbuster on David Bowie, but just a couple of years ago it had an exhibition on quilts. Far fewer visitors to the Tate will see its Kurt Schwitters show than the Lichtenstein retrospective, but it&apos;s there nonetheless. The serious argument is over balance. One of the British Museum&apos;s most imaginative shows was on the Hindu goddess Durga. By drawing on its collection of Bengali art and drawing on the participation of local Bengalis, it reflected an important part of the culture of ethnically mixed London. More museums engaging with their communities, rather than displaying the latest jetsetting collection, would be all to the good. But the blockbuster will always be valuable for providing audiences with once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to look upon treasures. As John Elderfield, formerly of the Museum of Modern Art, recently observed of Tate Modern: &quot;It&apos;s not only about looking closely at works of art; it&apos;s moving around within a sort of cultural spectacle. I have friends who think this is the end of civilisation, but a lot more people are going to be in the presence of art, and some of them will look at things and be transported by them.&quot; As an appraisal of blockbusters too that sounds realistic \u2013 and not a bad result."}, {"sentences": ["Founded the Ushida Findlay partnership in Tokyo with then-husband Eisaku Ushida."], "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-02T14:28:56Z", "title": "Kathryn Findlay, architect \u2013 portrait of the artist", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/apr/02/kathryn-findlay-architect-portrait-artist", "article": "What got you started? A trip to Charles Rennie Mackintosh&apos;s Glasgow School of Art while at art college in Edinburgh. It was an alchemy of space, light, shadow and materials. I loved the idea of combining something poetic with something practical. What was your big breakthrough? Designing the Soft and Hairy House [a\u00a0home with a rooftop garden] when I\u00a0was in Japan. That allowed us to carry a very different, Japanese way of working with traditional crafts into the English countryside, where we designed a series of thatched swimming pools. What&apos;s different about the Japanese approach to architecture? In Japan, architecture isn&apos;t just about what something looks like, but about all the senses: smells, sounds, textures. A traditional bathhouse, for instance, is built from cypress wood, which releases fantastic natural oils with the steam. It&apos;s almost synaesthetic \u2013 as if one sense swaps into the other \u2013 and it really opened my eyes. Your work has often been called &apos;green&apos;. Are ecological concerns important to you? Yes \u2013 but it&apos;s not just about counting carbon. What&apos;s even more important is your general attitude to the environment: not seeing buildings in isolation. Who or what is your greatest source of\u00a0inspiration? I loved working with Anish Kapoor on the Orbit. He has an incredible sense of\u00a0pure experience \u2013 of darkness and light, and of how to make an artwork as strong an experience as possible. He doesn&apos;t get caught up in detail. He captures what I try to do in architecture. Do you suffer for your art? My children suffered from having their mum working, and moving from one country to the other. But I think it&apos;s made them self-motivated people. What&apos;s the worst thing anyone ever said about you? We earned some disapproval in Japan for not being minimalists. But you just have to keep ploughing the furrow you see ahead of you, and hope that at some point they&apos;ll understand you, and you&apos;ll understand them. What&apos;s your greatest ambition? To die solvent. What&apos;s the biggest myth about being an architect? That we&apos;ve all got big egos. Architects are essentially thoughtful and structured, and we like to work in a team. What one song would work as the soundtrack to your life? Spiegel im Spiegel by Arvo P\u00e4rt. It&apos;s quiet and nuanced; no matter how often I listen to it, I never tire of it. Do you care about fame? Professional respect is important to me\u00a0rather than fame. Architecture is complex \u2013 it&apos;s not a superficial brand game. If branding and fame were my goals, I&apos;d be doing something else. In short Born: Finavon, Scotland, 1954. Career: Studied at the Architectural Association in London.

El Buen Retiro (on Estamos Felices, one of our favorite independent labels) is Carmel&apos;s first album, in which they manage to combine experimentation with electronica and melodies. Tu Momento is the first single from the record, available on iTunes.  AUSTRALIA: Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Jesse Davidson - WinterJesse Davidson is a 16-year-old songwriter from Adelaide. The track we&apos;ve chosen may be called Winter, but we think it sounds more like Grizzly Bear recording a leisurely acoustic session somewhere off the Caribbean coast. Alongside muted drums and blissful guitar embellishments that resurface every so often, there&apos;s something really pure about Jesse&apos;s music. He manages to capture the beauty of isolation in a way that never seems forced. Honest, effortless indie-folk.  AUSTRIA: Walzerk\u00f6nigKidcat Lo-Fi - Life SucksA singer-songwriter with a feminist tendency, Kidcat Lo-Fi&apos;s songs range from love to hate and from protest to irony. Her self-titled debut album, out in April, is consciously kept raw and will feature songs called I Will Not Marry Or Reproduce and I Want To Be A Cat. Don&apos;t we all?  BRAZIL: Meio DesligadoKarina Zeviani - UpdateEveryone should learn Portuguese to get the true feeling of Update, a ballad about the end of a relationship. Karina Zeviani, the former singer of Nouvelle Vague and Thievery Corporation, released her first solo album last year.  CANADA: Quick Before It MeltsEagle Lake Owls - Little Brittle BonesYou can hear the world thawing from winter&apos;s cold grip on Little Brittle Bones, from Winnipeg, Manitoba&apos;s Eagle Lake Owls. The slow and steady vibration of spring echoes through the song&apos;s opening moments, before it shakes the last shards of ice off and swells into life. Songs like this are what keep you going through the isolation of a prairie winter.  CHILE: Super 45WatchOut! - GuayabitaAlthough in the beginning WatchOut! stood out with a sound strongly influenced by Los Saicos&apos; primitive punk and North American psychedelic garage, they&apos;ve now turned to Latin America. In Guayabita, the first preview of their forthcoming album Tribu, to be released by local label BYM Records, the spirit of tropicalia, fusion music and Chilean psychedelia come alive to shape the new sound of WatchOut!  COLOMBIA: El Parlante AmarilloDorado - Out Of Her DepthDavid Triana aka Dorado is an electronic music producer and DJ from Bogota. His style is a coalescence of UK bass, techno and house music, although in his early life he was greatly influenced by hardcore punk. Triana is currently working with Downpitch Recordings, a new label from his home city. Out Of Her Depth is taken from Tribute EP, his first release.  CUBA: suenacubano.comKaramba - Vivir La VidaWe are happy to begin our participation in MAP with a different approach to what is generally known of Cuban music. Vivir La Vida is an ode to self-esteem. It&apos;s a song that invites reflection on our path to being and behaving in these troubled times. With his own particular stamp, Karamba uses cumbia, hip hop and rock &apos;n&apos; roll, combining the freshness of his lyrics and refrains to recreate the impeccable taste that permeates Cuban music.  DENMARK: All ScandinavianBite The Bullet - I Feel LoveThe first five songs by Bite The Bullet are released in Germany this month, one being this MAP exclusive download. Comprising one half of one of my favorite Danish bands, the sadly defunct Highway Child, BTB rock in the same retro vein as HC (the abbreviations end here) and still seem a live force to reckoned with as this video shows. A full vinyl release is coming up this fall and I for one can&apos;t wait.  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: La CaseteraOcean Lips - SubmarineOcean Lips take inspiration from Brit-rock, modern art and, of course, the ocean. Their first single Submarine evokes breezy feelings with the wavy sound of their guitars, taking us for a ride to the bottom of the sea.  ECUADOR: Plan ArteriaMunn - En La ObscuridadMunn is one of the country&apos;s best new bands. Their first EP Espirales mixes an electronic rhythm section with different types of samples, analog and digital synthesizers, acoustic instruments, bass, electric guitar and layers of voices, generating atmospheres of trip hop and downtempo. En La Obscuridad is Munn&apos;s second single and its video was directed by Lucia Romero.  ENGLAND: The Guardian Music BlogYYZ - Into The NightInto The Night is a sublime blast of ravey pop from the synth prodder, DJ-cum-FX-whiz and perky chanteuse known as YYZ. Formerly members of Ting Tings surrogates Ghostcat, and with a CV that includes remixing a single by Nicola Roberts of Girls Aloud, YYZ are now purveying an even more commercial brand of mainstream nu disco and fizzily addictive technopop aimed at the shopping mall massive, not the Hoxton passive.  ESTONIA: Rada7.eeHighmachine - SobergeistHighmachine have been playing honest, fun rock music since 2008. Formed from alumni of several Estonian rock and metal bands, they have returned to the bluesy riff rock that drove all of them to music in the first place. Highmachine are performing at the Tallinn Music Week festival in April, at a Rada7.ee showcase. By the way, the video for Sobergeist did pretty well on Estonia&apos;s video chart.  FINLAND: GlueStreak And The Raven - Speed Of LightElectropop group Streak And The Raven create an intense atmosphere with minimalistic synth-driven sounds, drawing comparisons to Chromatics and hedonistic early-80s bands. Speed Of Light is included in their recently released debut Love &amp; War, an album that makes a nighttime journey in the spirit of past war and lost love.  FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredMermonte - MonteMermonte was formed in Rennes in 2010. This group of 10 wonderful musicians all have a past in various bands, combining different elements such as jazz, math-rock, pop and post-rock. Band leader Ghislain Fracapane recorded the album Mermonte in 2011, before releasing it in May 2012. Monte is a catchy pop song with glockenspiel and soft French vocals that you will love immediately and put on repeat for weeks.  GERMANY: ColtranTellavision - Holidays On EarthquakesThere are a lot of stunningly good solo artists in Germany who base their music on looping, DIY and edged rhythms. Tellavision, who just recorded a split-vinyl called Cake with Touchy Mob, stands out from the crowd. Fee K\u00fcrten, the woman behind Tellavision, has a knack for drifting melodies and haunting singing. Holidays On Earthquakes perfectly captures these features.  GREECE: MouxlalouloudaMelentini - Gone Are The DaysAfter creating a series of music pieces, appearing in theatrical plays and collaborating with prominent artists, Melentini has finally completed Explosions Around, The Desert Inside, an enrapturing debut album. It is racked with mostly bare arrangements and a stark, heartfelt vocal delivery that provides the stunning balm to bind this unsettling beauty together. Stricken with fragility, it combines affecting poetic lyrics and piercing sorrow with something ethereal that drags you into an achingly alluring world. It&apos;s a record you&apos;ll return to again and again.  INDIA: NH7The Lightyears Explode - Garam DharamThe Lightyears Explode are a three-piece punk/garage rock band from Mumbai and a good example of the current crop of independent music coming out of India. Garam Dharam is from the band&apos;s debut release and the first word that comes to mind after listening to this song is &apos;heavy&apos;. If you dig this tune, stay tuned for their debut album which is due out in the next few months.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarGood Boy Badminton - Time OffGood Boy Badminton are an emo/indie-rock band that routinely rocks their home city and casually tours around the country. They have a good number of followers everywhere. Time Off has been well received by emo fans around the world, with the song remaining on the PureVolume chart for weeks. They are currently planning for an Asian tour.  IRELAND: Harmless NoiseReplete - Easy LoveLesser-known amongst the glut of electronic producers who are proving so popular in Ireland lately, Replete is Cork&apos;s Peter Lawlor. Easy Love, his latest track which premiered on Earmilk, is not quite house music but comes close. An indiscernible vocal leads over a brooding beat but this slight disorientation is allayed with the sweetest of synths. Not hard to love at all.  ITALY: PolaroidThreeLakes - The Accordion PlayerLuca Righi is a young and talented songwriter from Mantua, in the north of Italy, but when you listen to his music you&apos;d think he comes from the heart of the United States. His songs clearly have deep roots in Americana and folk, but then you hear his voice and it&apos;s so torn he is probably singing with tears in his eyes. And what you hear is amazing.  JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesBuddy Girl And Mechanic - FenixFenix is in no rush to get to any particular destination, but rather sounds intent on unnerving listeners during its almost four-minute running time. The track comes courtesy of Tokyo outfit Buddy Girl And Mechanic, who specialize in making seductive Krautrock-tinged songs hiding stranger details. On Fenix, check the way the vocals skip jump all over the place, and how those rinky-dink synths sound. Close listening encouraged.  MALTA: Stagedive MaltaCapitol K - Yo Tarzan Tu JaneKristian Craig Robinson, as Capitol K, has traversed a spectrum of electronic aesthetics throughout 13 years and five albums with releases on Planet Mu, XL and Faith And Industry. A legend of contemporary electronica in the purest sense, Capitol K&apos;s genre mashing, globetrotting musical explorations have seen him receive a steady stream of critical praise. Yo Tarzan Tu Jane is taken from his latest album Andean Dub, inspired by a South American road trip.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rikaYellow Yesterday - Le\u00f3nThe name Yellow Yesterday might refer potential listeners to a nostalgic band that recreates Beatlesque anthems for lazy afternoons. And that was indeed the sound of this Mexico City group, led by the charming Andr\u00e9s Ibarra (aka Chelito), on their early singles and EPs. For their proper debut, though, Yellow Yesterday seem to have ignited their retro-boosters to deliver this spacey-krauty epic that roars in slow motion like a lazy lion.  NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!Lemontrip - WanderWith Wander, Tilburg-based producer Lemontrip allows the listener to catch a glimpse of his submerged world. Being sparse with the distribution of melodic and rhythmic information, he makes sure to leave a lot to the imagination of his audience. In this sense, Wander seems to be the embodiment of the overarching theme of exploration, embedded in his debut album Nowhere. Released in November 2012 through his own Fog Mountain Records label, Nowhere consists of six stunning tracks, each displaying Lemontrip&apos;s craftsmanship for making slow-paced, melancholic electronic music. Now it&apos;s time for the rest of the world to catch on.  PERU: SoTBLa IrA De Dios - Yo SoloLa IrA De Dios was formed in 2001, but it was in 2005 that they began to draw international attention after being signed to German label Nasoni Records, who reissued the band&apos;s first album, leading to their first European tour. Last year they released their fifth album, Peru No Existe, a great example of psychedelia and powerful rock.  POLAND: \u0141ukasz Ku\u015bmierz WeblogSorry Boys - The SunYou could say that where Bon Iver&apos;s last album ends, the new song from Sorry Boys starts, though The Sun in its entirety is something different than Beth/Rest. Their avant-pop single is popular from the spring schedule advertisement of one of the biggest TV stations in Poland. Is it Kate Bush behind the microphone?  PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Kubik - Basso ProfondoKubik&apos;s new EP, Music For Trevor Reznik, was inspired by the character interpreted by Christian Bale in the 2004 movie The Machinist. Kubik mingles contemporary with traditional, and Basso Profondo is a perfect example of that as electronic sounds combine with the didgeridoo and basso profondo singing, best known in traditional Russian orthodox music.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndieOrquesta El Macabeo - Lluvia Con SolTime to hit the dance floor! The self-proclaimed rockeros con guille de salseros (&quot;rockers posing as a salsa band&quot;) of Orquesta El Macabeo have just released the first single from their upcoming third album. Lluvia Con Sol showcases the mean and dirty brass section and populist lyrics that have become staples of the band&apos;s sound. If you still haven&apos;t heard of these guys - local punk and hardcore players now spearheading Puerto Rico&apos;s &apos;old school&apos; salsa revival - now&apos;s a great time to start.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoiseThe Noise - Ringo StarrThe Noise is an indie-rock band formed in the summer of 2011 in Sibiu. The four-piece has shared a stage with some of Romania&apos;s better-known alternative bands and is scheduled to do quite a bit more of that in the coming year. The group&apos;s sound is the result of a diverse set of influences ranging from 60s beat music to modern-day noisemakers. New single Ringo Starr is meant to serve as a taster of things to come.  RUSSIA: Big EchoOL - Tak Budet VsegdaAs a part of the first compilation by the newly-created Beryoza community, OL transforms a Soviet musical hit by Alla Pugacheva, stretching a catchy refrain into a club anthem.  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopVigo Thieves - HeartbeatsVigo Thieves are the quintessential festival band. Think anthems. Massive, swaggering raise-the-roof anthems. Heartbeats is the pick of the bunch and was the official song adopted by T in the Park for their website last year. The group have a couple of EPs under their belt, although curiously they remain unsigned. For a band with this much commercial appeal, you&apos;d imagine that won&apos;t be the case for very much longer.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up To...Obedient Wives Club - Murder Kill BabyOh the glorious fuzz! Obedient Wives Club take their self-styled Spectorgaze (remember this kids!) to all new heights with the release of their Murder Kill Baby EP. What awaits is the throwback-to-saccharine 60s girl-band inspired pop paired with an almost manic dose of fuzzed out backwash that only the evilest of musical geniuses would dare tread upon. Don&apos;t let any of their gentle imagery fool you - this music is a hard citrussy candy shell wrapping the warm centre of acid bombs. Stay lucid, or don&apos;t.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean IndieModsdive - NorthPsychedelic post-rock band Modsdive gathers some of the best indie musicians in Korea, crafting amazing instrumental tunes on the foundation laid by MAP alumni Auhm. Formed a year ago, the band is scheduled to release their first full-length album this month. As a taste of what&apos;s to come, here is the dynamic and captivating North.  SPAIN: MusikornerPol Wagner - GrievingPol Wagner is a songwriter from Girona and currently living the nights of Barcelona. He says he&apos;s in love with American folk and booze, and you can tell by his dark but tender songs, written in his room and clearly influenced by Conor Oberst, Elliott Smith and Tom Waits.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaNord &amp; Syd - Inte IdagSweden&apos;s latest supergroup, Nord &amp; Syd - which consists of members from Vapnet, Laakso, Holy Madre, Ironville and Penny Century - released their debut full-length Som En M\u00e4nniska on March 13 via Hybris. The album is said to revolve around death, love and alienation - in other words your typical melodic, solidly produced and, of course, completely outstanding Swedish indie-pop.  SWITZERLAND: 78sMy Name Is George - Crazy StarMy Name Is George, from Winterthur, have released their fifth studio record in which they again celebrate the pompous and melodic side of rock &apos;n&apos; roll. Welcome in the neon-coloured world of My Name Is George. It&apos;s disco pop as disco pop can be.  TURKEY: WEARTBEATSapan - It&apos;s AlrightSapan, one of Turkey&apos;s most promising bands, has been around for three years. With their second EP Tundra they began writing songs in English, which should improve their future prospects. Opening track It&apos;s Alright is a very hopeful and soothing indie-rock tune.  UNITED STATES: We Listen For YouMiracles Of Modern Science - Dear PressureThis five-piece from New York takes classical instruments and pushes them to new levels by crafting half pop/half indie sounding tunes. Featuring a violin, mandolin, cello, drums and stand-up bass, Miracles Of Modern Science sound familiar, but at the same time highlight talents becoming rarer and rarer to find in modern music.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sSatelite - Poco A PocoSatelite is a pop/rock band that formed in Puerto Ordaz in 1997. They were first played on radio stations with home recordings and managed to share the stage with renowned bands such as Los Amigos Invisibles, Los Pericos and Desorden P\u00fablico. They define their music as rock made using traditional instruments with electronic sounds and ambience inspired by outer space."}, {"sentences": ["First, Tokyo is eager to see the yen fall on the foreign exchanges, but the crisis in Cyprus has once again made Japan seem like a safe haven for investors in times of turbulence."], "tags": ["Shinzo Abe", "Economics", "Business", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Deflation"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-02T18:43:53Z", "title": "Japan to learn whether Abenomics will live up to pro-growth rhetoric", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/02/japan-abenomics", "article": "Japan&apos;s two-decade fight against rolling recession and permanent deflation reaches a pivotal moment on Wednesday when Haruhiko Kuroda presides over his first policy meeting as head of the country&apos;s central bank. This is when all the talk about Abenomics is supposed to stop. Financial markets have been dazzled by the pro-growth rhetoric of the country&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, since he was swept back to power with the promise of a three-pronged economic revolution late last year. Now the time is approaching for the Bank of Japan to deliver. There are three strands to Abenomics \u2013 a more activist monetary policy from the Bank of Japan (BoJ), a fiscal boost from increased spending on public works and structural reform to make the economy more productive. In reality, the BoJ will be expected to do most of the heavy lifting. The new government has announced an expansionary budget but fiscal policy is constrained by the dire state of Japan&apos;s public finances. A debt-to-GDP ratio in excess of 200% is the upshot of more than two decades of sluggish growth and repeated attempts to pump-prime the economy. Meanwhile, structural reforms will take time to work, leaving Kuroda with responsibility for boosting short-term growth. Nonetheless, so far things could hardly have gone better for Abe. The yen has fallen against the dollar, helping boost Japan&apos;s export sector. The stock market has soared, and international bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have revised up their forecasts for Japanese growth. Stephen King, the chief economist at HSBC, said the BoJ has been reshaped by the new prime minister. Abe &quot;clearly believes that in its previous guise, Japan&apos;s central bank would never deliver the stimulus necessary to drag Japan out of its ongoing deflationary torpor&quot;, he added. Even so, many investors wonder whether this is a classic case of &quot;buy the rumour, sell the fact&quot;. Sceptics point to Japan&apos;s long struggle to repair damage due to the stock market and real estate bubbles of the 1980s. A quarter of a century on, often quite lengthy periods of strong growth have been choked off by premature policy tightening. Previous governments have promised reflationary action. The markets will want to see if Abe can improve on the aborted recoveries of the mid 1990s and the early 2000s. Consumers certainly seem to have responded to Abe&apos;s bullish talk about ending Japan&apos;s lost decades. Spending in the first two months of 2013 was up 3% on the same period of 2012, even though there has been scant evidence of rising wages and salaries. Japan&apos;s companies have so far adopted a much more cautious approach. The country&apos;s influential Tankan, a regular survey of business sentiment, showed that investment intentions remain weak, a sign that firms are reserving judgment on the new government&apos;s approach. Despite the need for larger quantities of imported oil after the Fukushima nuclear disaster two years ago, consumer prices have been falling almost continually since the Ggreat recession of 2008-09. Kuroda&apos;s challenge is to bring up the rate of inflation to 2%, so that companies and individuals can take advantage of negative real interest rates \u2013 borrowing costs lower than the annual increase in the cost of living \u2013 and to drive down the value of the yen. The new governor has three immediate problems to overcome. First, Tokyo is eager to see the yen fall on the foreign exchanges, but the crisis in Cyprus has once again made Japan seem like a safe haven for investors in times of turbulence. Currency movements in recent weeks have not been helpful for Abe and his team. Second, markets may be expecting a more radical transformation of monetary policy than the BoJ is capable of delivering. It is not as if the central bank has been inactive . For the past decade it has been trying to end deflation through electronic money creation. Indeed, it was well ahead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in opting for quantitative easing as a growth-boosting measure. Finally, the two-day meeting could, in theory, be Kuroda&apos;s last. When Abe pushed out the old BoJ governor before his term expired, Kuroda agreed to serve out the last few weeks of his period of office. It ends on 8 April, four days after this week&apos;s meeting of the bank&apos;s board, and it will require an act of parliament to reappoint him for a full term. That ought to be a formality, although there are analysts who believe he will wait for the next meeting of the BoJ on 26 April before revealing his hand, and in the meantime offer only a &quot;downpayment&quot; on future monetary action. Julian Jessop, of Capital Economics, said: &quot;We expect the board to announce only small policy changes now, with any more substantial reforms on hold for the second meeting on 26 April. But whatever the precise timing and details, the markets&apos; expectations of the new governor are so high that they will be almost impossible to meet, let alone beat, leaving the risks firmly skewed towards disappointment.&quot; Good arrows? Prime minister Shinzo Abe announced his three-arrow reform programme for Japan earlier this year. Fiscal policy was the first arrow to be removed from Abe&apos;s quiver. The government hopes to get the economy moving again through a 13.1tn yen supplementary budget with the emphasis on public works. But value added tax looks set to rise next year to prevent a further increase in Japan&apos;s debt mountain. Monetary policy is the second arrow. The Bank of Japan has already set itself an explicit 2% inflation target and is expected to announce an increase in the amount of Japanese government bonds it will buy. These will be of longer duration than the asset purchases up until now in an attempt to push down long-term interest rates. Much less is yet known about plans for the third arrow \u2013 structural reform. Japan has become keener on free-trade agreements but may baulk at dismantling its agricultural protectionism."}, {"sentences": ["Jay Carney, the White House press spokesman, avoided going into specifics beyond saying that the US was working with its allies in Seoul and Tokyo, adding: &quot;We are regularly reaching out to Beijing and Moscow to encourage them to do more to restrain the North Koreans.&quot; Asked if the tension was due to the personality of the young North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, Carney told reporters North Korea&apos;s pattern of behaviour predated his taking over."], "tags": ["North Korea", "US foreign policy", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US news", "South Korea", "Nuclear weapons"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-03T07:15:00Z", "title": "North Korea: US acts to calm fears over 'alarming' atomic plan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/02/us-north-korea-nuclear-plan", "article": "The US described the prospect of North Korea restarting a mothballed atomic reactor as &quot;extremely alarming&quot; on Tuesday. North Korea said it would reactivate all facilities at its main Yongbyon nuclear complex to ease its electricity shortage and strengthen its nuclear capability. The reactor was shut down in 2007 as part of international nuclear disarmament talks that have since stalled. The move came a day after Pyongyang announced a &quot;new strategic line&quot; focusing on its nuclear programme and economy. But the Obama administration, trying to reduce tension, stressed that it would take time between Tuesday&apos;s announcement heralding resumption of North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme and the North&apos;s ability to restore its nuclear programme. Analysts estimated it would take about a year. The North Korea move marked the latest escalation in a confrontation in which tensions rise almost on a daily basis. On Wednesday North-South relations were further hindered when North Korea denied entry to people from the South who work in the countries&apos; jointly run Kaesong factory park just inside the North&apos;s borders. It was not clear whether this was a temporary or permanent measure.  A US state department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, briefing reporters on Tuesday, said: &quot;As national security adviser Tom Donilon said less than a month ago, the US will not accept the DPRK [North Korea] as a nuclear state. The position has not changed since national security adviser Donilon stated it a month ago.&quot; Re-activating Yongbyon would be &quot;a clear violation of the DPRK&apos;s international obligations and the commitments it made at that time&quot;. Nuland stressed it would take time to reactivate the plant: &quot;Obviously there is a long way to go between a stated intention and actually being to be able to pull it off, with all that would entail. But were they to be able to put themselves back into position to use the facility, that would obviously would be extremely alarming but, as I have said, it&apos;s a long way from here.&quot; The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said he feared North Korea was on a collision course with the rest of the world that could lead to war. Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, said the crisis had &quot;gone too far&quot; and called for dialogue to ease tensions on the peninsula. &quot;Nuclear threats are not a game. Aggressive rhetoric and military posturing only result in counter-actions, and fuel fear and instability,&quot; he said on a visit to Andorra. &quot;Things must calm down as this situation, made worse by the lack of communication, could lead down a path that nobody should want to follow. &quot;I am convinced that nobody intends to attack [North Korea] \u2026 however, I am afraid that others will respond firmly to any direct military provocation,&quot; he said. China, the North&apos;s only major ally and aid provider, called the possible nuclear restart &quot;regrettable&quot;, while Japan said it was a cause for &quot;grave concern&quot;. Jay Carney, the White House press spokesman, avoided going into specifics beyond saying that the US was working with its allies in Seoul and Tokyo, adding: &quot;We are regularly reaching out to Beijing and Moscow to encourage them to do more to restrain the North Koreans.&quot; Asked if the tension was due to the personality of the young North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, Carney told reporters North Korea&apos;s pattern of behaviour predated his taking over. &quot;There is a pattern of behaviour here. A pattern that is familiar,&quot; Carney said. The Pentagon tried to lower the temperature, denying news reports that two US destroyers, the McCain and Decatur, were now off the South Korean coast. A Pentagon spokesman, George Little, opted for a vaguer description of their deployment, saying only that they were positioned somewhere in the western Pacific. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, met the South Korean foreign minister Yun Byung-se on Tuesday in Washington. Afterwards, Kerry said that restarting Yongbyon would be a violation of international obligations. &quot;The bottom line is very simply that what Kim Jong-un has been choosing to do is provocative, it is dangerous, reckless and the US will not accept the DPRK as a nuclear state,&quot; Kerry said. &quot;And I reiterate again the US will do what is necessary to defend ourselves and defend our allies, Korea and Japan. We are fully prepared and capable of doing that and the DPRK understands that.&quot; Kerry is to visit Seoul next week and the South Korean president Park Geun-hye is to visit the White House next month. The Yongbyon announcement follows repeated warnings from the North that it is on a war footing with South Korea. The regime has also threatened nuclear strikes against the US mainland and its overseas military bases, though experts are convinced it is still several years away from developing the necessary technology. Duyeon Kim, a North Korea and nuclear arms specialist at the Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington, estimated it would take North Korea at least a year to reverse the steps taken in 2007. &quot;It&apos;s not an immediate danger. They cannot immediately start producing plutonium again because the reactor and other key components were shut down and disabled under two six-party talks agreements in 2007. Eleven key plutonium-producing facilities and parts were disabled, meaning it would take at least a year to reverse those steps,&quot; she said. &quot;The reactor cooling tower was also destroyed and it would take time to rebuild it, too, although they could pump water from the river next to Yongbyon to act as a cooling mechanism. &quot;The North&apos;s announcement reaffirms its intention to fully develop its nuclear programmes, keep both avenues (plutonium and uranium) open to making nuclear weapons, to proclaim that its nuclear programmes cannot be negotiated away, and to publicly confirm our suspicions that its uranium-enrichment plant is for nuclear weapons and not for energy purposes, as they claimed until now.&quot; Some North Korea experts believe the regime wants to avoid provoking a potentially catastrophic inter-Korea conflict. &quot;The North Korean regime indulges in this kind of behaviour all the time,&quot; said Prof Shin Jong-dae of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. &quot;The possibility of war breaking out is still very low, although there is always the chance of smaller skirmishes. But ultimately the North Koreans don&apos;t want this to escalate out of control. They want a turning point in relations with the United States.&quot; The latest threats are in response to ongoing military drills involving forces from South Korea and the US \u2013 the US flew B-52 and B-2 bomber sorties over the Korean peninsula last week \u2013 and tougher UN sanctions imposed after Pyongyang&apos;s third nuclear arms test in February. A spokesman for North Korea&apos;s bureau of atomic energy said the Yongbyon facilities are a graphite-moderated five-megawatt reactor, which generates spent fuel rods laced with plutonium and is the core of the Yongbyon nuclear complex. When fully operational the complex is capable of the annual production of one atomic bomb&apos;s worth of plutonium, the most common fuel in nuclear weapons."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;The tentative assessment of this virus is that it may cause human infection or epidemic,&quot; said Dr Masato Tashiro, director of the World Health Organisation&apos;s influenza research centre in Tokyo and one of the specialists who studied the genetic data."], "tags": ["Bird flu", "China", "World Health Organisation", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Flu"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-04T02:52:44Z", "title": "Third death from H7N9 bird flu", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/04/third-death-h7n9-bird-flu", "article": "A third person has died from H7N9 bird flu in China as the total number of confirmed cases rose to nine and concerns were raised that the virus might have mutated to infect other animals and humans more readily. The latest victim was a 38-year-old cook who fell ill early in March while working in the province of Jiangsu, where five of the other cases were found, authorities said. He died in hospital in on 27 March and a positive test for H7N9 flu came back on Wednesday. Chinese authorities have said there is no evidence the strain spreads easily between humans but experts say it seems to move through poultry without making them sick, making it hard to track, and possesses genetic markers that indicate it is infectious to people. In the wake of the illnesses, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention shared the genetic sequence of H7N9 with other scientists to help study how it might behave in different animals and situations. &quot;The tentative assessment of this virus is that it may cause human infection or epidemic,&quot; said Dr Masato Tashiro, director of the World Health Organisation&apos;s influenza research centre in Tokyo and one of the specialists who studied the genetic data. &quot;It is still not yet adapted to humans completely but important factors have already changed.&quot; Flu viruses evolve constantly and scientists say such changes have made H7N9 more capable of infecting pigs. Pigs are a particular concern because bird and human flu viruses can mingle there, potentially producing a bird virus with heightened ability to spread between humans, said Dr William Schaffner, a flu expert at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. This happened in 2009 with swine flu. One scientist said the sequence raised concern about a potential global epidemic but it was impossible to give a precise estimate of the likelihood. &quot;At this stage it&apos;s still unlikely to become a pandemic,&quot; said Richard Webby, director of a WHO flu centre at St Jude Children&apos;s Research hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. &quot;We should be concerned [but] there&apos;s no alarm bells ringing yet.&quot; The scientists who inspected the genetic data said that based on information from the genes and Chinese lab testing the H7N9 virus appeared capable of infecting some birds without causing any noticeable symptoms. Without obvious outbreaks of dying chickens or birds authorities could face a challenge in trying to trace the source of the infection and stop the spread. If there were no obvious symptoms in birds or pigs &quot;nobody recognises the infection in animals around them. Then the transmission from animal to human may occur,&quot; Tashiro said. &quot;In terms of this phenomenon it&apos;s more problematic.&quot; This behaviour is unlike the H5N1 strain, which set off warnings when it began ravaging poultry across Asia in 2003. H5N1 has since killed 360 people worldwide, mostly after close contact with infected birds. If the latest virus continues to spread in China and beyond &quot;it would be an even bigger problem than with H5N1, in some sense, because with H5N1 you can see evidence of poultry dying&quot; said University of Hong Kong microbiologist Malik Peiris, who also examined the genetic information. He urged China to widely test healthy birds for the virus in live animal markets in the parts of the country where the human infections have been reported."}, {"sentences": ["Debuted in Tokyo in 1964, Cut Piece has the artist (or in this case, Peaches) kneeling on a stage as members of the audience cut away her clothes, taking the scraps away with them."], "tags": ["Meltdown festival", "Yoko Ono", "Patti Smith", "Festivals", "Culture", "Boy George", "Siouxsie and the Banshees", "Music", "Iggy Pop", "Pet Shop Boys", "Kim Gordon", "Feminism", "Art", "Installation", "Peaches", "Meltdown festival 2013"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-04T10:47:16Z", "title": "Yoko Ono's Meltdown: Patti Smith, Boy George and Siouxsie Sioux sign up", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/04/yoko-one-meltdown-patti-smith-siouxsie-sioux", "article": "Patti Smith, Boy George, Siouxsie Sioux and Iggy and the Stooges will be among the performers at this year&apos;s Meltdown festival, curated by Yoko Ono.

There will definitely be an element of feminism and the plight of women \u2026 [and] I am thinking of having one or two events where I ask men to say something strong about themselves too.&quot; The festival&apos;s initial line-up is a perfect distillation of those ideas: feminist icons such as Smith, Kim Gordon, and Sioux, who will be performing for the first time in five years; and acts like Boy George, Iggy Pop, Ryuichi Sakamoto and comedian Reggie Watts, who represent different modalities of masculinity. The bill is multi-generational and multi-racial, with new bands like Savages alongside veteran performers such as Marianne Faithfull, who will play with jazz guitarist Bill Frisell. Ono herself will appear with the Plastic Ono Band, opening the festivities on 14 June.

The film programme includes Sergei Eisenstein&apos;s seminal 1925 movie, Battleship Potemkin, to be shown with the Pet Shop Boys&apos; score from 2004. This will be the electro-pop Potemkin&apos;s first-ever cinema screening. In addition to the concerts, film screenings and a planned silent disco, Ono&apos;s Meltdown will have a political side. Guest speakers and &quot;some the most influential campaigners of our times&quot; will present talks and discussions over 15-16 June, dubbed Activism weekend, and 22-23 June, Future weekend. In recent months, Ono has been particularly active in protests regarding fracking and US gun control.

As part of a new set of policies known as Abenomics, formulated by Japan&apos;s new prime minister Shinzo Abe, the Bank of Japan will buy \u00a57tn yen (\u00a346bn) of government bonds each month using electronically created money, with the aim of rekindling demand and pushing up prices and wages. Haruhiko Kuroda, the Bank of Japan&apos;s new governor, described its stance as &quot;monetary easing in an entirely new dimension&quot;. He promised to target a doubling in the size of the &quot;monetary base&quot; \u2013 the amount of cash circulating in the economy, plus the reserves held by financial institutions at the central bank \u2013 in the hope of stoking inflation of 2% within two years. The more aggressive approach to tackling Japan&apos;s economic problems had been well-trailed, but the scale of the BoJ&apos;s operation still stunned financial markets, pushing the Nikkei index of leading shares up by 2.2%. In a statement released on Wednesday in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan said it wanted to &quot;drastically change the expectations of markets and economic entities&quot;, and &quot;lead Japan&apos;s economy to overcome deflation that has lasted for nearly 15 years&quot;. The US Federal Reserve \u2013 an enthusiastic supporter of so-called &quot;unconventional&quot; monetary policies such as QE \u2013 is spending $85bn a month, only just above the $70bn planned by the BoJ, in an economy almost three times the size of Japan&apos;s. The radical new dose of quantitative easing comes alongside tax breaks from the government aimed at encouraging firms to raise wages, in the hope that consumers will respond by increasing spending, and allow prices to rise, too. Persistent deflation tends to encourage households to hoard their cash, as they wait for prices to fall further. Guy Foster, head of portfolio strategy at Brewin Dolphin, said: &quot;What is clear is that this is a concerted effort which is being \u2026 stage-managed for maximum effect. We also understand that there is a tremendous sense of support for such radical policy actions from the Ministry of Finance, Bank of Japan, and the Japanese private sector.&quot; The Bank of Japan&apos;s decision is likely to spark concerns that Tokyo is deliberately depressing the value of its currency in a bid to improve its export performance in a tough global trading environment. The yen fell sharply after the decision was announced, losing about 3% of its value against the dollar in Asian trading. David Bloom, currency strategist at HSBC, said: &quot;Policymakers will likely hope that yen weakness will be a side-effect of their QE strategy, but given the sensitivity of &apos;currency war&apos; accusations, they will not want to actively target the exchange rate through rhetoric.&quot; The yield on Japanese government bonds hit a record low after the BoJ&apos;s announcement, which also included a pledge to buy bonds with maturities of up to 40 years, helping to bear down on long-term borrowing costs across the economy. It will also step up its purchases of other assets, including property funds. Central banks worldwide have been battling to convince investors they still have ammunition left despite interest rates being at rock-bottom levels for years. The Federal Reserve has used so-called &quot;forward guidance&quot;, promising to keep stimulating the economy until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5%; George Osborne has asked the Bank of England to consider adopting a similar approach. &quot;It is not surprising that given the extreme set of economic conditions suffered by many countries and the resultant lack of flexibility now afforded by many central banks&apos; main interest rates that a discussion over the appropriateness of policy tools should be gathering pace,&quot; said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank. &quot;While we remain sceptical of the ability of Japan to achieve 2% inflation over the next two years, governor Kuroda is at least stepping up the attack on deflation meaning that his chances of achieving some success have increased.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["But now Tokyo is letting rip with a new bazooka that is big by any standards.", "This was not, as some said, a crude invitation to competitive devaluation: Tokyo is less concerned with the price of yen than with prices in Japanese shops."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Euro", "European Union", "Europe", "Business", "David Cameron"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-04T20:01:33Z", "title": "Yield swerve: Tokyo's answer to the inflation crisis | Editorial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/04/tokyo-answer-inflation-crisis-editorial", "article": "David Cameron once demanded a &quot;big bazooka&quot; to solve the euro crisis. In the event, big enough blasts were fired to quieten market monsters, but never to finally silence them; lingering fear still haunts a continent. Japan&apos;s very different crisis, however, has lingered for longer, for so long that it ought instead to be called a permanent stasis \u2013 since 1990 to be precise. Rock-bottom interest rates, a depressed yen, stimulus and austerity have all been tried in various combinations. The economy has disregarded the lot, remorselessly rolling from lukewarm recovery to fresh recession and back. But now Tokyo is letting rip with a new bazooka that is big by any standards. In accordance with wishes of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the supposedly independent Bank of Japan has explained how it will pursue inflation. In an economy where falling prices have often been the norm, the stock of money will be doubled in 21 months, and the newly minted currency will be used in novel ways; specifically, to purchase government debt from \u2013 in the jargon \u2013 across the yield curve. Both elements represent a radical departure in their own right. Nothing on this scale has been tried before, not even when the world&apos;s central bankers worked in panicked concert in 2008. And the whole world must now pray that the plan comes off in what remains its second-biggest mature economy: a recovered Japan really could boost a stagnant planet. But is that likely? It can&apos;t be ruled out. This was not, as some said, a crude invitation to competitive devaluation: Tokyo is less concerned with the price of yen than with prices in Japanese shops. Even if trading partners cheapen their currencies in reply, it may be no bad thing. During the 1930s, beggar-my-neighbour policies cancelled out in terms of export sales, but the cheapening of currencies nonetheless helped ease debt deflation. Big bazookas are hard to control, and those wielding the weapon could shoot themselves in the foot. Japan needs to persuade its people that prices will rise, but if expectations of excessive inflation are stoked, investors could take fright, causing borrowing costs to rise. It is a risk, though not one that aggressive monetary expansion in the US or Britain has yet seen realised; besides, risks simply have to be run if the alternative is permanent stagnation. The deepest doubts arise from Japanese demographics: the typical citizen is four years older even than in ageing Britain. The idea of cheap money is to persuade people to open their wallets, and spend their way to recovery, but in this sort of senior society, fear of inflation eating up pensions could convince people they need to save more and spend less. Let us hope not. Where Japan led, the world has followed since 2008. Fingers crossed that it can now lead the way to a solution."}, {"sentences": ["That run of chart luck, unexpected for a city some 700 miles from Tokyo&apos;s hipsters, reinforced a local spirit of independence, and today Fukuoka seems to have outgrown its old Gateway-to-Kyushu label, seeing itself more as a Gateway to Asia.", "Seoul is closer than Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan holidays", "Asia", "Bars and clubs", "Travel", "Music", "Japanese food and drink", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-05T20:00:00Z", "title": "Why flourishing Fukuoka has something for every traveller", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/apr/05/flourishing-fukuoka-something-every-traveller", "article": "Nearly 15 years on from my first visit, Fukuoka, on the north coast of Japan&apos;s Kyushu island, feels like a city fulfilling its potential. When I stepped off the plane in 1999, the colleague who drove me to my apartment introduced the city as &quot;the Liverpool of Japan&quot;. The analogy had to do with its position as an international port, as well as a spate of minor hits that the city&apos;s Mentai Rock scene produced in the early 1980s. That run of chart luck, unexpected for a city some 700 miles from Tokyo&apos;s hipsters, reinforced a local spirit of independence, and today Fukuoka seems to have outgrown its old Gateway-to-Kyushu label, seeing itself more as a Gateway to Asia. Its proximity to the Asian mainland has attracted a rich, cosmopolitan population, and with KLM having just launched direct flights from Europe, there&apos;s no reason why it can&apos;t vie for some of the international tourism afforded Honshu&apos;s big hitters. Returning here is never short of surprising. Whether it&apos;s the new Aitaka walkway \u2013 which edges you over the glistening Hakata Bay \u2013 or the expansion of already enviable shopping possibilities\u00a0with the immense Hankyu\u00a0mall, the city seems to be constantly improving itself. Importantly, none of this regeneration seems to be to the detriment of the older town, meaning that in a geographically compact space, you get a little of everything you might ask of Japan, be that the ancient temples and zen gardens at nearby Dazaifu, the hi-tech gadgetry on sale in the Tenjin district, or the craft-loving communities that dot the Itoshima peninsula to the west.     Canal City shopping mall, Fukuoka. Photograph: Alamy    However, it&apos;s the lingering flavour of Showa-era Fukuoka that continues to attract me most. If Liverpool had Mathew Street, Fukuoka has Oyafuko Dori, which translates pleasingly as Delinquents&apos; Street. This thin stretch leading between bustling Tenjin and the port warehouses is dotted with izakayas (traditional bars), nightclubs and the ubiquitous &quot;live houses&quot; in which the Mentai Rock movement flourished. By day, it looks like an anonymous side street, but by night it&apos;s where the city&apos;s musical youth flocks. It&apos;d be tempting to say these youngsters are hopeful of becoming the next Ayumi Hamasaki or Shiina Ringo, legends of the J-Pop and J-Rock scenes who spent their formative years in Fukuoka, but the feeling amongst many local artists tends to be &quot;make it here or die trying&quot;. Seoul is closer than Tokyo. Why move to the capital beat? There&apos;s a charm about Fukuoka&apos;s older shopping districts that is unique to the city. Lovers of the latest brands can happily throw their cash around all day long in the Hankyu or Parco malls, but for a taste of Fukuoka&apos;s more decadent character, it&apos;s good to take a walk from Nakasu Kawabata Station on Nakasu (a neon-specked island designed to keep the city&apos;s more eye-opening sights from the innocent) along the Hakata Kawabata Shotengai arcade to Canal City. This rusty promenade hangs on (just) as a home to some of Fukuoka&apos;s more traditional shops, with kimono artists lined up alongside the mentaiko\u00a0makers who specialise in the local roe delicacy that lent the Mentai rockers their name. The arcade is more alive in the earlier hours of the day, when it wakes to a dawn chorus of traders. Just before Kokutai Street sits Kushida Jinja, a fine example of an inner-city shrine still servicing the merchants it has looked after since the eighth century. Canal City is now well into its second decade, but the imposing red shopping mecca is still worth exploring en route to the Naka River. Built in the mid-1990s, it&apos;s something of an architectural wonder, complete with it&apos;s own mini system of waterways, a\u00a0small amphitheatre and an abundance of overhanging vegetation. At weekends, the amphitheatre is given over to a kind of branded busking \u2013 often a bit cheesy, but never less than consummately professional, and entirely free to the passerby. Better still, during the New Year celebrations, the shows take on a more classical air, and it&apos;s not unusual to come across the likes of a shamisen orchestra squeezed onto the tiny stage.     Nakasu noodle district. Photograph: Alamy    Evening is the best time to walk the banks of the Naka river, especially the strip between Canal City and the bridge to Nishi Nakasu. As night falls, out trundle the yatai stalls \u2013 small, mobile restaurants complete with built-in benches that specialise in the local tonkotsu ramen broth and sticks of yakitori meat. These first began to pop up among the second world war debris, offering warmth and community to impoverished locals, but they&apos;re a nationwide attraction now and, along with nearby Dazaifu and the further-flung hot springs of Kurokawa, they&apos;re among the region&apos;s biggest domestic draws. In truth, some are less friendly than others, and entering can be the Japanese equivalent of stepping into a dusty saloon as the piano singsong fizzles out. However, with so many stalls to choose from, picking the right one is a quick exercise in trial and error. Poke your head under the canopy and see what kind of reaction you get. If it&apos;s a beaming smile, you&apos;re likely to be there into the small hours. Food and nightlife There are yatai stalls in abundance across the centre of town, but the relatively new Toriyatai near the Otani Hotel in the Yakuin district is excellent, and even has its own shop attached, selling homemade goods. For a friendly start to a more involved night out, try the American-run Dark Room on Oyafuko Dori, which opens a popular beer garden on the roof during the summer months. Accommodation As befitting Kyushu&apos;s largest city, Fukuoka is not short on accommodation in all budget ranges. The Grand Hyatt benefits architecturally from being part of Canal City, and is within easy walking distance of Nakasu, Tenjin and Hakata districts. For something more traditional, Daimaru Besso is in Futsukaichi (a 15-minute express train ride from Hakata Station), and has its own onsen (natural hot spring) attached. Getting there KLM now flies daily from Amsterdam to Fukuoka.

Last week it prevented South Korean workers from crossing the border into the complex, located just inside North Korea. About 100 South Koreans who had stayed at Kaesong last week were due to return yesterday, with 500 more remaining. The Korea Herald noted that the \u00a356m that the North earns from the complex every year was &quot;no small amount&quot;, adding that the country &quot;does not have many comparable or better sources of hard currency&quot;.

An editorial in the Korea Times said those living in both the North and South had reason to be vigilant. &quot;Not a single expert can say for sure what will be the unpredictable regime&apos;s next move,&quot; it said. &quot;One thing seems certain, however: it will be Koreans, especially South Koreans, who will have to shoulder the risks of any misjudgment or miscalculation to be made by either Koreas.&quot; There was consternation, too, that the North had disrupted operations at Kaesong for four days, although it has not closed the facility. Last week it prevented South Korean workers from crossing the border into the complex, located just inside North Korea. About 100 South Koreans who had stayed at Kaesong last week were due to return on Saturday, with 500 more remaining. The Korea Herald noted that the \u00a356m that the North earns from the complex every year was &quot;no small amount&quot;, adding that the country &quot;does not have many comparable or better sources of hard currency&quot;. Political tensions have briefly disrupted operations at Kaesong several times since it opened in 2004, but a complete and prolonged shutdown would be a sign that cross-border ties were near to collapse. &quot;South Korea takes this situation very seriously,&quot; a senior government official in Seoul told the Observer. &quot;We must watch even the smallest moves by North Korea. At the same time, we will continue to send signals that we want to build trust with Pyongyang in the hope that it will cooperate and dialogue can begin.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 7 April 2013.

Before long at least one is bound to fall over. Given all the recent publicity about Japan and the colossal amounts of money it is about to throw at reviving an ailing economy, it seems strange to lump the two countries together. Different cultures and business practices should make for a very unlikely link, but they are in a similar hole and Japan is leading where Italy could mistakenly follow. Italy and Japan were once the two largest axis powers with Germany. After the second world war they all benefited from huge subsidies, mostly from the US and much of it in the form of debt write-offs. Unencumbered by debts, all three amassed huge savings, almost all of it through 40 years of manufacturing prowess dating back to the 1950s. Exports of everything from toasters to car parts fuelled an astonishing rise in living standards, much of it stashed in local banks or invested in government debt. From the early 1990s all three entered a long decline, each weighed down by their own financial problems (the integration of East Germany, the Tokyo property bubble and in Italy&apos;s case, stagnant productivity) and falling birth rates added to their woes (caused, arguably, in part by the state&apos;s reliance on women to continue their domestic role without childcare support even when they entered the workplace). \u00a0 Germany&apos;s ageing postwar baby boomers broke free of the triumvirate. Among other things, they endorsed then chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der&apos;s mix of Anglo Saxon (reduced wages and reduced job protection) and French-style child support alongside swingeing cuts to the terms and conditions for younger workers. Rome and Tokyo opted to borrow to protect the living standards of their ageing populations while also attacking the wages and conditions of the young. It didn&apos;t work. Though they still appeared to churn out top-of-the-line manufactured goods, especially in Japan, increasingly it was for assembly by foreign companies.\u00a0 In Italy, the car manufacture Fiat is haemorrhaging sales while Po Valley parts suppliers keep Germany&apos;s BMW fully stocked with brake pads and door panels. Likewise, Japanese electronics firm Sharp has become more dependent on making iPad screens for Apple than TVs or mini hi-fi systems under its own brand name and for its trouble has become persistently loss-making. Japan&apos;s newest tactic has grabbed the headlines in the last week. Put simply, it will combine a long-standing policy of running budget deficits amounting to 10% of GDP a year with a massive US Federal Reserve-style money creation spree. An increase in VAT is supposed to keep a lid on the budget deficit. Charles Dumas, the eminent boss of economic analysts Lombard Street Research, describes in his latest monthly review how Japan&apos;s refusal to adapt has cost its citizens dearly. Such is the loss of export competitiveness that per capita incomes are now around half that of the US. Deflation, in the form of persistently falling prices, has deterred consumer spending (why spend when prices will be lower in six months or a year?) and encouraged savings because even though interest rates are at rock bottom, savings values rise each year relative to prices. Dumas recommends Tokyo scrap its VAT rise for the time being and instead tax dead money lying around the Japanese economy doing nothing. His target is retained corporate profits, which are not invested or disbursed to shareholders. He recommends a punitive or even 100% tax, and a low or zero tax on their disbursement. The goal is to get cash out into the economy. Not the stuff created by the central bank and spent on other financial instruments in the hope that it will filter down into consumers pockets. Real cash. While there is every reason to tax the wealth and savings of individuals, especially the super rich, attacking corporates, which in Japan combine wealth and caution in equal measure, is more politically acceptable. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said last week that the splurge in quantitative easing by the Bank of Japan will achieve the same end painlessly. Dubbed Abenomics, the policy aims to devalue the currency and push up inflation via more costly imported goods. Rising prices will persuade consumers to spend now, not later. When, the pressure of higher demand and more costly imports has brought inflation up to a new 2% target, theory tells us a higher level of consumption will be maintained, making for a healthier, higher spending economy. The trouble with this argument, apart from the obvious environmental impacts, is that a cheaper currency raises the cost of the chief import, gas and oil, and everyone&apos;s heating, lighting and transport costs. Pushing up inflation while cutting living standards could be self-defeating. The knock-on effects of quantitative easing in the UK and US on consumer spending are also disputed. They have arguably kept inflation from falling precipitously, and asset prices are bolstered \u2013 witness the rising stock market \u2013 but economic activity has shifted only marginally. All this means Japan could be left with higher debts and an equally sclerotic economy with everyone doing what they have always done on slightly lower incomes. There is no chance of immigrants coming to the economy&apos;s rescue. The same applies in Italy where the young and skilled are setting sail. Rome&apos;s membership of the euro means it is unable to print money. It could tax unproductive money in personal and corporate bank accounts, but like many European countries its banks are not in the best of health. Without an expanding export sector, it must look inward and has recently put the emphasis, like the UK, on a bonfire of welfare benefits. Unfortunately for an ageing society, this policy brings us full circle. Without a welfare safety net that includes funds for childcare, the population will continue to decline. If Germany&apos;s example is anything to go by, Rome has already left it too late. Almost 10 years of generous benefits appeared to arrive too late for Germans who have fewer children a head than Italians. No wonder several economists have speculated that Italy and not Greece will be the first to leave the euro. With a budget deficit of almost zero, it can survive with funds from Brussels. But an exit and devaluation would be a way for Rome to repeat the &quot;spend and devalue&quot; that encouraged the formation of the euro in the first place. There is no easy way out. Only when governments realise they need to tax the dead money in their economies to release the funds for investment they desperately need, can the recovery begin."}, {"sentences": ["Photograph: Axiom Photographic/Design Pics/Corbis     Umami has been variously translated from Japanese as yummy, deliciousness or a pleasant savoury taste, and was coined in 1908 by a chemist at Tokyo University called Kikunae Ikeda."], "tags": ["Food & drink", "Nutrition", "Health & wellbeing", "Nutrition", "Science", "Life and style", "Food science"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-09T10:30:00Z", "title": "Umami: why the fifth taste is so important", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/apr/09/umami-fifth-taste", "article": "I am often flabbergasted when I think about how humans came to develop such complex culinary skills. Granted, 1.8m years have passed since our ancestor, homo erectus, began to cook. But still, leavened bread! That was one hell of a happy accident. Our predilection for umami \u2013 the only recently recognised (by western scientists) &quot;fifth taste&quot;, after salt, sweet, sour and bitter - is a fascinating piece in the jigsaw of our gastronomic evolution. Since studies confirmed just a few years ago that our mouths contain taste receptors for this moreish savoury taste (the other four &quot;basic tastes&quot; had been widely accepted for, ooh, a few thousand years), so much in the history of recipes suddenly makes sense. Umami is why the Romans loved liquamen, the fermented anchovy sauce that they sloshed as liberally as we do ketchup today. It is key to the bone-warming joy of gravy made from good stock, meat juices and caramelised meat and veg. It is why Marmite is my mate. Escoffier, the legendary 19th-century French chef who invented veal stock, felt sure that a savoury fifth taste was the secret of his success, but everyone was too busy gorging on his food to take much notice of his theories. Fast forward to the 21st century and many cooks are delighted to finally see proof of what they had instinctively known. Massimo Bottura, whose restaurant in Modena is ranked fifth best in the world, served the first incarnation of his dish five ages of parmigiano reggiano in different textures and temperatures in 1995. More recently, however, Bottura says that the discovery that parmesan is probably the most umami ingredient in western cookery has enhanced his appreciation and understanding of the dish. &quot;Five textures, five temperatures and five levels of umami,&quot; is how he now views it. Putting a name to a taste     Cheese and cured meats have umami in spades.  Photograph: Axiom Photographic/Design Pics/Corbis     Umami has been variously translated from Japanese as yummy, deliciousness or a pleasant savoury taste, and was coined in 1908 by a chemist at Tokyo University called Kikunae Ikeda. He had noticed this particular taste in asparagus, tomatoes, cheese and meat, but it was strongest in dashi \u2013 that rich stock made from kombu (kelp) which is widely used as a flavour base in Japanese cooking. So he homed in on kombu, eventually pinpointing glutamate, an amino acid, as the source of savoury wonder. He then learned how to produce it in industrial quantities and patented the notorious flavour enhancer MSG. What gives good glutamate?     Wild mushrooms, rich in glutamate. Photograph: Jeremy Sutton Hibbert / Rex Features    A quintessential example of something umami-tasting, says Paul Breslin of Monell University, who was among the first scientists to prove the existence of umami taste receptors, is a broth or a soup: &quot;Something that has been slow-cooked for a long time.&quot; Raw meat, he points out, isn&apos;t that umami. You need to release the amino acids by cooking, or &quot;hanging it until it is a little desiccated, maybe even moulded slightly, like a very good, expensive steak&quot;. Fermentation also frees the umami \u2013 soy sauce, cheese, cured meats have it in spades. In the vegetable kingdom, mushrooms are high in glutamate, along with those favoured by children such as petit pois, sweetcorn and sweet cherry tomatoes. Interestingly, human milk is one of the highest MSG-containing mammalian milks. Magical flavour-bomb maths     Double cheeseburger with all the trimmings: m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois. Photograph:  Jess Koppel/Getty    So why is bolognese sauce with cheese on top, or a cheeseburger with ketchup so finger-licking good? Because, says Laura Santtini, creator of the umami condiment Taste No 5 Umami Paste, when it comes to savoury, &quot;1+1=8&quot;. In the simplest terms, umami actually comes from glutamates and a group of chemicals called ribonucleotides, which also occur naturally in many foods. When you combine ingredients containing these different umami-giving compounds, they enhance one another so the dish packs more flavour points than the sum of its parts. This is why the cooked beef, tomato and cheese in the above examples form a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois made in heaven. And why ham and peas is a gastronomic no-brainer. And, oh dear, why it&apos;s hard to stop popping Smoky Bacon Pringles. Why we love umami     Sushi \u2013 with the all-important soy sauce. Photograph: Howard Shooter/Getty Images/Dorling Kindersley RF    Just as humans evolved to crave sweetness for sugars and, therefore, calories and energy, and loathe bitter to help avoid toxins, umami is a marker of protein (which is made up of amino acids, which are essential for life). This begs two interesting questions. First, why is our innate penchant for umami best served by cooked or aged foods? Breslin&apos;s answer is that cooking or preserving our main protein sources detoxifies them. &quot;&quot;Part of the great digestion formula,&quot; he says, &quot;is not only the ability to procure nutrients, but it&apos;s to protect yourself from getting sick while you do that. If you don&apos;t get proper nutrition you can live to see another day, but if you&apos;re poisoned, it can end it for you right there.&quot; Second, why are some fruits and vegetables that are low in protein, high in glutamate? Some cases, such as mushrooms, says Breslin, we cannot explain. However, for others, such as tomatoes, it could be the same reason why fruit is so sweet. &quot;The sugar is there so you grab the fruit and spread the seeds around. It could be that the mixture of sugar and glutamate in some of these foods is there to make them extra attractive.&quot; A force for good?     Spaghetti bolognese with cheese: umami triumvirate. Photograph: Christian Teubner/Getty Images/StockFood    Lacing cheap, fattening, non-nutritious foods with MSG to make them irresistible is clearly not responsible, but some argue that glutamate can be used responsibly to good effect. Breslin says one of his key motivations is finding ways through taste research to feed malnourished people. &quot;What you want,&quot; he says &quot;are things that are very tasty that kids will eat, that will go down easy and will help them.&quot; Meanwhile, Professor Margot Gosney, who chairs the Academic and Research Committee of the British Geriatrics Society is &quot;looking into increasing the umami content in hospital food,&quot; to make it more appealing to older people, without overdoing the salt. When I first learned about the fifth taste, I became obsessed, seeking it out in ingredients and experimenting. However, not everyone is convinced that umami should even be classified as a basic taste. Professor Barry Smith of London University&apos;s Centre for the Study of the Senses queries why &quot;we need neuroscience and the Japanese&quot; to alert us to it, when tastes such as salt and sweet are clear as day. &quot;If you think of what has umami,&quot; he says, &quot;it&apos;s not obvious that there&apos;s something in common with all these things,&quot; and in lab tests, westerners struggle to consciously detect it.&quot; Do you savour the umami in foods, or is the concept meaningless to you? And where do you stand on the MSG food additive debate?"}, {"sentences": ["In response, Japan deployed PAC-3 missile interceptors in Tokyo on Tuesday.", "Japan&apos;s self-defence forces are under orders to shoot down any incoming North Korean missiles; Tokyo has also deployed two Aegis destroyers equipped with sea-based interceptor missiles in the Sea of Japan.The two missiles, thought to be the untested Musudan, have a maximum range of 2 485 miles, putting South Korea, Japan and US bases on Guam within reach."], "tags": ["North Korea", "US news", "US military", "US foreign policy", "Asia Pacific", "South Korea", "Obama administration", "Kim Jong-un", "US politics", "World news", "Nuclear weapons", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-09T18:51:00Z", "title": "US confident it can intercept North Korean missiles, says top admiral", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/09/us-military-north-korea-missiles", "article": "The United States could intercept a ballistic missile launched by North Korea, the top US military commander in the Pacific said Tuesday, as the relationship between the West and the communist government hit its lowest ebb since the end of the Korean War.

According to the Star, the court papers lodged by Makaziwe and Zenani are fiercely critical of the three men, especially Chuene, claiming that he was &quot;criminally conducting himself&quot; when he allegedly appointed himself as director of the companies. Makaziwe&apos;s affidavit alleges that Bizos was &quot;quite happy to participate in this unlawful conduct, as is evident from his acceptance of the sham directorship&quot;. Bizos, 84, who is currently representing victims of the Marikana mine massacre, strongly rejected the claims. &quot;There is no basis to the allegations,&quot; he told the Star. &quot;We are not hijackers. We don&apos;t hijack things. The public should ask themselves why five years later these allegations are being laid. We are confident we were regularly appointed at the wish of Mr Mandela five years ago.&quot; He added that Makaziwe and Zenani had brought the court application &quot;in order to further their interests and get their hands on the money&quot;. On Wednesday Bizos, who has known Mandela for 65 years, declined to comment further except to say: &quot;Of course I am hurt.&quot; Both companies were established by Mandela&apos;s controversial former lawyer Ismail Ayob. A legal statement on behalf of Bizos, Chuene and Sexwale claimed that when Mandela ended his professional relationship with Ayob in 2004 he provided &quot;explicit instructions&quot; identifying who was to be appointed to the companies. &quot;Our clients were identified by Mr Mandela and were in due course lawfully appointed as directors of the companies referred to in the application,&quot; said Michael Hart, a lawyer with Norton Rose South Africa. &quot;We are instructed to record our clients&apos; complete rejection of the scurrilous allegations made by the applicants in their papers. These will be refuted in the answering affidavits filed in support of their opposition to the application.&quot; In an apparent reference to 94-year-old Mandela&apos;s failing health, the statement concluded: &quot;Our clients record their dismay at the insensitivity of the applicants in publicly releasing the unanswered court documents, particularly at this time. They will deal fully with the matter in their papers to be filed in terms of the rules of court.&quot; Sexwale, the human settlements minister in the South African government, told South Africa&apos;s eNews Channel Africa that he felt there was something &quot;dodgy&quot; about the court case. He maintained that the three people in question were appointed trustees by Mandela. &quot;I still do not know what the quarrel is about. As a colleague and a comrade of Nelson Mandela, if he appoints you, you do the job.&quot; Sources close to the case told the Guardian that the case had divided the Mandela family, with some members refusing to back Makaziwe and Zenani. A spokeswoman for Mandela&apos;s ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, was unavailable for comment. Mandela has married three times and fathered six children, three of whom have died. His surviving children are all women: Makaziwe, by his first wife, Evelyn Mase, and Zenani and Zindzi, by his second wife, Winnie. He divorced Winnie in 1996 and is now married to Gra\u00e7a Machel. According to the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory, he currently has 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.

The airbags were produced by Tokyo-based company Takata, which makes airbags and seatbelts for major carmakers, including non-Japanese companies such as Daimler and Ford. Takata spokesman Toyohiro Hishikawa told the Reuters news agency that some non-Japanese carmakers were also supplied with the faulty airbags, but declined to name them. Honda said 1.1 million cars were being recalled worldwide, including 680,000 in North America and 15,475 in the UK.

The stern communique issued after weeks of bellicose rhetoric from North Korea follows evidence in recent comments and editorials that China has been persuaded to put public pressure on its ally to step back from further dangerous provocations. It also comes as new US intelligence suggested that North Korea has the ability to launch nuclear-armed ballistic missiles but that the weapons would probably be unreliable, according to Pentagon officials. The US Defence Intelligence Agency said North Korea probably has the knowhow to arm a missile with a nuclear warhead but doubted its reliability. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, is travelling on to Seoul and Tokyo, with the tensions expected to dominate discussions in both cities. In the statement the G8 ministers condemned in the &quot;strongest possible terms&quot; recent missile tests for seriously undermining international security, adding to similar messages that have been emerging in the Chinese media in recent days. The G8 nations are the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia. In a sign of growing international solidarity over North Korea&apos;s recent behaviour, Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia \u2013 which has been at loggerheads with the US over Syria \u2013 said: &quot;There is no disagreement with the United States over North Korea.&quot; The G8 ministers said Pyongyang&apos;s aggressive rhetoric would only isolate North Korea and urged the government to engage in &quot;credible&quot; talks on abandoning all existing nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. They urged North Korea to refrain from &quot;further provocative acts&quot;, and expressed concern about its plans to reopen its Yongbyon nuclear facility. On Thursday President Barack Obama warned North Korea that his administration would &quot;take all necessary steps&quot; to protect American citizens, and urged the country&apos;s leadership to end its nuclear threats, saying it was time for the isolated nation &quot;to end the belligerent approach they have taken and to try to lower temperatures.&quot; &quot;Nobody wants to see a conflict on the Korean peninsula,&quot; Obama added, speaking from the Oval Office alongside United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon. North Korea claimed on Thursday it had &quot;powerful striking means&quot; on standby for a missile launch. Despite the recent strident tone of its warnings, analysts believe that the spate of threats is intended to pressure South Korea and the US into shifting their policy. Although this round of rhetoric and symbolic measures has been particularly prolonged, they believe it reflects the coincidence of joint US-South Korean military drills, the United Nations security council resolution condemning North Korea&apos;s third nuclear test, and the coming anniversary of the birth of the country&apos;s founder, Kim Il-sung. The country is often keen to demonstrate its military power and technical progress on important political dates. Officials in Washington and the US say Pyongyang appears to be preparing to test-fire a medium-range missile, dubbed the Musudan, thought to have a potential range of 3,500km. &quot;North Korea has continuously issued provocative threats and made efforts to raise tension on the Korean peninsula \u2026 but the current situation is being managed safely and our and foreign governments have been calmly responding,&quot; said Seoul&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman, Cho Tai-young. The unification minister, Ryoo Kihl-jae, urged Pyongyang to engage in dialogue and discuss resuming production at the joint industrial park at Kaesong, from which North Korea pulled its workers earlier this week. The G8 statement was released amid the first signs that all parties were edging away from the warlike rhetoric of recent weeks. North Korea&apos;s state news agency seemed to suggest that the strongest step the country had so far taken \u2013 the closure of the Kaesong joint economic development zone \u2013 had been a temporary measure. Pyongyang issued a statement that appeared to be tinged with regret over the closure of Kaesong, which was shut when it ordered its workers out this week, terming the North-South venture &quot;the pinnacle of General Kim Jong-il&apos;s limitless love for his people and brothers&quot;. The statement, on the country&apos;s KCNA news agency, blamed the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, for bringing the money-spinning venture to &quot;the brink of shutting down&quot;. Evidence from inside North Korea in recent days has also suggested that reserves who had been mobilised have returned their weapons and gone back to other duties. Despite threats that it will attack US bases and the South in response to any hostile acts, the North has welcomed a stream of visitors for Monday&apos;s celebrations marking Kim Il-sung&apos;s birthday. The official news agency listed an eclectic mix of guests ranging from Chinese businessmen to cold war-era enthusiasts of its socialist monarchy and official ideology of &quot;juche&quot;, or self-reliance. Most observers say Pyongyang has no intention of igniting a conflict that could bring its own destruction, but fears remain over the risk of miscalculation on the militarised Korean peninsula. North Korea has stationed five medium-range missiles on its east coast, according to defence assessments by Washington and Seoul, possibly in readiness for a test launch that would show its ability to hit US bases on Guam. &quot;There are signs the North could fire off Musudan missiles any time soon,&quot; an unnamed intelligence source in Seoul told Yonhap news agency. Apart from the swipe at South Korea&apos;s new president, verbal threats appeared to fall off as KCNA listed arrivals for the upcoming birthday celebrations, naming an eclectic mix ranging from Chinese businessmen to Ccold Wwar-era enthusiasts of its socialist monarchy and official ideology of &quot;juche&quot;, or self-reliance. China has also urgedIn a sign of growing pressure on Pyongyang from Beijing, China yesterday urged &quot;relevant parties&quot; to resume long-stalled six-party talks involving China, the two Koreas, the US, Japan and Russia and aimed at reining in North Korea&apos;s nuclear ambitions. &quot;The hope that the Korean peninsula maintains peace and stability is the universal expectation of the international community,&quot; spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news briefing. The Global Times, a tabloid published by the ruling Communist party&apos;s People&apos;s Daily, underlined the growing pressure from Beijing. It said: &quot;North Korea is sure to change, because its current situation is unsustainable and is placing huge pressure on the country \u2026 the regime has taken an extreme path \u2026 Pyongyang should clearly understand that it does not have the capability to dominate the situation in the Korean Peninsula.&quot; Another piece, carried by the website of the Communist party newspaper People&apos;s Daily, criticised the US, Japan and the South but noted that while the outside world should not interfere with the North&apos;s internal affairs, &quot;if its choice and words intensify the Korean peninsula tensions and affects peace and stability in the region, it becomes an international issue. The situation&apos;s development on the peninsula will not necessarily go according to the ideas and expectations of the DPRK.&quot; &quot;China&apos;s policy towards the DPRK has been changing since 2006 [when Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear test], and is still changing,&quot; said Cheng Xiaohe, a foreign policy at Renmin University. &quot;In the past few days we&apos;ve seen China seemingly ratchet up its warnings to the DPRK \u2013 and also to other countries, including the US. But any expectations of fundamental change will be unrealistic. China&apos;s bottom line is that it will not cut off its relations with the DPRK and will not turn the DPRK into its enemy.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Nothing had been revealed but the mysterious title, Colourless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage, but that didn&apos;t stop hundreds of Haruki Murakami devotees queuing at midnight outside Tokyo bookshops last night to get their hands on the cult novelist&apos;s latest title.", "On Friday morning, an NHK journalist told the broadcaster he was still only halfway through the &quot;gripping&quot; title, while Michiko Mamuro, a bookstore employee in central Tokyo, breezed through its 370 pages in a couple of hours."], "tags": ["Haruki Murakami", "Books", "Fiction", "Japan", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-12T14:01:13Z", "title": "Haruki Murakami fans queue overnight for latest novel", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/12/haruki-murakami-colourless-tsukuru-tazaki", "article": "Nothing had been revealed but the mysterious title, Colourless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage, but that didn&apos;t stop hundreds of Haruki Murakami devotees queuing at midnight outside Tokyo bookshops last night to get their hands on the cult novelist&apos;s latest title.

Mamuro revealed that the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown form the work&apos;s backdrop. &quot;I got the impression that Murakami faced the disaster head on,&quot; she told the Asahi Shimbun. &quot;The book is filled with strong messages and many encouraging words.&quot; According to the Asahi Shimbun&apos;s early review, the novel is &quot;the tale of a man who tries to overcome his sense of loss and isolation&quot;. At high school, protagonist Tsukuru Tazaki had four close friends whose names represented different colours. His did not, and at university he was rejected by his friends.

Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said: &quot;This weakness is possibly linked to increased payroll and income tax hikes which took effect at the start of the year, and will inevitably add to worries that the US economy is slowing as we move into the spring as automatic budget spending cuts come into force.

Kerry told reporters that a launch would &quot;raise people&apos;s temperatures&quot; and reiterated the US determination to defend its allies. But he added: &quot;Our choice is to negotiate, our choice is to move to the table and find a way for the region to have peace. &quot;I&apos;m not going to be so stuck in the mud that an opportunity to actually get something done is flagrantly wasted because of a kind of predetermined stubbornness.&quot; He said how far the North would need to go would have to be the subject of discussion, but added: &quot;If the Chinese came to us and said, &apos;Look, here&apos;s what we have cooking,&apos; I&apos;m not going to tell you I&apos;m shutting the door today to something that&apos;s logical and might have a chance of success.&quot; Kerry indicated he might be willing to use back channels rather than an official US government envoy to handle contact with the North.  In the US, the Republican senator John McCain voiced scepticism about possible talks with the North, warning: &quot;If we give them food, if we give them oil, if we give them money, they will come around and they take our money and run.&quot; In Pyongyang, leader Kim Jong-un visited the mausoleum where the bodies of his grandfather Kim Il-sung and father Kim Jong-il lie in state to pay &quot;high tribute in humblest reverence&quot; on Monday, the official Korean Central News Agency said.

After weeks of tension \u2013 with the North issuing a string of threats and recalling workers from a joint industrial complex \u2013 Kerry has repeatedly stressed the possibility of dialogue during visits to Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo. But in an interview with the BBC he warned again that the North would have to show good faith, noting: &quot;We do not want to go into another round of artificial talks that are clearly calculated to play a game. &quot;We cannot continue this charade and we cannot have a policy of rhetoric about denuclearisation \u2013 there have to be real steps.&quot; The North rebuffed Seoul&apos;s proposal of talks as a &quot;crafty trick&quot; on Sunday. The South&apos;s unification ministry described the response as regrettable but said the offer would remain on the table. Earlier, speaking to reporters in Tokyo, Kerry told the North that a missile test would &quot;raise people&apos;s temperatures&quot; and further isolate it. South Korea&apos;s defence minister, Kim Kwan-jin, told a parliamentary committee in Seoul on Monday that North Korea appeared ready to launch a missile from its east coast. Experts thought it might try to do so ahead of the 101st anniversary of Kim&apos;s birth. Kim Jin-moo of the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses in Seoul said the North might have felt there had been too much scrutiny and could still launch a missile later, when there was less attention. &quot;I think they didn&apos;t launch the missile because they may be worried it would be shot down,&quot; Kim said, adding: &quot;North Korea may abruptly fire the missile early one morning.&quot; South Korea&apos;s foreign minister, Yun Byung-se told journalists: &quot;Some people are talking about [the North&apos;s] exit strategy [from the latest confrontation]. But you have to see the bigger picture. Basically the new leader in North Korea seems to be a bit different. Before we were able to predict what they would do. This time, under the young leader, we have less and less predictability.&quot; In Pyongyang, Kim Jong-un visited the mausoleum the bodies of his grandfather Kim Il-sung and father Kim Jong-il lie in state to mark Monday&apos;s anniversary, state media reported. There are no celebratory parades scheduled this week \u2013 as there have been in previous years \u2013 perhaps because the North plans them for other significant anniversaries. But people queued to lay bouquets at the bronze statues of the former leaders. In London, the North Korea&apos;s ambassador to Britain made a rare speech to a foreign audience, defending Pyongyang&apos;s stance as a response to the provocations of the United States and South Korea. The 11-minute address by Hyon Hak-bong to the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist) was posted on a YouTube channel carrying North Korean propaganda on Monday afternoon. In a written ministerial statement to Parliament following last week&apos;s G8 meeting in London, the foreign secretary, William Hague said: &quot;Our message to North Korea is clear. It has a choice, between constructive engagement with the international community, or further international action and isolation. &quot;The choice it is taking now will lead it to be a broken country, isolated from the rest of the world.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Marathon tourism has also taken off, with many keen British runners travelling to Boston, New York, Paris and Tokyo to compete abroad."], "tags": ["London Marathon", "Athletics", "Sport", "Boston", "US news", "Massachusetts", "World news", "Boston Marathon bombing"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-15T22:46:49Z", "title": "London Marathon security to be reviewed after Boston attack", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/15/london-marathon-security-boston-attack", "article": "The Metropolitan police will urgently review security for this Sunday&apos;s London Marathon in the wake of the bombs at the Boston event, it said on Monday night.

Speaking 12 hours after the blasts near the finish line in Boston, which also injured more than 100 people, Robertson said he was &quot;absolutely confident&quot; the London race, involving about 37,500 competitors, could be held safely. Asked on BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme if he thought the marathon should go ahead, he replied: &quot;Yes, I do. These are balance of judgments but we are absolutely confident here that we can keep the event safe and secure. &quot;I think this is one of those incidents where the best way to show solidarity with Boston is to continue and send a very clear message to those responsible.&quot; The organisers of the London race confirmed it would go ahead as originally scheduled following a review of security arrangements with the Metropolitan police and other authorities. The home secretary, Theresa May, has been briefed fully about the Boston explosions and held a meeting with the MI5 director-general, Jonathan Evans, and the Met&apos;s assistant commissioner for specialist operations, Cressida Dick. The threat level to the UK from international terrorism, set by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, remains at substantial. Police and London Marathon officials are expected to have a series of discussions about security following the explosions in Boston. Scotland Yard is waiting for details to emerge from US investigators, such as who is thought to be behind the blasts, as well as information about the bombs&apos; construction and the types of explosives used, which will help give clues about whether the perpetrator or perpetrators were inspired by al-Qaida ideology or other forms of extremism. Chief Superintendent Julia Pendry, in charge of policing the London Marathon, said: &quot;A security plan is in place. We will be reviewing our security arrangements in partnership with London Marathon.&quot; An estimated 500,000 spectators will line the streets to watch the 26.2-mile race from Blackheath, in the south-east of the capital, to the Mall, in central London.

They take account of many contingencies, including this type of threat and incident, but one can&apos;t be complacent and when it has happened, you need to then review those plans you have in place to see what else may be necessary. That is certainly what we are going to be doing in the forthcoming hours and days.&quot; The London mayor, Boris Johnson, said he was shocked by the events at the Boston Marathon, which is the world&apos;s oldest. &quot;The bombings in Boston are shocking, cowardly and horrific, and the thoughts of all Londoners this morning will be with the victims. Boston is a proud city built on history, tradition and a real sense of community. &quot;These attacks were aimed at its core, at innocent men, women and children enjoying a spring day out at a major sporting event. We do have robust security measures in place for Sunday&apos;s London Marathon, but given events in Boston it&apos;s only prudent for the police and the organisers of Sunday&apos;s race to re-examine those security arrangements.&quot; The mayor added that he had spoken to the Met police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe.

Not by much, but a bit cheerier than it was six months ago when it was fretting about the eurozone busting apart or the United States imposing budget cuts that would have killed economic recovery stone dead. Those two big risks have, the Fund believes, been greatly diminished. It thinks the US is going about fiscal consolidation too hastily and too clumsily, and wishes eurozone policymakers would get their fingers out and get on with the creation of banking and fiscal unions. But all in all it thinks the doomsday scenarios it was envisaging last autumn are now less likely. So, while 2013 is not going to be a vintage year, with global growth similar to that in 2012, activity will strengthen in the second half of the year and into 2014. Even so the Fund likes to pepper its World Economic Outlook with warnings about what could go wrong, and the spring 2013 edition is no exception. The main short-term risk, predictably enough, is seen as Europe, where the crisis in Greece, the political impasse in Italy, the court ruling against austerity measures in Portugal and the speculation about the financial difficulties facing Slovenia have punctured optimism at the turn of the year that the worst was over. The Fund&apos;s growth forecasts for the single currency area are dire. Of the big four economies only one \u2013 Germany \u2013 is slated to see any growth at all in 2013, and even then expansion of just 0.6%, weaker even than the forecast for the UK. France is expected to follow last year&apos;s zero growth with a contraction of 0.1%; Italy and Spain are both predicted to see output slump by around 1.5% in 2013. Prolonged stagnation in the eurozone \u2013 GDP falls by 0.3% this year after a 0.6% drop in 2012 \u2013 is worrying in itself but it also has knock-on consequences for the rest of what the Fund sees as a three-speed global economy. In the first division are the emerging economies, which are exploiting their ability to catch-up with the countries of the developed world. They should see growth of more than 5% this year, similar to last year&apos;s performance. The second division includes the US, Canada and Japan \u2013 even though the IMF clearly believes the stop-at-nothing reflationary strategy adopted by the new government in Tokyo is &quot;risky&quot; given the high level of public debt and the absence of a credible plan for putting the public finances back into some sort of order. Finally, there is Europe, firmly in division three and with no immediate prospect of promotion. Britain, according to the Fund&apos;s forecasts is battling to avoid relegation into the bottom tier. It is expected to have higher growth and lower unemployment than the eurozone, but suffer from higher inflation and a bigger current account deficit. The danger from the Fund&apos;s perspective is that the eurozone drags the rest of the world economy down with it. Growth in Asia is highly dependent on what is happening elsewhere, while a special analysis by IMF economists showed strong linkages between expansion in the US and expansion in the eurozone. Some indications of this are already starting to feed through into the most recent economic data, which in the US, China and Europe has been weaker than anticipated. When the Fund notes in the WEO that &quot;financial markets have led the re-acceleration in activity&quot;, this is not strictly true. There has, as yet, been no &quot;re-acceleration in activity&quot; merely the expectation that there will be one. The wobble in the markets in recent days reflects concern that celebrations to mark the end of the most severe global downturn since the 1930s \u2013 and even the Fund&apos;s cautious optimism \u2013 may be a trifle premature."}, {"sentences": ["From Tokyo to London and from New York to Berlin, the emotional intensity of the global response to the attack on the Boston Marathon is indicative of the rise of distance running as a modern phenomenon that is now far from lonely.", "The big city marathons in London, Boston, New York, Tokyo, Paris, Chicago and Berlin have become far more than the sum of their parts."], "tags": ["Athletics", "Boston Marathon bombing", "London Marathon", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-16T13:30:50Z", "title": "Boston bombs desecrate marathon spirit celebrating human endeavour | Owen Gibson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/apr/16/marathons-bombs-human-endeavour", "article": "From Tokyo to London and from New York to Berlin, the emotional intensity of the global response to the attack on the Boston Marathon is indicative of the rise of distance running as a modern phenomenon that is now far from lonely. Over the past three decades the growth of marathon and distance running in a sporting landscape otherwise dominated by fears over obesity, increasingly sedentary lifestyles and plummeting sports participation figures is a cheering anomaly. It has also become big business, while raising a fortune for charity, and forged a global community of like-minded souls. Those who have not endured the pain and pleasure of 26.2 miles themselves have either stood on the side of the road cheering those who have, or contributed via the now traditional appeals for sponsorship that have become a staple at this time of year. Runners in London alone have raised more than \u00a3500m over the years, lending an extra layer of emotional resonance to their efforts. In the US the numbers have soared from 25,000 participants in 1976 to a record 518,000 in 2011. The pattern of growth continued in 2012, but the total number of participants was down because the New York Marathon was cancelled in the wake of the storms that battered the city. Even then, there was evidence of the humanity at the heart of these events as many of the frustrated participants instead turned their attention to helping those worst affected by the storms. The big city marathons in London, Boston, New York, Tokyo, Paris, Chicago and Berlin have become far more than the sum of their parts. The same is true of the Great North Run half marathon in the north east and countless other marathons and half marathons around the world. The late Chris Brasher, a onetime Observer athletics correspondent and the co-founder of the London Marathon in 1981, had been inspired after taking part in the New York Marathon, which had been run since 1970 and was in turn influenced by the Boston race. The latter began in April 1897 and is commonly credited as the oldest marathon in the world as well as the second longest continuously running footrace in North America, having debuted just five months after the oldest, the Buffalo Turkey Trot. Returning enthused from New York, Brasher wrote: &quot;To believe this story you must believe that the human race can be one joyous family, working together, laughing together, achieving the impossible. Last Sunday, 11,532 men and women from 40 countries in the world, assisted by over a million people, laughed, cheered and suffered during the greatest folk festival the world has seen.&quot; That is the spirit that went on to infuse the London event as it grew beyond even the grand vision of its founders to become part of the capital&apos;s beating heart. The same is true of a growing number of others across the world. The elite race is one aspect, but for most of those watching in person or on television, it is the combination of the best in the world running the same course as tens of thousands of others, ranging from serious club runners to those pushing through the pain barrier to complete their first marathon and those in fancy dress running for charity. Brendan Foster, the director of Great North Run organiser Nova International and a key player in the growth of the sector, summed up the appeal like this. &quot;It&apos;s ordinary people in many cases doing extraordinary things. Some are doing it to become professional athletes, some are doing it to break a certain time, some are doing it for charity, some are doing it in memory of others. There are a multitude of reasons but there is a single spirit,&quot; he said. The masses pounding the streets in London on Sunday will be literally following in the footsteps of Wilson Kipsang and Mo Farah. Among those who have caught the bug, marathon tourism has taken off in a big way. There were 374 British runners and 108 Irish runners registered to take part in Boston and a global community of runners of all ability levels increasingly criss-cross the globe to take part. &quot;It&apos;s a lifestyle, it&apos;s a life choice and it&apos;s international. By definition, these people are representative of the world, they&apos;re not representative of any organisation or any country. There are people from all around the world who run in these events.&quot; All of which makes the endlessly replayed TV images of limbs being blown off and the heartbreaking story of an eight-year-old boy killed as he ran proudly to congratulate his father on finishing the race all the harder to bear. Ed Warner, the UK Athletics chairman, who has run the Boston Marathon himself, said: &quot;It touches a lot of hearts. There&apos;s a collective sadness that something that is usually 100% about celebrating human endeavour is besmirched in this way. It&apos;s so sad.&quot; The fact that the bombers struck at a time when recreational runners were crossing the line, hours after the elite field were back in their hotel, only adds to the sense of outrage and incomprehension that has greeted the attack. For Foster, marathons have become a modern way of defining ourselves, a 21st century rite of passage. &quot;We lead an increasingly sedentary lifestyle and they are challenges to a cross section of people to prove to themselves they can do certain things. Instead of being on the sidelines, you can be in the middle, you can be where the action is. &quot;Alongside the best runners in the world, on the same course, you&apos;re doing the same challenge as them, you&apos;re just doing it a bit more slowly. You can go into the office on Monday morning and you might have come 35,000th but you&apos;ll be applauded and respected for what you&apos;ve done. It&apos;s a way of expressing yourself and what you believe in. And it&apos;s worldwide.&quot; You would not always turn to the president of the international federation to sum up the emotional intensity of an attack on sport. But, for once, the IAAF president, Lamine Diack, precisely captured the depth of the outrage. &quot;This ghastly and cowardly attack strikes at the very core of the freest of human activities. Whether as a fun runner or elite competitor, road running exemplifies the honesty of basic human movement, strength and resilience,&quot; he said. &quot;What makes this incident so vile and its planning so incomprehensible is that marathons the world over are about selfless acts of human generosity.&quot; It is that generosity that has already seen London Marathon chief executive, Nick Bitel, besieged with offers of help and support from around the world for a race that will now have yet another added layer of meaning as it sends out a message of defiance to those who targeted Boston in such shockingly incongruous fashion."}, {"sentences": ["On strictly foreign-policy and national-security grounds, Democratic and Republican officials surely regard Seoul and Tokyo as important as the Mideast, certainly now with the growing importance of Asia."], "tags": ["Torture"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-18T13:23:00Z", "title": "US torture 'indisputable', CNN's humiliation, and Iran sanctions | Glenn Greenwald", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/18/torture-report-cnn-terrorism-iran", "article": "(updated below - Update II) Today is a travel day for me, so I&apos;ll use this opportunity to note some brief though significant items: (1) It&apos;s hardly news that the US instituted and for years maintained a systematic torture regime, but the success of the Obama administration in blocking all judicial proceedings has meant there has been no official decree that this is so. A comprehensive report just issued by a truly bipartisan group of former high-level Washington officials (including military officials) is as close as we are likely to get to such an official proclamation.  The Report explains that the impetus behind it was that &quot;the Obama administration declined, as a matter of policy, to undertake or commission an official study of what happened, saying it was unproductive to &apos;look backwards&apos; rather than forward.&quot; It concludes - in unblinking and definitive fashion - that &quot;it is indisputable that the United States engaged in the practice of torture&quot;; this finding is &quot;offered without reservation&quot;; it is &quot;not based on any impressionistic approach&quot; but rather &quot;grounded in a thorough and detailed examination of what constitutes torture in many contexts, notably historical and legal&quot;; and &quot;the nation&apos;s highest officials bear some responsibility for allowing and contributing to the spread of torture.&quot; It also debunks the popular claim that torture was confined to three cases of waterboarding, documenting that more than three people were subjected to that tactic and that the torture includes far more than just waterboarding. This is not only a historical disgrace for the US and the responsible officials, but, as the New York Times article on this report inadvertently suggests, also shames two other institutions:  (1) the New York Times itself, which steadfastly refused to use the word &quot;torture&quot; to describe what was being done (unless it was done by other countries) and continues to justify that refusal through its then-Executive Editor Bill Keller (Andrew Sullivan ably demolishes Keller&apos;s reasoning, while the paper&apos;s public editor, Margaret Sullivan, wrote this week that this choice merits &quot;some institutional soul-searching&quot;); and,  (2) President Obama, who barred all criminal prosecutions for Bush officials and other torturers and thus brazenly violated at least the spirit and probably the letter of the Convention Against Torture. That treaty, signed by Ronald Reagan in 1988 (exactly 25 years ago to the day: Happy Anniversary!), compels all signatories who discover credible allegations that government officials have participated or been complicit in torture to &quot;submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution&quot; (Art. 7(1)). It also specifically states that &quot;no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat or war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture&quot; and &quot;an order from a superior officer or a public authority may not be invoked as a justification of torture&quot; (Art. 2 (2-3)).   The disgrace of the American torture regime falls on Bush officials and secondarily the media and political institutions that acquiesced to it, but the full-scale protection of those war crimes (and the denial of justice to their victims) falls squarely on the Obama administration. Dan Froomkin has more on the significance of this report here. In sum, if you&apos;re the NYT or Obama, how do you reconcile your conduct with this establishment finding that it is &quot;indisputable&quot; that the US government, at its highest levels, instituted a worldwide regime of torture? (2) One of the most commonly voiced objections to my Monday column about the Boston bombing was that, contrary to my claim, there were no real media attempts to suggest that the perpetrators were Muslim. That objection was voiced despite the multiple examples I cited where precisely that was done by the most mainstream news sources. It was voiced despite the grotesque media attempt to convert a Saudi victim of the bombing into &quot;the suspect&quot;, as brilliantly analyzed by the New Yorker&apos;s Amy Davidson. And now we have yet another example: probably the worst of the bunch. On Tuesday afternoon, CNN humiliated itself as badly as it ever has (which is saying quite a bit). The network&apos;s anchor John King, and its &quot;terrorism expert&quot;, former Bush homeland security adviser Fran Townsend, both &quot;reported&quot; - as part of a &quot;Breaking News&quot; scoop that CNN loudly and excitedly trumpeted - that an arrest had been made in the Boston case and that the person was, as King put it, &quot;a dark-skinned individual&quot; (more or less simultaneously, Fox also reported the arrest). An hour later, it became clear that this was totally false. Raw Story details what happened here, and BuzzFeed (which one might at this point reasonably say is a level or so above CNN in the news reliability department) has the very amusing and appropriate mockery here. But the best commentary on this debacle came from Chris Hayes&apos; top-of-the-show seven-minute scathing monologue on MSNBC last night, where he not only crystallized why this was so journalistically reckless but, more importantly, explains exactly why CNN repeatedly said that the arrested person was &quot;dark-skinned&quot;:      Townsend has built up quite a history at this point. It was she who visited Abu Ghraib in 2003 and put pressure on the prison officials there to extract more information. She then served as one of the paid shills for the then-designated terrorist group Mujaheddin-e Khalq (MeK), even as she used her perch at CNN to cheer for broad interpretations of the &quot;material support for terrorism&quot; statute that sent American Muslims to prison for decades for far less involvement with such groups than she had with the MeK. And now she&apos;s at the center of this reporting disaster. Good job, CNN: nobody could have guessed that a Bush terrorism official would produce outcomes like this. (3) A different report from a bipartisan cast of official Washington was issued today, this one on the Obama administration&apos;s Iran policy. Although it affirms the DC convention that Iran is some sort of serious threat to the US - a prerequisite for being viewed as Serious among its target audience - it surprisingly, and quite cogently, calls into serious question the wisdom of the sanctions regime imposed by the US. As this good New York Times summary of the report notes, the report explains that sanctions have &quot;contributed to an increase in repression and corruption within Iran&quot; and &quot;may be sowing the seeds of long-term alienation between the Iranian people and the United States&quot;.  The most important conclusion is that Obama must rely far less on bluster, threats and sanctions - none of which is likely to achieve anything - and instead do far more to engage the Iranians and find a negotiated settlement to the multiple issues between the two countries. That is the same conclusion publicly advocated by Obama&apos;s own former Iran adviser Vali Nasr, who has harshly criticized the president for failing to engage in real diplomacy with Tehran, as well as former national security officials Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leverett. That these same warnings now issue from such an establishment group as the one that produced this report is a compelling sign of just how misguided Obama policy has been. That does not, of course, mean, that he can or will change it. That&apos;s because, as Foreign Policy Community maven Les Gelb recently explained in the Daily Beast, what drives Iran policy more than anything else is this:  &quot;Administration officials would never admit it, but the main reason for their being tougher on Iran than North Korea seems tied to American domestic politics as much as or more than anything else, specifically the standing of Israel and oil versus Korea and Japan. On strictly foreign-policy and national-security grounds, Democratic and Republican officials surely regard Seoul and Tokyo as important as the Mideast, certainly now with the growing importance of Asia. In American politics, however, Israel and oil count for much, much more. It&apos;s notable that President Obama made his strongest pronouncements about employing force to stop Iranian nukes at the annual meeting of AIPAC, the very potent group of American-Jewish backers of Israel.&quot;  Still, the more light shined on the fact that US belligerence toward Iran helps only Israel and hurts the US, the better. (4) Also related to Monday&apos;s column on the Boston bombing: the Associated Press apparently woke up this morning and realized that the term &quot;terrorism&quot; has no real, fixed, or consistently applied meaning. This has long been clear, but it&apos;s nice to see this truth recognized in such a mainstream outlet:  &quot;In times of tension and uncertainty, words can become malleable vessels - for cultural fears, for political agendas, for ways to make sense of the momentous and the unknown. In 2013 America, the word &apos;terrorism&apos; exists at this ambiguous crossroads. And the opinions you&apos;ll find about it - this week in particular - often transcend mere linguistics.&quot;  Precisely. But what&apos;s most amazing about it is that the term, though essentially impoverished of fixed meaning, is incomparably significant when it comes to legal, political and cultural assumptions. It&apos;s a word that means nothing, yet justifies everything those in power do. (5) The issue of the composition of the Guardian&apos;s readership often is raised in the comment section here and elsewhere. Yesterday, the paper&apos;s editor-in-chief, Alan Rusbridger, sat for an interview with Mathew Ingram and revealed, among other things, that 1/3 of the Guardian&apos;s readership is British, 1/3 is American, and 1/3 is from the rest of the world. He also discussed the Guardian&apos;s expansion into the US, the impressive increases in US readership it has seen, and the Guardian&apos;s journalistic and financial strategies. Those interested in such matters matters may find the interview worthwhile. (6) I&apos;ll be speaking at a couple of events this week, including the annual dinner of CAIR in New York this Saturday, April 20, entitled &quot;Upholding Our Constitution&quot; (ticket and event information here), and at the University of Illinois College of Law on Monday, April 22, where I&apos;ll debate the topic of domestic drones with the Heritage Foundation&apos;s James Carafano (for information, contact the local ACLU, one of the event sponsor&apos;s, at law-aclu@illinois.edu). I&apos;ll also be doing some media appearances, including on Chris Hayes&apos; MSNBC show on Friday night at roughly 8:00 pm, presumably to discuss several of these issues, and on Bill Moyers&apos; PBS show in the middle of next week. Also, a bit later today, I intend to add one item here on the growing hunger strike at Guantanamo, complete with an extraordinary video from the truly great documentarian Laura Poitras. UPDATE The hunger strike at Guant\u00e1namo continues to grow, even by the Pentagon&apos;s own admission. The New York Times&apos; Charlie Savage cites two military officials as saying that &quot;two detainees recently have tried to commit suicide by hanging themselves.&quot; Laura Poitras interviewed one former detainee, Lakhdar Boumediene, who engaged in hunger strikes while at the camp; watch this extraordinary two-minute video to see what happened to him:            Related to this, the Atlantic&apos;s Andrew Cohen interviewed another former detainee who was tortured at the camp, the Libyan national Omar Deghayes, to get his reaction to the new torture report I described in Item 1. His reactions are well worth hearing. UPDATE II I noted above (via commenter David Mizner) the remarkable coincidence that today is the 25th anniversary of the date the US signed the Convention Against Torture (April 18, 1988). Kade Crockford of the ACLU of Massachusetts commemorated the occasion with a truly perfect visual, particularly compelling in light of this week&apos;s new report decreeing it &quot;indisputable&quot; that the US government maintained a systematic torture regime:      That would make an excellent exhibit in the Obama presidential library, marking one of the most significant aspects of his legacy."}, {"sentences": ["One study of high-speed rail in Japan showed that Nagoya lost 20% of its employment after the opening of a high-speed line between Tokyo and Osaka."], "tags": ["Local government network blog", "Local government", "Public Leaders Network", "Local government"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-19T08:00:24Z", "title": "The promises for job creation  of road infrastructure are exaggerated", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2013/apr/19/job-creation-road-infrastructure", "article": "Hardly a day goes by without a headline proclaiming the transformation of tarmac and concrete into well-paid, sustainable jobs. These claims for infrastructure projects are a lot like alchemy and divert attention away from other, more sustainable, options for job creation. An excellent example is the Heysham M6 link road (the Lancaster northern bypass), a four-mile stretch that was approved for construction in March this year at a cost of \u00a3123m. Over a three-year period, Lancashire county council reduced its estimate of the number of jobs that the project would create by a factor of 10, down from 6,000 to 600. It is, of course, not possible with any meaningful precision to say how many jobs are created or, indeed, lost when a new road is inserted into a local economy. This was the conclusion reached by a government inquiry in 1999 (the standing advisory committee on trunk road assessment). Instead, it found that road building &quot;may sometimes benefit [one city or region] to the disbenefit of the other&quot;. This is a strong warning against exaggerated claims. Unfortunately, it is routinely ignored. The committee also concluded that there was no &quot;convincing general evidence of the size, nature or direction of local economic impacts&quot; from completed transport projects. A year later it said: &quot;Better communications will enlarge markets for goods, services and workers: the area as a whole may gain or lose from this depending on the structure and competitiveness of the local economy. It follows that there is no simple, unambiguous link between transport provision and local regeneration.&quot; The list of exaggerated and scientifically unproven job creation claims goes back a long way. In 1998, supporters of the High-Low Newton bypass on the A590 on the edge of the Lake District said that the bypass would be &quot;a stimulus to over 2,000 new jobs, a more diverse economy, enhanced competitiveness of existing manufacturing firms [and] more investment&quot;. The 6-mile A30 Bodmin-Indian Queens upgrade in south-west England was supported by claims that it would bring 1,400 jobs to West Cornwall. But in both cases there has been no verification of the job creation claims and no attempt to provide audited case study material to improve decision making on other UK road construction projects. The Thames Gateway Bridge proposals in East London were cross-examined in a public inquiry in 2005-06. Claims that 25,000 jobs would be created were found to be flawed and the planning inspector at that inquiry recommended refusal of the proposal to build. The lack of auditing information or National Audit Office publications on the degree to which job creation claims for road building are delivered sits alongside research showing that such claims cannot be verified by empirical evidence. An Eco-Logica report in 1994 concluded: &quot;Road construction is bad value for money as a way of creating jobs. Its rationale is seriously flawed, its performance rarely audited and such benefits as do materialise are rarely maintained into the future as congestion builds up and eliminates the time savings at the centre of the flawed model of economic development.&quot; The report, which excluded jobs created in the construction phase of a transport project, said that as the UK was a mature economy with high levels of good accessibility in all core regions, transport costs were rarely more than 5% of total operating costs and labour availability and access to pools of highly skilled labour was a key determining factor in decisions around inward investment. Yet claims continue: Cardiff airport (\u00a352m), the M4 in South Wales (\u00a31bn) and high-speed rail (\u00a332bn), all contain promises about jobs and regeneration benefits with no scientific evaluation of the claims or reference to previous studies. And the consequences will be shared unevenly. One study of high-speed rail in Japan showed that Nagoya lost 20% of its employment after the opening of a high-speed line between Tokyo and Osaka. This had an important bearing on a calculation by Derby city council that Derby will gain 12,300 jobs as a result of a high-speed rail connection to the city centre. There are three reasons why this all matters a great deal: \u2022 Decisions should be taken on the basis of high-quality evidence, audit and evaluation. This guarantees best value and prudent use of scarce resources at a time of deep cuts and austerity. \u2022 Transport spending usually contributes to higher demand for travel and transport. This means more car journeys, more road freight, more air travel and more high-speed rail travel and these are very significant components of growth in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that challenge all our climate change policies. \u2022 Transport spending justified wholly or in part by exaggerated claims around job creation represents a wasted opportunity. Creating jobs in local economies and supporting sustainability objectives (eg Freiburg, in Germany, has created 10,000 jobs in the renewable energy sector) can be achieved in many different ways and at lower cost per job than a motorway, airport or high-speed rail link. Importantly, these jobs can be created in every local economy, for example by implementing an integrated public transport system in every city in the UK with more than 100,000 people (as in Freiburg or Zurich).

As police confirmed that there would be 40% more officers on duty in the wake of Monday&apos;s bombs and Westminster Council removed all litter bins from the route as a security measure, those taking part said their sense of sadness and solidarity with competitors in Boston would help inspire them to finish the 26.2 mile course alongside 36,000 others. Many of those registering at the cavernous London Marathon Expo at the ExCel conference centre, which is on the other side of the Thames from where they will gather on Sunday at the start line, had their own, deeply personal reasons for wanting to complete in the race. Some were running in the memory of a deceased friend or relative, others to raise money for charity and others simply to beat their target time. But as they picked up the black ribbons that they will wear on their running vests alongside their race number, most agreed that they would also be running for those who were killed and injured by the bombs that exploded close to the finish line in Boston at a time when the elite participants were back in their hotel and those still running were recreational competitors like them. All said they had been left shaken by the blasts and some said they initially considered the security implications for London. But almost all agreed that London organisers were right to immediately signal their determination not to cancel. In the wake of the Boston bombs, much was made of the sense of global kinship felt by marathon runners, and it was much in evidence in the otherwise sterile surroundings of ExCel. Runners have come from around the world to compete in London just as hundreds from Great Britain and Ireland had taken part in Boston. &quot;I am running the marathon in honour of my dad who passed away three years ago and was really into his sport,&quot; said Kim Butigan, a 24-year-old journalist from Dubrovnik in Croatia. &quot;I was shaken [after what happened in Boston] and apprehensive about running but we must not let these things affect our everyday lives.&quot; Many of those registering have taken part in other marathons around the world, from Tokyo to Berlin. Chris McBeth, a farrier from Colchester who is an experienced marathon runner, was sporting a homemade Boston ribbon in yellow and blue that his partner Zoe had begun selling on Facebook to raise money for the victims of the bombing. In less than 24 hours, she had raised \u00a3100. &quot;I have been applying for six years so this is a really good opportunity. It didn&apos;t give me second thoughts at all. It was just so tragically moving. We had just come back from the Brighton marathon, where I was at that point at the finish waiting for Zoe,&quot; he said. &quot;If anything, it makes you more determined to do it. The running community has been so supportive. All runners everywhere want to show solidarity.&quot; Organisers will hold a 30-second silence before each of the three starts and, in addition to the black ribbons handed to every runner, have also announced that they will donate \u00a32 to the Boston First fund for every finisher. Anne Sinagra, who works for the city council in Bordeaux, had travelled to London to run with her sister-in-law Alice Cavender, who also lives in the French city. Both completed their first London marathon last year and are running again for Action Medical Research. &quot;It was the best day of my life. We crossed the finishing line together holding hands. The crowd was amazing,&quot; said Sinagra. &quot;I watched the news Monday night and I was very, very sad for the runners and all the families. It&apos;s supposed to be a day of joy and sharing. Sunday will be very emotional because all the runners will run for the same cause.&quot; James Wright, who had travelled from Oldham with his wife Della and hopes to complete the race dressed as Little Miss Chatterbox, predicted that crowds would turn out in even greater numbers in light of events in Boston. &quot;You can&apos;t let them stop you. It&apos;s two fingers up to anyone who wants to try and stop us.&quot; Typically, a crowd of around half a million throngs the 26.2 mile route that starts in Blackheath in south east London and ends on the Mall, and lends the event its unique atmosphere. Among the runners will be Dr Jack Holland, a lecturer in international relations at the University of Surrey and an expert on terrorism and security policy. In a blog written in the aftermath of the bombing, he wrote: &quot;&apos;Carry on&apos; has been a prominent British response to the events in Massachusetts. And that is not a bad start. So while Boston&apos;s 26th mile was dedicated, tragically, to the victims of the Newtown shootings, many running the London Marathon on Sunday will do so with Boston in mind.&quot; The elite runners also insisted that the Boston bombings would not deter them. Mo Farah, who is running the first half of the marathon in preparation for a tilt at the full distance next year, said: &quot;My support goes out to all the people involved, their families and loved ones. But they would want us to carry on and show our support. Why would you let it stop you?&quot; The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said the extra security measures and added police numbers were to provide &quot;reassurance&quot;. &quot;If we thought there was anything there that should stop people going out onto the streets, we would say so and we would call the whole thing off,&quot; he said. &quot;The threat level remains exactly the same as it always was, we&apos;ve had many marathons here, we&apos;ve looked at the experience of many, many marathons abroad.&quot; Additional reporting: Arjun Kharpal"}, {"sentences": ["He attended Cook It Raw in Japan and Poland When we arrived at Tokyo airport, there was a media scrum, with maybe 35 journalists and photographers."], "tags": ["Chefs", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Food", "Environment", "Ren\u00e9 Redzepi"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-21T06:30:00Z", "title": "Cook it Raw: 'For chefs, it's like free-falling into the unknown'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/21/cook-it-raw-eight-chefs-recall", "article": "Ren\u00e9 Redzepi  Redzepi&apos;s restaurant in Copenhagen, Noma, has been voted No 1 in the World&apos;s 50 Best every year since 2010 and his belief in the importance of time and place in cooking has had global influence. He is a co-founder of Cook It Raw and has attended all five events: Denmark, Italy, Lapland, Japan, Poland There is one moment I will never forget from the first Cook It Raw in Denmark in 2009. David Chang, the extraordinary chef from Momofuku in New York, is walking in a forest outside Copenhagen and he falls to his knees in a patch of wild garlic. &quot;Holy shit!&quot; you can tell he&apos;s thinking. &quot;What I&apos;m looking at isn&apos;t scenery, it&apos;s food!&quot; I see it in my cooks all the time. You might be at a farm and you take some asparagus fresh out of the soil, heated by the sun. You chew into that crunchy mouthful and you know your idea of asparagus has changed for ever. You will always be searching for that quality again. That moment of realisation is magical: the world is edible. My friend Alessandro Porcelli came to me in 2009 and said: &quot;Listen Ren\u00e9, I have an idea.&quot; Cook It Raw would bring together a small group of chefs from around the world and ask them to prepare one dish each using local ingredients but with as few appliances as possible. Ideally we would cook with just our hands, a knife and some fire. That first event would coincide with the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which was being held in my home city of Copenhagen. I liked the idea straightaway. I knew it would be meaningful for these people to bring their culture, their brains into our world and to have them look at things that for us are natural and normal. To me, Cook It Raw is about collaboration, sharing ideas and using knowledge as a way of increasing innovation. I have always believed that we could move forwards faster together than alone.     David Chang foraging in Denmark. Photograph: Per-Anders J\u00f6rgensen    That first time in 2009 was one of the meals of the decade, probably one of the meals of my lifetime. There were 11 chefs in Copenhagen: I had met all of them before, though I didn&apos;t know any of them well. Sure, I had been drunk with several of them, but it was something new and intimate to spend three days together, showing them my restaurant and my favourite little part of the beach where I think the plants are most delicious. It felt like going to camp: you get on the bus and it&apos;s really exciting because you are free from your everyday responsibilities. Cook It Raw often feels like free-falling into the unknown. You have to step out of your daily routine and put yourself on the line. In a restaurant, you have a perfect set-up, everything functions as you want it. Then, for the duration of Cook It Raw, you erase that. You have to do things very differently, and maybe it will fuck up, but it is this change of routine that pushes you into new ideas and new ways of looking at things. The Cook It Raw in Copenhagen, for example, was the first time I ever served live fjord shrimp. We have done it for years now in Noma, and lots of people expect it, but that idea came out of thinking about rawness and also, &quot;What can we serve that can only happen today?&quot; One way of doing that is taking fjord shrimp, which you can only get once a day, because if you keep them longer they die. They are the way that the ocean tastes on that particular day. At Cook It Raw, I served them in a container that was closed and when people opened them they just saw these animals jumping back and forth. We often eat things that are alive, that you kill by putting in your mouth; the big difference is that you don&apos;t usually have two eyes looking at you. But it gives an amazing sense of camaraderie. &quot;Oh, she ate it, now I have to do it, too\u2026&quot; The first Cook It Raw in Copenhagen will always be special to me, but since then we have gone to Italy, Finland, Japan and Poland \u2013 all of them unique. Each event pushes you, you see new places, you meet your peers and the Cook It Raw family grows. I always tell the chefs at Noma: as a restaurant we have two feet planted in the soil here, but our minds should wander and explore everywhere. Cook It Raw is a way of doing that. Has it helped me in my endeavours? Absolutely. I wouldn&apos;t want to be without it \u2013 there&apos;s no question about that. Ben Shewry   Shewry was raised on a farm in New Zealand, and has foraged wild plants for as long as he can remember. He moved to Australia in his 20s, and has turned his Melbourne restaurant Attica into one of the best in the world. He attended Cook It Raw in Japan and Poland When we arrived at Tokyo airport, there was a media scrum, with maybe 35 journalists and photographers. I remember walking through with Ren\u00e9 Redzepi and saying: &quot;I wonder who they&apos;re waiting for?&quot; And he said: &quot;I think they&apos;re here for us, chef.&quot; It was surreal. We got on this big tour bus and a few of them chased us down the highway. At one point a car pulled alongside us and this guy with a video camera, his head and shoulders out of the window, was just filming the bus. My first Cook It Raw was a tough one, personally. Right before I was due to leave, a friend of mine, a fish wholesaler called Jason Jurie, died. I also had a touch of depression \u2013 that&apos;s probably not a word I like to say, but the truth is I was feeling really blue, and being with the guys in Japan gave me a lift. When you reach a certain level as a cook there&apos;s only so many people who understand what you go through. Being with my friends at Cook It Raw gave me the spirit to continue. Japan as a society is very structured and at times I felt like a bull in a teashop in terms of etiquette. Poland, on the other hand, was more like going home to New Zealand. For my dish, I looked to my own heritage: a Maori tradition of cooking called the hangi. Basically you dig a pit in the ground, light a huge bonfire, and when it has burned down you put food on the hot rocks, cover it with soil and leave it for about 10 hours. So we recreated this in Poland with two baby wild boars. When it came time to serve the dish, we played the Ramones song Pet Sematary and people were dancing on the tables, going nuts. Everyone was laughing and I was like: &quot;Man, we&apos;ve done this in the right country!&quot; Massimo Bottura  Bottura&apos;s Osteria Francescana in Modena has three Michelin stars and came fourth in the World&apos;s 50 Best list in 2012. He has attended the Cook It Raw events in Denmark, Italy and Finland     Massimo Bottura gets up close and personal with his catch. Photograph: Per-Anders J\u00f6rgensen    The first dish I cooked at Cook It Raw I called Pollution. Before I arrived in Copenhagen, I read a newspaper article that looked at the future state of the world&apos;s oceans. Already 90% of large fish have disappeared from our seas and some scientists believe that by 2050 the waters will be so polluted that only the prehistoric creatures \u2013 squid, monkfish, jellyfish and algae \u2013 will be left. I wanted to create a dish just from these ingredients: it would serve as both a warning, but also a reminder that chefs need to adapt as well. The finished plate looked a little murky, like a dirty riverbank, which I think was shocking to people. But whoa, when you tasted it, it stung the palate. The world is changing, and we as chefs have to change with it. That is why in my cooking I stay close to my &quot;territorio&quot;, my area. I work with social projects in Italy to clean the Po river and I passionately believe that we have to protect our agricultural schools, because they are in very bad shape, and if we don&apos;t fight we will lose them. We speak about these aspects a lot at Cook It Raw. It is fantastic to see the younger chefs so focused on those messages. They are very influential, these guys, because they are almost rock stars now. It is great fun, too. My abiding memory of the trips is sitting around a fire in Lapland, with a beer in our hands. There was Ren\u00e9, Albert Adri\u00e0 and Dave Chang and we were just laughing so hard. I thought: &quot;Oh my God, this is perfect.&quot; There was a fire in the middle, we weren&apos;t chefs, there weren&apos;t journalists \u2013 just a group of people, a group of friends.

Photograph: Erik Olsson    The beauty of Cook It Raw lies in the fact that by presenting us chefs with challenges, reducing the ingredients available to us, taking us out of our comfort zones and stripping away out egos there is a real chance of failure. With the chance of failure comes fear and this is the fear that really gets our collective creative juices flowing. In Japan, the final dinner was about to begin and I had succeeded in destroying everything I had made the day before. I didn&apos;t have any idea how to salvage my dish so I swallowed my pride and asked my fellow chefs for help. The kitchen was fired up with the spirit of the event: a bunch of chefs constantly improvising and adapting, creating and learning as they go. Professional chefs are traditionally fiercely competitive, secretive of their recipes and techniques and jealous of others. Not so with us, we have become a brotherhood.

I will also always remember the incredible trip to get from Helsinki to our final destination, with everyone together in the train all night, and all the beer and all the vodka. From the first Raw, in Copenhagen, I remember the craziness of Davide Scabin who served us raw meat in cinnamon sticks. In general, I&apos;d say that first Raw was the most important. It was at Ren\u00e9 Redzepi&apos;s home and exceptional, with a magical last night full of happiness because of this feeling that we all had done a good job, together. In Italy, at Collio, I made an apple dish that I liked and I made it again, afterwards, to serve it at El Bulli. In Finland, I tried a red and white dish that was supposed to look like deer blood in the snow, but it didn&apos;t taste that great. And in Japan, my mackerel dish was a mistake. But did we ever eat well at Umi on the last night. They opened it just for us after service. When I left that Cook It Raw, I said to myself, I have to go back there at least once before I die.

He was born in Lyon, but made his reputation in Ludlow, Shropshire, before moving to the capital in 2007. The only British-based chef invited to Cook It Raw, he has attended all five events It was at the Cook It Raw in Collio, Italy, that I drank raw blood for the first time. They slaughtered a pig in front of us, and the Italian chef Davide Scabin asked me: &quot;Have you ever tasted blood?&quot; I replied: &quot;Get lost!&quot; But he said: &quot;Go on, try it.&quot; So I had some and the flavour was just fantastic. I said: &quot;Davide, I&apos;m going to do a blood soup!&quot; So I kept the blood and made my dish with it. At Cook It Raw, you never know what to expect. We served the blood in the evening, mixed with cream and served with local cockles. You could never recreate a dish like that: you do it once and it&apos;s finished, never again.     Claude Bosi. Photograph:  /Per-Anders j\u00f6rgensen    At the first Cook It Raw in Copenhagen, I left London with some of my own produce, but I didn&apos;t use any of it when I found out what was available there \u2013 giant king crab, Danish beach herbs and flowers. That event changed my approach to cooking. I realised: &quot;Fantastic food is all around us \u2013 why are we not using it?&quot; Cook It Raw is not a holiday, it&apos;s more like doing a stage in a great restaurant. Every time you go somewhere different: you see different people, cultures and produce and different ways of thinking about cooking. I\u00f1aki Aizpitarte   Aizpitarte is one of the leading young chefs in France and runs two highly regarded restaurants in Paris, Le Chateaubriand and Le Dauphin The first thing that comes to mind when I think of the first Cook It Raw, in Copenhagen, is the couscous we ate for lunch on the last day. It had been prepared by a French chef named Bernard who&apos;d been living in Denmark for a while. It was really good, we were really hungry and as we were eating by ourselves, by the water, the sun came out. It was a perfect moment. That night, the ending of the big dinner, with everyone celebrating together, after sharing so much, was rather euphoric. And very moving. Then we all went a bit crazy.     I\u00f1aki Aizpitarte. Photograph: Per-Anders J\u00f6rgensen    The Cook It Raw I liked most was the one in Lapland. I&apos;ll always remember the day I spent with Petter Nilsson gathering all kinds of ingredients. We went in the wood, we fished. We smoked our fish. We picked herbs. Everything we put on the plate, at the end of the day, came from our efforts. That feeling of making a dish from scratch, with another chef, was fantastic. When does such a thing happen in the daily life of a cook, especially when you live in Paris? Seldom. In Italy, what I liked the most was their varieties of lettuce \u2013 there was one that looked like a rose. I have never seen anything like it elsewhere. Alessandro Porcelli Porcelli is the founder and director of Cook It Raw  I do not want to broaden Cook It Raw \u2013 you could not do it for 300 chefs; it needs to be intimate \u2013 but I do want to broaden its spirit. My hope is that in the future we will tackle more serious issues. Instead of sitting round a fire talking about football, we need to discuss how to deal with problems such as obesity.

Visits to the Yasukuni shrine \u2013 which honours 14 class-A war criminals among 2.5 million other Japanese war dead \u2013 have traditionally angered China and South Korea, which view the site as a symbol of Japanese militarism. Four ministers in the conservative administration of Shinzo Abe paid visits to the shrine, including his finance minister, Taro Aso. The separate visits, to mark the beginning of the shrine&apos;s annual spring festival, come amid tensions with China over a longstanding territorial dispute in the East China sea. Beijing did not immediately respond but South Korea said on Monday that its foreign minister, Yun Byung-se, would not be making a two-day visit to Tokyo due to begin this Friday. &quot;Amid this kind of atmosphere our stance is that it will be difficult to hold a productive discussion and Yun decided not to visit to Japan this time,&quot; an unnamed South Korean official told the Yonhap news agency. Abe did not visit the shrine but sent a decorative branch of a cypress tree as a ritual offering, with his name and title written beneath, according to media reports. China is unlikely to overlook the visit while the two rivals continue to stake rival claims to the Senkaku islands, known as the Diaoyu in China. For many in China and South Korea, visits to Yasukuni in central Tokyo are proof that Japan&apos;s modern leaders have yet to atone for their country&apos;s military misadventures on the Asian mainland in the first half of the 20th century. Despite his nationalist leanings Abe did not visit during his previous year-long premiership from 2006 to avoid inflaming opinion in Beijing and Seoul. He later said he regretted the decision and with his popularity ratings high at home speculation is mounting that he may be less willing to consider sensibilities in China and South Korea, particularly if his party wins key upper house elections in July, giving it control of both Diet chambers. Aso, who also serves as deputy prime minister, has a reputation for angering Japan&apos;s neighbours; in 2003, he praised the country&apos;s 1910-1945 colonisation of the Korean peninsula and has refused to apologise for his family firm&apos;s past use of Korean forced labourers and allied prisoners of war. Aso, a former prime minister, wants class-A war criminals &quot;delisted&quot; from Yasukuni, thereby removing the biggest obstacle to members of the imperial family resuming their annual visits. On Sunday, he bowed in the Shinto shrine&apos;s worship hall and left without speaking to reporters. The other visitors included Keiji Furuya, a state minister in charge of resolving the abduction of Japanese nationals by North Korea during the cold war. &quot;It is natural for a lawmaker to offer heartfelt condolences for spirits of the war dead who sacrificed their lives for the nation,&quot; he said. Abe visited the shrine in 2012 while leader of the then main opposition Liberal Democratic party, drawing criticism from China. In late March, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the objections over Yasukuni centred on a desire for Japan to &quot;face up to and reflect on its history of aggression and respect the feelings of people from the victimised countries, including China&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;People are allowed to incite and instigate [violence] in a co-ordinated campaign \u2013 this is the lesson taken in by others.&quot; The democracy icon and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has come under repeated fire for her silence on the issue, told students at Tokyo University last week that she was &quot;not a magician&quot; and that &quot;differences take a long time to sort out&quot;."], "tags": ["South and Central Asia", "Buddhism", "Religion", "Islam", "World news", "European Union", "Europe", "Myanmar"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-22T13:45:00Z", "title": "Video shows Burmese police standing by as Buddhists attack Muslims", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/22/burmese-police-buddhists-attack-muslims", "article": "     Video footage has emerged showing Burmese police standing by as Buddhist mobs wielding sticks and swords attack Muslims in Meikhtila \u2013 where last month more than 40 people were killed and 12,000 displaced \u2013 on the same day that the EU is expected to permanently lift all sanctions against the country. The footage, apparently shot by police officers, shows Buddhist crowds looting and ransacking a Muslim jewellery shop, cheering when Muslims are attacked, and setting fire to mosques and houses. Later, a man who has been set alight and is believed to be Muslim can be seen lying in the road, surrounded by a crowd of people. &quot;Pour water on him,&quot; a man in the crowd commands. &quot;Let him die,&quot; shouts another. &quot;No water for him.&quot; Both Buddhist monks and police can be seen through much of the footage \u2013 the monks often taking part in the violence, the police watching immobile as it progresses. The footage emerged on the day the EU is expected to permanently lift the remaining sanctions against Burma \u2013 which include travel restrictions on around 500 Burmese individuals, an asset freeze of 1,000 companies, and bans on EU investment in certain sectors such as timber and mining \u2013 in recognition of the country&apos;s &quot;remarkable process of reform&quot;. Sanctions had been suspended since April 2012, although the arms embargo remained \u2013 and is expected to remain \u2013 in place. A series of political and economic reforms have taken place in Burma since the president, Thein Sein, took office in 2011, such as the release of some political prisoners, the opening up of its economy and the easing of media restrictions. EU ambassadors last week agreed to permanently lift sanctions in order to &quot;open a new chapter in [the EU&apos;s] relations with [Burma]&quot;, according to an official document seen last week by Reuters. Full ministerial approval is expected on Monday. Yet rights groups \u2013 as well as parliamentarians for the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean), of which Burma is a member \u2013 say that permanently lifting sanctions would be a mistake. They point to EU benchmarks set out last year that were to be met if the sanctions were to be lifted completely, ranging from the unconditional release of all political prisoners to recognition of the stateless Rohingya and the end of conflict in areas such as Kachin state. &quot;International pressure has played a considerable role in encouraging reformers within the government in [Burma] to support the democratic steps we have witnessed over the past two years,&quot; said Eva Kusuma Sundari, president of the Asean Inter-Parliamentary Myanmar Caucus. &quot;A careful balance needs to be struck between encouragement and continued pressure. Permanently lifting EU sanctions now would be sending the wrong message.&quot; The new video footage also corroborates claims by Human Rights Watch (HRW) that security forces in Rakhine state, western Burma, failed to protect ethnic Rohingya Muslims in June and October last year, when 200 were killed and more than 100,000 forced to flee after intercommunal violence spread through the region. &quot;While the state security forces in some instances intervened to prevent violence and protect fleeing Muslims, more frequently they stood aside during attacks or directly supported the assailants, committing killings and other abuses,&quot; said an HRW report released on Monday. The failure to protect Burma&apos;s minority Muslims by the primarily Buddhist officials \u2013 and in some cases, the officials&apos; complicity in the crimes themselves \u2013 has directly contributed to the religious violence that has since swept through the nation, from the mobs swarming the streets in Meikhtila to the anti-Muslim &quot;969&quot; campaign promoted by the militant Buddhist monk Wirathu, HRW&apos;s Phil Robertson told Reuters. &quot;What happened in [Rakhine] has helped spark radical anti-Muslim activity,&quot; Robertson said. &quot;People are allowed to incite and instigate [violence] in a co-ordinated campaign \u2013 this is the lesson taken in by others.&quot; The democracy icon and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has come under repeated fire for her silence on the issue, told students at Tokyo University last week that she was &quot;not a magician&quot; and that &quot;differences take a long time to sort out&quot;. Meanwhile, the International Crisis Group will on Monday night present Thein Sein with its top award for peace \u2013 lauding his &quot;visionary leadership to effect profound social, economic and political changes&quot; in Burma \u2013 a move that has been derided by rights groups and analysts alike. Pro-interfaith groups and individuals promoting peace in Burma were also targeted on Monday by a group called the Myanmar Cyber Army, which shut down a number of Facebook pages and maintains a list of pages it has attacked.

The eastern theatre &quot;looks at the state of the world and asks: why?&quot; he wrote. &quot;The western theatre shrugs and says: why not?&quot; Either side of the Berlin Wall, neighbours, cousins, were up to very different things.  The world was a larger place in 1956, and cultural dividing lines were more boldly defined. West Berlin looked outside Germany for theatrical inspiration, and East Berlin looked outside of traditional dramaturgy, but they rarely looked at each other. The world is smaller now, if no less diverse, and collaborative theatre is a powerful way for different cultures to converse. Last week marked the debut of National Theatre Wales&apos;s first international collaboration, Alan Harris&apos;s new play The Opportunity of Efficiency, showing at and produced by the New National Theatre, Tokyo. It is a culmination of the &quot;why not?&quot; philosophy followed by NTW artistic director John E McGrath and the post-Fukushima &quot;why?&quot; of NNTT&apos;s artistic director Keiko Miyata, who made the invitation. But what exactly can these ambitious collaborations achieve? NNTT was building a season that invited foreign practitioners to help Japan explore its own identity and it was interested in the NTW model \u2013 a roaming theatre with no base that imbeds itself into communities for several months, attacking issues that concern the locale. There was an eye on technical lessons as well as the hope of coaxing out answers to more profound questions.  &quot;We really wanted to do something that had a Welsh spirit to it on the stage, even though it was done with Japanese actors,&quot; said McGrath when I met him in Tokyo last week, the morning after the opening night. &quot;But the story \u2013 of the discovery of a cure for radiation sickness \u2013 has a powerful resonance here in the wake of Fukushima.&quot; The Opportunity of Efficiency has a south Wales temperament, but is full of Japanese concerns about energy, globalisation and ethics. The final production is a fascinating meeting at the faultline of cultures and ideas.  There are few touchstones between the kitchen sinks of Harris&apos;s south Wales and the sheen of corporate Tokyo, but it is collaborative theatre that has created a dialogue between the two, and, quite possibly, a cultural silk road. Next year two Japanese practitioners will get the chance, through NTW&apos;s WalesLab, to travel to Wales to develop their own project. &quot;Collaboration is about widening the net of the people you work with, and the relationships you forge become ongoing ones,&quot; said Alexander Kelly, one of the artistic directors of Sheffield&apos;s Third Angel, and a veteran of international collaborative projects. &quot;You discover similar sensibilities although there are different approaches to work.&quot; This may seem obvious but conversations across borders have not always been so fluid. The NTW&apos;s partnership in Tokyo aims to try to find the answers to national questions in the work of others, to look outside. As Tokyo, a city of 30 million people, asks the theatre of Wales, a country of three million people, to help it develop their &quot;why?&quot; into a &quot;why not?&quot;, theatre reasserts its relevance without lecturing or posturing, but just by being part of the conversation."}, {"sentences": ["These latest island tensions came hard on the heels of controversy over weekend visits by Abe&apos;s cabinet colleagues and MPs to the Yasukuni shrine for Japan&apos;s war dead in Tokyo.", "Doubtless to Kim&apos;s delight, Yun Byung-se, Seoul&apos;s foreign minister, cancelled talks in Tokyo on the North Korean crisis."], "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "South Korea", "China", "Japan", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-25T14:25:55Z", "title": "Why warring 'allies' hold no terrors for North Korea | Simon Tisdall", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/25/warring-allies-no-terrors-north-korea", "article": "North Korea&apos;s ostracised leadership has little to laugh about these days, or so one might think, given the condemnation heaped on its outlawed nuclear and missile activities. But Pyongyang could be forgiven a quiet or even a loud snigger at the Crazy Gang antics of its main critics, the US, China, Japan and South Korea \u2013 who, regardless of the supposedly grave and imminent threat posed by the North, have been at each other&apos;s throats again this week. If Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, is worried about strategic encirclement by a powerful anti-Pyongyang alliance, he can rest easy; these guys can barely agree what day of the week it is, let alone a concerted policy of negotiation, containment or regime change. One bone of fierce contention is the Senkaku islands (Diaoyu to the Chinese) in the East China sea \u2013 to be exact, five islets and three rocks \u2013 that Japan controls but Beijing says are its own. This is one of many maritime disputes involving China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and others, but it is potentially the most dangerous, mainly because of numerous, provocative incursions by Chinese military vessels and planes. Japanese ultra-nationalists, encouraged by hawkish prime minister Shinzo Abe&apos;s recent landslide election victory, are busy exploiting the issue. On Tuesday, after 10 boats carrying Japanese hardliners entered the area, an unprecedented eight Chinese patrol ships hove into view. A physical collision was avoided this time, but an outright clash, deliberate or otherwise, appears inevitable on present trends. This perception has been heightened by details of an incident on 30 January, when, according to Japan&apos;s defence ministry, a Chinese frigate or destroyer activated its missile-guidance system and &quot;painted&quot; a Japanese maritime self-defence force ship with its fire-control radar \u2013 the first such contemporary &quot;lock-on&quot; incident involving the two navies. &quot;In response, the PLA [People&apos;s Liberation Army] said an investigation had concluded that no such incident had taken place,&quot; the International Institute for Strategic Studies IISS said in a briefing paper. &quot;But the Japanese defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said the radar lock-on amounted to a threat of force and violated the UN charter\u00a0\u2026 Japanese commentators asserted that the incident marked a watershed in the island dispute,&quot; Saying Chinese military officials privately admitted the incident had occurred, the IISS suggested the PLA was operating beyond the control and possibly without the knowledge of the political leadership in Beijing. It also warned that both militaries were worryingly inexperienced, that both sides had failed so far to create mechanisms to avoid an accidental conflict, and that Abe, who has authorised his ships to fire warning shots if challenged, was pursuing a highly political agenda ahead of upper house elections in July. These latest island tensions came hard on the heels of controversy over weekend visits by Abe&apos;s cabinet colleagues and MPs to the Yasukuni shrine for Japan&apos;s war dead in Tokyo. This row pitted Japan against not only China but also South Korea, its supposed comrade-in-arms against North Korea. Doubtless to Kim&apos;s delight, Yun Byung-se, Seoul&apos;s foreign minister, cancelled talks in Tokyo on the North Korean crisis. Even as these events were unfolding, General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, was valiantly maintaining after three days of talks in Beijing that the US and China were on the same page when it came to curbing North Korea&apos;s nuclear activities. But he did not sound entirely sure. &quot;They have given us an assurance that they are working on it, as we are. But I didn&apos;t gain any insights into particularly how they would do that,&quot; Dempsey said. Washington and Beijing have a lot of &quot;issues&quot;, of course. And Chinese reticence on North Korea might have something to do with Dempsey&apos;s reassertion of Washington&apos;s determination to stick up for Japan in any future maritime conflict. Even before Dempsey left, Beijing issued a statement condemning US-Japanese plans to hold joint military exercises in June off California involving the notional recapture of an isolated island. China would not be intimidated by &quot;provocative actions&quot; and &quot;foreign pressure&quot;, the foreign ministry said. Beijing also announced it was building a second aircraft carrier. Bottom line: China fears and resents American regional interference far more than it does North Korean misbehaviour. While all this was going on, meanwhile, North Korea pursued its dangerous game of cat and mouse, shuffling missiles about and potentially holding hostage 175 South Korean managers stranded at the Kaesong industrial complex just north of the border from which most South Korean workers have been expelled. Seoul&apos;s unification ministry warned on Thursday of &quot;grave measures&quot; unless the impasse was resolved, without saying what that might entail.

The US, the UK, France and Israel all say there is evidence pointing to the use of the nerve agent sarin in Syria. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said the US was looking into two cases, but did not specify where. British officials talk about three incidents in particular, at Khan al-Assal near Aleppo, in Homs and near Damascus. All the allegations involve relatively small-scale attacks, with the numbers of alleged victims in the dozens at most rather than hundreds. Rebel groups have made several claims over the course of the two-year conflict that the regime has used chemicals against its fighters and civilians. On 19 March both the Assad regime and the rebels claimed nerve gas had been used against their forces at Khan al-Assal. British officials say Syrian army troops appear to have been affected in that incident but suggest it was either a case of &quot;friendly fire&quot;, a projectile going astray or a deliberate attempt to implicate the rebels. What is sarin? It is a manmade chemical compound similar to organophosphate pesticides but much more toxic. It was first developed as a pesticide in Germany in 1938. It is a colourless, odourless liquid that easily evaporates as a vapour. Exposure leads to muscle spasms, heavy sweating, and ultimately respiratory failure and death. It is believed to have been used in the Iran-Iraq war in the 80s, possibly in the attack by Saddam Hussein&apos;s regime against the Iraqi Kurds in Halabja in 1988, and in attacks on the Tokyo metro in March 1995 by the Aum Shinryko cult, in which 13 people died. How strong is the evidence that it has been used in Syria? There appear to be two types of evidence: physical samples, of soil from the scene of the alleged attacks and possibly human tissue samples too; and videos, photographs and witness accounts. The letter issued by the White House to two senators on Thursday makes it clear the evidence is far from conclusive. There are questions over the &quot;chain of custody&quot; of the physical evidence \u2013 ie the US analysts cannot guarantee the provenance of the samples they have been given because they were collected and handed over by someone else, either another government or an opposition faction. According to a report by the McClatchy news agency in the US, the soil sample examined by American experts is minuscule and contains a byproduct of sarin that could also be from fertiliser production. Some of the videos in circulation online show alleged victims foaming at the mouth, but that is not listed as a sarin symptom on the website of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Richard Guthrie, a British chemical weapons expert and former head of the Chemical and Biological Warfare Project of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said: &quot;That [foaming at the mouth] would not be indicative of use of nerve agents but is more likely to be a sign of a choking agent such as phosgene being used, if anything were used. Phosgene is a widely used industrial chemical as well as being a first world war-era chemical weapon.&quot; Jean-Pascal Zanders, an expert at the EU Institute for Strategic Studies, said: &quot;It&apos;s not possible that what is being shown to the public is a chemical weapons attack. The video from Aleppo showing foaming at the mouth does not look like a nerve agent. I&apos;m wholly unconvinced.&quot; Will we ever know for sure whether this was a sarin or other chemical attack? Possibly. The UN has launched an investigation in co-operation with the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the world&apos;s experts on the subject. However, because of disagreements with the Syrian government, some of the investigators are still in Cyprus waiting for a green light to travel, and some have returned to their home countries. The investigators are due to interview and possibly take samples from victims in refugee camps, and to examine samples taken by the UK and France, but it is unclear when that would happen. OPCW protocols for judging whether a chemical weapon has been used are very strict. Its own investigators would have to have taken the specimen in tightly controlled circumstances, the chain of custody would have to be strictly monitored and the laboratories doing the analysis would have to OPCW-certified. It appears unlikely that the evidence now in the hands of western states would pass that threshold. Guthrie said blood and tissue samples from victims might still provide solid evidence as it was harder to fake the chemical metabolites left in the body as a result of sarin exposure than to spike a soil sample with sarin itself. Nobody expects a result from the UN inquiry any time soon. If sarin or another chemical weapon is proved to have been used, will that cross the &quot;red line&quot; laid down by Barack Obama and trigger military action? The White House letter makes it clear that the current evidence falls below the US administration&apos;s standard of proof. Even if proof is found, the scale of the use may be a factor. When Obama originally laid down his &quot;red line&quot; he said it could come into effect if &quot;a whole bunch&quot; of chemical weapons were moved or used. The very limited nature of the recorded incidents, if proved to involve chemical weapons, may mean that Damascus is testing the boundaries of what is acceptable to Washington, or it may signify that chemical weapons have been used inadvertently by local commanders. In the Iran-Iraq war, Guthrie said, artillery commanders sometimes used chemical rounds by mistake because they were not clearly marked. Furthermore, Obama is not saying explicitly that the US would take unilateral action. The first step is likely to be to go to the UN security council once more and to try to persuade Russia and China to back punitive action against the Syrian government. Pressure on the Obama administration to take some kind of action will mount if the evidence strengthens, but that may take a considerable length of time, if it ever happens at all."}, {"sentences": ["I&apos;m wholly unconvinced.&quot; Some press reports of the sarin attack on the Tokyo metro system in March 1995 do refer to some victims foaming at the mouth."], "tags": ["Syria", "US news", "US foreign policy", "US politics", "John Kerry", "Human rights", "Law", "Obama administration", "US Congress", "Chemical weapons"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-26T17:21:00Z", "title": "US ponders Syria options but urges caution over chemical weapons claims", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/26/us-options-syria-chemical-weapons-claims", "article": "The US is considering a range of military responses to alleged evidence of chemical weapons use by Syria but remains cautious about significant intervention. Congressmen briefed by secretary of state John Kerry on Friday in Washington say the most likely option Kerry outlined would involve joining other countries in arming specific rebel groups. The imposition of a no-fly zone is also being considered but is deemed unattractive by the administration because chemical weapons do not require aircraft to be used \u2013\u00a0and because the high quality of Syrian air defences would put US lives at risk. There was also discussion of special forces use and specially designed ordnance designed to safely incinerate chemical weapons facilities, but there was scepticism that either would address the problem, which is thought to be widely dispersed. Kerry briefly took questions from politicians in the House of Representatives, but there has been a marked stepping down of rhetoric on Capitol Hill, even among more hawkish members of Congress. &quot;There was about as much appetite in the room for getting involved as I have when I leave an all-you-can-eat restaurant,&quot; said Brad Sherman of California, who has previously sponsored a bill calling on Obama to arm rebels with anti-aircraft weapons. Other congressmen who discussed the briefing afterwards with reporters said they had more confidence now that the evidence pointing to chemical weapons use was strong, but not conclusive. &quot;There is enough evidence to pass muster in a civil court, but I can&apos;t say it has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt,&quot; added Sherman. It remains unclear whether the US has independently established a clear &quot;chain of custody&quot; for soil samples and other evidence pointing to chemical use that may have been passed on by rebel groups. White House spokesman Jay Carney said there was still work to be done before weighing US options. &quot;We need to assess the credibility of the evidence before we take decisions on what action to take.&quot; On Thursday, the White House and other top Obama administration officials said that US intelligence had concluded with &quot;varying degrees of confidence&quot; that the Syrian government has twice used chemical weapons in its civil war. Two Syrian officials denied on Friday that government forces had used chemical weapons against rebels. In the Syrian capital, a government official said President Bashar al-Assad&apos;s military &quot;did not and will not use chemical weapons, even if it had them&quot;. The official instead accused opposition forces of using them in a March attack on the village of Khan al-Assad outside of the northern city of Aleppo. Both sides have accused each other of the deadly attack. British prime minister David Cameron described the evidence of chemical weapons use as &quot;limited but growing&quot; and played down any suggestion British troops could be deployed in Syria as a consequence, saying only that itrepresented a red line\u00a0for the international community &quot;to do more&quot;. Speaking to the BBC, the prime minister echoed the White House&apos;s caution over the evidence so far, saying the UK government would not to make the mistake of &quot;rushing into print&quot; and would work to verify the evidence with its allies. &quot;It is very disturbing what we are seeing. It&apos;s limited evidence, but there&apos;s growing evidence that we have seen of the use of chemical weapons, probably by the regime,&quot; Cameron said. &quot;It is extremely serious. This is a war crime and we should take it very seriously.&quot; He also stopped well short of suggesting that confirmation of chemical weapons use would necessarily be a trigger for military action. &quot;I think what President Obama said was absolutely right \u2013 that this should form for the international community a red line for us to do more.&quot; There has been speculation that western special forces could be sent in to secure chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria, but Cameron said he could not envisage British troops on the ground. &quot;I don&apos;t want to see that, and I don&apos;t think that is likely to happen, but I think we can step up the pressure on the regime, work with our partners, work with the opposition in order to bring about the right outcome,&quot; he said. British officials say there is evidence of sarin use in at least three incidents: at Khan al-Assal, in Homs and near Damascus. In the Khan al-Assal incident on March 19, the Syrian government and the rebels claimed that chemical agents had been used against them. British officials say that Syrian army troops appear to have been affected in that incident but suggest it was either case of &quot;friendly fire&quot;, a projectile going astray, or a deliberate attempt to implicate the rebels. Chemical weapons experts have mostly reacted with caution over the claims. Referring to video footage purported to show victims foaming at the mouth, Richard Guthrie, a British chemical weapons expert and former head of the Chemical and Biological Warfare Project of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), said: &quot;That would not be indicative of use of nerve agents, but is more likely to be a sign of a choking agent such as phosgene being used, if anything were used.&quot; Jean-Pascal Zanders, another expert at the EU Institute for Strategic Studies said: &quot;It&apos;s not possible that what is being shown to the public is a chemical weapons attack. The video from Aleppo showing foaming at the mouth does not look like a nerve agent. I&apos;m wholly unconvinced.&quot; Some press reports of the sarin attack on the Tokyo metro system in March 1995 do refer to some victims foaming at the mouth. Experts also said that evidence in the form of physical samples, of soil or human tissue, would be of little use without a clear &quot;chain of custody&quot; between the site of an alleged attack at the laboratory where it was analysed. According to a report by McClatchy in the US, the soil sample examined by American experts is &quot;minuscule&quot; and contains a byproduct of sarin that could also be a byproduct of fertiliser production.

Speaking at the White House, Obama said that confirmation Bashar al-Assad had deployed chemical agents in the protracted Syrian civil war would alter his administration&apos;s &quot;calculus&quot;, but stopped short of declaring that a &quot;red line&quot; had been crossed. Obama&apos;s cautious comments reflected the lack of a consensus in Washington over how to respond to claims that Syria has used sarin gas in recent incidents. US congressmen briefed by secretary of state John Kerry on Friday said the most likely option would involve joining other countries in arming specific rebel groups. Sitting alongside King Abdullah of Jordan at the White House, Obama said that the international community &quot;could not stand by and permit the systematic use of weapons like chemical weapons on civilian populations&quot;. But he left open the possibility that their use in Syria would not be proved: &quot;I think that, in many ways, a line has been crossed when we see tens of thousands of innocent people being killed by a regime. &quot;But the use of chemical weapons and the dangers that poses to the international community, to neighbors of Syria, the potential for chemical weapons to get into the hands of terrorists \u2013 all of those things add increased urgency to what is already a significant security problem and humanitarian problem in the region.&quot; On Thursday, the White House said that US intelligence had concluded with &quot;varying degrees of confidence&quot; that the Syrian government has twice used chemical weapons. British officials say there is evidence of sarin use in at least three incidents in Khan al-Assal near Aleppo, in Homs and near Damascus. In London, the British prime minister David Cameron described the evidence of chemical weapons use as &quot;limited but growing&quot;, and played down any suggestion British troops could be deployed in Syria as a consequence, saying only that it represented a red line for the international community &quot;to do more&quot;. Speaking to the BBC, Cameron echoed the White House&apos;s caution over the evidence so far, saying the UK government would not make the mistake of &quot;rushing into print&quot; and would work to verify the evidence with its allies. &quot;It is very disturbing what we are seeing. It&apos;s limited evidence but there&apos;s growing evidence that we have seen too of the use of chemical weapons, probably by the regime,&quot; Cameron said. &quot;It is extremely serious \u2013 this is a war crime \u2013 and we should take it very seriously.&quot; He also stopped well short of suggesting that confirmation of chemical weapons use would necessarily trigger military action. &quot;I think what President Obama said was absolutely right \u2013 that this should form for the international community a red line for us to do more.&quot; There has been speculation that western special forces could be sent in to secure chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria, but Cameron said he could not envisage British troops on the ground. &quot;I don&apos;t want to see that and I don&apos;t think that is likely to happen, but I think we can step up the pressure on the regime, work with our partners, work with the opposition in order to bring about the right outcome,&quot; he said. Asked if he was concerned the invasion of Iraq in 2003 \u2013 which toppled Saddam Hussein \u2013 was having an impact on the way in which western leaders were dealing with the conflict in Syria, Cameron told the BBC: &quot;I do worry about that.&quot; He added: &quot;Let me be absolutely clear. I think the Iraq lesson must be about how we marshal and use information and intelligence and I think that lesson has been learned but I think it is very important for politicians and leaders of this generation to look at what is happening in Syria and ask ourselves what more we can do.&quot; In the Khan al-Assal incident on 19 March, the Syrian government and the rebels claimed that chemical agents had been used against them. British officials say that Syrian army troops appear to have been affected in that incident but suggest it was either case of &quot;friendly fire&quot;, a projectile going astray, or a deliberate attempt to implicate the rebels. Chemical weapons experts have mostly reacted with caution over the claims. Referring to video footage purported to show victims foaming at the mouth, Richard Guthrie, a British chemical weapons expert and former head of the Chemical and Biological Warfare Project of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), said: &quot;That would not be indicative of use of nerve agents, but is more likely to be a sign of a choking agent such as phosgene being used, if anything were used.&quot; Jean-Pascal Zanders, another expert at the EU Institute for Strategic Studies said: &quot;It&apos;s not possible that what is being shown to the public is a chemical weapons attack. The video from Aleppo showing foaming at the mouth does not look like a nerve agent. I&apos;m wholly unconvinced.&quot; Some press reports of the sarin attack on the Tokyo metro system in March 1995 do refer to some victims foaming at the mouth. Experts also said that evidence in the form of physical samples, of soil or human tissue, would be of little use without a clear &quot;chain of custody&quot; between the site of an alleged attack at the laboratory where it was analysed. According to a report by McClatchy in the US, the soil sample examined by American experts is &quot;minuscule&quot; and contains a byproduct of sarin that could also be a byproduct of fertiliser production. The UN has launched an investigation in cooperation with the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the world&apos;s experts on the subject. However, because of disagreements with the Syrian government, some of the investigators are still in Cyprus waiting for a green light, and some have returned to their home countries. In Washington, Kerry briefly took questions from politicians in the House of Representatives, but there has been a marked stepping down of rhetoric on Capitol Hill even among more hawkish members. &quot;There was about as much appetite in the room for getting involved as I have when I leave an all-you-can-eat restaurant,&quot; said Brad Sherman of California, who has previously sponsored a bill calling on Obama to arm rebels with anti-aircraft weapons. Other Congressmen who spoke to reporters after said they had more confidence now that the evidence pointing to chemical weapons use was strong, but not conclusive. &quot;There is enough evidence to pass muster in a civil court but I can&apos;t say it has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt,&quot; added Sherman.

He has opinions on everything, and he hurls them at\u00a0you so enthusiastically, so ferociously, that before long you feel battered. Within seconds, he\u00a0has taken me on a global tour of his favourite cities. New York? &quot;It&apos;s become so gentrified that it&apos;s lacking in soul.&quot; London? &quot;The most gloriously eclectic city in the world.&quot; Tokyo? &quot;Everyone&apos;s beautiful, everything&apos;s futuristic, but\u00a0it&apos;s ethnically homogeneous.&quot; Then he&apos;s on to his theory about why London has\u00a0such a thriving indie arts scene (because the mainstream is so establishment), why Mo Farah represents all that&apos;s great about Britain, the impact of cuts in arts funding for disadvantaged inner-city kids\u2026 He&apos;s talked for seven minutes solid, and is almost hoarse. &quot;I&apos;m obsessed with cities and spotting patterns,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s what most of my first album is about.&quot; The actor and rapper has a fascinating background, almost as rich and diverse as London\u00a0itself. He\u00a0was born into an upwardly mobile Pakistani family (his father was a shipping broker)\u00a0and won a scholarship to the public school Merchant Taylors&apos;, where he felt he didn&apos;t belong, before eventually making it his own. Then he went on to Oxford University to study philosophy, politics and economics, and felt even\u00a0more strongly that he didn&apos;t belong, though again he made his mark. After Oxford, he studied acting at Central School of Speech &amp; Drama in London, and by 23 he had made his film debut in\u00a0The Road To Guant\u00e1namo, about the Tipton Three. At the same time, he was developing a\u00a0following as the rapper Riz MC. The Chris Morris\u00a0terrorist spoof Four Lions brought him to mainstream attention in 2009, and two years later\u00a0he released his first album, MICroscope. The Reluctant Fundamentalist, directed by the great Indian director Mira Nair, is his 10th film. Ahmed still drives a battered old car, but at 30 he is a movie star, straddling different worlds, reshaping them in his own fashion. As for his private life, you sense that it is on hold at the moment \u2013 no girlfriend, lives with his brother in south London, forever working. The Reluctant Fundamentalist is an adaptation of Mohsin Hamid&apos;s taut existential thriller. Ahmed is on screen virtually throughout as Changez, a super-smart Wall Street analyst from Lahore who is desperate to assimilate in the cut-throat world of New York finance. And he does \u2013 until 9/11, when his colleagues and American girlfriend start to regard him with suspicion, which leads him to reappraise his own identity. We meet at the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank in London. I&apos;d asked him to choose a place that meant something to him, expecting him to opt for something closer to his childhood home in\u00a0Wembley, or where he lives now. I&apos;m disappointed he&apos;s chosen the South Bank \u2013 it seems like a rather obvious and actorly way of deflecting from the personal. But he insists it isn&apos;t: this is where he was an emerging artist-in-residence for two years; where he met all sorts of new people and began to experiment creatively. &quot;I&apos;m a big believer in follow a passion, throw shit at the wall and unexpected connections will appear.&quot; We head off to the Wagamama noodle bar, which is so loud we can hardly hear each other. &quot;Shit,&quot; he\u00a0says. &quot;I didn&apos;t really think this through.&quot; I&apos;m not so sure, though. The conspiracy theorist in me thinks he might have chosen it deliberately. He&apos;s made it obvious in the past that he doesn&apos;t enjoy interviews, and hates the way that journalists pigeonhole. This isn&apos;t the first time I&apos;ve met Ahmed. Over the past year, he&apos;s popped up a couple of times in unexpected places. One day I found myself sitting next to him in the morning conference at the Guardian \u2013 he\u00a0was developing a project about journalism. Another time he was observing a drop-in for destitute asylum seekers at which I volunteer \u2013 he\u00a0was researching a story on asylum. When observing, he&apos;s quiet and discreet. He\u00a0has\u00a0a facility for slipping into places, becoming\u00a0part of the furniture, absorbing the experience of others. This is what makes him such a fine actor. He has an ability to disappear into roles, and can play pretty much anything: posh/working class, naturalistic/over the top, any\u00a0number of nationalities. He is small, lean and handsome, with something of the chameleon about him \u2013 catch him at different angles, and you could be looking at\u00a0different people.     Ahmed in The Reluctant Fundamentalist: \u2018It was the first time I\u00a0read a book and thought I love something so much I\u2019m going to find out who\u2019s got the rights\u2019    We are eating ramen and he&apos;s talking about school, where he was naughty, clever, hard-working, angry and a little bit militant. What was the worst thing he did? &quot;When I\u00a0was 11, I put a\u00a0chair through the window in the classroom.&quot; That is hardcore, I say. &quot;I didn&apos;t mean to. I\u00a0meant to throw it at somebody.&quot; What was his punishment? &quot;I got Saturday detention.&quot; Blimey, he got off lightly. &quot;My form teacher loved me.&quot; He\u00a0smiles. When he first started, he says, he experienced bigotry and racism. Yet there was also\u00a0something brilliant about the school. &quot;I had a teacher there called Mr Roseblade and\u00a0I\u00a0looked up to him as a kind of rock star. He&apos;d\u00a0teach us Ginsberg and stuff, and he spoke Punjabi as well.&quot; Was he Asian? &quot;No,\u00a0he was a\u00a0Jewish guy from Wolverhampton. The seven years I\u00a0was there was almost a metaphor for how Britain was changing. When I started, it was double-barrelled surnames, sons of diplomats and kids wearing rugby shirts, and in my time it became more Jewish and more Asian. The transition was painful.&quot; For whom? &quot;For the school.&quot; He\u00a0talks about sixth form and how the junior common room was all-white, so he decided to do something about it. &quot;There were kids in the sixth form, prefects, who we knew were Combat 18, and we were like, &apos;What the fuck?&apos; There were no Asian kids in the JCR\u2026&quot; Junior common room? &quot;Exactly. They said it was a democratic process to elect the head boy, and the whole year group had to select the five people they wanted to vote for.&quot; But Ahmed thought it was a farce, because the\u00a0teachers would blackball any candidate they\u00a0considered unsuitable. &quot;So I got everyone together in the common room and said, &apos;That&apos;s\u00a0bullshit: the school has changed, but the establishment at the school hasn&apos;t.&apos; And I said, &apos;What we&apos;re going to do is, we&apos;re all going to vote for the same five people; they&apos;re all going to be black and Asian, and they&apos;ve all been suspended, right! And we&apos;re going to see if there&apos;s really a\u00a0democracy.&apos; They were all people the teachers wanted to blackball. So there was a big hoo-ha \u2013 &apos;Rizwan rigged the\u00a0JCR election&apos; \u2013 and we exposed them for just picking their puppets. We ended up getting a few\u00a0people into the JCR. And by my last day at school, there was the first ever Asian head boy.&quot; (After our interview, Ahmed gets in touch to ask me not to be too harsh on the school \u2013 it was extremely supportive when the family had financial problems.) Next he took on the Oxford establishment. &quot;The default social circuit over there is a black-tie thing, which I wasn&apos;t familiar with. That was a culture shock. I was out of my comfort zone, viewed with suspicion, then it falls to you to say, &apos;OK, what are you going to do about it?&apos; Those experiences really defined me in terms of embracing your outsider status, and clawing your\u00a0way to insider status.&quot;            So what did he do about it? &quot;I\u00a0started this club night and I honed my MC skills, and tried to change that culture and landscape of Oxford a bit. By the time I left, it was one of the biggest club nights, and when I started there wasn&apos;t anything like it. Again, it reinforced that message \u2013 just unapologetically do your own thing. Zadie Smith says, &apos;Where I want to be in my writing is to take words like British and woman and black, and just stretch them big enough so I can live inside them.&apos; That&apos;s interesting.&quot; He comes to a sudden stop, as if he&apos;s just remembered he left his front door open. &quot;We should talk about the film, man. Amazing book, isn&apos;t it? It was the first time I read a book and thought I love something so much I&apos;m going to pick up the phone and find out who&apos;s got the rights.&quot; Why was he so keen to play Changez? &quot;What I\u00a0can relate to is growing up between classes and cultures. But for Changez it&apos;s even more extreme than it was for me. He\u00a0wants to shed his complexity to fit in. I realised late in my adolescence that you&apos;ve got to embrace that confusion as an artist. It can lead you to being the odd one out, but that&apos;s amazing.&quot; Now he likes to mix up his life as much as possible. &quot;Researching a film about politics, I&apos;ll be sat around with all these people from some guild in the City of London, and then that night I&apos;ll go and do a set in Peckham, say. That&apos;s my job. I have to cultivate those different things.&quot; He mentions the video for his first single, Post\u00a09/11 Blues, which was released in 2006 and originally banned from the radio. He says what he\u00a0loves about that video is it combined so many of his interests: acting, music, writing, collaborating. Post 9/11 Blues is a witty rap about how the bombing of the twin towers by al-Qaida had resulted in him being stereotyped and harassed, but had at least made him employable as\u00a0an actor (&quot;We&apos;re all suspects so, literally, be watching your back/I farted and got arrested for a\u00a0chemical attack&quot;). I ask if 9/11 was important in shaping his identity, and he recoils. &quot;How did we get to that?\u00a0How did we get to that? Wow! Wow! That was clunky!&quot; He really does sound shocked. And\u00a0now I&apos;m shocked that he&apos;s shocked. Because you were talking about your song, Post 9/11 Blues, I say. &quot;How&apos;s it shaped my life more than yours or anybody else&apos;s?&quot; he asks. Well, I\u00a0say, it&apos;s defined all our lives to some extent, but probably yours more than mine because you&apos;re a\u00a0Muslim; because much of your best-known work is about 9/11; because you\u00a0and your co-stars were detained under the prevention of terrorism act at Luton airport when you returned from The Road To Guant\u00e1namo&apos;s premiere in Berlin (where it had just won the prestigious Silver Bear); because you wrote a song called Post 9/11 Blues\u2026 I quote the song at him, inaccurately, and he instantly raps the correct version back at me. &quot;Shave your beard if you&apos;re brown, and you best salute the crown, or they&apos;ll do you like Brazilians and shoot your arse down.&quot; Exactly, I say: you rap\u00a0Post 9/11 Blues as if it was your life story. He shakes his head. &quot;Well, that song&apos;s a satire \u2013 it&apos;s not a personal song. That song&apos;s a generational thing about the post-9/11 circus of fear.&quot; Now I\u00a0quote a couple of lines at him: &quot;Post 9/11 I been getting paid, playing terrorists on telly, getting songs made.&quot; How can that not be personal, I ask. &quot;It is. But it&apos;s very tongue in cheek. It&apos;s\u00a0not a heart-on-sleeve confession\u2026 Listen, 9/11&apos;s been the most dominant narrative of the 21st century so far. And,\u00a0of course, it relates to me differently from how it might relate to you,&quot; he concedes. &quot;I&apos;m\u00a0not in a position to shape narratives, but what I can do, and what I&apos;m privileged and proud to have\u00a0done, is engage with it and not allow it to define me. Bandwagons roll through our lives. It&apos;s\u00a0up to you whether you jump on them unquestioningly or jump on them to overturn them and subvert them. I\u00a0feel privileged that I\u00a0have been part of projects that have overturned assumptions in that narrative.&quot;     Riz Ahmed in The Road To Guantanamo. Photograph: Capital Pictures    It&apos;s true his 9/11-related work has been diverse in\u00a0style and perspective: from the docudrama The\u00a0Road To Guant\u00e1namo, in which he played one of the Tipton Three, imprisoned without trial; to the Chris Morris terrorist farce Four Lions, in which he plays a would-be jihadi; to the MI5 agent who rejects his militant sister in Peter Kosminsky&apos;s TV drama Britz; and now The Reluctant Fundamentalist. I&apos;m curious whether he went looking for such roles, or directors sought him out. &quot;Most of my work hasn&apos;t been tied into that narrative,&quot; he says a little huffily. Does he bristle when people like me say it has? &quot;Well, you&apos;ve only watched two of my fucking films!&quot; I think by now we might be shouting \u2013 partly because there&apos;s no other way to hear each other. There is a woman next to us with a baby, and she leans over. &quot;I thought Shifty was really good,&quot; she\u00a0says. She&apos;s right \u2013 Shifty, which has absolutely nothing to do with 9/11 and in which Ahmed plays a drug dealer \u2013 is great. He grins. &quot;That&apos;s brilliant, you jumping in there. Listen, if he starts bullying me, you can knock him out.&quot; &quot;You sound like you can handle him on your own \u2013 don&apos;t worry,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;ll knock if I need some back-up,&quot; he says. I&apos;ve seen more than two of your films, I say. I\u00a0feel as if they&apos;re ganging up on me now. &quot;I was joking, bro. But you&apos;ve cherrypicked the projects to fit the preconceived lines of your interview. Listen, it&apos;s a human thing to do. You impose patterns on reality. People need to make sense of people. It can be convenient to put me here or there, and that&apos;s fine \u2013 it&apos;s been happening to me my whole life.&quot; Look, I say, I&apos;m not putting you in a box, but casting directors might be. Being a Muslim actor today reminds me of being a black actor 20\u00a0years ago, when every role was defined by their blackness. He instantly cites all the movies he&apos;s made that contradict this theory \u2013 Trishna (Michael Winterbottom&apos;s take on Tess Of The D&apos;Urbervilles), Plan B&apos;s directing debut Ill Manors, the forthcoming thriller Closed Circuit, to name but three. &quot;I think you&apos;re a little bit behind the curve, though, if I&apos;m honest. This is how I think it works. First, you have stereotypes, and that will be the black drug dealer, the east Asian kung fu master, the Middle Eastern terrorist in True Lies. Then you have stuff that takes place on culturally specific terrain, that engages with it, but actually subverts assumptions. Smashes stereotypes. That&apos;s where I&apos;ve come into the game.&quot; I try to say something, but he won&apos;t allow interruptions at this point. &quot;That&apos;s Road To Guant\u00e1namo, that&apos;s Four Lions, that&apos;s Britz, that&apos;s The Reluctant Fundamentalist. That doesn&apos;t make me bristle \u2013 I feel fucking proud of that. You can&apos;t just jump from stereotypes to brown James Bond. You need Spike Lee and Denzel Washington doing their thing on a specific territory before you can be Will Smith. I&apos;m proud and privileged to have been part of that, to have been one of the leading voices\u2026 Then the third stage is you&apos;re just a guy. And you look at my career, man \u2013 where I&apos;ve come in is the back end of stage two and the start of stage three, and that&apos;s where I&apos;m at.&quot; He talks about Four Lions, in which hopeless suicide bombers target the London Marathon. &quot;You can&apos;t look at a bungled terror headline without thinking of Four Lions now.

The warning that much of the nation&apos;s coal reserves will become worthless as the world hits carbon emission limits comes after banking giant Citi also warned Australian investors that fossil fuel companies could do little to avoid the future loss of value. Australia is already the globe&apos;s biggest coal exporter and &quot;mega-mine&quot; plans in Queensland for more extraction are identified as the world&apos;s second biggest &quot;carbon bomb&quot; threatening runaway global warming. &quot;Investments in Australian coal rest on a speculative bubble of climate denial, indifference or dreaming,&quot; said John Connor, one of the new report&apos;s authors and CEO of The Climate Institute, an independent research organisation based in Sydney. &quot;Investors, governments and even some coal companies say they take climate change seriously, but this report shows they do not or are taking risky gambles.&quot; James Leaton, at thinktank Carbon Tracker and also another of the report&apos;s authors, said: &quot;Investors need to challenge the assumption that coal demand will continue to rise in China and elsewhere, otherwise billions of dollars of taxpayer, superannuation and shareholder funds will be wasted in assets linked to unburnable carbon.&quot; Carbon Tracker&apos;s recent global report found that at least two-thirds of existing fossil fuel reserves will have to remain underground if the world is to meet existing internationally agreed targets to avoid the threshold for &quot;dangerous&quot; climate change. The new report shows Australian coal reserves owned by listed companies alone are equivalent to 25% of the global carbon budget for the fuel to 2050. However, far from cutting back on exploration for new coal reserves, Australian listed companies spent AU$6bn on developing new deposits. If only half of potential future reserves were exploited, Australian coal would use up 75% of the global carbon budget for the fuel. Earlier in April, Citi banking group issued a warning to investors in fossil fuel companies. &quot;We see limited potential for engagement to alter the outcome in this case,&quot; concluded its report. &quot;If the unburnable carbon [scenario] does occur \u2013 even with carbon capture and storage technology \u2013 it is difficult to see how the value of fossil fuel reserves can be maintained.&quot; Leaton said China has indicated its coal use will peak in the next five years, but that this had not been priced by markets. &quot;I don&apos;t know why the market does not believe China. When it says it is going to do something, it usually does.&quot; Yet Australia is banking on selling coal to China: &quot;That doesn&apos;t add up.&quot; The report, called &quot;Australia&apos;s carbon bubble&quot;, also warns that the nation&apos;s politicians will have little control over events: &quot;Tokyo and London have high exposure to Australian proven coal reserves. The decisions in overseas markets that will leave Australian assets stranded are beyond any Australian political control.&quot; It also warned that as coal prices fell in future, Australia&apos;s high costs of production leave its coal less competitive. A separate report, also published on Monday, highlighted the opportunities available to Australia in joining other nations with big energy resources in transforming to a low-carbon economy. &quot;There are a lot of opportunities for Australia but the world is changing quickly and we need to be prepared,&quot; said Prof Tim Flannery, of the independent Climate Commission. &quot;We are the 15th largest emitter in the world, larger than 180 other countries. We are more influential than most of us think.&quot; &quot;China is accelerating action. After years of strong growth in coal use, this has begun to level off. They have an impressive array of [climate] actions that will drive global momentum in the future,&quot; he said. &quot;Renewable energy is surging globally with solar PV capacity increasing 42% and wind 21% in just one year. With so much global momentum this is clearly the beginning of the clean energy era.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The composer, who turned 70 at the beginning of this year, may have teased us with the occasional soundtrack or live album, but it&apos;s still a thrill to hear his first new music since 1989&apos;s Tokyo Rose."], "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Culture", "Van Dyke Parks"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-29T15:21:34Z", "title": "Van Dyke Parks: Songs Cycled \u2013 exclusive album stream", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/apr/29/van-dyke-parks-songs-cycled-album-stream", "article": "It&apos;s been 24 years since Van Dyke Parks last released an album of new material.

El Celler de Can Roca, in Catalonia in north-eastern Spain, was voted the world&apos;s best restaurant in a poll coordinated by Restaurant magazine, displacing the experimental eatery Noma in Copenhagen, which had held the title for the past three years and was pushed into second. The winner, which calls itself &quot;a freestyle restaurant committed to the avant garde&quot;, was opened by brothers Joan and Josep Roca in 1986, in a plot next to their parents&apos; bar. They were joined by brother Jordi in 1997, two years after their restaurant won its first Michelin star (it now has three). The brothers \u2013 Joan is head chef, Jordi head pastry chef and Josep the sommelier \u2013 say they learned their passion for food from the aromas of their mother&apos;s stews, &quot;generously, simply and honestly prepared&quot;, but their cooking has developed beyond simple Catalonian recipes to embrace cutting edge techniques. Their victory means that Spain&apos;s coastal region north of Barcelona has regained its reputation as the world&apos;s most exceptional place to eat \u2013 the new winner is just 50km from the site of El Bulli, Ferran Adria&apos;s legendary eatery which topped the list for four years, but has since closed. In total, Spain has five restaurants in the top 50, beaten only by the US and France, both of which have six (though the highest placed French restaurant, L&apos;Arpege in Paris, can manage no higher than 16th). Three British establishments make the rankings, the best-placed of which is Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, based at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in central London, which rose two places to seventh. The Ledbury in Notting Hill, run by Australian chef Brett Graham, also went one place better than last year, at 13th. But Blumethal&apos;s better known restaurant, the Fat Duck in Bray, experienced what might, by its standards, be seen as a slump: named the world&apos;s best restaurant in 2005 and runner up to El Bulli for the next four years, it has fallen 20 places in the past year to 33rd place. Blumenthal was relaxed insisting that the Fat Duck was &quot;in a different league \u2013 its 50 to 100% better&quot; than when it held the title: &quot;I said at the time we were number one that you can&apos;t really have a number one restaurant, because there are so many great chefs that aren&apos;t even in the top 100. &quot;The awards are looking at where you are in the minute, what&apos;s the mood at the time.

The awards are based on the votes of 900 leading chefs, restaurateurs, food critics and gastronomes from 26 regions around the world. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 April 2013 because El Celler de Can Roca is in Catalonia, not Galicia as the original said."}, {"sentences": ["So far, there are five shows: two hometown gigs in Athens, Georgia, a concert in Asheville, North Carolina, and performances in Taipei and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Music", "Indie", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-30T10:34:29Z", "title": "Neutral Milk Hotel reunite with classic lineup", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/30/neutral-milk-hotel-reunite-classic-lineup", "article": "The classic lineup of Neutral Milk Hotel will reunite for concerts in the US, Taiwan and Japan.

Mangum&apos;s plaintive voice is not for everyone, and his vivid lyrics \u2013 full of sex, death and Anne Frank \u2013 aren&apos;t likely to ring out on The X Factor. In fact, the album spent years out of print in the UK. But the combination of Mangum&apos;s songwriting and the band&apos;s crashing psychedelic folk turned In the Aeroplane Over the Sea into a cult hit, ranked fourth in a Pitchfork poll of the best albums of all time. Mangum all but disappeared after Neutral Milk Hotel dissolved. A decade went by before he played another concert, in Brooklyn in December 2010. He has since performed on a handful of solo tours, including gigs at the Coachella festival and Occupy New York, and curated one of last year&apos;s All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties festivals in Minehead. In all of the concerts, Mangum played old material almost exclusively: in almost 15 years, he has only performed one new song."}, {"sentences": ["All over the developed industrial world \u2013 from Tokyo to Paris \u2013 have reached the same conclusion.&quot; Any politician \u2013 footballer too for that matter \u2013 doing an interview should ask him/herself what the interview is for."], "tags": ["Ed Miliband", "Politics", "Conservatives", "Nick Clegg", "Media", "Financial Times", "Newspapers & magazines", "Radio 4", "BBC", "UK news", "Labour"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-30T13:24:26Z", "title": "Ed Miliband, gaffes and the art of the political interview | Michael White", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/30/ed-miliband-political-interview", "article": "Nick Clegg was interviewed on Sunday sofa TV this weekend by Andrew Neil. Promising stuff, but political reporters in search of a headline were disappointed. Neil is a well-prepared and combative inquisitor, David Frost with a Taser. But it was dull. A setback for Cleggie then? Not a bit of it, a triumph. He&apos;s survived his ordeal and all those policy pitfalls \u2013 as Ed Miliband did not when quizzed by Martha Kearney on Radio 4&apos;s World at One. That&apos;s the trouble with interviews of all shapes and sizes, as Tory MP Amber Rudd discovered this week. They&apos;re a gamble, only more so in politics where the stakes are often higher and sudden death more brutal. The interviewer misunderstands. He/she writes up the frivolous angle. Some brute puts up a savage headline. Dull but decent is a good policy: Douglas Hurd was a past master, so is Alistair Darling. Both rose to dizzy heights by being as unflashy as someone like George Galloway wasn&apos;t. How much trouble is charming Rudd in after taking the Financial Times around her highly marginal constituency of Hastings &amp; Rye (paywalled link), scene of recurring battles since 1066 \u2013 mostly against French raiders or Labour challenges? My hunch would be not much more than she&apos;s in already with a majority of 1,993. Rudd is smart and charming, unpaid parliamentary private secretary to George Osborne, a well-connected woman with a bit of fight. All the same it probably wasn&apos;t wise to say she&apos;d been looking for a seat in 2010 &quot;&quot;within two hours of London and I could see we were going to win it&quot;. Or dwell on the high proportion of benefit claimants the faded-but-resilient Sussex seaside town has acquired. Or admit: &quot;If the worst comes to the worst it&apos;s been a great five years.&quot; I find such candour rather endearing, but have learned to mistrust my own reactions as psephology. Some of the FT&apos;s below-the-line contributors in Hastings were a bit miffed. Never mind, Rudd, it was a long and informative article, which will be in Fleet Street&apos;s e-files for handy reference. And not too many people in Hastings \u2013 or even in Rye \u2013 read the FT, alas. On the downside the cheeky LabourList website used it to run a feature which will also be in the e-files: how not to do a gaffe-strewn interview like Rudd. Don&apos;t diss the constituency or the voters. That sort of thing. And don&apos;t do too much detail. On gay marriage, Rudd remarked: &quot;I don&apos;t think they&apos;ll still be thinking about anal sex&quot; on polling day. You never know, some censorious voters may well think of little else. But these are small crosses to bear. A good candidate can make a difference. A one-vote majority is enough. But mostly it is national swings that decide outcomes, though having a low swing against you \u2013 &quot;she fought a good campaign&quot; \u2013 helps if Rudd ever tries for a safer billet. In which case Miliband&apos;s World at One interview may be better news for Rudd than a chunk of space in the FT. On the local election campaign trail the Labour leader refused to explain how he would cut VAT and low-rate income tax to boost the economic recovery or to confirm (as Ed Balls has done) that borrowing would have to rise in the short term to stimulate the growth UK Plc desperately needs. That allowed the Tories to say there would be a \u00a328bn black hole in the public finances \u2013 shades of Chris Patten and John Major&apos;s &quot;tax bombshell&quot; campaign in 1992. The Guardian didn&apos;t make much of it, but the Times put it on page one and the Daily Mail helpfully reprinted verbatim his exchanges with Kearney under a &quot;Milishambles&quot; headline. That&apos;s now in the e-cuttings too and far more seriously. It hits Miliband where he&apos;s vulnerable and where Labour is vulnerable: on management of the economy in tough times when many voters blame the Blair/Brown governments instead of the bankers they failed to supervise properly for the crash of 2008. Worse, it shows Miliband as ill-prepared, callow even. I don&apos;t enjoy pointing this out. But it&apos;s an obvious question, one with an obvious and legitimate answer, roughly along the lines of: &quot;Of course, we must borrow more in order to borrow less in the long term. The coalition&apos;s austerity programme is clearly self-defeating, Osborne is borrowing much more money than he promised to \u2013 or Labour did \u2013 because he is squeezing the life out of the economy. All over the developed industrial world \u2013 from Tokyo to Paris \u2013 have reached the same conclusion.&quot; Any politician \u2013 footballer too for that matter \u2013 doing an interview should ask him/herself what the interview is for. &quot;What do I want to say, what message to get across?&quot; Also &quot;what do I not want to say or concede?&quot; And &quot;who will read this?&quot; Once clear in one&apos;s own head, the interview can safely proceed.

Wales complained to the International Rugby Board when Scotland picked Shingler in their Six Nations squad and a panel ruled in their favour, saying Shingler was not available to play Test rugby for any other country because he played for the Under-20s against France in a match when the two teams were their nations&apos; designated second sides. Shingler, whose back-row brother Aaron is one of the capped members of the 32-strong training squad announced on Wednesday for the two-Test tour to Japan, said last summer that he had been naive to think he could play for Scotland and that his ambition was to emulate his sibling and win a Wales cap.

The most significant difference from last year&apos;s London event is that instead of a tottering and discredited transitional regime, Somalia now has a fully fledged government, led by Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Elected last September, the 57-year-old professor and activist is the first leader chosen inside Somalia since the 1991 overthrow of president Siad Barre, which sowed the seeds for the country&apos;s descent into chaos. Next week&apos;s gathering can be seen as a concerted attempt to bolster the Somali government&apos;s legitimacy as it seeks to rebuild the country after more than two decades of conflict. The conference will be co-chaired by Mohamud and David Cameron, the UK prime minister, and its main aim is to signal international support for Somalia as the new government sets out its vision. But in a setback to the UK, Somaliland, which broke away from Somalia in 1991, refused British entreaties to attend on the grounds that it would not have been treated as equal to the Somali government. Somali officials, however, are upbeat. &quot;We hope the international partners will support Somalia&apos;s implementation of its plans and priorities,&quot; Nuradin Dirie, a presidential adviser, speaking from Mogadishu, the Somali capital, says. &quot;We will be presenting plans for rebuilding the military, the police, the justice and public financial management systems. It is a vision of a political process to take Somalia forward.&quot; There may be some announcements of financial commitments, but those are expected to come at an EU-hosted conference in Brussels in September. Somalia will be very much on the international agenda this year. It will feature in meetings of the G8 group of industrialised countries, and the Tokyo international conference on African development, culminating in the Brussels meeting on the new deal for fragile states. The new deal \u2013 strongly backed by countries recovering from conflict such as Timor Leste and Liberia \u2013 seeks to put poor countries in the driving seat on development strategy rather than donors. At its core are five peace- and state-building goals: legitimate and inclusive politics; security; justice; economic foundations (jobs); and revenues and services. The thinking is that unless aid focuses on peace, money will go to waste. Somalia has enthusiastically embraced the approach and now wants donors to back its plans. Britain \u2013 which has pledged to spend \u00a380m this year and next on aid \u2013 is on board. It has voiced support for the new deal, which seeks to align donor funds with the priorities of the recipient country, and has emerged as a strong cheerleader for the new Somali government. Last week, Britain reopened its embassy in Mogadishu, the first EU country to do so since Barre&apos;s overthrow. Turkey is committing diplomatic and financial resources. Somalia needs all the international support it can get. Although security has improved since al-Shabaab militants were driven out of Mogadishu by Amisom peacekeepers, the group continues to kill. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, this week expressed concern that the Islamist insurgents seem to be targeting Somalia&apos;s legal system, after the Somali deputy state attorney, Ahmed Malim Sheikh Nur, was killed by gunmen as he was leaving a mosque after Friday prayers. The threat posed by al-Shabaab explains the urgency behind the government&apos;s efforts to build a credible military and police to deal with hardcore elements who remain implacably opposed to reconciliation. The Somali government says it will welcome dialogue with those who turn their backs on violence. &quot;The doors are open to those who renounce violence [to] be part of the political process and we will take every step to include people,&quot; Dirie says, adding that the president and prime minister want to rebuild the security infrastructure to provide law and order. While noting the importance of peace- and state-building, civil society representatives, who attended events in London in the runup to the conference, say it is important to maintain development, particularly after the 2011 famine in which nearly 260,000 people died. &quot;Although the drought has ended, we need to build capacity to prepare for future emergencies, we need to invest in farming and livestock,&quot; Aydrus Daar, executive director of Wasda, an NGO that works in the Horn of Africa, says. &quot;There are short-term recovery projects but no three- to five-year programmes.&quot; Fartuun Adan, executive director of the Elman peace and human rights centre in Mogadishu, urged the Somali government to embrace civil society. &quot;We have lots to contribute, we have been working in Somalia for the past 22 years, whereas the government is very new in its job,&quot; she says, adding that the government should do its utmost to empower women and ensure enough jobs. Abdirashid Duale, chief executive of Dahabshiil, a remittances company, who will take part in an investment conference following the event in London, is confident there will be jobs as Somalia rebuilds. &quot;The young generation in Somalia is where the future lies and yes there will be jobs,&quot; he says, &quot;because we need people to build airports, electricity systems and infrastructure.&quot; Laura Hammond, senior lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies, however, says it is important not to get carried away with expectations. &quot;The new government is a real gift to the international community and much better than it was expecting,&quot; she says. &quot;But there is a danger of letting euphoria cloud our judgment. I hope people are patient enough with it and yet able to hold it to account, although international engagement has to be on Somali terms. That will be part of shoring up the government&apos;s legitimacy.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["But as Tokyo has found, 20 years can quickly pass and the situation stays the same."], "tags": ["Small business", "Business", "Japan", "Banking"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-03T13:51:27Z", "title": "Lessons from Japan for UK's struggling SMEs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/may/03/lessons-japan-uk-struggling-companies", "article": "The first three months of the year brought a 5.3% fall in the number of corporate bankruptcies. A fall is generally considered a good thing. A five-year low even better. No one wants to see businesses go bust, and besides, a decline must be a good indicator of an economy that is, to use George Osborne&apos;s favoured phrase, &quot;healing&quot;. Alan Hudson, head of restructuring at Ernst &amp; Young, thinks so. The 3,619 business insolvencies in the first quarter of 2013, which is a decrease of 15.8% compared with the same quarter in 2012, should be considered &quot;another sign that the UK economy is finally starting to move in the right direction&quot;. However, there is another way of looking at the figures. Stewart Baird, director of SME investment firm, Stone Ventures, says that while it is encouraging, &quot;a relatively benign insolvency landscape should not be mistaken for an economy in a state of good health&quot;. He points out that the average liquidation rate over the past 25 years has been 1.2% of all active registered companies against a rate over the last 12 months of 0.7%. &quot;Given the weakness of the economy, this simply doesn&apos;t stack up and could suggest the worst is yet to come,&quot; he says Why would there be worse to come? The answer relates to the UK&apos;s zombie companies. These are the multitude of firms weighed down by pre-crash debts that only survive because banks roll over their debts from one year to the next. Often with hundreds of employees, they have no money to invest, can&apos;t emply more staff and stagger along spending most of their time worrying about the monthly cashflow figures. This is the Japanese conundrum. Taxpayers, via the state-owned banks, keep thousands of small and medium-sized companies afloat in the hope that the rising tide of economic good fortune will allow them to set sail again. The trouble is that while this situation is ongoing investors refuse to inject fresh funds into the affected businesses. Without fresh shareholder funds, and in the absence of further bank lending, the businesses are unable to invest. There are benefits. Workers are, on average happier, because we can estimate that around 1-to-1.5 million people remain employed who might otherwise have suffered redundancy from bust businesses. That is the chief benefit for the Japanese since the big property crash in the late 1980s. But as Tokyo has found, 20 years can quickly pass and the situation stays the same. Baird decribes the UK&apos;s situation as &quot;artificial&quot;. He says: &quot;Over the past five years many of Britain&apos;s businesses have been in a protracted agony. In many cases, because of their financial position, banks haven&apos;t pulled the plug but this may change in the short to medium-term as their balance sheets strengthen.&quot; Like many, he recommends loosening the constraints on bank lending. The Treasury makes a similar argument and the Funding for Lending scheme is supposed to make a difference. yet it is working against some fundamental forces, not least the new financial regulator, which appears to approve of strict lending rules to prevent a bank collapse that is unlikely for another decade. While this situation persists, banks will continue to keep the zombies on their feet staggering on, and on."}, {"sentences": ["This time John McClane will apparently get to wisecrack and explode his way across Tokyo before \u2013 as is now traditional in the series \u2013 collapsing in an exhausted heap, oblivious to all the sustained human death and major structural damage he is responsible for.", "There&apos;s already a hint that this is what Trebilcook has in mind \u2013 why would McClane be visiting Tokyo if not to see the new Nakatomi headquarters?", "Perhaps William Atherton could conveniently be in Tokyo at the same time as McClane."], "tags": ["Bruce Willis", "Sylvester Stallone", "Film", "Culture", "Action and adventure", "Thriller", "Die Hard"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-03T15:40:25Z", "title": "Die Hard 6: why Bruce Willis is taking tips from Rocky Balboa", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/may/03/die-hard-6-willis-balboa", "article": "     There are probably a million reasons why Die Hard 6 should never be made. Die Hard 5 was terrible. Bruce Willis is too old. John McClane is no longer a recognisable human being. Every time anybody makes a sequel to Die Hard, you feel like your childhood is being stabbed directly in the heart. And so on. However, it seems that no amount of logic is enough to stop Die Hard 6 from happening. According to reports, Die Hard 6 not only has a prospective title, Die Hardest, but a location, too. This time John McClane will apparently get to wisecrack and explode his way across Tokyo before \u2013 as is now traditional in the series \u2013 collapsing in an exhausted heap, oblivious to all the sustained human death and major structural damage he is responsible for. But look hard enough and you might find the faintest glimmer of promise. A treatment for Die Hardest is being written by Ben Trebilcook, who told Total Film: &quot;There&apos;s the possibility producers might go back and find some other source material to base the next one on, like they did with the first and second. Mine though, I feel it could be the Rocky Balboa of the Die Hard franchise.&quot; The Rocky Balboa reference is key. The sixth Rocky film wasn&apos;t perfect by any means, but it did manage to get two things right. First, it reined in the out-of-control bombast \u2013 the pastel vests and talking robots and weird Don King impersonations \u2013 that had eroded the charm of the first movie. Second, it was an elegant full stop; bringing the story full circle and sending it off in the most touching manner possible. If this is the route that Trebilcook plans to take with Die Hardest, then that can only be a good thing. The Die Hard series has spiralled out beyond all recognition: they&apos;re now films about invincible bald-headed supermen who charge headfirst into one breathtakingly unrealistic situation after another and don&apos;t stop punching until everyone else is dead. If we wanted to see that, we&apos;d go and watch a Jason Statham film.     The way forward? ... Sylvester Stallone in Rocky Balboa    So the first thing that Trebilcook should do is remember who John McClane is. He&apos;s not a Transformer; he&apos;s a scrappy, quick-thinking human being. He spent much of the first film hobbling around and begging people on the outside for help, which seems unthinkable given how bulletproof he has become in the last two movies. Something \u2013 anything \u2013 that reminds the audience that he&apos;s fallible and vulnerable would immediately make Die Hardest 10 times better. And Bruce Willis is still capable of this type of performance, despite his inclination to appear in everything from GI Joe sequels to Sky broadband adverts. Next, perhaps we could reintroduce some characters and iconography from the franchise&apos;s past. There&apos;s already a hint that this is what Trebilcook has in mind \u2013 why would McClane be visiting Tokyo if not to see the new Nakatomi headquarters? \u2013 but we could take it further. Perhaps William Atherton could conveniently be in Tokyo at the same time as McClane. Or Reginald VelJohnson. Or even Carmine from Die Hard 2, who could pop up to briefly reveal that he&apos;s finally worked out the solution to McClane&apos;s timeless riddle, &quot;What sets off the metal detectors first? The lead in your ass or the shit in your brains?&quot; Or what could give the film more emotional pull than bringing back Bonnie Bedelia as McClane&apos;s wife Holly? She was the primary motivation for the first two films, and the franchise has lost its way without her. Whether the McClanes end up reunited, or whether one of them dies, she&apos;s the presence that most sorely deserves a return. But then again, maybe we&apos;re getting ahead of ourselves. This is Die Hard we&apos;re talking about. It&apos;s already blown so many chances to bring the series to a graceful conclusion that this is all probably wishful thinking. In which case, be sure to look out for Die Hard 7: Die Hardester in cinemas around the time of Bruce Willis&apos;s 65th birthday."}, {"sentences": ["I&apos;ve never been to Tokyo, but I suddenly realize why people pushing devices might come in handy."], "tags": ["London", "London holidays", "New York", "Travel", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-05T12:32:00Z", "title": "Sounding off: London v New York | Heather Long", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/05/living-in-new-york-versus-london", "article": "Perhaps nothing illustrates the cultural differences between Londoners and New Yorkers better than a ride on the famed &quot;tube&quot; and &quot;subway&quot;. London: I board the Circle Line and wonder if I have stepped into a library. The carriage is silent. At least half the people on the train are reading something \u2013 a tablet, a free newspaper, a dense novel, a car magazine. My attempts to make eye contact \u2013 let alone speak \u2013 with anyone are futile as Londoners seem to have a way of staring intently at the advertisements, that is, if their phone or other reading material are not handy. As people get up, vacating those prized seats, it&apos;s rare that someone just rushes right to it. There&apos;s a sort of dance that goes on where people lean towards the open spot, but look around to make sure no one else wants it more.  A few stops down the line, a young man with a massive wheely suitcase doesn&apos;t realize that his big bag rolls away from him and over the well polished shoes of a banker type. I wait for the screaming \u2013 maybe even swearing \u2013 from the businessman. It never comes. He pushes the suitcase away from his foot, takes a step to the left and re-opens his book without uttering a word. I don&apos;t think the young man ever realized his suitcase trampled someone. It was like watching a silent film.  I disembark later, without a sound, except for the very clear, feminine voice of the announce articulating the name of the stop and what to &quot;alight here for&quot;. &quot;Keep calm and carry on IN SILENCE&quot;, I think. New York: I board a number 4 or 5 train, and the masses on the platform behind me push me until I crash into multiple people. Occasionally I say sorry, but, frankly, it&apos;s like a mosh pit. I&apos;ve never been to Tokyo, but I suddenly realize why people pushing devices might come in handy.  There&apos;s shouting to &quot;move in, move in, make room.&quot; You just pray that the person you are suddenly rubbing up against remembered to use deodorant that day. After the shoving contest subsides, you feel like you&apos;ve stepped into a club as you begin to notice the music. Sometimes it&apos;s rap. Sometimes it&apos;s Latin salsa. Sometimes it&apos;s a Disney song on a kid&apos;s iPad. All these people have headphones, but why they need them is beyond me. They are doing their DJ routine for the entire subway car to hear. Within a few stops, someone gets mad. About being pushed too often. About being stepped on. About how that idiot insists on reading their big newspaper on a clearly overstuffed train. There&apos;s more shouting. Occasionally someone yells back. You look at the people next to you and nod in either annoyed or amused solidarity. If you&apos;re really unlucky, a preacher of some sort gets on the train and tells you all how you&apos;re going to go to hell. All before 9am.  For the record, I am a resident New Yorker, but I lived and worked in London for two years and recently visited the UK&apos;s famed capital only to be completely stunned at how quiet it is.  New York is noisy. All the time, even inside a subway car amongst total strangers. When you emerge from the underground transit system, it gets even louder. Police and fire sirens go off about every five minutes, and taxi drivers honk about as often as they push the accelerator. People scream, they shout. You aren&apos;t sure if they are truly insane, shooting a video or just letting lose. After a day or two in the city, you stop even looking at the noise because there&apos;s so much of it. It&apos;s just part of the energy of the Big Apple.  New Yorkers also dress as boldly as they speak. Bright colors, odd shoes, hats and accessories. And if all else fails, big name labels like Louis Vuitton (or imitation LV). New Yorkers want to be heard from head to toe. After two weeks in London, I feel like I&apos;ve been at a peaceful retreat. I think I heard a police siren once in my time here, and I&apos;m starting to think someone stole all the taxi&apos;s horns. How can this many people be so quiet?  There&apos;s a dignity to this way of life, and a bit of that stiff upper lip stereotype. It takes a lot to ruffle a Londoner&apos;s feathers. In numerous trips on the subway, there was only one occasion when someone blared their music too loudly or said something to me. While most people are dressed nicely, it&apos;s striking that subdued colors dominate: blacks, grays, earth tones. If someone, often a youngster, is wearing something bold, it&apos;s a scarf or other accent piece, not an entire rainbow outfit.  I could go on about the differences, but you get the idea. For me, those daily metro rides during rush hour captured it best. I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s possible to say what&apos;s better or worse \u2013 or even preferable. Both cities have their charms. Both cities are clear trendsetters and incredibly diverse and creative. The 8.24 million New Yorkers and 8.17 million Londoners (according to Google) have perhaps voted with their residence, but it&apos;s a virtual tie.

Last year the company estimated it blocked nearly 250,000 cyber-attacks. One out of every 532 websites was infected with viruses, it said, and 1.6 million instances of malware were detected. Overall, cyber-attacks were up 42% in 2012. They range from &quot;hacktivist&quot; targeting of industries such as defence to the fast-growing area of &quot;ransomware&quot; blackmail attempts, but more than a third of attacks focused on small- to medium-size businesses employing fewer than 500 people. Orla Cox, the senior manager of security response at Symantec&apos;s office in north-west Dublin, said hackers \u2013 including criminal gangs, individuals and even states \u2013 regarded smaller enterprises as &quot;stepping stones&quot; to enable them to attack larger corporations. In a briefing last week, Cox also said Twitter was perceived as a weak link. Last month Syrian hackers claimed responsibility for a bogus tweet from an Associated Press account that sent stock markets into temporary freefall. &quot;The security of Twitter is not strong and Twitter is going to have to do something about that,&quot; Cox said. Symantec&apos;s Dublin hub, with 800 workers including 60 in its security division, plays a key part in global computer security because in terms of timezones it lies between the company&apos;s two other main operations, in California and Tokyo. The Irish office was the first to detect the Stuxnet virus, which has caused severe damage to the Iranian nuclear programme in Natanz. The virus, which entered the country&apos;s nuclear industry system via computers sold to Iran from Europe, caused centrifuges used in uranium enrichment to spin out of control. Symantec is reluctant to state its view on the origin of the highly sophisticated virus but most security analysts believe Israel was behind it. Cox said Stuxnet was probably not the end of it. She predicted those behind the virus were probably developing a new &quot;son of Stuxnet&quot; in the campaign to sabotage Iranian nuclear efforts. Ransomware has become a bigger challenge in the last 12 months, according to Symantec. The company has identified 16 cybercrime gangs using ransomware, which in the space of 18 days in 2012 alone infected 500,000 computers. &quot;It works by shutting down your computer with a virus and then sending out a bogus warning that a user has been looking at something illegal,&quot; Cox said. &quot;They tell the user they can only get the computer back running if they pay a ransom, in some cases of $100, usually by buying a moneypack voucher and then sending the code transferring the amount to the gang. If the user for instance has been browsing a porn site they are going to believe the warning and pay up. Such scams netted the 16 gangs about $5m in 2012, she said. In many cases paying through an anonymous money transfer system did not necessarily ensure an infected computer was unlocked, the company pointed out. In some cases ransomware can capture images of the targeted user via webcam, which is displayed when a computer screen is frozen to intimidate the victim. Cox said there were now online toolkits hackers could buy on the internet to enable them to break into bank accounts. She said hacking into the financial system and online banking theft was mainly the work of gangs from Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet states. Symantec also expressed concern about teenagers and young adults being targeted on Twitter, Facebook and other social networks because they were less guarded about their personal data and in particular their usernames and passwords. The company said the intersection of smartphones and social media would become an important security battleground. Cox said Symantec believed Apple products were less prone to attack, with iPhones for instance being safer because they are &quot;completely locked down&quot;. However, she said Apple Macs are &quot;not impervious&quot; to hacking. In the last weekend of April the Guardian also came under a cyber-attack from Syrian hackers who have targeted a series of western media organisations in an apparent effort to cause disruption and spread support for Bashar al-Assad&apos;s dictatorship. The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) claimed responsibility for the Twitter-based attack, having previously also targeted the BBC, France 24 TV, and National Public Radio in the United States. Cyber-attacks believed to emanate from North Korea have recently caused disruption to media organisations in South Korea."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;It makes us less prosperous, it jeopardises, potentially, up to 3 million jobs\u00a0\u2026 it also means we&apos;ll be taken less seriously in Washington, Tokyo."], "tags": ["Nick Clegg", "Politics", "European Union", "World news", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Conservatives", "Liberal Democrats", "UK Independence party (Ukip)", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-07T08:46:20Z", "title": "Nick Clegg dismisses Nigel Lawson's call for EU exit", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/07/nick-clegg-nigel-lawson-eu", "article": "Nick Clegg has dismissed former chancellor Lord Lawson&apos;s claim that the British economy would be better off outside the EU.

The\u00a0setting is the world fair at Ghent. Visitors from every nation in the world throng the stands, marvelling at the ingenuity of modern man. Business cards get swapped, order books filled. The mood is open and curious, with conversations shifting easily between languages. The talk might be about British ball bearings, Flemish lace or Portuguese wine. Later, over a coffee or\u00a0beer, someone may mention the recent royal wedding attended by a full\u00a0sweep of royal cousins: George of Britain, Nicholas of Russia and Wilhelm of Germany. Here is cosmopolitanism showing its sunniest face to the world: mild, pragmatic and touchingly convinced that it is doing its best by\u00a0everyone. This is just the sort of opening scene we are used to in narratives that begin in 1913 \u2013 a more sophisticated version of the summer garden party in which girls in white frocks play croquet on a vicarage lawn. We know that in the very next beat the sky will darken, the music will go atonal, and the bright colours will drain to sepia as the guns move in. But Emmerson does not give us that next beat. For it is not his intention to describe how or why the Great War began. Instead, he wants us to continue to potter among the stalls at Ghent, experiencing what it felt like to be alive in 1913, unaware of the coming rip in history. To further decentre the war from his\u00a0narrative, he takes us on a tour that includes places apparently aloof from the approaching carnage. What, for instance, was it like to be a beef baron in Buenos Aires, a wine merchant in Algiers or a tyre manufacturer in Tokyo? Actually, it turns out, it wasn&apos;t all that different from being a clerk in London or a banker in Berlin. In the newly joined-up world of 1913, information, artefacts and people hurtled around the world at dizzying speeds. The report of a poor wheat harvest in Canada meant a fall on the stock market in London the next day. Model T Fords struck out from Detroit to do sterling service in the coffee plantations of Brazil and the sheep farms of New Zealand. Russia, far from\u00a0stewing in its own juices, was publishing books in 49 languages. Emmerson is able to make his case about globalisation by arguing that 1913 was the year the world finally turned urban. From China to Brazil, men and women were pouring into the\u00a0expanding towns to remake their lives. Citizens, fresh from the country, encounter new jobs, new drinks, new dances, even new kinds of bodies. In Peking, dawdling citizens are even told to stand up straight and walk faster if they really want to get on. Not everyone enjoyed being modern. Naysayers grumbled that the world now turned so fast that it would soon spin off its axis. In Pera, a suburb of Constantinople, you could buy &quot;Parisian&quot; scarves made in Manchester, Nestl\u00e9&apos;s condensed milk from Switzerland and Russian galoshes. Tokyo&apos;s new railway station was modelled on Amsterdam Centraal while Bombay&apos;s Victoria station showed a puzzling resemblance to London&apos;s St Pancras. Shanghai&apos;s Customs House, meanwhile, was built in a style best described as Tudorbethan. While electricity now lit up the main streets in Tehran and Algiers, it only served to make the side streets seem darker than before, and 1913 turned into a year of frightening shadows. In Vienna a Jewish clerk was arrested on a\u00a0trumped-up charge of ritual murder. In Russia, whispering the word &quot;constitution&quot; on the freezing air was still enough to bring a policeman to your door. In other parts of the world, protesters marched and waved placards. A British-trained lawyer called Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi rallied Indian miners in Natal against laws designed to squeeze them into ghettoes. Such was the speed with which news travelled that Indians on the subcontinent were soon joining in to protest this attack on their cherished right to move freely around the British Empire. In Palestine, things quickly turned nasty. Fanned by newspapers, sectarian tensions increased to the point where a banal incident involving the theft of some grapes was enough to trigger a murderous street brawl between Arabs and Jews. Particularly striking are the literary sources Emmerson uses to recreate the world of 100 years ago (and remember it&apos;s all recent: there are 13,000 people in the UK today who were alive in 1913). Rather than high literature, he mostly opts for demotic texts, journalism and hack novels, to get a feel for the splits and bumps that marked private and public thinking. So\u00a0instead of Proust, DH Lawrence and\u00a0Freud, we have the intelligent but non-canonical work of Stefan Zweig and Israel Zangwill. A chapter on Mexico City makes great use of a potboiler called Philip Dru, written by\u00a0Woodrow Wilson&apos;s Texan adviser Edward M House, in which Mexico is incorporated into the US, a move that seemed entirely likely at the time. To understand how the inhabitants of Detroit felt about their homes, Emmerson uses a Sears catalogue, while Los Angeles&apos;s fantasies about its\u00a0own past are mapped on to a Mary\u00a0Pickford movie. Throughout this ambitious, subtle account, Emmerson tries hard not to play the hindsight game. Still, he&apos;s honest enough to acknowledge the cheap pleasure that comes from knowing what happens next. For who would not be tickled to learn that in 1913 Kaiser Wilhelm was being hailed as a glorious peacemaker, with 25 conflict-free years under his considerable belt?\u00a0Or that until recently a young Mussolini had been running a socialist group in Trieste while Trotsky was busy as a journalist in the tinkling tea shops of Vienna? Then there are those startling contemporary resonances, such as the moment when Elizabeth Kendall, a global fl\u00e2neur, declares: &quot;China is waking up, the self-satisfied complacency of the white race has received a shock&quot;. Not all the prophecies made in 1913\u00a0turn out to be quite as spot-on as Kendall&apos;s, though. India, according to a\u00a0piece in the Evening Standard, would probably never wish to be independent of Britain. The Channel Tunnel was confidently declared to be only a few years away. Oddest of all, however, was the suggestion that, by the year 2013, the capital city of the British empire would have been obliged to relocate to\u00a0somewhere along the Canadian-US border. Such wild mis-hits are worth cherishing as a reminder that the future is never simply the present dressed up in a funny haircut. A hundred years from now we \u2013 or at least the very youngest among us \u2013 will be doing and\u00a0thinking things that are quite unguessable now. And, actually, the idea of that is really rather cheering. \u2022 Kathryn Hughes is writing a book about famous Victorians&apos; body parts.

The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said Japan had stated its regret for the harm its troops caused to civilian populations on the Asian mainland in the first half of the 20th century, and had no plans to alter its stance. &quot;The Abe government has expressed sincere condolences to all victims of the war, in and out of the country, and there is no change in that,&quot; Suga told reporters in Tokyo. &quot;We have repeatedly said we have no intention of making this a diplomatic and political issue, but I&apos;m afraid this may not be fully understood.&quot; Suga&apos;s remarks will lay to rest, for now, fears that the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, would revise previous apologies to the country&apos;s wartime victims, including tens of thousands of women forced to work as sex slaves in frontline brothels by the Japanese imperial army. Abe, a nationalist who wants to revise Japan&apos;s pacifist constitution to give its military a bigger role overseas, had voiced support for altering a 1993 apology issued by the then chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, for the forced recruitment of the so-called comfort women, most of whom were from the Korean peninsula. In 1995, the then socialist prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, issued a more general expression of remorse over Japan&apos;s wartime conduct. Tokyo&apos;s insistence that the apologies will remain unaltered may have been in response to rare public pressure from the US, whose former ambassador to Tokyo, Thomas Schieffer, warned last week that revisions to the Kono statement risked harming US-Japan ties. Earlier this week, the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, who is on an official visit to Washington, said Japan had reopened old wounds and urged it to &quot;correct&quot; its view of history. In an interview with the Washington Post, Park said &quot;the Japanese have been opening past wounds and have been letting them fester, and this applies not only to Korea but also to other neighbouring countries. &quot;This arrests our ability to really build momentum, so I hope that Japan reflects upon itself.&quot; Her remarks came after Japan&apos;s finance minister, Taro Aso, and more than 160 other politicians visited Yasukuni shrine, a symbol of Japanese militarism and spiritual resting place for 2.5 million war dead, including 14 convicted war criminals. Abe, who did not visit the shrine but sent a ritual offering, raised tensions recently when he questioned whether Japan&apos;s wartime conduct in Asia could be described as aggression. Asked in parliament if he would consider revising the Murayama statement, he replied: &quot;The definition of what constitutes aggression has yet to be established in academia or in the international community. &quot;Things that happened between nations will look differently depending on which side you view them from.&quot; But on Wednesday, Abe told a parliamentary committee: &quot;We share the same recognition with the past cabinets that Japan caused tremendous damage and suffering to people in Asia.&quot; The foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, said Abe&apos;s government had &quot;accepted the facts of history in a spirit of humility, expressed once again our feelings of deep remorse and our heartfelt apology, and expressed our feelings of profound mourning for all victims, both at home and abroad. And prime minister Abe shares the same view.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Eager to protect London&apos; status as one of the world&apos;s three most important financial centres alongside Tokyo and New York, Johnson has lobbied for access to the Chinese markets."], "tags": ["Boris Johnson", "Politics", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Conservatives"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-09T20:00:09Z", "title": "Boris Johnson to make trade mission to China", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/09/boris-china", "article": "Boris Johnson will embark on a major trade mission to China later this year, stealing a march on the prime minister who was blocked last year after Beijing cancelled high-level diplomatic ties. Johnson is expected to take a large group of business people on his trip in October, overtaking plans by No 10 to mend ties broken when David Cameron met the Dalai Lama. The trip will aim to cement already strong links between the capital and Beijing. It will be seen as a coup for Johnson and could help build his standing in preparation for a Tory leadership bid. The London mayor said he was keen to take a substantial group of business people to China to help British companies broaden their reach. He said the city was proud that it was a hub for international business and would remain a key player in the financial sector. &quot;It is the only place in the world where you can call S\u00e3o Paulo and Shanghai on the same day,&quot; he said. Asked whether David Cameron would accompany the delegation, he said: &quot;Only if he is travelling in the hold&quot;. French president Francois Hollande and German premier Angela Merkel&apos;s have both enjoyed state visits to China, making it clear to London that France and Germany are now favoured above the UK in diplomatic relations. Eager to protect London&apos; status as one of the world&apos;s three most important financial centres alongside Tokyo and New York, Johnson has lobbied for access to the Chinese markets. Last year Beijing chose London as the first place to trade the remnimbi outside China. Johnson said at the Global Investment conference in London, organised by Vincent Cable&apos;s Business department, that Britain needed to play to its strengths as a global financial centre. Cameron has struggled to re-establish diplomatic ties with Beijing after a meeting with the Dalai Lama that was also attended by the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. China demanded No10 apologise for attending the official meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader at st Paul&apos;s cathedral in May last year, warning of &quot;serious consequences&quot;, but Cameron refused. A trip to China was cancelled last summer and a visit by the new Chinese leader Li Keqiang has yet to be arranged this year. No10 denied that the Dalai Lama link damaged relations, saying the election of the new Chinese leadership last autumn forced scheduled visits to be scrapped. A spokesman said six ministers had visited China since May last year and the prime minister had enjoyed warm relations during phone calls with Li in recent months. He said he was not appropriate to discuss whether there were plans for No10 to embark on a trade mission. Investment in the UK by Chinese investors has increased sharply in recent years, but there have been fears that the frosty diplomatic relations could put at risk proposals for major Chinese investments in a wide range of large infrastructure projects. The government is hopeful that the High Speed 2 rail network and the Government&apos;s nuclear investment programme will benefit from billions of pounds of investment from China&apos;s sovereign wealth fund. George Osborne, speaking at the conference, said the UK was unapologetic about encouraging overseas investors with the lowest corporation tax in the G20. He said the cut in the headline rate of corporation tax to 20% by next year would support Britain&apos;s recovery. Speaking ahead of the G7 summit of finance ministers this weekend, which he is chairing, the chancellor said his priority was to support the global recovery. &quot;The situation has stabilised, but that does not mean we should let up in our efforts to promote growth and build on the stability we have seen recently,&quot; he said. The G7 will discuss a range of issues he said, including how central banks can further their support for the the major economies."}, {"sentences": ["Potter-san takes on Japan Forthcoming action flick Tokyo Vice sees a bloody battle between a ruthless Yakuza boss and, er, Daniel Radcliffe."], "tags": ["Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-11T05:00:02Z", "title": "Populist: Items of interest this week", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/may/11/populist-the-guide", "article": "Music&apos;s on their radar The &quot;will they won&apos;t they&quot; debate over a new Blur LP steps up a gear after Damon Albarn suggests the Britpop stalwarts will &quot;try to&quot; start work on a new album.

It sounds like a statistic from the dizzy days before the Great Recession, when ostentatious consumption was in, &quot;banker&quot; had yet to become a dirty word, and the capital prided itself on providing a haven for the world&apos;s super-rich. But it&apos;s the story today in the prime postcodes, which are basking in a spring recovery yet to be felt in the rest of Britain. Analysis of official data by London Central Portfolio, which helps investors to buy in the capital, shows that the cost of a property in one of central London&apos;s &quot;prime&quot; areas, such as Knightsbridge or Kensington and Chelsea, has jumped a whopping 25% in the last year to an average of \u00a31,186,817. London&apos;s skyline bristles with giant cranes as the construction industry cranks back into life, while deep beneath the capital hundreds of workers are digging 42km of tunnels for the vast Crossrail project, which will connect the heart of the city from east to west, in Europe&apos;s largest construction project. On the south bank of the Thames, near London Bridge, there is no shortage of visitors willing to pay the \u00a324.95 entry fee to admire the spectacular views of the city from the top of the Shard, the giant Renzo Piano glass-and-steel pinnacle, financed with Qatari cash, which opened in February. Just around the corner in Borough Market, each Saturday morning brings a flock of foodie shoppers to stock up on artisan cheeses, hand-dived scallops and craft beers. Across the river in the City, the vast London outpost of US restaurant chain Sushisamba high up in the Heron Tower \u2013 another recent addition to the increasingly crowded skyline \u2013 is booked up, with well-heeled diners keen to sample its &quot;unique blend of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine culture, music and striking design&quot;. At times London in 2013 feels more akin to Manhattan than, say, Manchester. There is nothing remotely New York about the waterfront at Brough, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. No cranes, no bustle of industry. Just the muddy Humber river sweeping past a vista of mudflats, coastal lagoons and saltmarshes. A major centre for aircraft manufacture since 1916, where more than 80 models of plane were built over the years, this is the kind of place that might hope to be swept up in a 21st-century industrial renaissance. But while BAE Systems still has a presence only yards from the waterfront, the company is no longer the force it used to be here. At the height of the recession, a fall in orders forced BAE to announce the potential loss of 899 jobs. Eighteen months on, that figure has mercifully been limited to &quot;an anticipated 30 compulsory redundancies,&quot; as staff have been switched to other sites or found jobs with new employers in now redundant BAE premises. These days the town \u2013 population 7,000 and rising \u2013 is less a base for advanced aeronautical engineering and more a genteel dormitory for the likes of Hull, Scunthorpe, Grimsby and Leeds. &quot;The people doing the best are those who catch the train out of here to London every morning,&quot; says David Funnell, who proudly sells &quot;Yorkshire ground&quot; coffee outside Brough station. &quot;You&apos;ll see them park their top-of-the-range Lexuses, Mercs and Range Rovers and head off to the south. What they&apos;re leaving behind is part of the north that&apos;s increasingly being left behind by the government.&quot; Frazer Ulrick, a specialist in business restructuring with Begbies Traynor, had just emerged with a bag of groceries from Morrisons. &quot;The south is definitely more affluent,&quot; he says. &quot;But then, they have to pay higher house prices and so things balance out. Overall, I feel I&apos;m better off where I am. We have a nice house and Brough is a great place to bring up children.&quot; Ulrick, 33, and his wife Emma, 31, bought their three-storey terrace home in &quot;New Brough&quot; in 2008. &quot;We paid \u00a3150,000 for it, and because it&apos;s still probably worth that, our next house is not getting further away,&quot; he says. &quot;If we were in London, we&apos;d need to be finding the extra \u00a327 an hour to make that same move.&quot; Five years after the crash, there is finally talk of a (modest) economic upturn. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has estimated that the economy expanded by a healthy 0.8% in the three months to April. But where is the growth happening? And who is benefiting? The evidence suggests that an unbalanced recovery is in prospect, during which London and its environs will effortlessly pull further away from the rest of the country. Welcome to two-speed Britain. In the capital, for anyone looking for economic green shoots, there are anecdotes aplenty \u2013 packed restaurants, high-spending shoppers, ambitious building projects. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of private sector money coming into London; there&apos;s a phenomenal amount happening,&quot; says Gerard Lyons, chief economic adviser to the mayor of London, Boris Johnson. &quot;London is leading the recovery.&quot; But when the coalition government came to power in 2010, George Osborne hoped to build an economic model that no longer depended on the spendthrift habits of a few hundred thousand impossibly wealthy bankers and resident Russian oligarchs. Instead, he pledged to lead a &quot;march of the makers&quot;, rebalancing Britain&apos;s growth model away from debt-fuelled spending towards industry. In turn, that would help to spread the benefits of growth beyond the capital. Yet while the green shoots are showing in London, it&apos;s a different story elsewhere. &quot;If you look at Glasgow city centre at the moment, there are no cranes to be seen,&quot; says Allan Lapsley, a partner at property advisers Speirs Gumley. &quot;If I go to London there is just a different feel, like there is no recession. There is a buzz that hasn&apos;t gone away. Whereas at this end we&apos;ve had our heads in our hands for the last two or three years.&quot; The huge public spending cuts of the last three years have made a difficult economic situation in the north and other regions even worse. David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas, says: &quot;It has been an unbalanced recovery, and typically unbalanced recoveries in the UK tend to favour the south as they tend to be consumer- and housing market-led.&quot; It is, of course, in the property market where the contrast between London and the financial health of the rest of the country is most stark. Property developer Christian Candy is working on plans for a lavish development in the grounds of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, where prices are expected to reach \u00a3200m. Meanwhile, houses in Wales are changing hands for a few thousand \u2013the cost of a single designer lampshade in one of London&apos;s luxury pads. Luxury property agents Knight Frank say that London&apos;s market is boosted by rich overseas buyers who see a house in the capital as a safe haven investment. They report that foreign buyers accounted for 52% of all prime central London sales worth more than \u00a32m over the past year. &quot;The increasingly volatile global economy has only served to fuel demand among global investors,&quot; says Liam Bailey, Knight Frank&apos;s global head of residential research. &quot;The London market has really outperformed over the last four years, and over the past 12 to 18 months it has become more noticeable. The eurozone crisis undermines confidence in the UK and hurts the housing market but it is positive for London because eurozone investors look to London as somewhere to buy.&quot; London ranks top in the world \u2013 ahead of Tokyo and New York \u2013 for the number of multi-millionaires, although it also has some of the worst child poverty rates in the UK. The capital has 4,224 multi-millionaires \u2013 classed as individuals with net assets of $30m (\u00a319m) or more excluding their primary residences, according to analysts Wealth Insight. It puts the number of dollar millionaires at 281,000 or, in other words, a staggering one in 29 Londoners. These are people Johnson is eager to hang on to, as he stresses the tax revenue that is being garnered from the capital&apos;s financial services and its high-earning employees. But if London begins to pull yet further away from the rest of the UK as recovery takes root, resentment may grow that the crucible of the financial crisis which plunged the economy into the deepest recession in a generation is \u2013 yet again \u2013 taking the lion&apos;s share of the benefits of growth. Professor Karel Williams, from the Centre for Research and Socio-Economic Change group of academic researchers, says that the divergence between the fortunes of London and the rest of the country is the result of deep-seated flaws in the UK&apos;s economic model. &quot;We&apos;re seeing a fragmentation of the social settlement,&quot; he comments. &quot;This country is a pleasant, prosperous place for some social groups, but it&apos;s a depressed hole of shuttered shops for others. What we&apos;re heading for is a two-speed UK.&quot; He argues that the chasm between the cost of a home in the capital and in the rest of the country exacerbates the problem: &quot;The ex-industrial working class are marooned by the lack of cheap housing. For somebody who&apos;s lost a council job in the north of England to come down to London with a family \u2013 how would they live?&quot; Governments have wrestled for decades with the challenge of regenerating the northern towns that were the powerhouses of the industrial revolution. Ed Cox, director of the thinktank IPPR North, says that, without rekindling growth outside the capital, UK plc will remain stuck in the doldrums: &quot;If you focus exclusively on jobs and growth in London and the south-east, it will be very difficult to turn the economy around.&quot; That idea was echoed in Lord Heseltine&apos;s recent report, No Stone Unturned. He called for \u00a349bn of Whitehall funding to be allocated to local enterprise partnerships \u2013 the bodies set up by the coalition to replace Labour&apos;s regional development agencies \u2013 to spend on transforming their local economies. But with ministers reluctant to cede control over large chunks of their budgets, the amount eventually handed down to local level looks likely to be a tiny fraction of that. Cox says the enterprise partnerships are &quot;slowly starting to get their act together and the government is slowly realising that they need a degree of capacity&quot;. Enterprise partnerships are an integral part of the &quot;city deals&quot;, under which eight &quot;city regions&quot;, including Birmingham, Newcastle and Sheffield, were recently handed new powers over economic development. Cox points to bioscience and engineering as industries in which the north has great strengths. &quot;It&apos;s not all about metal-bashing,&quot; he says. The latest official trade figures, published on Friday, showed a strong rise in exports, boosting hopes that a march of the makers may finally be about to get under way, helped by a cheaper pound. But back in Brough, at his commuter-friendly coffee stall, Funnell is sceptical that the coalition has a convincing plan for spreading the benefits of growth beyond the capital. &quot;We&apos;re proud folk in Yorkshire, but we&apos;re getting increasingly fed up with the government,&quot; he says. &quot;They feel that Cameron&apos;s Eton and Harrow set are making policies for Londoners and don&apos;t care about the rest of the country. In their minds, we&apos;re all &apos;flat caps and ferrets&apos;.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Prince Pickles is animated face of Japan&apos;s self-defence forces, while Pipo-kun represents the Tokyo metropolitan police."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-12T13:53:00Z", "title": "Kumamon leads Japan's mascot craze, but don't mention Pluto-kun", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/12/kumamon-japan-mascot-plutokun", "article": "He is a genuine household name in a country where celebrities are ten a penny.

For all his clever cultural references, Sento-kun was guilty of the most serious crime in the Japanese mascot world: he simply wasn&apos;t cute.     Sento-kun, mascot of the ancient capital of Nara.

His job: promoting mushrooms. Adorability aside, their role in circumventing staid social conventions is a big part of mascots&apos; appeal in Japan, says Choko Ohira, founder of what is said to be the world&apos;s only school for people who want to make a living from zipping themselves into a stifling suit and donning a comically oversized head. &quot;Japan is generally a peaceful, safe place, and that&apos;s the perfect environment for mascots,&quot; said Ohira, who trains 25 students. &quot;You can interact with mascots in public in a way you might hesitate to do with other people, like hugging. Adults will happily hug a cute character even though know there might be a middle-aged man inside the suit. Her coaching skills clearly aren&apos;t going to waste. Earlier this year, 141 different Japanese characters set a Guinness world record for synchronised mascot dancing.            Last year&apos;s grand prix to find Japan&apos;s most popular character drew almost 900 entries \u2013 double the number from the previous year \u2013 and 300,000 visitors. In Kumamon&apos;s absence, the title went to a rotund avian named Barii-san, the official mascot of the city of Imabari on the island of Shikoku. The Kumamon craze, though, shows no sign of easing up. To mark his &quot;birthday&quot; in March, he was given his own karaoke song and now has more than 220,000 followers on Twitter, as well as 112,000 likes on his official Facebook page. The cuddly bear from Japan&apos;s deep south is a &quot;brilliant&quot; mascot, Ohira said. &quot;He started out as a promoter, but now he&apos;s become a brand in his own right.

The hedge fund recommends that Sony then sell a 15%-20% stake in that business in an offering to existing shareholders. Separately, it proposed that the company should consider selling off its 60% stake in Sony Financial, which sells life insurance policies and has real estate holdings. That would leave the core electronics arm, which includes Sony&apos;s TV and PlayStation units. Loeb said that would generate funds to invest in the electronics business and allow the company to reduce its debt pile. Third Point thinks this strategy could drive Sony&apos;s share price up by as much as 60%, &quot;if implemented properly&quot;. Sony&apos;s share price has plunged by nearly 85% over the past 13 years, as it has been overtaken in electronics by the likes of Apple, Samsung and LG. The approach represents a bet by Loeb that Japan can recover after a decade of minimal growth. Loeb has come out in support of the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who is pushing policies to attract private investment. In his letter to Sony, Loeb wrote: &quot;Under Prime Minister Abe&apos;s leadership, Japan can regain its position as one of the world&apos;s pre-eminent economic powerhouses and manufacturing engines.&quot; In one of his most famous corporate spats, Loeb successfully ousted Yahoo&apos;s former chief executive and poached Marissa Mayer from Google to run the internet company."}, {"sentences": ["     Sony at a glance Sony, the company behind the Walkman, Django Unchained and Michael Jackson&apos;s back catalogue, was established in Tokyo in 1946.", "Twelve years later it floated as Sony on the Tokyo stock exchange, listing in the US in 1970."], "tags": ["Hedge funds", "Sony Pictures", "Technology", "Financial sector", "Business", "Sony", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-14T08:56:24Z", "title": "Sony: the key operations in the breakup battle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/14/sony-key-operations", "article": "     Sony at a glance Sony, the company behind the Walkman, Django Unchained and Michael Jackson&apos;s back catalogue, was established in Tokyo in 1946.

A long piece published earlier this month in the People&apos;s Daily \u2013 a\u202fnewspaper controlled by the Chinese Communist party \u2013 suggested that China would have reason to assert its rights over the Ryukyu archipelago, of which Okinawa is the main island. According to Zhang Haipeng and Li Guoqiang from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, &quot;the time has come to reconsider unresolved issues concerning the Ryukyu islands&quot;. The two academics went on to examine the 1895 treaty of Shimonoseki, which ended the first Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895, lost by the Manchu Qing dynasty at a time when it was very weak. This &quot;unequal&quot; treaty obliged China to cede a great deal of territory to the &quot;imperialist power&quot;, including the island of Formosa, now Taiwan, and was a source of deep and lasting humiliation for the Chinese. The disputed subtropical archipelago lies between Japan and Taiwan, and in the course of its history was a vassal state of China, paying tribute for years before coming under Japanese sovereignty. The tiny, but independent and prosperous, kingdom became the Okinawa prefecture in 1879. The Ryukyuans had shared a long history with China and many suffered after the island&apos;s annexation, being treated as second-class citizens. The islands were the theatre of intense combat during the second world war, when large numbers of the Ryukyu population were killed and many others were allegedly forced to take their own lives by the Japanese. The United States then occupied the islands until 1972, and the Okinawans have had to accept the presence of American military bases to this day. The calls over Okinawa may well revive tensions between Beijing and Tokyo, already embroiled in a territorial dispute over the Senkaku islands, an archipelago in the South China Sea that China refers to as the Diaoyu islands.   \u2022 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde"}, {"sentences": ["In the summer of 1986 Keith Haring, 28, travelled from Milan, where he took part in a public presentation of one of his projects in aid of children, and then on to Tokyo, for another project."], "tags": ["Street art", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Paris holidays"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-14T13:01:35Z", "title": "Keith Haring, the Political Line \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/may/14/keith-haring-political-line-review", "article": "In the summer of 1986 Keith Haring, 28, travelled from Milan, where he took part in a public presentation of one of his projects in aid of children, and then on to Tokyo, for another project. He had come to international notice four years earlier, when he was invited to take part in the Documenta show in Kassel, Germany, an exceptional honour for someone so young. During the long flight to Japan he noted his doubts in his diary. In Milan, the sponsors had hogged the limelight and Haring was unhappy about this &quot;commercial&quot; intrusion. Despite this, he was convinced that with time people would understand his approach to being a contemporary artist. We finally seem to have reached that point. Haring died of Aids in 1990. The retrospective staged by the Mus\u00e9e d&apos;Art Moderne in Paris is the first to focus on the artist&apos;s political commitment. It aims to present Haring as he wanted to be seen and understood, a daunting task given his prolific output. Indeed the show, which features almost 250 works including large-scale pieces, spills over into the Centquatre, the only public hall able to accommodate them. Another difficulty is that Haring worked in public places \u2013 New York subway stations, billboards and outdoor spaces. This was at the heart of his political approach to art, unusual at a time when most of his contemporaries had turned away from such an engagement. In 1980 he posted simple collages in New York made from press photographs and messages cut from newspaper headlines, such as &quot;Reagan: ready to kill&quot; or &quot;Reagan slain by hero cop&quot;. Such provocative montages mocked newspaper headlines and formed an off-beat commentary on local and international news. Drawn in white chalk or black paint on billboards that hung alongside an advert for, say, Penthouse magazine or a film poster, Haring&apos;s work would be seen by the general public. His fragile and hasty creations were a counter to the medium of mass communication. As his fame grew, Haring and his assistants started producing ever bigger friezes displayed beside New York highways or on university campuses. He accepted commissions for public health campaigns in New York and Barcelona, against nuclear proliferation and against apartheid in South Africa. His was a rationale of intervention, underground in his early work, but soon accepted by the establishment and sought after. Haring&apos;s diary explains the methods for his visual strategy of invading the city. Haring&apos;s model for this was Andy Warhol . &quot;He was the first real public artist,&quot; he wrote in 1987, the year Warhol died. &quot;I honestly think he was the most important artist since Picasso, whether people like it or not, and a lot of them don&apos;t.&quot; Behind this conception of the artist-activist lay Haring&apos;s exceptional gift for drawing, which was apparent from childhood. At 18 he enrolled at Pittsburgh&apos;s Ivy School of Art. However, rather than academic work, what is abundantly clear in the first room of the exhibition is Haring&apos;s fanatical, voluptuous love of drawing. For example, in 1978 with the aim of producing his Manhattan Penis Drawings as fast as possible for sites such as opposite Tiffany&apos;s or the Museum of Modern Art, he invented simple, efficient signs, but never repeated the same composition. His method was to devise pictograms that could be drawn preferably in a single continuous brush stroke. These signs were abbreviations for a human body, a monkey, a hand, a phallus, a caterpillar or a plane. He associated them with geometrical symbols \u2013 crosses, spirals, waves and parallel streaks. When they multiply you have to stand back to distinguish the figurative shapes among the mass of abstract signs. This vocabulary borrows widely, from Aboriginal art to railway signs. Haring was also well acquainted with Picasso, Klee and Dubuffet. Haring rarely uses these signs individually. They mingle, making up scenes and narratives that enable the artist to deploy his political symbolism. Signs are enslaved, chased by police tracker dogs, standing dazed before monkey gods, or sick, dying of Aids. Our initial response to these hieroglyphs of oppression, desire or death may be to admire the prodigious skill with which he produced them. But a much less artistic response follows, emotional, moral or political. Haring has achieved his aim.

The report, compiled by a panel of experts, also warned that North Korea is skirting bans on the import of luxury items, which are distributed by the regime to retain the loyalty of political and military elites. The confidential report, a copy of which has been seen by Reuters, said a combination of financial sanctions, an arms embargo and other measures had &quot;choked off&quot; funding to the North&apos;s nuclear programme. &quot;While the imposition of sanctions has not halted the development of nuclear and ballistic missile programs, it has in all likelihood considerably delayed [North Korea&apos;s] timetable and, through the imposition of financial sanctions and the bans on the trade in weapons, has choked off significant funding which would have been channelled into its prohibited activities,&quot; the report said. The assessment comes months after North Korea conducted its third nuclear weapons test and sent a satellite into orbit in a launch many believe was a test of its ballistic missile technology. Speculation that the country was due to conduct more atomic and missile tests amid last month&apos;s rapid rise in tensions on the peninsula have abated in recent weeks. In a further sign that tensions are easing, it was reported on Wednesday that an adviser to Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, had arrived in Pyongyang to discuss the unresolved abductions of Japanese citizens by North Korean agents during the cold war. Government officials in Tokyo refused to comment on the visit, but the Kyodo news agency said Isao Iijima would stay in Pyongyang for several days and meet senior government and party officials. He is expected to relay Abe&apos;s desire to reopen talks on the abductions, a key sticking point to the resumption of diplomatic ties between the two countries. The UN sanctions document, by a group that monitors the effect of international sanctions, covers the period up to last month, so does not gauge the effects of the latest round of security council sanctions passed in March. It will be left to the UN security council to decide whether to implement the report&apos;s recommendations. They include imposing additional measures against three North Korean entities and 12 individuals, including four senior officials in the ruling Korean Workers&apos; party&apos;s munitions industry department. The report warned, however, that North Korea continues to import items connected to its nuclear and missile programmes and to export similar technology to countries such as Iran and Syria. The report did not single out China, which has come under pressure to rein in its economic support for Pyongyang. Beijing has vowed to implement the latest round of UN sanctions, and the Bank of China recently announced it had closed the account of North Korea&apos;s Foreign Trade Bank, the country&apos;s main foreign exchange bank. A number of other Chinese financial institutions have reportedly taken similar measures against the bank, which the US has accused of funding the North&apos;s nuclear programme. The UN policy of targeting Pyongyang&apos;s banking operations is producing results, the report said. &quot;The panel is highly confident that financial measures of the resolutions in general are being effectively implemented by major banks. &quot;It has concerns, however, about the ability of banks in states with less effective regulators and those unable to afford effective compliance to detect and prevent illicit [North Korea] transfers.&quot; The panel voiced concern about the North&apos;s ability to conduct trade-based money-laundering via front companies and agents posted overseas, with the resulting deliveries of cash used to &quot;pay for illicit procurements and to transfer proceeds of sales of weapons&quot; and items related to weapons of mass destruction. The North is also understood to have sidestepped a UN ban on luxury goods. The report identified several times since May 2012 when the regime procured items such as cars, tobacco, alcohol, consumer electronics and cosmetics by, for example, falsely declaring the goods were bound for diplomatic missions in Pyongyang."}, {"sentences": ["China is attempting to open a new front in its territorial dispute with Japan by questioning Tokyo&apos;s sovereignty over the island of Okinawa, home to 25,000 US troops.", "The two countries are already pushing rival claims to the Senkakus, a chain of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are controlled by Tokyo.", "Washington and Tokyo have agreed to reduce Washington&apos;s military footprint on Okinawa, but the island is seen as key to the US&apos;s ability to respond quickly to maritime provocations by the increasingly robust Chinese navy, as well as a crisis on the Korean peninsula."], "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "Senkaku Islands", "US military", "US news", "US foreign policy"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-15T14:28:44Z", "title": "China lays claim to Okinawa as territory dispute with Japan escalates", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/15/china-okinawa-dispute-japan-ryukyu", "article": "China is attempting to open a new front in its territorial dispute with Japan by questioning Tokyo&apos;s sovereignty over the island of Okinawa, home to 25,000 US troops. The two countries are already pushing rival claims to the Senkakus, a chain of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are controlled by Tokyo. The dispute over the islands, known as the Diaoyu in China, has hit bilateral trade and sent diplomatic relations to their lowest point for decades. Beijing began its attempt to broaden the territorial dispute earlier this month when the communist party newspaper, the People&apos;s Daily, ran an article in which two Chinese academics challenged Japan&apos;s sovereignty over the Ryukyu chain of islands, which includes Okinawa. Luo Yuan, a two-star general in the People&apos;s Liberation Army, raised the territorial stakes again this week, saying the Ryukyus had started paying tribute to China in 1372, half a millennium before they were seized by Japan. &quot;Let&apos;s for now not discuss whether [the Ryukyus] belong to China, they were certainly China&apos;s tributary state,&quot; Luo said in an interview with China News Service. &quot;I am not saying all former tributary states belong to China, but we can say with certainty that the Ryukyus do not belong to Japan,&quot; he added, in comments translated by the South China Morning Post. The potential for more diplomatic clashes over territory comes amid fresh criticism of Japan&apos;s attitude towards its wartime conduct in China and the Korean peninsula. Beijing reacted angrily after the outspoken nationalist mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, said this week that Japan&apos;s forced recruitment of Asian women to work in military brothels before and during the second world war had been necessary to maintain discipline among soldiers. &quot;We are appalled and indignant about the Japanese politician&apos;s comments boldly challenging humanity and historical justice,&quot; Hong Lei, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters. &quot;The way they treat the past will determine the way Japan walks toward the future. On what choice Japan will make, its Asian neighbours and the international community will wait and see.&quot; On Wednesday Hashimoto attempted to clarify his remarks, saying he had not sought to justify the use of so-called comfort women, but was questioning why Japan had been singled out for criticism given that other countries had, he said, operated similar schemes. Okinawa, an island of more than 1 million people, hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops stationed in Japan. Washington and Tokyo have agreed to reduce Washington&apos;s military footprint on Okinawa, but the island is seen as key to the US&apos;s ability to respond quickly to maritime provocations by the increasingly robust Chinese navy, as well as a crisis on the Korean peninsula. In their People&apos;s Daily article, Li Guoqiang and Zhang Haipeng, prominent academics at the government-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Japan&apos;s annexation of the Ryukyu kingdom in 1879 amounted to an invasion, and that the sovereignty issue remained open to question. They pointed out that the kingdom had previously been a Chinese vassal state, adding that the ruling Qing dynasty had been too weak to resist Japan&apos;s advance. &quot;Hanging in the balance of history, the unresolved problem of the Ryukyus has finally arrived at the time for reconsideration,&quot; they wrote. In a later article for the paper&apos;s sister publication, the Global Times, Li said: &quot;Not only is Japan obliterating the truth about the Ryukyu issue, but it is doubling its aggressiveness and making provocations over the Diaoyu issue. Therefore it is necessary to revisit the Ryukyu issue.&quot; China&apos;s foreign ministry dismissed Japanese protests over the article. Hua Chunying, a ministry spokeswoman, told reporters that China &quot;does not accept Japan&apos;s representations or protests&quot;. She said the article reflected renewed interest in the islands in the light of Japan&apos;s provocative actions over the Senkakus. Japan&apos;s government effectively nationalised three of the disputed islets after buying them from their private owners last year, sparking violent protests across China and forcing the temporary closure of Japanese businesses in the country. Okinawa, scene of one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific war, was controlled by the US until it was returned to Japan on 15 May 1972. The continued presence of US troops and military hardware is a constant source of tension with the civilian population, who complain about crimes by soldiers, noise pollution and the potential for accidents involving aircraft. Analysts said China was mistaken if it believed that provoking Japan over Okinawa would add momentum to its claims to the Senkaku islands. &quot;If China&apos;s goal is to hold talks with Japan over the Senkakus, articles like these are counterproductive,&quot; M Taylor Fravel, a Chinese foreign policy expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Associated Press. &quot;As a result, Japan has an even stronger incentive now to stand firm with China and not hold talks.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Even now Tokyo is looking to boost government spending by 2% to 3% as it seeks to generate growth and reduce its almost perpetual 10% annual deficits."], "tags": ["Austerity", "US economy", "Economics", "Business", "Obama administration", "US news", "US politics", "World news", "George Osborne", "Politics", "Office for Budget Responsibility", "Economic policy", "Government borrowing", "Budget deficit"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-15T16:31:43Z", "title": "US budget deficit's fall should make European 'austerians' think again", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/may/15/us-budget-deficit-austerity-stimulus", "article": "If only the &quot;austerians&quot; had listened.

The slide from 2009&apos;s 10.1% budget shortfall is one in the eye for the Tea party and any other advocate of &quot;contractionary expansion&quot;. Worse for the fans of austerity, forecasts published by the US congressional budget office expect the deficit to fall to 2.1% of GDP by 2015 as tax revenues soar. By comparison, the UK&apos;s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), expects a budget deficit on a Maastricht treaty basis of 7.6% this year. Not until 2017 will it fall below the Maastricht maximum of 3%. The Obama administration was regularly battered by critics who said the deficit would balloon without massive budget cuts. The president resisted much of the rhetoric and put in place a stimulus plan. It was weaker than economists such as Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz wanted, mainly because constitutionally required cuts in local state spending went ahead regardless. But it was still a stimulus plan and by last year it was helping millions of workers find jobs and this year is making serious inroads into the deficit. Trevor Greetham, a director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, congratulated the president on his strategy. &quot;The anti-austerity camp will get a boost today,&quot; he said. &quot;It is increasingly clear that the Obama administration was right to put off fiscal tightening and focus reforms in the medium to long term. America is growing its way out of debt. The deficit is shrinking because tax revenues are coming in better than expected and a rise in house prices has seen the two government-sponsored lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, repay some $95bn (\u00a360bn) to the Treasury. &quot;The good US fiscal performance stands in stark contrast to the UK, where front-loaded spending cuts and tax rises have hurt the economy and caused a shortfall in government revenues. The OBR expects the deficit to shrink to a manageable level by 2017 but this forecast, like all of the previous ones, relies on sustained economic expansion of 2-3% a year. It is hard to believe this level of growth will be achieved especially as next month will see another year of cuts tacked on the end of what has become a rolling five-year austerity plan.&quot; Greetham is one of the few City investors to say loudly and consistently that austerity was the wrong medicine. In 2011 he contradicted George Osborne&apos;s message that the UK was like Greece. He said then it was more like the US and should adopt the same remedy. And Japan is moving in the same direction. Even now Tokyo is looking to boost government spending by 2% to 3% as it seeks to generate growth and reduce its almost perpetual 10% annual deficits. Alongside this plan is the expansion of the money supply by the Bank of Japan, which together with the spending boost will be the ultimate test of the Keynesian answer to a slump. Yet many will argue the Obama administration has done enough to show that Keynesianism works and it is only ideology that has hindered growth in the UK and Europe, not the availability of an oven-ready solution."}, {"sentences": ["Maybe it&apos;s the jazz, maybe it&apos;s the Suntory whiskey cocktails ($15-16), but this is Prohibition with a Tokyo-noir twist."], "tags": ["New York holidays", "Bars and clubs", "Travel", "Cocktails", "American food and drink", "United States holidays"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-16T10:33:00Z", "title": "The best speakeasy-style bars in New York", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/may/16/best-speakeasy-style-bars-in-new-york", "article": "Eighty years ago, America&apos;s short-lived flirtation with a ban on alcohol came to an end.

The trailer began with a shot of Ryan Gosling breaking a glass in someone&apos;s face (in Only God Forgives) and ended with Forest Whitaker being stabbed through the ear (in Zulu). Good evening, dignitaries, and welcome to Cannes. &quot;Lights! Camera! Bloodbath!&quot; bellows the headline in today&apos;s Hollywood Reporter, which goes on to quote a programmer&apos;s sheepish explanation that the trailer was &quot;done in a hurry&quot;. In the meantime, festival director Thierry Fremaux is said to be unimpressed, reportedly &quot;deploring&quot; any impression given by the trailer that this year&apos;s lineup offers little more than a heaped buffet of GBH. That, after all, is what the Cannes March\u00e9 is for. Or could it be that the competition and market are slowly switching places? In previous years, the March\u00e9 du Film, round the back of the Palais, was the go-to place for films about axe murderers and chainsaw psychos, nympho killers and snuff maniacs. &quot;It is the first time ever that we kill them with chains,&quot; a producer once told me, perched beside a display for his latest low-rent horror flick. Yet, on this occasion, the balance seems to have swung towards the more saccharine end of the spectrum. The posters (Otto Is a Rhino; My Dog the Champion) are so bright and perky they make your eyes water, and one has to hunt a little harder for the slasher films of old. For all that, the market is still reliably fun and bizarre and has a nice line in rum juxtapositions. A Japanese stall sits a hoarding for Psychic School Wars right next to a hoarding for a remastered version of Tokyo Story. Perhaps they are offering a two-for-one deal. My own double-bill involves screenings of Ashgar Farhadi&apos;s The Past and Clio Barnard&apos;s The Selfish Giant. The first is a wrenching domestic drama, painstakingly managed by the Iranian director (who won an Oscar for his last film, A Separation) and potently played by Tahar Rahim, B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo and (especially) Ali Mosaffa as the sad-eyed &quot;old bushy beard&quot; toiling hard to keep the peace. Farhadi has his characters converse through the plate glass at the arrivals&apos; lounge, the sliding doors of a pharmacy, or the serving hatch at the local restaurant. They are groping for connection, for understanding; anything that will lay the ghosts and put the past to rest. The Selfish Giant is better still: a brilliant, Bradford-set riff on Of Mice and Men, played out with kids and spotlighting the scavengers of a broken society. Barnard conjures up a landscape of muddy forecourts and moribund moorland, where the power cables crackle invitingly overhead. The Selfish Giant is a heartfelt, humane, and at times purely galvanising portrait of the Britain on the margins. When the film&apos;s two heroes, Arbor and Swifty, steer a horse and trap through the grand buildings in the city centre, it&apos;s almost a shock to see them there. They look like visitors from another era, another country; a pair of emerging-world foragers who&apos;ve gatecrashed the developed world."}, {"sentences": ["Using extracts from movies as diverse as ET: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Jane Campion&apos;s An Angel at My Table (1990), Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s An Inn in Tokyo (1935) and Ken Loach&apos;s Kes (1969) \u2013 and many more \u2013 Cousins creates light-flashes of insight by the hundred which amount to a pointilliste work of scholarship."], "tags": ["Cannes 2013", "Documentary", "Cannes film festival", "Festivals", "Film", "Culture", "A Story of Children And Film"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-17T16:25:01Z", "title": "Cannes 2013: A Story of Children and Film \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/17/story-of-film-and-children-cannes-review", "article": "This has to be one of the most beguiling events at Cannes, appropriately presented in the Cannes Classics section. Mark Cousins&apos;s personal cine-essay about children on film is entirely distinctive, sometimes eccentric, always brilliant: a mosaic of clips, images and moments chosen with flair and grace, both from familiar sources and from the neglected riches of cinema around the world. Without condescension or cynicism, Cousins offers us his own humanist idealism, as refreshing as a glass of iced water. He presents movie texts which illuminate and challenge what we imagine to be the &quot;performance&quot; presented to the camera by a child, what we take to be the nature of childhood and by implication the unexamined &quot;adultness&quot; of those grownups variously appearing in, making or watching the film. He suggests that as an artform, cinema has paid more attention to children than any other, perhaps because it is itself in its infancy. Using extracts from movies as diverse as ET: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Jane Campion&apos;s An Angel at My Table (1990), Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s An Inn in Tokyo (1935) and Ken Loach&apos;s Kes (1969) \u2013 and many more \u2013 Cousins creates light-flashes of insight by the hundred which amount to a pointilliste work of scholarship. Just as in his colossal documentary TV series The Story of Film, Cousins takes ideas and runs with them, bobbing and weaving, hopping lightly from movie to movie, free-associating and bopping around but without ever seeming slick or glib. Cousins coolly repudiates parochial Anglo-Hollywood bias; he juxtaposes contemporary films with ones from the distant past, and places emphasis on cinema from Iran, India and Africa. Just as Puck put a girdle around the world in forty minutes, Cousins zooms happily around the circumference of world cinema in an hour and 40. Taking as his starting point a meditation on the artistic gaze of Vincent van Gogh, and then artlessly showing us a film of his niece and nephew Ben and Laura mucking about with toys, he embarks on a subject whose impossible vastness never daunts him. His approach moves away from the conventional idea that movie kids are either horribly mannered, beribboned child stars or saintly simple souls, luminous with non-professional purity and authenticity. The truth is more complex: kids on screen are often wary, blank and guarded \u2013 it is their reserve which creates the electrical charge of drama. But they are often &quot;performative&quot; (as Cousins phrases it), simply showing off and acting out, and it is this entirely natural tendency which can be harnessed for the camera. Elegantly, Cousins gives us a clip of Shirley Temple in Curly Top (1935), singing &quot;When I grow up in a year or three \u2026&quot;, and instead of taking the Graham Greene line of acidly knowing irony, he gently juxtaposes Temple with the theatrically minded children in Bergman&apos;s Fanny and Alexander (1982) and then brings in Vincente Minnelli&apos;s Meet Me in St Louis (1944) and Judy Garland (so recently a child star) singing Under the Bamboo Tree with Margaret O&apos;Brien, and suggests that O&apos;Brien is believably out of tune and that this famous scene is very much like a wedding video. I&apos;d never thought of it like that before. Some of the most powerful or debatable moments are when Cousins shows us children under threat, or themselves offering a threat. In a rather remarkable-looking Polish film called Wrony, or Crows (1994), directed by Dorota Kedzierawska \u2013 another hidden gem which I now feel the need to experience in its entirety \u2013 a 10-year-old child is effectively kidnapped by an older child. Another type of film-maker in the Anglo-Saxon journalist tradition might have decided at this point to discuss the darker themes of exploitation, maybe bringing in the Bulger case (itself partly triggered by a horror movie called Child&apos;s Play 3). But this is not Mark Cousins&apos;s style. It arguably opens him to charges of naivete, but perhaps it is also that his affirmative insistence is a corrective to our 21st-century news-junkie reticence and fear. Either way, this film is a treat. I have only one modest footnote to offer. Mark Cousins shows us his nephew Ben smashing things up and wonders if this is a boyish trait. Well, I wonder: Ben is squaring his shoulders and shoving his fists down into the ground in a very familiar way. Surely he is impersonating cinema&apos;s most destructive and brattish green child, the Incredible Hulk?"}, {"sentences": ["There have been some exceedingly bad weeks over the past five years, including the one in April that began with the Boston Marathon bombings and ended with an earthquake in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Republicans", "US news", "World news", "US political financing", "Democrats", "Barack Obama", "Obama administration"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-17T19:00:00Z", "title": "Six ways the GOP could screw up the Obama administration's scandals | Ana Marie Cox", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/17/six-ways-republicans-could-screw-up-scandals", "article": "There&apos;s something already dangerously smug about the way that the Republican Party \u2013 and the media, for that matter \u2013 have described the past two weeks as the White House&apos;s &quot;worst weeks ever&quot;. There have been some exceedingly bad weeks over the past five years, including the one in April that began with the Boston Marathon bombings and ended with an earthquake in Tokyo. One can plausibly assume that all this schadenfreude about the Obama administration, done in its optics-y, win-the-news-cycle way, seems to be the only way that our political press is capable of talking about scandals. But just because the White House has had a difficult time managing this waterfall of negative stories doesn&apos;t mean that the Republicans on the Hill won&apos;t drown in the torrent. The GOP is the only party, after all, that impeached a sitting president yet still came out more unpopular than the man they targeted for character assassination. Surveying their management of the situation thus far, I&apos;ve had a few ideas about how they might yet snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. 1. Full-volume hysteria over every new detail makes it difficult for normal people to distinguish the issues that are actually important \u2013 within each scandal and among the scandals themselves. Republicans are not so much acting like the &quot;boy who cried wolf&quot; as the &quot;boy who cried and cried and just wouldn&apos;t stop crying&quot;.  And the party itself seems unable to decide from which vat of scandal-tar they could do the most damage. Is it #Benghazi, which the GOP has been hyping for months (with little success)? Is it the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS? That one is easy for a non-wonk to understand, but difficult to prove as having done actual harm. Maybe they should harp on the confiscation of the press&apos; phone records, which doesn&apos;t sit well with civil libertarians but forces conservatives to make common cause with \u2013 gulp \u2013 the media, whom they have trained their base to instinctively distrust.  Gun-rights theologian and political cryptographer Glenn Beck thinks conservatives don&apos;t have to choose! &quot;I want to go back to the name of the scandals,&quot; he said on yesterday&apos;s program. &quot;We have Benghazi, IRS and the AP,&quot; correctly naming all three. &quot;In the end, what do these three scandals have in common? What they have in common is the arrogance of transforming the world.&quot; He has a chart. 2. Speaking of overreaching: overreaching. This is a risk that many Republicans themselves seem to be aware of! Veteran pols told the Washington Post that their compatriots on the Hill should remember, there&apos;s &quot;no need to gorge themselves&quot;, and &quot;[They] need to pace themselves.&quot; Specifically, said another, &quot;The area we have to avoid is not to use the &apos;I&apos; word \u2013 impeachment.&quot; Columnist Charles Krauthammer cautioned that discussion of impeachment \u2013 especially given that none of the scandals have direct connections to Obama, &quot;feeds the narrative of the other side that it&apos;s only a political event&quot;. 3. Which GOP politicians has gleefully ignored this advice? Representative Michele Bachmann, of Minnesota, who slunk away from the spotlight after her embarrassingly close re-election and until recently had hid quietly in her bunker, unable to find other Republicans willing to be seen with her. This week, she was out in front of the cameras again, not just urging impeachment but proclaiming that we should get on with the impeaching already!   &quot;I will tell you, as I have been home in my district, in the sixth district of Minnesota, there isn&apos;t a weekend that hasn&apos;t gone by that someone says to me, &apos;Michelle, what in the world are you all waiting for in Congress? Why aren&apos;t you impeaching the president?&apos;&quot;  I live not too far from Bachmann&apos;s district, and have to wonder where she spends her weekends, and why exactly her constituents aren&apos;t more concerned about cuts in services and the lagging economy. Perhaps she&apos;s just meeting the same constituent over and over again, since the one she quoted this week sounds a lot like the one she quoted in a 2010 interview:  &quot;Everywhere I go, people ask me, &apos;Michele, can we impeach the president?&apos;&quot;  She may be referring to that strident voice in her head, and/or that one guy on the campaign trail who did ask her, &quot;When will we impeach him and get him out of the way? We should be.&quot; Maybe he moved to her district? In any case, the more Bachmann&apos;s wild-eyed conspiracy mongering gets attention, the more the Democratic National Committee raises money. To paraphrase &quot;Arrested Development&quot;: Never promise crazy an impeachment. 4. Similarly, Rep Louie Gohmert (TX) is a GOP nut just waiting to pop out of the can. He blipped into national consciousness this week for a delightful malapropism, which he made during the interrogation of Attorney General Eric Holder over the FBI investigation of the Boston Marathon bombing: He decried that Holder &quot;will not cast aspersions on my asparagus&quot;. Like Bachmann, Gohmert is no stranger to the dog-whistling demographic that continually demands for the president&apos;s impeachment and possible arrest. He whipped up opposition to Obama&apos;s executive order that institute some limits on gun ownership by saying, &quot;the American Revolution was all about fighting such a monarchy.&quot; Even more recently, Gohmert asserted that the administration has ignored the threat of Muslim terrorism because:  &quot;This administration has so many Muslim Brotherhood members that have influence that they just are making wrong decisions for America.&quot;  Gohmert also bears the distinction of being one of the few Republicans to draw a direct connection between limits on gun magazines and bestiality:  &quot;And I pointed out, well, once you make it ten, then why would you draw the line at ten? What&apos;s wrong with nine? Or eleven? And the problem is once you draw that limit; it&apos;s kind of like marriage when you say it&apos;s not a man and a woman any more, then why not have three men and one woman, or four women and one man, or why not somebody has a love for an animal?  There is no clear place to draw the line once you eliminate the traditional marriage and it&apos;s the same once you start putting limits on what guns can be used, then it&apos;s just really easy to have laws that make them all illegal.&quot;  Sure, sometimes an asparagus is just an asparagus, but with the twin obsessions of violence and sex, I see a future Todd Akin in the making. By all means, put this man on television. 5. If Republicans relentlessly pound the IRS&apos;s targeted investigation of conservative groups filing for tax exemption, they remind people that that the IRS had a reason to do so; there&apos;s a substantial amount of evidence that certain conservative groups were, in fact, violating tax law. Republicans this week burned up the internet by pointing to a ProPublica story about the IRS being a little too generous sharing conservative groups&apos; information.  But the story also contained a rather significant detail: ProPublica had initially requested to learn more about a successful investigation into &quot;how dozens of social welfare non-profits had misled the IRS about their political activity on their applications and tax returns.&quot; So, you know, it&apos;s difficult to claim that certain groups were unfairly targeted when some of that targeting turns out to be well-founded. 6. Last but not least, there&apos;s the blatant hypocrisy. The Justice Department&apos;s application of informational thumbscrews to the Associated Press is the scandal nearest and dearest to my heart, the one with which I&apos;m most likely to side with the Republicans. It was a breach of governmental trust; it has a chilling effect on freedom of the press; and it&apos;s a threat to the valuable role whistleblowers play in the unofficial balance of power. It&apos;s everything the Republicans say it is! &quot;A sweeping intrusion&quot;! They &quot;suggest a pattern of intimidation by the Obama Administration&quot;! And, hey &quot;the first amendment is first for a reason.&quot; And the whole thing might have been prevented by a proposed bill that would shield journalists from revealing sources, and that Republicans, including one pronounced fan of first amendment, Darrel Issa, voted against. Certainly, hypocrisy has never stopped a politician from making accusations. You can look back to the Clinton administration and see rampant hypocrisy \u2013\u00a0actually, you don&apos;t have to look back that far at all. But hypocrisy is perhaps the one sin that voters have trouble forgiving, especially if the original scandal has nothing to do with them. And that&apos;s maybe the saddest thing about the whole situation: none of these scandals tie into the concerns that voters keep expressing. Make that &quot;concern&quot;, as &quot;economy and jobs&quot; (or some variation, including &quot;unemployment&quot;) tops every single recent poll, aobve every other perfectly legitimate concern, such as &quot;gun policy&quot; and &quot;health care&quot;, by double digits. Remember the economy? It was the reason Mitt Romney was going to beat Obama, until the magic of his missteps diverted conversation to his personal failings and the GOP&apos;s unrelentingly and backward social policies. What I&apos;m saying here is that as bad as the past couple of weeks have looked for Obama, the Republicans are playing on his court. Obama isn&apos;t on the defensive, he&apos;s just marking time until they make a mistake. They probably already have."}, {"sentences": ["In Washington, Tokyo, Beijing, New Delhi or Moscow, let alone in all other EU national capitals, it seems obvious that the UK needs the union as the platform and vehicle by which to influence events and policy in many spheres."], "tags": ["EU referendum and Brexit", "European Union", "David Cameron", "Foreign policy", "Conservatives", "Politics", "Labour", "Liberal Democrats", "UK news", "Europe", "World news", "Geoffrey Howe"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-18T20:00:04Z", "title": "This is a new, farcical low and David Cameron is losing control | Geoffrey Howe", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/18/david-cameron-control-geoffrey-howe", "article": "Unfortunately, last week&apos;s events in the House of Commons have brought the debate on Europe within the Conservative party to a new, almost farcical, low. Having previously opposed the introduction of legislation in this parliament to hold a referendum in the next one, the prime minister suddenly allowed a free vote among backbenchers, with the government abstaining, on the extraordinary basis that the party had no policy on the issue. Then, once more than 100 backbenchers had voted for such a referendum, he insisted that all Tory MPs, whatever their view, should from now on support the proposal, on a three-line whip, whereas only the day before they could take any position they chose. This saga looks more like the politics of the French Fourth Republic than the serious practice of government and it is especially disappointing and damaging on such an important issue \u2013 the place of Britain in Europe and the world. Sadly, by making it clear in January that he opposes the current terms of UK membership of the EU, the prime minister has opened a Pandora&apos;s box politically and seems to be losing control of his party in the process. The ratchet-effect of Euroscepticism has now gone so far that the Conservative leadership is in effect running scared of its own backbenchers, let alone Ukip, having allowed deep anti-Europeanism to infect the very soul of the party. The risk now is that, if it loses the next general election \u2013 a far from negligible possibility \u2013 the Conservative party will move to a position of simply opposing Britain&apos;s continued membership, with or without a referendum. Archimedes said: &quot;Give me a place on which to stand and lever long enough, and I will move the world.&quot; British foreign policy should be about maximising and exploiting the levers we possess \u2013 whether through Europe, the transatlantic relationship or the Commonwealth \u2013 not breaking them or throwing them away. In this context, I have yet to meet any significant western political figure from beyond our shores who can understand why Britain would even contemplate leaving the European Union, which is now a key point of leverage for this country in the modern world. In Washington, Tokyo, Beijing, New Delhi or Moscow, let alone in all other EU national capitals, it seems obvious that the UK needs the union as the platform and vehicle by which to influence events and policy in many spheres. Nowadays, with the possible exception of Germany, a country such as Britain, boasting about 1% of the world&apos;s population and 3% of the world&apos;s GDP, is unlikely to be able to hold anything like the position of power to which we continue to aspire, unless this is firmly anchored in a strong alliances and, ideally, a credible regional framework. With the decline of Nato, the only such framework available, unless we seek to join the United States, is basically the European Union. The Americans have always wanted Britain to play a leadership role in a united Europe \u2013 from the early 1950s through to today. It has been a constant of US foreign policy that any &quot;special relationship&quot; is not based on nostalgia or some mystical solidarity among the &quot;English-speaking peoples&quot;, but on a realpolitik assessment of our capacity to help shape our continent in a modern, outward-looking direction. Half a century ago, in making Britain&apos;s first application, Harold Macmillan understood this very well. He wrote: &quot;If we remain outside the European Community, it seems to me inevitable that the realities of power would compel our American friends to attach increasing weight to the views and interests of the six in Europe, with others who may join them, and to pay less attention to our own. We would find the United States and the community concerting policy together on major issues, with much less incentive than now to secure our agreement or even consult our opinion. To lose influence both in Europe and Washington, as this must mean, would seriously undermine our international position and hence, one must add, our usefulness to the Commonwealth.&quot; Every one of Macmillan&apos;s words remains as true and powerful today as in 1962 \u2013 except that, first, the six are now the 27; and second, Britain is a much lesser force in world affairs, making the problem he describes more acute. Last week, President Obama called Britain&apos;s membership an &quot;expression of the UK&apos;s influence and role in the world&quot;. Leaving the union would, by contrast, in my view, be a tragic expression of our shrinking influence and role in the world \u2013 and the humbling of our ambitions, already sorely tested by the current crisis, to remain a serious political or economic player on the global stage. Earlier this year, Obama made it clear that America wants &quot;a strong United Kingdom in a strong European Union&quot;, not a weak or isolated UK outside a broken-backed EU. Ironically, his words echoed the &quot;Strong Britain in a Strong Europe&quot; manifesto slogan on which the Conservatives fought the 1994 European elections. Almost two decades later, the Conservative party now needs a US president to tell it what it once had the confidence to proclaim as common sense itself. Another irony was that the prime minister&apos;s main\u00a0business in Washington was to discuss the launch of negotiations for an EU-US free-trade agreement and single market, officially known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. It is the EU, not the member states individually, which will negotiate TTIP. If successful, it will create the largest single open economic area in the world, even bigger than Europe&apos;s existing single market, and help us set global standards in a world where neither Europe nor even America has that leverage on its own. Where would the UK fit into this, as an independent island, stranded between markets of 450 million and 300 million apiece? Outside the EU, we would have to accept the terms of whatever deal Washington and Brussels decide, with us enjoying no meaningful influence on either side. This pattern would be repeated across the board internationally. Outside the EU, Britain would have to renegotiate hundreds of existing EU trade, investment and aid deals with countries all around. I find it difficult to imagine the Japanese, South Koreans or Brazilians queuing up to give us a better deal than 26 (soon 27) other European countries, including Germany, can extract as a bloc. Creating and completing the European single market of 500 million consumers \u2013 a major British objective \u2013 has already brought significant benefits, too often ignored. They include greater competition, lower prices and a wider choice for consumers. If we push for further progress in liberalising services or digital commerce, these gains can be built on, with British firms well placed to take advantage of the opportunities that result. Much of our inward investment also depends on easy access to the \u00a311tn EU economy. Does anyone think that the UK&apos;s revival as a car manufacturing nation is based on the appeal of the British market alone to foreign investors? Last week has shown that the Conservative party&apos;s long, nervous breakdown over Europe continues and what is essentially a Tory problem is now, once again, becoming a national problem. Serious mistakes have been made, but the situation is not irretrievable. What is needed is a mixture of clear thinking, strong leadership and an overriding concern for the national interest, not party management or advantage. If the Conservative party is losing its head, a heavy responsibility now rests with Labour\u00a0and the Liberal Democrats to hold their nerve. In the complex and interdependent world we inhabit today, to walk away from the European Union into the unknown would be a very dangerous choice indeed.

They are swallowed by more than 40 million people, from Beijing to Beirut, knitting a web of happiness from New York to New Caledonia. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, of which Prozac is the best known, are the defining drug of the modern age, the crutch of choice for the worried well. In the US, where one in 10 takes antidepressants, you can buy beef-flavoured Prozac for your dog, trademarked Reconcile. The Prozac revolution has not only changed the way we think about depression (aided by Eli Lilly&apos;s mammoth advertising campaign); it has also changed the way we think, full stop. In his 1993 book Listening to Prozac, the psychiatrist Peter D Kramer explored the ethical issues around the rise of what he termed &quot;cosmetic pharmacology&quot;. With a daily pill people could now banish social awkwardness or the unhappiness of relationship break-ups, forge brassily assertive personae from their once shy selves. Like the Soma of Aldous Huxley&apos;s Brave New World, Prozac was making people &quot;better than well&quot;. Kramer wrote of the &quot;personality transformations&quot; that occurred in a substantial minority of those taking the drug, briefly pausing to speculate as to what impact this might have had on their creativity. While we know, thanks to Kay Redfield Jamison&apos;s Touched with Fire, that poets are up to 30 times more likely to suffer from bipolar disorder than the national average, we have no idea how or if the pills they take to treat the disease affect their creative output. The French writer Henry de Montherlant said that happiness writes white. For me that whiteness was the colour of a 20mg Cipralex pill \u2013 a close cousin of Prozac \u2013 taken at the breakfast table. With the depthless chemical happiness of the drug, a thin layer of snow seemed to fall over my mind, blocking access to strong feeling, cutting me off from the hidden impulses that drove me to write. Sometimes I did feel &quot;better than well&quot;, but more often I was haunted by the uncanny feeling that I was skimming over the surface of my life. Looking back, those Prozac years have a curious, occluded feel, as if viewed through a gauze. To celebrate the drug&apos;s quarter-century, I spoke to other writers, artists and musicians who have taken SSRIs, trying to establish whether they have been a bane or a boon for our collective creativity. I&apos;ve deliberately concentrated on the arts, rather than the sciences. This is partly because, while we&apos;ve all seen Carrie Mathison in Homeland and John Nash in A Beautiful Mind, there is significantly more literature on artists and writers taking antidepressants than on chemists and economists. It&apos;s partly because the arts are my bailiwick: I&apos;m not on &quot;are you on drugs?&quot; terms with that many scientists. We expect our  artists to be, in Baudelaire&apos;s words, touched by &quot;a breath of wind from the wings of madness&quot;. In his book Poets on Prozac, Richard Berlin speaks of &quot;an entire generation of writers who became famed for the dramatic excesses of their psychiatric disorders&quot;. Sylvia Plath sits at the head of a pantheon of artists who took their own lives \u2013 Virginia Woolf, Alexander McQueen, Ernest Hemingway, David Foster Wallace \u2013 and who battered their bodies into submission with drugs and booze (see also Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Amy Winehouse, F Scott Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday). It&apos;s easy to agree with Dryden when he says, &quot;Great wits are sure to madness near allied, / And thin partitions do their bounds divide.&quot; From Heinrich Heine to Edvard Munch, many resisted treatment for their depression, fearing a loss of creative urges. When offered psychotherapy, the poet Edward Thomas replied: &quot;I wonder whether for a person like myself whose most intense moments were those of depression, a cure that destroys the depression may not destroy the intensity \u2013 a desperate remedy?&quot; Sigmund Freud \u2013 who also killed himself \u2013 argued that artistic creativity is a product of neurosis. We deal with the conflicts in our subconscious by making objects out of them. If this, grossly simplified, is the theory behind the link between mental illness and creativity, then the worry for artists is that in banishing their black dogs they are also dousing the flames of inspiration, blunting the edge of their genius. Creativity and pharmacology have a troubled past. Chloral hydrate, used as a sedative for the first half of the 20th century, left patients feeling sapped and sluggish. The playwright Antonin Artaud accused it of lowering his &quot;mental water level&quot;, causing a &quot;diminution of my morality and my intellect&quot;. He finally died of an overdose of the drug. In an unpublished letter discovered in 2001, Ted Hughes revealed that Sylvia Plath was taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) in the days leading up to her suicide. She&apos;d had a negative reaction to a similar drug as a teenager and in the letter, Hughes blames the MAOI and the doctor who prescribed it for her death.     \u2018Prozac was the miracle that saved my life\u2019 But also ... \u2018The secret I sometimes think that only I know is that Prozac really isn\u2019t that great\u2019 Elizabeth Wurtzel, author, in Prozac Nation    Plath&apos;s antidepressant was remarkably similar to Nardil, the drug with which David Foster Wallace struggled for many years. Making little headway with the novel that would be published, incomplete, after his death as The Pale King, Wallace began to wean himself off Nardil. His biographer, DT Max, said &quot;he thought that removing the scrim of Nardil might help him see a way out of his creative impasse&quot;. Instead, he remained blocked and, as his friend Jonathan Franzen put it, &quot;when his hope for fiction died, after years of struggle with the new novel, there was no other way out but death&quot;. This is not the essay in which to debate in depth the efficacy of SSRIs. Irving Kirsch claims \u2013 to my mind convincingly \u2013 in The Emperor&apos;s New Drugs that their benefits have been substantially overstated. What is clear is that their side-effects have not. Apart from stifling the libido, SSRI use has consequences that are particularly significant for artists. A 2009 study by Oxford University, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, found that those taking SSRIs reported &quot;a general reduction in the intensity of the emotions that they experienced&quot;. They described themselves as feeling &quot;dulled&quot;, &quot;numbed&quot;, &quot;flattened&quot;, or &quot;blocked&quot;. If poetry is (as Wordsworth claimed) &quot;the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings\u2026 emotion recollected in tranquillity&quot;, then could Prozac bring artists too little feeling, too much tranquillity? I spent most of my 20s on SSRIs of one sort or another. I was a difficult teenager, expelled from school and lurching from one illegal chemical high to the next. I was prescribed Prozac in the wake of one particularly manic episode and continued to take it on and off for eight years. My GP at university persuaded me to quit for a while, but when I moved to London I found a pharmacy that would sell me my SSRI of choice over the counter, no questions asked. What should have been a temporary buttress ended up forming part of the architecture of my young life. Writing on SSRIs was like swimming in mud. Words came slowly or not at all; emotions were perceived as if at a great distance, alien and remote. Even at a sentence-by-sentence level, I was aware of a certain lag in my writing, a syntactic sluggishness \u2013 the imprint of a brain that was failing to catch up with itself. I missed the hectic moods of my teens where I&apos;d write great (I mean clearly terrible, but great in my mind) stories on my father&apos;s ancient Amstrad, caught up in the flow of words. Fuddled and frustrated, I quit writing altogether and didn&apos;t start again until I&apos;d given up the pills. In a recent Radio 4 documentary, Will Self considered the legacy of Prozac&apos;s first 25 years on the planet. What he didn&apos;t say on air, but admitted to me in a subsequent email, was that he&apos;d had his own run-in with SSRIs. I&apos;d mentioned &quot;Inclusion&quot;, a surreal story in his book Grey Area that satirises the psychopharmacological brouhaha surrounding Prozac. &quot;I was prescribed Seroxat (I believe wrongly),&quot; he wrote in reply, &quot;to help me with withdrawals from a bad crack habit (what&apos;s a good crack habit?). After being on it a couple of weeks, I borderline intentionally took a heroin overdose and nearly died... so, I have a negative view of the drugs.&quot; Self, however, didn&apos;t blame the SSRIs for obstructing his artistic flow: &quot;Heroin, cocaine, marijuana and alcohol were really the drugs that ended up fucking my creativity; the Seroxat was just a way station on the escape ramp to abstinence.&quot; Other writers identified with the creative hamstringing I&apos;d experienced on SSRIs. The novelist Amanda Craig was an early adopter of Prozac in Britain. Suffering from profound depression, she found SSRIs unhelpful, even damaging, despite the brief lift they gave to her mood. &quot;Prozac enabled me to function, but dulled everything,&quot; she told me, &quot;including the shafts of joy that gradually pierce depression. It changed who I was and that included who I was as a writer.&quot; She finally stopped taking the pills and turned her experience of depression into a bestselling novel, In a Dark Wood. Children&apos;s author Lucy Coats is another who found herself blocked by SSRIs. &quot;I&apos;ve been depressed all my life,&quot; she told me, &quot;but it came to a head with postnatal depression after my second child. I was badly depressed and my doctor put me on Seroxat.&quot; Although the drugs offered some relief from her symptoms, it was at a heavy price \u2013 her creativity. &quot;I took it for six months and I felt as if I was walking through this grey world, with all the joy totally stripped out of it. I could feel neither happy nor sad. It was absolutely vile. As a writer, I need to feel emotion of some kind. The creative spark was completely extinguished for me. I had a deadline and I had to ask the publisher to give me more time because I could not write. Everything I wrote was kind of lumpy, disgusting clay and I couldn&apos;t shape it into anything.&quot;     \u2018Had Prozac been available last century, Baudelaire\u2019s \u201cspleen\u201d, Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s moods, the poetry of Sylvia Plath, the lamentations of so many other poets, everything with a soul would have been silenced\u2019 Author Nassim Taleb, in Antifragile    It&apos;s not just authors who have suffered creatively from the effects of SSRIs. I spoke to my brother, Sam, better known as Preston from the Ordinary Boys. Or, if we&apos;re honest, better known for going on Celebrity Big Brother and marrying Chantelle Houghton, one of his fellow housemates. He&apos;s since forged a successful songwriting career. I knew he&apos;d been on Prozac throughout his time in the Celebrity Big Brother house and asked him how it affected him \u2013 creatively and otherwise. &quot;More than anything,&quot; he told me, &quot;it made me really sweaty. And it seems a banal thing, but it was debilitating, particularly as it was a time I was in the public eye. As for creativity, Prozac just makes you a bit &apos;Yeah, OK, fine, whatever&apos; about stuff. You lose the inner critic. And that goes for life as well as art. I got married to someone I&apos;d met on a TV show and didn&apos;t really know. I think if it hadn&apos;t been for the haze of the drug, I might have made better decisions.&quot; I can relate to this (and not just because he&apos;s my kid brother). With my creative blockage came what I later identified as a kind of moral blockage. Because actions didn&apos;t feel like they had consequences \u2013 in that nothing seemed able to shock me from the pallid world the drugs had wrapped about me \u2013 I pushed myself into more and more extreme situations, desperate for a spark of authentic feeling. I was haunted by the sense that I was living in the third person. This inability to feel implicated in my actions had its own creative repercussions \u2013 the characters in my novels seem to lack agency, are buffeted by forces beyond their control (as several reviewers have pointed out). I gave Charlie Wales in This Bleeding City a Valium addiction, but actually what I was describing was life on SSRIs: &quot;With dead eyes and dead hands, I navigated the world. On the way to work in the mornings I pressed a pill into the furry lining of my cheek and felt it melt, bitter and comforting as I sat on the fusty orange seats of the tube and watched flares of electricity light up the darkness of tunnels. I had stopped reading. Instead, I just watched.&quot; For other artists, Prozac has been a life belt thrown as they drowned in a sea of depression. In an exchange of letters with the historian Roy Porter, Zo\u00eb Heller speaks of how, after taking Prozac, &quot;I stopped lying in bed in the middle of the day. I stopped crying all the time. I began to entertain visions of my future that were, if not entirely rosy, then at least not entirely gloom-laden.&quot; The original Prozac pin-up, Elizabeth Wurtzel, is another who claims to have been rescued by the drug (although a careful reading of her memoir Prozac Nation might give the credit to the rather less zeitgeisty lithium). Wurtzel&apos;s book has not aged well \u2013 it is stuck in the 90s, po-faced and narcissistic. It lacks the note of authenticity that characterises the best books about mental illness. Wurtzel is also unsure exactly how she feels about the drug. At one point she gushes, &quot;Prozac was the miracle that saved my life.&quot; Several pages later, though, she admits that &quot;the secret I sometimes think that only I know is that Prozac really isn&apos;t that great&quot;. Writing about depression is difficult precisely because it is a disease that strips us of words, of narrative. One of the most impressive works on the subject is by the Welsh poet Gwyneth Lewis. Her memoir, Sunbathing in the Rain, joins Lewis Wolpert&apos;s Malignant Sadness and William Styron&apos;s Darkness Visible, three books sent back by emissaries from deep within the abyss of depression. Gwyneth Lewis is another who benefited greatly from Prozac.     \u2018I can\u2019t paint on Prozac. It doesn\u2019t feel like me. If I can stay off the coffee, I know that things will get calmer\u2019 Stella Vina, painter    When we first met a couple of years ago at a writing retreat in Norfolk, Lewis was literally wearing rose-tinted spectacles, but the world didn&apos;t always have such an optimistic hue. After a serious bout of depression, she found herself incapacitated, a ghost in her own life. Sunbathing in the Rain is her description of journeying into and, eventually, out of her despair, during which time SSRIs offered &quot;some psychic space, a small but crucial distance between me and the horrors&quot;. I asked her about her experience of writing on the drugs. &quot;When I get ill, I get so ill I can&apos;t write at all,&quot; she told me. &quot;I don&apos;t work when I&apos;m wretched, I work when I&apos;m happy. The antidepressants offered a pathway to effective working.&quot; But there were drawbacks. She stopped taking the pills during a sailing trip with her husband, finding that they rendered her spaced-out and unreactive (and a poor sailor to boot). &quot;I was distanced and dissociated\u2026 I&apos;d see a rock coming towards us and I just wouldn&apos;t move.&quot; She was also aware that the loss of sex drive so common to SSRI users had creative repercussions. &quot;Part of what you feel as a poet is libido towards language. Being on these drugs will change your language use because they change who you are.&quot; For Lewis it was a decision between writing on Prozac or not writing at all. For Keeril Makan, the choice was rather different. One of America&apos;s most celebrated young composers, he struggled for years with a depression that would often find vivid reflection in his work. He describes his music as &quot;informed, almost viscerally, by my depression&quot;, and spiky, atonal pieces such as The Noise Between Thoughts attack the listener with a bleak physical force. Finally, though, he reached a point at which he had to step away from the darkness. &quot;Although I was still composing,&quot; he told me, &quot;it was such an excruciating process and was putting me in contact with these really difficult emotional places. I couldn&apos;t go on with my daily life. I was creating music I was happy with and people were interested in, but I had to live as well.&quot; He started taking the antidepressant Wellbutrin and meditating, and found that his music gained a new depth as he dragged himself out of his depression. &quot;Being on the antidepressants does change the type of emotions I&apos;m experiencing,&quot; he said, &quot;but I think they can be just as interesting. If anything, this helps the composing. I was working on an opera recently and I don&apos;t think I could have written it before. I was too one-dimensional, emotionally. Things were just dark but now there&apos;s both \u2013 dark and light.&quot; I confessed to admiring the raw power of his early work and he chuckled. &quot;It&apos;s true that I&apos;m not as fully immersed in darkness as previously, but I guess I don&apos;t care, because I couldn&apos;t keep doing that. It was a question of living, or creating this music that was negative and violent. I made my choice.&quot;     \u2018Heroin, cocaine, marijuana and alcohol were really the drugs that ended up fucking my creativity; the Seroxat was just a way station on the escape ramp to abstinence\u2019 Will Self, author and broadcaster    It shows how  little we understand of the functioning of the brain&apos;s neurochemistry and SSRIs&apos; effect upon it that a pill that may cause blockages (as it did in my own case) has also been prescribed as a cure for writer&apos;s block. In a Late Show documentary aired in 1995, the psychiatrist and author Oliver James gave five artists Prozac to see what effect it would have on their creative output. Two of them \u2013 the New Order frontman Bernard Sumner and the poet Alan Jenkins \u2013 were blocked when filming began. Sumner, who was working on his Electronic side project with Johnny Marr at the time, was afflicted by a hyper-critical internal voice, and said that the process of writing lyrics was &quot;like breaking a horse&quot;. As he wrote, he&apos;d hear repeated in his head: &quot;You can&apos;t do this, you can&apos;t do this.&quot; I spoke to James about the effect of SSRIs on writer&apos;s block. &quot;What the film showed,&quot; he told me, &quot;was that once you removed the depression \u2013 and Prozac did seem to do that, whether by placebo or not \u2013 people could write. When I first met Bernard Sumner he was clearly blocked and by the end of it he&apos;d written some lyrics.&quot; There was a hitch, though. &quot;What I couldn&apos;t say on the documentary was that he may have done some work, but I&apos;m not sure that it was any good.&quot; This seems to be one of the problems with the use of SSRIs to free up the creative impulse. While, as Gwyneth Lewis said, it&apos;s very difficult to write during periods of intense depression, it may be that we need to be a bit down on ourselves in order to produce good work. James agrees. &quot;On Prozac you become more confident, you&apos;re less aware of other people&apos;s feelings, less worried about what other people might think about you, you&apos;re more able to act as opposed to [being] self-absorbed and stuck. You may be talking crap, producing crap, but you don&apos;t care and just press on. And that&apos;s a real change of personality for some creative types \u2013 to stop caring what other people think. It&apos;s a dangerous game.&quot; We begin to recognise the precarious high-wire act that most creative depressives undertake, trapped between the unbearable pain of their illness and the equally unbearable blockages brought about by their medication \u2013 walking Dryden&apos;s &quot;thin partitions&quot;. We need the critical voices in our heads (mine is that of a reviewer who gave my second novel a mauling on Radio 4), but they mustn&apos;t swamp us with their carping and condemnation. In Touched with Fire, Kay Redfield Jamison looked at manic depressive artists who took lithium, a drug which &quot;inhibits creativity so that the individual is unable to express himself&quot;. She found that, overwhelmingly, the artists either gave up the drug or reduced their dosage &quot;in hope of achieving a kind of controlled cyclothymia [mood swings], willing to take the undulations of power and imbecility in exchange for periods of high enthusiasm and flowing thoughts&quot;. In this essay, I&apos;ve deliberately only quoted artists who would let me use their names in print. This is partly because, post-Leveson, we know that &quot;a close friend&quot; means the journalist made it up, but also because I think it&apos;s important that the subject be addressed in the open. One thing that has struck me while researching this piece, though, is the sheer number of artistic friends and acquaintances who have taken Prozac \u2013 some of whom agreed to be quoted, some who preferred to remain incognito. I mentioned that I was writing this article on Twitter and was contacted by a host of creative types keen to share their experiences \u2013 positive or (more usually) negative \u2013 of working on SSRIs. This is far from a clinical survey, but it does feel like our creative industries are smoothing the jagged surfaces of their lives with SSRIs in astonishing \u2013 even epidemic \u2013 numbers. My conversation with my brother confirms this impression. &quot;Everyone in music is on Prozac,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s like it&apos;s part of the job description.&quot; We know from toxicology reports that Michael Jackson, Michael Hutchence, Heath Ledger and Brittany Murphy were taking Prozac (although for them it was but one of a heady concoction of drugs), while stars such as Sheryl Crow, Robbie Williams and Olivia Newton-John have spoken about their reliance on SSRIs. &quot;It&apos;s partly to do with the stress of the business,&quot; my brother tells me. &quot;If you&apos;re really successful you have little time to yourself, you&apos;re having to sleep when and if you can, you don&apos;t have much control of your life. And if you&apos;re playing a gig in Tokyo on Friday, you can&apos;t commit to therapy, to sitting down once a week and talking through your problems. You never know where you&apos;ll be one week to the next, so you just take a pill and get on with it.&quot; There&apos;s another factor in the celebrity antidepressant narrative \u2013 doctors. &quot;There&apos;s a kind of understanding you come to,&quot; my brother tells me. &quot;Because most people in the music industry use private doctors and it was certainly the case with me that I went to this one doctor because I knew I&apos;d get the drugs I wanted. I was paying and she knew that if she didn&apos;t write the prescription I&apos;d just go elsewhere.&quot; Certain doctors would gain a reputation for being particularly laissez-faire with their prescriptions. &quot;I don&apos;t think it was necessarily that they were corrupt or anything,&quot; my brother says. &quot;It was more that the only people they saw were these neurotic actors and musicians. Now I see an NHS doctor and she&apos;s having all sorts in her surgery so when I come in moaning she&apos;s just like, &apos;Come on now, pull yourself together, you&apos;ll be fine.&apos;&quot; One of the  effects of the Prozac revolution has been an increasing acceptance that mental illness is caused by chemical imbalances in the brain, a simplified standpoint that has been reinforced by the press and celebrity commentators. In a 2011 Larry King Live interview, Jim Carrey came out with some exemplary bio-babble, both meaningless and pernicious: &quot;Certain elements of the brain like tyrosine and hydroxytryptophan\u2026 instead of being a serotonin inhibitor, which just uses the serotonin you have and Prozac and things like that. It just uses the serotonin you have and it doesn&apos;t allow it go back into the receptor. But it metabolises your serotonin after a while and you have to keep taking more and more to feel good. This actually creates dopamine and creates serotonin.&quot;     Photograph: Jonathan Nourok/Getty    Bolstered by heavy drug company spending, the message has been put out there: the brain is an organ like any other; treat depression as you would a stomach upset or broken ankle. This narrative misses the extraordinary complexity of the brain and the very limited understanding we have of its operations. The neurotransmitters which are influenced by SSRIs are intricate and multivalent \u2013 indeed the role of these neurotransmitters in the control of mood was only discovered by accident when examining the effect of the anti-psychotic thorazine on the brain&apos;s chemistry. In her Prozac Diary (1998), Lauren Slater referred to Prozac as a &quot;revolution in psychopharmacology because of its selectivity on the serotonin system; it was a drug with the precision of a Scud missile, launched miles away from its target only to land, with a proud flare, right on the enemy&apos;s\u00a0roof.&quot; Such grandiose claims have faded with time as we come to understand how little we really know about how \u2013 and if \u2013 Prozac works. In Daniel Nettle&apos;s book Strong Imagination: Madness, Creativity and Human Nature, he turns a scientific eye upon the creative process, looking in depth at the types of mental illness associated with creativity. Of particular interest is his work on serotonin \u2013 the neurotransmitter influenced by Prozac. He shows how serotonin systems function to help us to adapt to psychological challenges, reducing anxiety and providing &quot;a carapace against a fickle and confusing world&quot;. When I questioned him about the specific impact of Prozac on creativity, he described serotonin-related drugs stimulating &quot;energy, concentration and an expanded mental horizon&quot;, although he added that, in the decade since writing the book, he had become convinced that Prozac and related SSRIs were much less effective than once thought. It is comforting to believe that, to quote Robert Lowell, the lack of a little salt in the brain is all that stands between us and sanity. Irving Kirsch&apos;s research for The Emperor&apos;s New Drugs suggests, however, that SSRIs are barely more effective than placebos. While the drugs have clearly delivered dramatic benefits to some like Gwyneth Lewis (and, indeed, Oliver James himself, who when he briefly took Prozac in the 90s said he felt &quot;miraculous&quot; on it), it seems to hamper as many creative types as it helps. We need to be sane to work \u2013 being an author requires discipline, doggedness, a rhino-hide for criticism \u2013 but we must also be open to the insanity of creativity. The state of manic flow when we write, paint, compose or merely play is a kind of cogent madness and antithetical to my experience of the drab fog of SSRI &quot;happiness&quot;. Within three weeks of my own Prozac fog lifting, I was writing again. Yes, I still felt down, so down some days that I couldn&apos;t work and buried my head under the duvet, but the trade-off was days when my fingers couldn&apos;t move fast enough over the keyboard, my pen struck sparks from the page. In Deborah Levy&apos;s Swimming Home, the heroine, Kitty Finch, has just quit Seroxat. &quot;It&apos;s quite a relief to feel miserable again,&quot; she says. &quot;I don&apos;t feel anything when I take my pills.&quot; It&apos;s been five years since I took my last SSRI. The happiness I get from my writing is deeper seated and more authentic than anything that could be confected in the laboratories of Big Pharma. The drugs didn&apos;t work for me and, more importantly, I couldn&apos;t work when I was on them. Alex Preston&apos;s novels This Bleeding City and The Revelations are published by Faber &amp; Faber (\u00a37.99) Prozac world: the rise and rise of antidepressants 1988 The first SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), Prozac, is made by Eli Lilly and launched in the US. 1989 The drug reaches the UK. It hit the covers of Newsweek and New York magazine, which described it as the &quot;new wonder drug for depression&quot;. 1991-2001 Annual UK antidepressant prescriptions rise from 9m to 24m. 1994 Elizabeth Wurtzel&apos;s memoir Prozac Nation is published, establishing the drug&apos;s position in popular culture. 1994 The first of many lawsuits concerning side-effects of the drug goes to trial. Joseph Wesbeckerwent on a killing spree in 1989, killing eight before shooting himself. His violence was claimed to be a side-effect of taking Prozac. 1994 Psychiatrist Peter Breggin&apos;s Talking Back to Prozac, critical of the drug, is published. 1995 Prozac is referenced in the Blur song Country House: &quot;He&apos;s reading Balzac and knocking back Prozac\u2026 It&apos;s the helping hand that makes you feel wonderfully bland.&quot; 1998 Prozac Diary, the candid memoir by Lauren Slater, is published. 2000 Zoloft overtakes Prozac as the most popular SSRI in the US. 2001 Prozac (fluoxetine) loses its patent. Eli Lilly loses $35m of its market value in one day and 90% of its prescriptions in a single year. 2004 Prozac is in our drinking water. The Environment Agency says the drug is building up in British rivers and ground-water supplies, probably via the sewage system, but in quantities so dilute they could have no effect. 2008 Antidepressants are now the third most common prescription drugs in the US. 2009 The Lancet ranks the top 12 antidepressants from 117 studies. Zoloft and Lexapro come in first for their combination of effectiveness and fewest side-effects. 2010 One in 10 people in Europe has now taken an antidepressant"}, {"sentences": ["We look at the regulations and the red tape that comes from Europe\u00a0\u2026 and if you go into the boardrooms in New York, or Tokyo or Singapore they think the European economy is frankly a joke.&quot; Their interventions came after Howe lambasted Cameron over Europe."], "tags": ["Conservatives", "Peter Mandelson", "European Union", "Politics", "UK news", "Jeremy Hunt", "Eurozone crisis", "Europe", "EU referendum and Brexit"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-19T10:21:54Z", "title": "Eurosceptics running protection racket in Tory party, says Lord Mandelson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/19/eurosceptics-protection-racket-tory-mandelson", "article": "Tory Eurosceptics are running a &quot;Soprano-style protection racket&quot; in the Conservative party in which they are threatening to burn down the house unless David Cameron caves into their demands, Lord Mandelson has claimed. As the former Tory chancellor Lord Howe warned that the prime minister is losing control of his party over Europe, Mandelson described the Eurosceptics as the &quot;provisional wing&quot; of the Tory party. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, hit back at Lord Howe. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show on BBC1, he said: &quot;I don&apos;t think those views actually represent the reality. The substance is that the Conservative party says if we are going to be successful in that global race we need to renegotiate that relationship with Europe and give the British people a say.&quot; But Mandelson echoed Howe&apos;s warning, though he used a more dramatic analogy. He said: &quot;We all know what&apos;s going on inside the Conservative party. The UK Isolation party and their fellow travellers in the Conservatives are sort of operating a Soprano-style protection racket inside the Conservative party. They are saying: &apos;Do what we want, give us what we are demanding, or we are going to burn your home down.&apos;&quot; The former Northern Ireland secretary even appeared to liken the Eurosceptics to the provisional wing of the Irish republican movement. He said: &quot;Just because one wing - the provisional wing - of the Conservative party want to bring down their leader and change their party&apos;s policy and are using this as an issue to do so is not a good reason to hold a referendum.&quot; Mandelson, who was a close adviser to two prime ministers, offered some advice to Cameron. &quot;Now, in my view, the prime minister has got to say: &apos;Enough is enough. You guys have got to clear off. Take your tanks off my lawn. I am going to lead this party and govern this country in the way that serves its true economic national interest and I am going to do so without being bullied around by a bunch of people whose only interest is to be separate from Europe, not to create the prosperity for Britain and the trade and other economic opportunities by staying within Europe and its single market.&apos;&quot; Mandelson endorsed Ed Miliband&apos;s position on an EU referendum. &quot;On this issue they are right. They are saying yes to a referendum if there is some significant change in the relationship. But no, not an in-out referendum just for the sake of having a referendum, which would be a lottery. You couldn&apos;t predict what the outcome would be.&quot; In a sign of how the Conservative party has shifted in a Eurosceptic direction over the last 15 years, the former cabinet minister John Redwood praised Cameron as he confirmed he had offered advice ahead of his EU speech in January. Redwood, who challenged John Major for the Tory leadership in 1995 over Europe, said: &quot;We went to the prime minister privately and helped him with the Bloomberg speech and we are very happy with his new policy. Now we wish to get on with it.&quot; Hunt said: &quot;If you look at the substance of the issue the Conservative party is absolutely united.

The former chancellor wrote in the Observer: &quot;Sadly, by making it clear in January that he opposes the current terms of UK membership of the EU, the prime minister has opened a Pandora&apos;s box politically and seems to be losing control of his party in the process. &quot;The ratchet-effect of Euroscepticism has now gone so far that the Conservative leadership is in effect running scared of its own backbenchers, let alone Ukip, having allowed deep anti-Europeanism to infect the very soul of the party.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Terrified, the culprit actually hands himself over to the police who must protect someone who sickens them, and transport him to Tokyo for trial through a country now swarming with hostile vigilantes: cops, gangsters, ordinary people with kitchen knives."], "tags": ["Cannes 2013", "Cannes film festival", "World cinema", "Crime", "Thriller"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-20T11:24:09Z", "title": "Cannes 2013: Shield of Straw \u2013 first look review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/20/shield-of-straw-cannes-2013-review", "article": "      I&apos;ve experienced some plot-holes in my time, but this is something else: this is a plot-hole with a circumference to match one of Saturn&apos;s rings. Takashi Miike \u2013 the legendary, prolific Japanese director of extreme movies, including the satirical classic Audition from 2000 \u2013 has dreamed up a bizarrely unbelievable cop suspense thriller. It is put together with technical competence, but is entirely cliched and preposterous, and it implodes into its own fundamental narrative implausibility. In a small Japanese town, a 7-year-old girl is found dead after being raped; DNA evidence fingers a suspect for a previous, similar crime still at large: Kiyomaru (Tatsuya Fujiwara). His name and photo are released to the media and a manhunt begins. But then this little girl&apos;s wealthy grandfather Ninagawa (Tsutomo Yamazaki) offers a billion-yen reward for killing the man. Terrified, the culprit actually hands himself over to the police who must protect someone who sickens them, and transport him to Tokyo for trial through a country now swarming with hostile vigilantes: cops, gangsters, ordinary people with kitchen knives. Everyone is crazy for the cash offer, and this grandfather is actually paying out smaller sums to people who&apos;ve just had a go. Yet no matter how the police try to transport the man, by road or rail, the bounty-hunters seem to know where they are. Could there be a snitch among the cops? Hang on, though. Surely incitement to murder is a criminal offence in Japan? Shouldn&apos;t the cops have arrested this billionaire straight away? And threatened to arrest anyone offering or paying money? That way, they could have removed the market incentive for this mayhem. The billionaire makes a video statement of his bounty-offer via his website which supposedly has an IP address in &quot;Colombia&quot; making the website supposedly impossible to take down. But even if the man himself is in Colombia, extradition isn&apos;t impossible. Everything could be fixed in the first five minutes! The Sweeney could have sorted it. Dixon of Dock Green could have sorted it. The Keystone Cops could have sorted it. But oh no. Basic logic is cheerfully or rather cheerlessly ignored and we get a sort of Assault-on-Mobile-Precinct-13-meets-The-Taking-of-Pelham-123-meets-Reservoir-Canine-Cops. Which would be fine, up to point: after all, it is, in Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s immortal words, only a movie. But if it wasn&apos;t also so boring and ridiculous, then the audience would feel it easier to forget that their collective intelligence had been massively insulted. Actually, the billionaire&apos;s cash offer is so bizarre that it&apos;s possible to believe that it was his cunning psychological ruse to trick the culprit into handing himself in - and that the offer, not seriously meant, had just got out of hand in a group hysteria. However, it is what it appears to be: nonsense. Well, after two long hours, the crude and absurd movie finally expires. Thrillers, however far-fetched, need some plausibility. This has none."}, {"sentences": ["Investors were encouraged by the Japanese government&apos;s optimism, amid signs that Tokyo has inspired the first sustained period of solid expansion in two decades."], "tags": ["FTSE", "Stock markets", "Quantitative easing", "Economics", "Interest rates", "Bank of England", "Business", "Global economy", "Global recession", "Banking", "Financial crisis", "World news", "Financial sector", "Eurozone crisis", "European banks"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-20T18:53:53Z", "title": "Britain is booming?

At a close of 6,755 points, the FTSE 100 blue chip index matched levels from September 2000, just before the market&apos;s fascination with loss-making technology companies such as lastminute.com came to an abrupt end and the dotcom bubble burst. The closely watched index of the 100 biggest companies traded in London is also within sight of its all time peak of the 6,930 reached on 30 December 1999. The FTSE 100 is nonetheless lagging behind many other global markets, including the S&amp;P 500 in the US and the Dax in Germany, which are at record levels. Investors are betting that central bankers, including the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve, will continue their attempts to boost the global economy by printing money and keeping interest rates at historic lows. The buoyant stock market may take some of the pressure off George Osborne as he tries to persuade voters that his emphasis on public spending cuts to re-establish confidence in the economy is working. Bailed-out RBS was also the biggest gainer on Monday, rising 4.5%. Earlier this month, the chancellor narrowly avoided the humiliation of a triple dip recession and since then has enjoyed the first signs that economic activity is picking up, mainly in the services sector and the south-east. Even so, the FTSE 100 \u2013 which only four years ago sank to below 4,000 \u2013 is linked to the the global economy, which accounts for around 70% of sales by FTSE 100 firms. Investors were encouraged by the Japanese government&apos;s optimism, amid signs that Tokyo has inspired the first sustained period of solid expansion in two decades. Signs of growth, albeit tentative, have encouraged a more positive mood among investors, while the long-running eurozone crisis seems to have entered a period of reasonable calm. A number of major deals, the latest being Yahoo&apos;s $1.1bn (\u00a3750m) proposed purchase of blogging site Tumblr, have also helped sustain the rally. The historically low level of interest rates has also made shares more attractive than other investments. Gold and silver, previously considered safe haven investments, have lost their lustre. Since the global banking crisis sent markets tumbling, with the FTSE 100 falling to 3,529 in March 2009, shares have slowly been regaining lost ground, gathering momentum in recent weeks. The turning point came last summer when the head of the European Central Bank said he would do &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to save the euro from collapse. Mario Draghi&apos;s message was taken by investors as a vote of confidence in the 17-member currency club and a signal that a repeat of the Greek crisis would be dealt with swiftly by Brussels. Richard Hunter at the UK&apos;s largest financial adviser, Hargreaves Lansdown, said shares in Britain&apos;s 100 biggest companieswere likely to continue rising this year as long as companies could sustain their current run of profits. &quot;It doesn&apos;t look like central banks are going to stop printing money any time soon. Interest rates are going to remain low. When there is little money to be made investing in government bonds and commodities are volatile, stock markets have become the focus of most investors&apos; attention,&quot; he said. But some City analysts believe the recent positive run could soon come to an end, especially if the central banks turn off the money taps. Julian Jessop at researchers Capital Economics said: &quot;[We] expect a substantial correction in equity prices in the second half of the year, perhaps of the order of 10% for the US and UK markets and 15% for Europe and Japan, most likely triggered by the scaling back of the Fed&apos;s quantitative easing programme and a renewed escalation of the crisis in the eurozone. Assuming global monetary policy remains loose and Europe emerges stronger, the markets should then perk up again in 2014. But we doubt the current euphoria will last throughout 2013.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["My mother, who had led a relatively sheltered life, wrote in her memoir of life with my father: &quot;I had to get used to people being drunk, aggressively or amorously, and to a whole new vocabulary of swearwords.&quot; From 1950 they spent two years in Tokyo, with George as cultural adviser to the UK Liaison Mission, but this was brought to an abrupt end when he had a serious breakdown while on a lecture tour."], "tags": ["Poetry", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-21T15:21:27Z", "title": "Paddy Fraser obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/may/21/paddy-fraser-obituary", "article": "In her lifetime, my mother, Paddy Fraser, who has died aged 94, probably met almost every 20th-century poet of significance writing in English. She was born Eileen Lucy Andrew (but was known as Paddy from birth) in Leeds, and attended Thoresby high school. She then won an exhibition to read English at St Anne&apos;s College, Oxford, where she ran the literary society and met Philip Larkin. After leaving university in 1942 she joined the rapidly expanding Board of Trade, where she had to sequester the factories of clothes manufacturers for war work. She met my father, GS Fraser, the poet and academic, through his sister Jean, who also worked at the Board of Trade, and they married in 1946. My father became part of a Fitzrovia literary set, writing for the poet and editor Tambimuttu and drinking with friends including Lawrence Durrell. My mother, who had led a relatively sheltered life, wrote in her memoir of life with my father: &quot;I had to get used to people being drunk, aggressively or amorously, and to a whole new vocabulary of swearwords.&quot; From 1950 they spent two years in Tokyo, with George as cultural adviser to the UK Liaison Mission, but this was brought to an abrupt end when he had a serious breakdown while on a lecture tour. She returned to Britain with a young daughter and newborn son, while George slowly recovered his mental health. There then followed six years of Chelsea bohemian life, with fortnightly poetry readings at their flat in Beaufort Street. These began with poets reading Shakespeare or Keats, but soon &quot;people would shyly produce manuscripts from their pockets ... Gradually the flat became a sort of informal poetry centre.&quot; The Group \u2013 a poetic tribe who included Peter Porter, George MacBeth, Peter Redgrove and Edward Lucie-Smith \u2013 would &quot;turn up in force&quot;.

She also took a series of jobs (secretary to a Labour MP, writing synopses of newly published novels for MGM) to eke out my father&apos;s earnings as a freelance literary writer. As she wrote, she was &quot;trying to run an orderly bourgeois life in a bohemian society&quot;. It helped that she was naturally sociable and loved giving parties. In 1958 they moved to Leicester, where George became a lecturer in English at the university. There followed more than 20 years of much more settled life, with jobs for my mother in teaching and adult education, until George&apos;s early death in 1980. She had a lifelong passion for the theatre, sat on the board of the Haymarket theatre in Leicester, and enjoyed visits to Stratford-upon-Avon. Her happy 33 years of marriage were followed by 33 years of widowhood, during which she continued to be engaged with writers (through the Leicester Poetry Society), and had many friends. It gave her great pleasure in her final weeks to read the reviews of her granddaughter Blanche McIntyre&apos;s production of The Seagull.

But it&apos;s rare for a series to keep on building as it matures into its fourth, fifth and sixth episodes, as Fast &amp; Furious has done. The first three films in the franchise all opened below \u00a33m in the UK, before the fourth picture, confusingly called just Fast &amp; Furious, debuted with a shade under \u00a35m in 2009. Fast &amp; Furious 5 pushed a little further two years later, kicking off with \u00a35.33m, including \u00a31.30m in previews. Now Fast &amp; Furious 6 arrives, screaming out of the starting block with a stunning \u00a38.72m. That&apos;s enough to make it already the third-biggest Fast &amp; Furious film at the UK box office, behind only the fifth (\u00a318.5m) and fourth (\u00a313.7m) in the series. While the little-heralded original film The Fast and the Furious opened strongly in the US, stunning observers with its $40m debut in June 2001, it failed to repeat the trick in the UK three months later, hampered by landing in our cinemas just three days after the 9/11 terror attacks. Cumulative UK grosses for the first three pictures run as follows: The Fast and the Furious, \u00a36.6m; 2 Fast 2 Furious, \u00a37.7m; Tokyo Drift, \u00a35.8m. Distributor Universal is reporting that the Fast &amp; Furious 6 number is its biggest-ever three-day opening, and points out that it&apos;s also the biggest 2D opening of 2013 so far. Recent Fast &amp; Furious films have opened over Easter weekend, delivering strong numbers and, in industry parlance, owning the date. May is traditionally when the top blockbusters of the year start arriving, and represents a time when rewards can be bigger, but competition fiercer. Universal took a gamble by grabbing the 17 May date, only a week after Star Trek Into Darkness, and facing off against The Great Gatsby, which admittedly is targeting a different audience. It&apos;s a risk that has handsomely paid off. The runner-up After one of the most highly visible publicity campaigns of recent times, some might be surprised to see The Great Gatsby so comprehensively overshadowed by yet another helping of auto mayhem. But Warner Bros will probably be pretty happy with its UK number: \u00a34.10m, including previews totaling \u00a3676,000. By rule of thumb, that&apos;s slightly down on the US result: a $50m opening there would usually suggest a UK debut at around \u00a35m. But it&apos;s still pretty healthy for a period literary adaptation or a film directed by Baz Luhrmann. Moulin Rouge opened in 2001 with \u00a32.40m, and Australia followed in 2008 with \u00a31.29m, achieved over the Boxing Day weekend. The Aviator \u2013 which, like The Great Gatsby, stars Leonardo DiCaprio and is set, initially at least, in the 1920s \u2013 took \u00a31.31m from its first weekend of wide play in January 2005. Ignoring the Thursday previews, The Great Gatsby was in fact beaten into third place by Star Trek Into Darkness, which fell an acceptable 46% in its second frame, for an 11-day total of \u00a315.6m. That&apos;s less than \u00a36m behind the lifetime total of the previous Star Trek film, which maxed out here with \u00a321.4m. The big fallers With Fast &amp; Furious 6 and The Great Gatsby providing tempting attractions to large and diverse audiences, it&apos;s no surprise to see existing pictures taking a tumble. Virtually every film fell by at least 50%, and some significantly more, exacerbated by plunging screen counts, as mature titles were tossed out of plexes to make way for the two big newcomers. Campus comedy 21 and Over fell an alarming 81%, while Gerard Butler actioner Olympus Has Fallen dropped 82%. Lionsgate will be plenty happy with the latter film, however, thanks to a gross so far of \u00a36.1m. The alternatives Since The Great Gatsby is capable of playing arthouse cinemas as well as multiplexes, wooing an upscale and older crowd with the credentials of source material, cast and director, most independent distributors gave the date a miss, and will try their luck at a less competitive time. New releases were thin on the ground, and existing niche titles saw audiences shrink. In the circumstances, Jeff Nichols&apos;s Mud did well to fall by only 46%, while Pedro Almod\u00f3var&apos;s I&apos;m So Excited and Derek Cianfrance&apos;s The Place Beyond the Pines dropped 67% and 71% respectively. StudioCanal will be more than pleased with Pines&apos; \u00a33.3m total. In the US, it managed $20.6m, so a UK total just over \u00a32m would be more expected. The future Thanks to the arrival of Fast &amp; Furious 6 and The Great Gatsby, overall the market was 30% up on the previous weekend and 48% up on the equivalent frame from 2012, when Sacha Baron Cohen comedy The Dictator was the top new release. Now Wednesday sees the arrival of animation Epic, from Fox&apos;s Blue Sky Studios, the makers of the Ice Age movies. Epic has already played previews at the weekend, but these takings have not been officially reported, and will instead be added to the five-day opening, delivering a &quot;weekend&quot; figure made up of play on seven days. Then on Thursday, The Hangover: Part III lands, targeting a market that has been missing a major comedy for quite a while. Assuming strong holdover business from the current hits, the weekend should deliver another cash bonanza for cinemas. Top 10 films 1. Fast &amp; Furious 6, \u00a38,717,534 from 462 sites (New) 2.

There have only been a handful of occasions when declines have been seen equivalent to that overnight in Tokyo \u2013 the last of them following the tsunami two years ago. What is remarkable about the sell-off in the Nikkei, however, is not its size but the fact that it has been so long in coming. For the past year, financial markets have been in bullish mood \u2013 prices of shares, bonds and property have all been rising even though Europe is in a prolonged double-dip recession, the recovery in the United States has been poor by historic standards and China is losing momentum. But after relentlessly turning a blind eye to bad data, markets responded badly on Wednesday night to rising Japanese bond yields, a weak business survey from China and mixed messages from Washington about the future of quantitative easing. The reason markets have been rising has, of course, nothing to do with real economic conditions and everything to do with the willingness of central banks to print money. In effect, investors have been able to play in the casino with chips liberally provided by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and \u2013 more recently \u2013 the Bank of Japan. Unsurprisingly, they have been having a fine old time of it. After such a strong rise, some correction has always been inevitable. The real question, however, is whether this is a pause for breath or the start of something more serious \u2013 a crash of the sort seen in the early 2000s or during the great recession of 2007-09. Almost certainly, it will be the former. Central banks may well be inflating the biggest financial bubble the world has ever seen, the popping of which would trigger a second global slump, but they are convinced they know what they are doing. Extra liquidity, they believe, will feed through into higher business and consumer confidence through a wealth effect, and this will put the global economy on a stronger growth path. Given the choice, they prefer to have the problem of asset prices going through the roof than the problem of deflation. If they are wrong and the bubble bursts before the recovery arrives, it will be the mother of all credit busts. The central banks are now in a very tricky position. Financial markets are so hooked on the electronic money created through quantitative easing that they cannot cope without it. One of the reasons for Wednesday night&apos;s market tumble was the release of Fed minutes showing that some members of the bank&apos;s policy-making committee want to see a tapering in the pace of asset purchases. This ran counter to the testimony the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, gave to Congress on Wednesday, in which he made it clear that he wanted QE to continue at its current rate. Bernanke will win this argument. Following the example of his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, the current Fed chairman will ensure the provision of extra liquidity every time the financial markets take a major tumble. Bernanke is now locked into providing his version of the Greenspan put, whereby Wall Street knew that at some point the Fed would bail out investors with an easing of policy. In the short term, a commitment to keep the money taps full on will do the trick. Market corrections will be followed by soothing words and policy easing by central banks, and this will prompt further buying of assets. In the end, of course, this increases the chances of an almighty bust. That indeed looks likely.

Yuichiro Miura, who has had four heart surgery operations, reached the top of the 8,848m (29,028ft) mountain at 9am local time on Thursday, according to reports from Kathmandu. Miura, a fearless adventurer who skied down the mountain from the South Col in 1970, said he felt great after reaching the summit via the south-east ridge route, which was established by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay six decades ago. &quot;I made it!&quot; Miura said in a phone call from the summit to his home in Japan that was captured by the broadcaster NHK. &quot;I never imagined I could make it to the top of Mount Everest at age 80. This is the world&apos;s best feeling, although I&apos;m totally exhausted. Even at 80, I can still do quite well.&quot; But Miura could soon see his achievement surpassed by a fellow octogenarian whose record he beat this morning. As the Japanese climber celebrated, 81-year-old Min Bahadur Sherchan, who set the previous record when he climbed Everest aged 76 in 2008, was at base camp preparing his own assault on the peak for early next week. Miura&apos;s successful ascent has reignited a rivalry that has captivated the climbing world since the pair arrived on the summit within a day of each other in 2008. Miura reached the summit on 26 May that year aged 75 years and 227 days, according to the Guinness Book of Records. But Sherchan had reached the top a day earlier, aged 76 and 340 days. Sherchan, a former Gurkha, is reportedly on schedule to begin his attempt, despite recently suffering from a digestive complaint. &quot;Our team leader has just arrived back at base camp and we are holding a team meeting on when exactly I will head up to the summit,&quot; Sherchan said in a phone call. &quot;I am fine and in good health. I am ready to take up the challenge. Our plan is to reach the summit within one week.&quot; Miura, however, has tried to play down his rivalry with Sherchan. &quot;The record is not so important to me,&quot; he said last month. &quot;It is important to get to the top.&quot; Whichever man appears in the record books once Sherchan has completed his attempt, both have a long list of mountaineering milestones to their names. Miura climbed Everest in 2003, at the age of 70. By 1985 he had skied down the highest mountains on all seven continents, a feat achieved by his late father, Keizo, who skied down Mont Blanc when he was 99. When younger, Miura also descended Mount Fuji on skis, aided by parachutes. He trained for the latest Everest climb by hiking in Tokyo with weighted packs and working out on a treadmill in a special low-oxygen room at home. Sherchan, whose only obvious concession to age is the use of a hearing aid, began his career more than 50 years ago when he climbed the 8,166-metre (26,790ft) Mount Dhaulagiri in Nepal. He walked the entire length of the country in 2003. By Wednesday, Miura, accompanied by three other Japanese climbers, including his son, Gota, and six Nepalese sherpas, had reached the steep, icy, oxygen-depleted area on Everest known as the death zone. Writing on his website before he reached the summit Miura said he was making the climb to challenge his &quot;own ultimate limit&quot;. He wrote: &quot;It is to honour the great mother nature. And if the limit of age 80 is at the summit of Mount Everest, the highest place on Earth, one can never be happier.&quot; Miura&apos;s compatriot, Tamae Watanabe, became the world&apos;s oldest woman to climb Everest at the age of 73 in 2012. Miura&apos;s ascent has been the subject of widespread media coverage in Japan. A recent broadcast included photographs of the climber and his team drinking green tea and eating sushi in their tent. As Sherchan prepares to disappoint Miura a second time, his biggest challenger could be the mountain&apos;s notoriously unstable weather, with the favourable conditions that helped the Japanese adventurer to the top on Thursday expected to deteriorate from Friday. Miura is not the first record-setter on Everest this climbing season. Raha Moharrak, 27, became the first Saudi Arabian woman to conquer the peak, while Sudarshan Gautam, a 30-year-old Nepali-born Canadian who lost both arms in an accident, became the first double amputee to make the summit.

But the country&apos;s leading distiller has been revolutionising drinking culture with the aid of a pint glass and a more than generous slug of soda. The whisky highballs introduced by Suntory, the privately owned Japanese drinks conglomerate that has the lion&apos;s share of the country&apos;s whisky market, seem to have worked. Sales have been up more than 10% a year over the past three years. The group&apos;s Yamazaki distillery on the\u00a0outskirts of Japan&apos;s imperial city, Kyoto, is the home of Japanese whisky and this year is celebrating its 90th anniversary. It is often forgotten outside Japan that as well as importing large quantities of scotch, the Japanese make their own malts. Indeed, more than 80% of the domestic market is accounted for by whisky produced in Japan. As in the UK, whisky drinkers were by tradition male and relatively old, but targeting younger drinkers with the highball has changed all that. &quot;Domestic consumption was declining up until three years ago,&quot; said\u00a0Hiroyoshi Miyamoto, the former general manager at Yamazaki and now Suntory&apos;s global brand ambassador, &quot;but\u00a0it all turned around in 2009 when we introduced the highball. That changed the attitude of Japanese consumers.&quot; Miyamoto said younger drinkers found old-style whisky bars intimidating, so Suntory was developing a new generation of highball bars and getting its cheaper\u00a0whiskies into other bars where they could\u00a0be sold as an alternative to beer. The capital, Tokyo, has plenty of the old and the new. The ultimate secret city, it has an estimated 300,000 bars, many hidden in basements or office blocks. Campbell Toun Loch, a subterranean bar in the Ginza district which despite the eccentric spelling does indeed prove to be full of whisky, seats just eight. It is no bigger than a large cupboard, but contains hundreds of bottles of whisky, three deep on the counter. When you order, the barman plonks the bottle down in front of you as if he expects it to be polished off. This is a bar for the connoisseur. In some of the more formal bars, there are rocking chairs and oak panelling. The atmosphere resembles that of a gentlemen&apos;s club. Bartenders in ties and waistcoats theatrically chip away to make the perfect iceball, over which the spirit is lovingly poured. This is whisky drinking as performance art. At the other end of the scale is Marugin, a noisy, bustling bar in the heart of Ginza district, full of salarymen who have just finished work and are desperate to let off steam. Whereas Campbell Toun Loch caters for the solitary, late-night drinker, Marugin attracts lively early-evening groups, eating, smoking and knocking back highballs. Marugin even has whisky on draught, a trend Suntory is keen to encourage despite the high cost of maintaining the pumps. &quot;We are trying to create a buzz around whisky,&quot; said brand manager Keita Minari. &quot;A popular TV programme in Japan picked up on Marugin and the new trend for drinking highballs, and it said people there were drinking whisky more than beer. When you are having a meal, whisky doesn&apos;t stay in your stomach, unlike beer where you get full very easily.&quot; There are, though, no immediate plans to transplant the whisky-drinking revolution to Europe, where Suntory&apos;s brands \u2013 principally the Yamazaki and Hakushu malts \u2013 are premium products. &quot;We have to do these things step by step,&quot; said Minari. &quot;Scots are coming to Japan, seeing the phenomenon of the highball and saying we should do the same thing in the UK, but it&apos;s too early. Our share of the UK market is very small\u00a0compared with scotch whisky. At the moment we still have to let people know that Japan is making whisky.&quot; Japanese whisky exports to the UK and Europe used to be negligible, but when Yamazaki 12 Years Old won a gold award at the International Spirits Challenge in 2003, Suntory decided to try to take on scotch on its home ground, and now has a foothold in the\u00a0market. Shunichi Ninomiya, senior general manager in Suntory&apos;s international liquor division, said the company had to be careful not to undermine its premium image in the UK and Europe by introducing cheaper brands such as its Kakubin blended whisky, the biggest-selling whisky in Japan. If it did go down the highball route in western markets, he said, it would probably be via its premium malts. Draught whisky and whisky in cans \u2013 available in vending machines in Japan to consumers with an ID smartcard to prove their age \u2013 are still a long way off in the west. Asked about the dangers in targeting younger drinkers and setting up whisky as a rival to beer, Minari insisted the Japanese were less prone to binge drinking than the British. Yet just opposite Marugin I saw a young salaryman clearly the worse for drink lying comatose in the street. A few minutes later, ambulance personnel were attending to him. I have no idea what he was drinking, but it does seem that not every young Japanese drinker knows when to stop. &quot;Regulation is loose in Japan,&quot; admitted a spokesman at Suntory&apos;s ad agency, &quot;but we are trying to champion responsible drinking. We are conscious of our position in society, and communication-wise we make sure it&apos;s delivered in a correct manner.&quot; The chief operating officer of the international liquor division, Satoru &quot;Tiger&quot; Abe \u2013 senior executives in Japan tend to be named after golfers \u2013 insisted that the increasing consumption of highballs made anti-social drinking less likely, because the whisky was heavily diluted and usually accompanied by food. He hopes the salaryman on the pavement in Ginza will be the exception, and this is one revolution that can be carried out without victims."}, {"sentences": ["Japan issued an apology to the surviving women in 1993, but its refusal to provide official compensation is a long-running source of tension between Tokyo and Seoul.", "Ties between Seoul and Tokyo have been strained by contrasting interpretations of Japan&apos;s wartime conduct, and  a feud over Takeshima, a group of islands claimed by both countries."], "tags": ["Japan", "South Korea", "Second world war", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "War crimes", "Law"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-24T11:26:14Z", "title": "Wartime sex slaves cancel meeting with controversial Japanese mayor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/24/wartime-sex-slaves-controversial-japanese-mayor", "article": "Two South Korean women who were forced to work in Japanese military brothels before and during the second world war have abruptly cancelled a meeting with the mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, whose controversial comments about wartime sex slaves have soured relations between Japan and its neighbours. The cancellation came as Japan and South Korea became embroiled in another row over a column in a South Korean newspaper that said the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were &quot;divine punishment&quot; for Japan&apos;s wartime aggression. Kim Bok-dong, 87, and Kil Won-ok, 84, had been scheduled to meet Hashimoto in Osaka on Friday to discuss his recent claim that Japan&apos;s military brothels had been &quot;necessary&quot; to maintain discipline among frontline troops. As many as 200,000 &quot;comfort women&quot;, mostly from the Korean peninsula and China, were forced to have sex with Japanese troops before and during the war. Japan issued an apology to the surviving women in 1993, but its refusal to provide official compensation is a long-running source of tension between Tokyo and Seoul. Hashimoto, who doubles as co-leader of the rightwing Japan Restoration party, whipped up a diplomatic storm earlier this month when he said Japan had been unfairly singled out for criticism, given that other countries operated similar brothels. &quot;To maintain discipline in the military it must have been necessary at that time,&quot; said Hashimoto. &quot;For soldiers who risked their lives in circumstances where bullets are flying around like rain and wind, if you want them to get some rest, a comfort women system was necessary. That&apos;s clear to anyone.&quot; Hashimoto caused further controversy when it emerged that, during a visit to Okinawa, he had told a US commander that American troops on the island should use the legal sex industry as a way of cutting the number of sexual assaults against local women. US state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called Hashimoto&apos;s remarks &quot;outrageous and offensive&quot;. &quot;What happened in that era to these women who were trafficked for sexual purposes is deplorable and clearly a grave human rights violation of enormous proportions,&quot; she said. Kim and Kil said they were concerned that Hashimoto would attempt to use Friday&apos;s meeting, due to be held in front of the media, to quell criticism, adding that he had yet to issue a formal apology for his comments. &quot;The indescribably heartwrenching reality and history of the victims cannot be traded with his apology performance and sweet talk,&quot; the women said in a statement issued by an organisation representing former sex slaves. &quot;We do not want to kill ourselves twice. If he truly feels sorry to us and regretful, he must take back his criminal comments and make a formal apology. He should take responsibility for his wrongdoing and retire from politics.&quot; The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has also questioned claims that the women were forced to work in the brothels \u2013 known at the time as comfort stations. Before he took office in December, Abe had advocated revising a 1993 statement by the then chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, acknowledging the military&apos;s role in coercing the women, and apologising to them. But Abe later said he would honour the statement, and distanced himself from Hashimoto. Ties between Seoul and Tokyo have been strained by contrasting interpretations of Japan&apos;s wartime conduct, and  a feud over Takeshima, a group of islands claimed by both countries. The territory, known in Korea as Dokdo, is administered by Seoul. Japan on Friday lodged a second complaint about the JoongAng Ilbo column, which appeared on Monday. The foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, said the Japanese embassy in Seoul had told the newspaper that Japan &quot;can never accept this kind of view about the atomic bombs&quot;. Kishida said he hoped the newspaper was aware of the &quot;surprise and fury&quot; it had caused in Japan. The column sought to justify the August 1945 attacks, in which more than 200,000 people died, saying: &quot;&quot;God often borrows the hand of a human to punish the evil deeds of men.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The video finds them on a fancy-dress trip round Tokyo and looks loads of lolz, but such pastiche is more fun for them than it is for us."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Jennifer Lopez", "Suede", "Muse", "Carly Rae Jepsen", "Nicki Minaj", "Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor", "Laura Marling", "Pop and rock"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-24T12:00:00Z", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Feat Pitbull, Suede, Muse: this week's new tracks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/24/this-weeks-new-tracks", "article": "PICK OF THE WEEK Jennifer Lopez Feat Pitbull Live It Up (Capitol)      Reading this on mobile?

EasyJet is up 165% and Lloyds 131%, although the worst-performing companies in the index, Eurasian Natural Resources and Evraz, are down 43% and 53%. Of the 2,000 unit trusts available to small investors, Japanese ones, even after Thurday&apos;s falls, have performed best, followed by formerly bombed-out funds in Europe. For example, Artemis&apos;s European Growth fund is up 54% over the past year, while Legg Mason&apos;s Japan fund has risen by 110%. Among investment trusts it is a similar story, and not just in Europe and Japan. For example, Henderson&apos;s UK Smaller Companies investment trust has jumped 66% over the past year. Even the average fund invested in UK shares is ahead 34% over the year. Scores of websites will help you make decisions about investments. The Financial Conduct Authority, which replaced the Financial Services Authority, has a vast array of consumer\u00a0information on investments, how to shop around, and your rights, although it won&apos;t give advice on where to invest. To research shares, one of the easiest sites to use is Yahoo Finance at uk.finance.yahoo.com. Stockbrokers also have sites promising to hold your hand through the share-buying process, such as Hargreaves Lansdown (hl.co.uk), the Barclays Investor Zone (barclays.co.uk) and Halifax Share Dealing (halifax.co.uk).

More experienced investors may want to try citywire.co.uk, a good\u2011quality, well-resourced news site for the more professional investor, providing updates on share prices, fund performance, top fund managers, directors&apos; dealings, news archives and so forth. Or you can talk to like-minded people keen to start investing. As book clubs do for literature, investment clubs bring together people with an interest in investing.

You&apos;ll be pushed into paying thousands of pounds for information you can find free elsewhere on the web. Step 2 Choosing an investment  Investing is about taking risk, but reducing that risk by spreading your money around and allocating your cash sensibly. So where do you start?  \u2022 How much can you afford to invest? Be realistic \u2013 it&apos;s better to pay down debts first, or perhaps pay into your company&apos;s pension scheme if the company also contributes. Do you have a lump sum to invest, or are you going to invest every month? Many experts say it is better to drip-feed your money into shares and funds over the long term, to help iron out the rough and smooth periods. \u2022 What&apos;s your timeframe? If you&apos;re under 50 and saving for a pension, then it&apos;s sensible to take higher risks and invest knowing you won&apos;t need the money for 10 years. If you&apos;re saving for a mortgage deposit in a couple of years, then don&apos;t put your cash in just a few shares that might be plummeting when you need to cash in. \u2022 Diversify your investments. Mix and match some blue-chip shares in big, safer companies with smaller investments in riskier, but potentially higher growth, smaller ones. Put money into emerging markets \u2013 but not everything. Japan was the laggard of the last two decades but even after the falls late this week has been the strongest market of the last 12 months. If you had a small allocation in Japan, at least you&apos;d be enjoying some of that gain. Meanwhile the Shanghai market is below where it was a year ago - so may be a better bet for the year ahead. \u2022 Consider ethical funds. Of the big ones, Standard Life Investments&apos; European Ethical fund has notched up a gain of 44.3% over the last 12 months, while over three years its UK Ethical fund has returned 75%. Step 3 How to buy and sell To buy or sell shares, there are dozens of online &quot;execution only&quot; brokers with relatively low charges. Expect to pay commission and a possible annual fee for holding the shares for you (called custody), with charges dependent on how frequently you trade. Halifax Share Dealing, Saga (provided by Barclays) and Hargreaves Lansdown all charge \u00a311.95 per trade. They claim you can open an account and start trading within minutes, once you&apos;ve made a minimum initial deposit. To buy or sell funds, your best bet is the investment &quot;platforms&quot; that allow you to buy, sell and manage all your investments \u2013 including Isas and self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) \u2013 in one place online. The biggies here are Alliance Trust&apos;s i.nvest platform, Hargreaves&apos; Vantage and Fidelity&apos;s fund supermarket (which sells a wide range of funds, not just Fidelity&apos;s). These are not just platforms for buying \u2013 for example, Fidelity offers lots of guided portfolios and &quot;expert picks&quot; for the novice investor. Step 4 Keep the charges low It&apos;s easy to waste money on unnecessary charges. The number one rule is: avoid the daft &quot;initial fee&quot;, which can be up to 5.5% of the sum you are investing. If you put \u00a35,000 in, say, the UK&apos;s biggest fund, Invesco Perpetual High Income, then \u00a3250 will go out the door in initial charges, plus another 1.5% of the value of the fund every year in annual management charges. The fund platforms named above will discount most initial fees to zero and there are discount broker sites such as chelseafs.co.uk and bestinvest.co.uk that offer funds cheaply. Cavendish Online is probably the cheapest place to buy, as it gives a rebate of not just the initial charge but also part of the annual charge as well. Generally, buying direct from a fund management company is a bad idea, as you will have to pay the hefty initial charges, but some are offering DIY investors better deals. Fundsmith.co.uk, sells its top-performing global equity fund to small investors for a 1% charge. Step 5 Monitor and move You should think of investments in shares and funds as long-term and avoid trading regularly, as your returns will be eaten up with charges. But use the huge variety of online tools to keep\u00a0an eye on your portfolio. Many will allow you to switch from one fund to another for a\u00a0charge of around\u00a00.25%.

His analysts at Elliotwave.com reckon the crash, when it comes, will be worse than any in living memory: &quot;We expect to see a bear market that&apos;s more severe than anything we&apos;ve seen in close to 80 years. The corrections of 2000-2002 and 2007-2009 were only the opening salvos of this bear market.&quot; A &quot;tell-tale sign&quot; of a coming market meltdown is widespread complacency among investors, with Prechter citing a recent survey of US money managers in which all but 6% expect shares to continue rising between now and 2018. Gerald Celente of the Trends Research Institute is another market forecaster popular on US television after predicting the 2008 financial crisis. He thinks stock markets could continue to rise through to 2014, buoyed by central bank QE programmes: &quot;There are other sound reasons for stock markets making new highs. Among them, with interest rates at or near zero, it makes no sense for people to pursue that quaint old practice of having a &apos;savings account&apos;.&quot; But he calls it a &quot;false recovery&quot; and sees equity markets back in decline once the props are removed by central banks: &quot;Despite these ongoing massive and unprecedented money pumping schemes, the employment sector remains under pressure, most of the jobs that have been lost over the past five years paid middle-income wages while most of the new ones being created pay low wages.&quot; But critics argue that the forecasters are rather like a broken clock stuck at 12, which tells the right time only twice a day. Financial adviser Brian Dennehy reminds investors that, despite the rise in the FTSE 100 this year, &quot;the market is still below the level it was 13 years ago.

The dream was of buildings like open landscapes,\u00a0occupied by modern nomads. There were many reasons why these projects were not built, one being their calculated indifference to the bourgeois idea of property ownership. An architect who has come closer than most to realising these dreams is the 41-year-old Japanese Sou Fujimoto, unborn when the 1960s ended. He achieves them, that is, with houses on the small plots of Japanese cities, rather than the wide open spaces imagined by Superstudio. Soon his Serpentine pavilion, which looks like a temporary, miniature version of Friedman&apos;s grand grids, will open in London&apos;s Kensington Gardens.     Fujimoto's transparent House NA, Tokyo. Photograph:   Rodrigo Reyes Martin/Corbis    Fujimoto&apos;s House NA is an inhabitable climbing frame in Tokyo, not suitable for anyone shy or retiring, made of impossibly spindly steel and enclosed by barely there glass. It makes the theatre of domestic life into a public spectacle, modified only by the fact that curtains may be drawn when privacy is wanted, and it turns inside out the mute residential boxes that are its neighbours. Fujimoto, who speaks calmly, a little abstractly, but with assurance, says: &quot;It is like living in a tree: you can choose branches here and there where you can do different things. People can gather together or they can stay on different branches and\u00a0chat.&quot; His House N, built for a &quot;couple in their 60s and their dog&quot; in the town of Oita, is &quot;a box within a box with a box&quot;. Each of its layers is perforated with rectangular openings, such that inside and outside overlap, and the actual line between house and garden becomes indistinct. &quot;Usually in Japan,&quot; Fujimoto tells me, &quot;a house is more closed to the outside and a garden is small and too exposed to the city and then there is a small street, so we tried to create nice gradations between the different areas, and create a covering for the garden and the house at the same time.&quot; If House NA is a tree, House N is a &quot;cloud&quot;, a high-ceilinged series of voids hovering about the ground-based living area. At other times he compares his architecture to fields, caves, nests and forests, and he has proposed a hurricane-like swirl of lines, which would house a complex of shops, restaurants and transport, in Belgrade. Nature, he explains, is important: &quot;It is a really fundamental question how architecture is different from nature, or how architecture could be part of nature, or how they could be merged, or what are the boundaries between nature and artificial things.&quot; This does not mean there is anything obviously organic in the appearance of his buildings. They tend to be curveless, and made of hard un-ageing materials, works of a high degree of contrivance and artificiality. Rather his interest in nature expresses itself in the way his structures capture external space, and in their emulation of the effects of natural phenomena. In particular he talks about the idea of &quot;background&quot;, the way in which landscapes make distinct settings for life without prescribing what happens within them. A forest is &quot;strong but at the same time really comfortable. People can ignore it, or just experience the different atmospheres \u2026 it allows people to behave as they like.&quot; Along with nature, he likes to talk about &quot;the behaviour of people&quot; \u2013 &quot;it is really fundamental to architecture, positively primitive. It has not changed a lot from 2,000 years ago, and I like to go back to the beginning, to the relationship between people and space.&quot; So his rectangular caves and nests, while looking very much of the present, are intended to allow people to carry on as they always have.     Fujimoto's plan for the Serpentine pavilion 2013.    His Serpentine pavilion is another &quot;cloud&quot;, a lattice made of skinny steel poles that will appear to hover over the ground. The aim is &quot;not to create a building but to create a place&quot;, an &quot;architectural garden&quot;, with &quot;no strong\u00a0walls and no strong colours&quot;. Despite the fact that it is all right angles and metal, Fujimoto says it will\u00a0&quot;have\u00a0a small scale that fits to human bodies, soft and ambiguous, with a nice coexistence of order and disorder&quot;. Personally, I like this line of thought \u2013 the idea that architecture is about making spaces that interact with what is around them, rather than precious objects; that it is a background to life, and incomplete without the activities and experiences that take place around it. Which does not mean that architecture has to be neutral or insipid \u2013 like the forests and caves Fujimoto keeps talking about, it can be powerful, but not the whole story. His works are not necessarily straightforward to inhabit, and it is striking that austere means such as steel and grids are used to pursue sensual ends, but that seems to be part of his game. Fujimoto is the youngest architect of the 13 practices to have designed a Serpentine Pavilion. He is also the third Japanese, the other two \u2013 Toyo Ito and Sanaa \u2013 having created what are generally thought to be the best of the series. This may not be coincidental, as Japanese architects are usually comfortable with the idea of the temporary and the lightweight. Their country is also becoming a haven for intricate and subtle ways of designing buildings that are endangered elsewhere, a sort of nature reserve for old-fashioned architecture. Where China provides a spectacle of brazen scale and speed of construction, at least some Japanese designers give a value to thoughtfulness and reflection. Fujimoto, for example, has a rare interest in drawing by hand, which he says &quot;clarifies his thinking&quot;. It helps him achieve complexity and to work intelligently at different scales, things basic to the practice of architecture but often hard to find. As for those 1960s ideas, Fujimoto has achieved them with the help of a major exclusion. He is not trying to transform society or challenge the ownership of property. He works within the precise lines of a building plot, or in the un-revolutionary location of Kensington. His buildings do in fact have boundaries \u2013 it is just that they are made indistinct. He builds dreams of living in trees or clouds, but not an actual unfettered, unlimited existence. Which, arguably, is as much as an architect can do."}, {"sentences": ["Yet last year in Tokyo, Deflem realised that a viral news story about a course he had taught called &quot;Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame&quot; had had the most unforeseen impact: it had made him famous, too."], "tags": ["Lady Gaga", "Celebrity", "Life and style", "Music", "Pop and rock", "Education", "US education", "Culture", "World news", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-25T16:52:49Z", "title": "The nature of fame: the Lady Gaga professor who became a global star", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/25/lady-gaga-celebrity-fame", "article": "Professor Mathieu Deflem finally realised that something truly strange had happened to him when people started asking him for his autograph. For the professor of sociology at the University of South Carolina is not a celebrity. He is just an academic, who teaches theories about fame in modern popular culture. Yet last year in Tokyo, Deflem realised that a viral news story about a course he had taught called &quot;Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame&quot; had had the most unforeseen impact: it had made him famous, too. Attending a Lady Gaga concert in Japan, Deflem suddenly found himself being approached by Japanese fans who called him &quot;Gaga sensei&quot;, which translates as Gaga professor, and they asked him to pose for photographs and sign autographs. &quot;That was weird. It was indeed surreal. Most professors do not get recognised at pop shows and yet they knew me by my face. They had seen me on TV,&quot; Deflem told the Guardian. Now, in a meta move that shows how twisted and strange the world of fame has become in the 21st century, Deflem has published an academic paper examining his own experiences of becoming famous for teaching a course about the nature of fame. One of his conclusions is that the statement of pop artist Andy Warhol \u2013 that anyone can be famous but just for 15 minutes \u2013 is no longer true. In the age of 24-hour media and widespread social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook, basically everyone can be famous all the time. These days, Deflem concluded from his own brush with celebrity, it is staying unknown that is the harder and more unusual experience. &quot;Nowadays it more exceptional to be obscure,&quot; he said. Deflem&apos;s entry into the world of celebrity began quietly enough. He had an idea for a course looking at Lady Gaga&apos;s rise to fame \u2013 and examining it from a sociological point of view \u2013 in the summer of 2010 and got the go-ahead to design it. In October, 2010, the course was announced to the university newspaper. From there \u2013 to the astonishment of many \u2013 the course suddenly became news across the globe. In the weeks that followed, Deflem was swamped by interview requests and media appearances to discuss the course. They came from the New York Times, the BBC, the Washington Post, MTV, Billboard, Elle and USA Today. Media from countries including Italy, Germany, Ireland, Slovenia, India, Vietnam, Lebanon, Oman and even Zambia ran pieces about it. He fended off accusations that he had cynically designed the course and its title just to get such attention. &quot;There is no way I could have planned this. I am not that smart,&quot; he said. But that was just the beginning. Soon he got an avalanche of criticism from figures like conservative firebrand Ann Coulter as well as Christian fundamentalists. His course even became an answer on the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. Lady Gaga herself noticed the course and talked about it on radio interviews and a chat with broadcast journalist Anderson Cooper on the flagship news programme 60 Minutes. Saturday Night Live did a skit about Lady Gaga featuring a fan of the star who was dressed to look like Deflem. Deflem found himself being consulted as an expert on other celebrities, such as Kim Kardashian, despite telling reporters he knew little about such figures. At a conference in Israel he was told by a colleague he was famous in her country for the Gaga course. &quot;My feelings on the matter are distinctly ambiguous, involving both a measure of agony as well as excitement,&quot; Deflem wrote in his academic analysis of the experience. Indeed, it is rare that a professor gets to so directly experience the subject they are studying. Deflem said that it gave him deeply personal insights into celebrities and the wider culture that creates, sustains and can often destroy them. He enjoyed the thrill of recognition, while understanding that it had a downside too as numerous internet postings appeared accusing him of all manner of outlandish things such as being a member of the Illuminati. He also came in for a lot of criticism because he had confessed to being a fan of Lady Gaga&apos;s music. &quot;That was used against me,&quot; he said. He was also amazed at the lack of agency he had over his own fate and image as it spiralled out of control in the hands of hundreds of journalists. &quot;You kind of undergo it. You experience it. You do not really have any control,&quot; he said. As for the course, Deflem taught it five times and has no current plans to teach it as a separate activity in the future \u2013 though he may include it as part of broader studies of fame. However, he adds that one of the proudest moments of the whole experience was the fact that student reviews of his work generally praised it as academically rigorous. He pointed out that one student had written on a professor ratings website: &quot;Stay away from the Lady Gaga class. You have to do the readings and work your butt off.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Born in Tokyo in 1933, to an aristocratic family, she was close to her father, who briefly harboured an ambition to be a classical pianist before settling down as a banker.", "His job meant that the family moved back and forth between Japan and America, returning to Tokyo before the second world war broke out."], "tags": ["Yoko Ono", "Meltdown festival 2013", "Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock", "John Lennon", "Art and design"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-25T23:01:00Z", "title": "Yoko Ono at 80: 'I feel that I am starting a new life, a second life'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/may/26/yoko-ono-80-meltdown-john-lennon", "article": "Sitting at her kitchen table, sipping green tea, Yoko Ono looks much the same as she did when I met her 20 years ago. Dressed in a black top and trousers and peering intently over tinted spectacles, her face bears little trace of the passing of time and her diminutive form exudes utter calmness. Having crossed the famous threshold of the Dakota building, and been ushered through the interior of possibly the most exclusive address in Manhattan by her assistant, then instructed to leave my shoes at the door, I do feel like I have been granted an audience with a grand historical figure. Which, in a way, I have. Having recently turned 80, the woman who was once regarded as a kind of latter-day witch who led John Lennon astray and broke up the Beatles, now occupies a more complex historical position in the pantheon of celebrity. She has been recognised belatedly as a pioneering conceptual artist, a musician and performer in her own right, and an activist in the spirit of her late husband. Her latest causes include campaigning for gun control and against fracking \u2013 the extraction of natural gas by cracking open shale rocks below the Earth&apos;s surface under\u00a0high pressure and at great ecological cost. Quiet-spoken, but still outspoken, Yoko Ono&apos;s vision remains utopian and her thinking seems utterly untroubled by the hard facts of contemporary geopolitical reality. &quot;I do feel that I am starting a new life at 80,&quot; she says, at one point, &quot;a second life that will have so many things I didn&apos;t have in the first life. I don&apos;t know how long I am going to live, but my prediction is that we will have heaven on earth in 2050. When I tell people this, they say, &apos;Oh, but you won&apos;t be there,&apos; and I say, &apos;Well, who knows?&apos;\u200a&quot; Before the arrival of heaven on earth though there is a more pressing commitment: this year&apos;s Meltdown festival, which she is curating, and which takes place at the Southbank centre in London next month. It will feature various musical pioneers such as Marianne Faithfull, Iggy Pop, Patti Smith, Siouxsie and Yoko herself, alongside contemporary cutting-edge acts such as Cibo Matto, Deerhoof and Immortal Technique. What, I ask, was her criterion? &quot;Oh, energy. I think energy is the most important thing that we can give to people as performers. Anything else is a little bit pretentious. But energy is not. It&apos;s so direct and so pure that it becomes a kind of freedom. If you don&apos;t have it, don&apos;t bother with rock and roll.&quot; Is it hard to find that energy as she enters old age? &quot;Well, as you get older, you realise that you can only do a performance on stage through the energy that is inside you. You transform yourself. I find that so interesting. I think that there is a sort of spiritual power that is translating into our bodies as we perform. Performers give and giving is so important. It can heal. That is my experience anyway.&quot; Alongside music, Meltdown will also have two weekends of talks, lectures, workshops and discussions, one devoted to activism, including a debate linked to the publication of a book of artists&apos; work in support of Pussy Riot, and one concerned with the digital future. &quot;I think this is the beginning of a time of big change,&quot; she says confidently. &quot;The 60s were very sweet in a way, but things are more urgent now because we really do have to get on with it. Time is running out for the planet. The only option is do something or do nothing.&quot; How would she describe her politics, if indeed she believes in politics? &quot;Well, I believe in people. People change things. And I am against negativity in all its forms. I think we should be discovering and inventing things that help the human race, not that damage the planet. By now, we should have realised this is what is needed, no? The future is now. We can&apos;t wait for the future.&quot; I ask Yoko why she has so ardently embraced the anti-fracking cause, becoming, alongside Lady Gaga and actress Susan Sarandon, the most visible spokesperson for the recently formed Artists Against Fracking. She has made a TV advert about the dangers of the process, addressed to New York&apos;s Governor Cuomo, to the soundtrack of John Lennon&apos;s Gimme Some Truth. And, alongside her son, Sean, and some famous friends, she has recorded the folksy, early-Dylanish protest song, Don&apos;t Frack My Mother. &quot;Well I&apos;m getting bashed for it, but I have to speak out, it&apos;s so potentially bad. These big gas corporations have so much money and they think that gives them the power to do whatever they want. They are going to put strong chemicals in the water and that water is going to splash all over the place. In Pennsylvania, already some people are getting cancer and the corporations are saying, &apos;Oh there&apos;s no proof.&apos; The usual. All the wells have no clean water now. You can show that. The water is cloudy. And people who are not rich, they cannot afford to buy clean water every day.&quot; She pauses for breath, and continues in a conspiratorial whisper. &quot;When I speak out against the guns or against the big corporations, some of my friends say, &apos;Oh Yoko, be careful. These people have all the power.&apos; But, you know, most people don&apos;t speak out because they are frightened. It&apos;s best to have no fear. Plus, I am not going to rest well if I don&apos;t do it. We cannot stay silent, so I ask people to please join me. If a million people stand up, they will have to take notice.&quot; Thus far, activism apart, Yoko has marked her 80th year on Earth in style. Alongside the imminent Meltdown festival, a touring retrospective of her art, entitled Half-A-Wind, has just finished at the Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt and will travel throughout Europe and the US in the coming months. A big art book, Infinite Universe at Dawn, spanning her long career as an artist, will be published later in the year. She has also just finished a new album and overseen an extensive reissue programme of her back catalogue from 1968-85. In February, she celebrated her birthday with a Plastic Ono Band concert at the Volksb\u00fchne in Berlin, where the group, which now consists of Sean and sundry friends, was joined on stage by Peaches, Michael Stipe and Rufus and Martha Wainwright. The show culminated with the arrival of a birthday cake and a chorus of Happy Birthday in English and German. The audience of ageing hippies and younger art-world hipsters lapped it up, raising the roof with the chorus of Give Peace A Chance without the slightest trace of irony or cynicism.            The concert itself was a curious affair, with the group moving often unsteadily through a selection of songs from her career, while Yoko submerged her more arty side \u2013 there wasn&apos;t much atonal screaming \u2013 for wavering renditions of songs including Walking on Thin Ice, Between My Head and the Sky, and Yes, I&apos;m A Witch, on which she duetted with the towering Peaches. I tell her I have always been intrigued by this song. Was it a late retort to those who blamed her for breaking up the Beatles? &quot;Not just that, but all the negativity. I had to combat the negativity coming towards me. I felt like the world was trying to kill me spiritually for 40 years, so one day I just said, OK, I&apos;m a witch. You are saying it, so am I. Don&apos;t ever touch me as I am doing what I want to do. It is a song of rebellion. It didn&apos;t seem to go anywhere at the time, but maybe it went everywhere spiritually. It certainly made me feel that I could go on.&quot; The song is a testament to the lunar miles she has travelled since those strange days in the late 1960s, and the restless, ambitious years of creativity that preceded them. Born in Tokyo in 1933, to an aristocratic family, she was close to her father, who briefly harboured an ambition to be a classical pianist before settling down as a banker. His job meant that the family moved back and forth between Japan and America, returning to Tokyo before the second world war broke out. They were in the city when it was firebombed in March 1945 \u2013 killing more than 100,000 people, it was the deadliest air raid of the entire war. Hard times followed \u2013 her parents had to barter some of their possessions for food and, for a while, live nomadically in the countryside. I ask her if she can recall the first piece of art she ever made. &quot;I remember, when we were evacuated during the war, my brother was really unhappy and depressed and really hungry because we did not have very much food. So I said, &apos;OK, let&apos;s make a menu together. What kind of dinner would you like?&apos; And, he said, &apos;Ice-cream.&apos; So, I said, &apos;Good, let&apos;s imagine our ice-cream dinner.&apos; And, we did, and he started to look happy. So, I realised even then that just through imagining, we can be happy. So we had our conceptual dinner and this is maybe my first piece of art.&quot; She describes herself as a &quot;very thoughtful, always dreaming&quot; child, who escaped constantly into words. Did she consider herself an outsider in the family? &quot;A little. I was known for creating poetry anytime. Just like that! Somebody said to my parents, &apos;She walks and when she stops walking, she has a poem coming out of her mouth.&apos; Was she rebellious? &quot;Oh yes. Naturally. I did not like the conformity of Japanese life and, though I did not have any bad feelings against my parents, the whole history of the family felt like a big weight.I felt like I had to succumb to that and become a little particle in their big family and die spiritually. Or I had to survive on my own. It was that simple. And that complex.&quot; After the war, the family returned to New York and Yoko attended the exclusive Sarah Lawrence College, a liberal establishment where activism was encouraged alongside study of the arts. She also trawled the city&apos;s art galleries and artists&apos; hangouts, connecting with leading lights in the American avant-garde, most notably the composers La Monte Young and John Cage as well as George Maciunas of the Fluxus group. &quot;I bumped into them,&quot; she says. &quot;I didn&apos;t search them out as people think. I created friends that are like me. I attracted them. It&apos;s a journey and you have to make your own way. If you have too many quotes from other people in your head, you can&apos;t create. You have to keep your head empty. That&apos;s why I am constantly enjoying the sky, the park, the walk. Anything in life is beautiful.&quot; Her early performance pieces included Lightning Piece from 1955, in which she sat at a piano and followed her own instruction to &quot;Light a match and watch it till it goes out.&quot; In 1964, she first performed her most famous work, Cut Piece, in which she sat still on stage while members of the audience cut though her clothes. &quot;It was a little scary,&quot; she says now, smiling, &quot;but just nerves. Not fear of the people. That&apos;s another thing that is very me, I suppose. I don&apos;t let fear or suspicion in or they would affect not just my performance, but my health.&quot; Much of her text-based work, like her famous book Grapefruit, comprises short instructional sentences (&quot;Imagine the clouds dripping./ Dig a hole in your garden to/ put them in.&quot; &quot;Let people copy or photocopy your paintings. Destroy the originals.&quot;). &quot;I made it into instructions because I did not have a way to make some of the big things in it,&quot; she says laughing. &quot;Plus, it&apos;s important to be mischievous. I think Grapefruit is very much a mischievous book for now. The age of the internet, the age of fast-forward thinking. You can use that, too, as an artist. People often talk about that in a negative way \u2013 oh, I have no concentration to read a big book now. But it is not all bad. When I was doing Grapefruit, I wanted it to read so there is no way to get bored with it. It&apos;s short but it says it all. I wanted it to do that so I made it short but full.&quot; It was her art, of course, that caught John Lennon&apos;s attention, when he attended her exhibition Unfinished Paintings and Objects in the Indica Gallery in London in November 1966, which included a conceptual piece in which she covered herself in a black bag. According to Peter Brown, director of the Beatles management company, in his book The Love You Make, Lennon had &quot;been up for three consecutive days, tripping on acid, and he had not washed or shaved for 72 hours&quot;, when his friend, John Dunbar, the gallery owner, cajoled him into coming to the exhibition with a vague suggestion that it might include &quot;all these beautiful young people lying around in a bag&quot;. As Lennon walked around, bemused, Dunbar urged Yoko to &quot;Go and say hello to the millionaire.&quot; Brown remembers their first conversation thus: &quot;\u200aWhere&apos;s the orgy?&apos; John asked her, slightly disappointed that nothing sexual was happening. Wordlessly, she handed John a card. On it was printed the word &apos;breathe&apos;. &apos;You mean like this?&apos; John said, and panted. The small Japanese woman seemed unimpressed.&quot; So, remarkably, began the ballad of John and Yoko, which was to enthral the world&apos;s media and appal many Beatles fans as the couple grew rapidly closer to the point of inseparability. It is still intriguing to see the film Let It Be, which details the dogged, fractious final recording sessions, and to watch Yoko right there in the studio with the group, albeit at Lennon&apos;s insistence. I ask her if ego is important in order to be an artist. &quot;No,&quot; she says. John Lennon spoke often and passionately about what he got from Yoko Ono; what did she get from him? She replies without a moment&apos;s hesitation. &quot;An energy that said; &apos;It&apos;s all right to be me.&apos; And that&apos;s what I gave him also. I didn&apos;t change him, as many people think, but he had a side of him that he was not able to express, because of the environment he was in, the people around him, his upbringing and all that. Because I was expressing those kinds of things, I think he thought, &apos;Yes, I can do that.&apos;&quot; More than 30 years have passed since his death. Though he still looms large in her life, she managed to escape the role that many people predicted for her: the perpetually grieving widow forever in her husband&apos;s shadow. &quot;Well, I could not ever just be one role like that. I never even thought of the word widow. I thought I was a soldier. We were both fighting for freedom and justice and self-expression and he just fell in the battlefield. That is how I thought of it. That I had to keep on going. I saw that right away. And I had a young son. I had to keep going.&quot; Is she concerned about old age at all? &quot;No. I feel good. Maybe it&apos;s because I don&apos;t think about the past so much. The past is so heavy. Part of me, of course, is still carrying it, but part of me is free from it.&quot; John Lennon was murdered on 8\u00a0December 1980, just three weeks after the release of their album Double Fantasy. The Meltdown festival will culminate with the first ever live performance of the album, featuring Yoko and Sean and some &quot;very special&quot; musicians and singers. It will undoubtedly be an emotional evening for her. &quot;And exciting, too,&quot; she says, smiling. &quot;John will be present for sure, but he was present from the beginning when I made the decision to curate and was thinking, I have to get this, I have to get that. Then it came to me that it was John&apos;s power. He was helping me, because, you know, he has big power now. I realised suddenly that he decided he wanted to be in a more powerful position to help us.&quot; I am slightly taken aback, but Yoko is smiling her enigmatic smile. Are you suggesting, I ask, that he somehow chose to go? She nods and continues calmly. &quot;Yes, in a way, I think so. All of us decide at one point how our fates would or should be. It&apos;s logical to me, but I don&apos;t want to go too far with this or people will think, oh she has gone crazy, but I do get some messages from John. I do think there are certain things that I got help from him with. Certain things that are so fantastic I almost don&apos;t want to take any credit for them.&quot; Could she give me an example? &quot;Well, Meltdown. You know that a lot of concerts sold out right away. That sort of thing. We are getting people to understand what I understand and what John understood.&quot; Which is? &quot;Future now! The future is here right now, it&apos;s only that we ignore it. Many many beautiful things are happening now, in our heads especially, but we have to act. What is really important is to say I can do it! Let&apos;s do it! I have always said this. John said this. What I want to tell people most of all is if you don&apos;t attempt to do it, you will never do it. And you don&apos;t realise you can do it until you do it.&quot; It&apos;s that simple. And that complex. Yoko Ono&apos;s Meltdown at the Southbank Centre, London SE1, runs from 14-23 June.

That&apos;s the argument of City bears, who warn that while last week&apos;s slide may be reversed in the days ahead, the sharp fall in share prices that spread from Tokyo to Wall Street and London was a foretaste of the reckoning that will inevitably come, once QE starts to be unwound. &quot;This is a liquidity-fuelled rally in stock prices. It&apos;s clear that the world economy has not been performing as well as stock prices say it has,&quot; said Neil Mellor of BNY Mellon. Pessimists cite several reasons to be nervous about whether the rally that took share prices in the US to record highs before the blip can be sustained. The first is China: a weak reading on the purchasing managers&apos; index survey for the country \u2013 a barometer of its manufacturing sector \u2013 was one of the factors that fed Thursday&apos;s decline. Growth in the world&apos;s second-largest economy has long been expected to slow from the double-digit pace that was the norm before the world recession of 2008-09. But there are serious concerns about the health of China&apos;s banks, which are thought to be sitting on a growing pile of bad loans. &quot;It&apos;s clear that a lot of banks are in an awful lot of trouble,&quot; said Mellor. Demand from China is critical for a number of major economies, including Japan, for which China is a huge export market, and Australia, which is heavily reliant on its natural resources. Any sign that the Chinese economy was slowing sharply, or worse still, facing a financial meltdown, would have knock-on effects right across the world&apos;s financial markets. A second reason to worry is the eurozone. While the mood has been quieter since the Cyprus bailout was agreed in March and a rate cut from the European Central Bank boosted confidence, the crisis is far from over. The eurozone economy remains deep in recession, and there is a long list of countries, from Slovenia to Spain, with unresolved problems that could spiral rapidly into a major crisis. Third, Japan: markets have been supercharged in recent weeks by the radical policy of &quot;Abenomics&quot;, named after new prime minister Shinzo Abe, which involves deregulation and a boost to public spending as well as the &quot;shock and awe&quot; quantitative easing announced last month. Even if the policy works well, however, it is unlikely to be the overwhelming success that would be required to validate the 25% jump in share prices seen since the end of last year. The final reason to be nervous is a more general one: as central bankers themselves have warned, extended periods of cheap money tend to create market distortions, as investors take the money and use it to fish around for better returns, in a &quot;search for yield&quot;. In the bond markets, for example, countries that would usually find it impossible to attract foreign lenders are finding investors falling over themselves to buy their bonds. Rwanda&apos;s $400m (\u00a3265m) bond issue in April was more than seven times oversubscribed, while middle-income countries such as Turkey, Mexico and Brazil have seen their borrowing costs slide. That&apos;s great news for the governments in question, but smacks of what Fed chairman Ben Bernanke recently referred to as &quot;excessive risk-taking&quot;. Whatever the outlook, &quot;jittery Thursday&quot;, as analysts at City consultancy Fathom called it, underlined the fact that investors should brace themselves for a period of increased volatility. &quot;This bout of market jitters has laid bare the twin distortions imposed by a combination of near-zero interest rates and unconventional monetary policy, namely an excess sensitivity to small changes in the data and an unhealthy addiction to doveish central banks,&quot; they said.Heather Stewart REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL People who buy shares are by nature optimistic. They make a profit when the stock market goes up, so they want it to go up forever. Until last summer \u2013 after two years of crisis in the eurozone about the single currency \u2013 European investors were wary about the prospects for the global economy. The 2008 banking crash had been a disaster, as shares lost almost half their value on the big European exchanges. Then governments soaked up bank debt and themselves grew vulnerable. But then European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said he&apos;d do &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to save the euro. That pledge, plus the renewed money-printing from the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, was a message that delighted investors. Since June 2012, the German Dax index has soared from around 6000 to almost 8400, before dropping back a little last week. The same story is told by the other major European exchanges, including the FTSE 100, which jumped from 5260 to a peak of 6723 earlier this week \u2013 a 28% gain in less than a year. Some economists argue that stock exchanges are riding for a fall. They say fundamental building blocks of growth are missing. In the major economies, investment remains low and consumer confidence is lacklustre, especially while high unemployment is rising and wages are frozen in real terms. However, there are three good reasons why stock markets, a few blips aside, will continue to grow for some time: central banks are scared; there is lots of money waiting to be invested; and returns on all other assets are low. Many analysts blamed the sharp falls in stock market values last week on a hamfisted performance by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, who initially gave little hint that the Fed&apos;s QE measures might be scaled down only to say later that several members of his committee thought the time might be ripe in the next few months. The Fed has injected more than $3tn of freshly minted money into financial markets and is supposed to be increasing the total by $85bn a month until unemployment comes down to 6.5%. It is 7.5% at the moment. The hint that Fed funds would stop early sent markets into a spin, but it was not new. Bernanke had said the same in January. And the Fed must stay the course because households and businesses across the US and Europe are still paying back debt from the boom years. Only central bank funds are keeping economies afloat. The Bank of England remains steadfast and the Bank of Japan is ramping up its QE programme. Bernanke will stick with his original plan. Stock markets are also being buoyed by the huge reserve of funds sitting in the Middle East, in Asia, and in western pension funds. Fund managers want to bet the trillions they are keeping on the sidelines on the stock market, should it feel safe. Central banks will continue to make it feel safe. The third driver comes from the low returns elsewhere. Sovereign wealth funds and pension funds have used large amounts of their spare money as loans to governments and big companies. But buying bonds earns them only a small return. Lending to the German government is such a privilege that investors lose money on the deal. Strapped to these three rockets, the market can still soar. Of course, Spain could yet go bust or China grind to a halt. There could be a natural disaster, an act of terrorism or war. History tells us a bust is waiting down the track, but while the world economy recovers and governments and central banks maintain their pledge to keep printing money, we should expect prices to rise.Phillip Inman"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;My real intention was to prevent a mere handful of US soldiers from committing crimes and strengthen the Japan-US alliance and the relations of trust between the two nations,&quot; Hashimoto told a packed press conference in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Second world war"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-27T11:28:26Z", "title": "Japanese mayor apologises for saying US troops should use sex industry", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/27/japanese-mayor-toru-hashimoto-comfort-women", "article": "Toru Hashimoto, the controversial mayor of Osaka, has apologised for suggesting that US troops in Japan should visit commercial sex establishments as a way of reducing the number of sexual assaults. But he defended his claim that Japan&apos;s military government played no direct part in recruiting tens of thousands of Asian women to work in frontline brothels before and during the second world war. Hashimoto, who is also co-leader of the rightwing Japan Restoration party, drew widespread condemnation earlier this month when he said the military&apos;s use of sex slaves in the 1930s and 40s had been necessary to maintain discipline among Japanese troops fighting in China and on the Korean peninsula. On Monday, the former lawyer, until recently a rising star of Japanese politics , claimed his comments about US troops on Okinawa had been misreported. More than half of the 48,000 American troops in Japan are based on the island, where rapes and other crimes by servicemen have long been a source of resentment among residents. &quot;My real intention was to prevent a mere handful of US soldiers from committing crimes and strengthen the Japan-US alliance and the relations of trust between the two nations,&quot; Hashimoto told a packed press conference in Tokyo. He said he had suggested that troops use the &quot;legally accepted adult entertainment industry&quot; out of a &quot;sense of crisis&quot; over sexual assaults by US servicemen. &quot;I understand that my remark could be construed as an insult to the US forces and to the American people and was inappropriate. I retract this remark and express an apology.&quot; Hashimoto did not apologise, however, for his remarks about comfort women, the name given to as many as 200,000 mainly Korean and Chinese girls and women forced to have sex with Japanese troops. Again, he blamed inaccurate reporting, saying that he did not personally believe military brothels were a wartime necessity, but that armies &quot;around the world&quot; had thought they were. He said the US, Britain, France, Germany and Russia also needed to reflect on the sexual abuse of women during the war, but did not offer any evidence that those countries had operated &quot;comfort stations&quot; \u2013 brothels where girls as young as 13 were forced to have sex with as many as 20 soldiers a day - on a similar scale. &quot;Based on the premise that Japan must remorsefully face its past offences and must never justify the offences, I intended to argue that other nations in the world must not attempt to conclude the matter by blaming only Japan and by associating Japan alone with the simple phrase of &apos;sex slaves&apos; or &apos;sex slavery&apos;,&quot; Hashimoto said. While he believes Japan should apologise to the surviving comfort women, many of whom are in their 80s and 90s, he said there was no evidence that the Japanese state had been directly involved in trafficking them. Instead, he claimed private brokers had recruited the women, some of whom were taken to the brothels in Japanese military vehicles and ships. &quot;I am not suggesting that Japan should evade responsibility\u00a0\u2026 what I&apos;m focusing on is historical fact,&quot; he said. &quot;The most important aspect is whether it was the will of the state to be involved in a systematic manner.&quot; Hashimoto conceded that the controversy surrounding his remarks could damage his party&apos;s prospects at upper house elections due in July. A poll in the Nikkei business paper showed support for his Restoration party at just 3%, down six percentage points from last month."}, {"sentences": ["However, by the time the The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift came out in 2006, it was in danger of echoing that third episode&apos;s title and drifting way past Tokyo and into the north Pacific, never to be seen again.", "Watch here The franchise picked itself up with Fast &amp; Furious in 2009 and ended up grossing $363m worldwide \u2013 considerably higher than the box office for the first two and far more than Tokyo Drift."], "tags": ["Action and adventure", "Comedy", "Drama", "Film industry", "Film", "Comedy", "Culture", "US news", "Canada", "World news", "Americas"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-27T13:27:32Z", "title": "Fast & Furious 6 races ahead as The Hangover Part III crashes and burns", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/may/27/fast-furious-6-hangover-3", "article": "Fast &amp; Furious 6 screeched to the top of the North American charts on an estimated $98.5m (\u00a365.1m) and will cross $100m when the four-day Memorial Day weekend numbers come out on Monday. It fuelled the biggest Memorial Day weekend on record and set a record international opening weekend for distributor Universal on $158m (\u00a3104m). That means it has already crossed $275m (\u00a3182m) worldwide after two weekends, factoring in a limited international foray last weekend when it broke records for distributor Universal in the UK. It&apos;s hard to think of another mature franchise that has experienced a critical and commercial turbo-boost as startling as that of the Fast &amp; Furious series. Your average Harry Potter or Twilight blockbuster series hits the ground running and, barring the odd banana peel, builds and builds to absurd heights, but what makes the Fast &amp; Furious franchise so unique is the timing of its surge in popularity. The series started well enough in 2001 and was always going to be a nice little earner for Universal. However, by the time the The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift came out in 2006, it was in danger of echoing that third episode&apos;s title and drifting way past Tokyo and into the north Pacific, never to be seen again. It was at a critical and commercial low-point.            Reading on mobile? Watch here The franchise picked itself up with Fast &amp; Furious in 2009 and ended up grossing $363m worldwide \u2013 considerably higher than the box office for the first two and far more than Tokyo Drift. By 2011, it was ready for its closeup. Fast Five roared out of the gates and was rightly praised by critics \u2013 no staging of a heist from the last five, possibly 10 years can touch that ridiculous bank vault sequence through the streets of Rio. Fast Five went on to gross over $625m worldwide. That is serious money. No franchise I can think of has somersaulted into the stratosphere so long after its genesis. Perhaps only 2012&apos;s Skyfall can occupy the same ground after becoming the biggest and most widely acclaimed movie of the decades-long James Bond series. Its $1.1bn global box office dwarfed anything done by the previous movies, but the 007 series has thrown up critical darlings before. The same cannot be said of the Fast and Furious franchise. So the sixth movie has arrived and Fast &amp; Furious 6 clearly wants to be even bigger than its predecessor \u2013 and there&apos;s every sign that it will be. The franchise has broad appeal among a number of age groups and with both male and female viewers, and is highly popular with North America&apos;s Hispanic audience, the fastest-growing portion of its filmgoing public. Universal has not missed a trick and last month announced it was pulling out the stops to release the seventh instalment in 2014. This is one Episode VII that audiences are actually looking forward to and seems destined to make money. A quick word on The Hangover Part III. Is it a comedy or a drama? It&apos;s a pretty dark story and this lack of definition, plus the fact that the franchise is well past its sell-by date, may have been reflected in its box-office performance at the weekend, which was some way below that of the second movie in 2011. It&apos;s too big a franchise to write off at this stage but it faces an uphill battle to gross more than its predecessors and take the series out on a high. Oh, and The Great Gatsby has crossed $200m worldwide. That, too, is impressive. North American top 10, 24-26 May 2013 1. Fast &amp; Furious 6, $98.5m2. The Hangover Part III, $54.2m3.

Nobody is saying that kind of thing about Australian players these days.&quot;  The Socceroos will get a chance to judge for themselves next Tuesday when they head to Japan for a vital 2014 World Cup qualifier. Only one team will be bursting with stars from the big European leagues, and it won&apos;t be the visitors. The best that Australia has to offer are no longer spotted in Manchester, Liverpool or Turin but Doha, Gwangyang and Nagoya. This is more of an eastern generation than a golden one. If the past of the national team was European, then its future looks to be Asian \u2013 just like the country itself, with 12% of Australians citing Asian ancestry in a 2011 census, a figure set to rise considerably. It is just seven years since Tim Cahill broke Japanese hearts in Kaiserslautern, helping to turn a goal deficit into a 3-1 win in Australia&apos;s first appearance at the World Cup since 1974. The starting 11 in Germany was full of Premier League and Serie A stars. Just three of the squad of 23 in 2006 played outside Europe, a number that had risen to five by the time South Africa came around four years later. Much has changed since. When coach Holger Osieck \u2013 appointed in 2010 at least partly due to his experience of leading Urawa Reds of Japan to the 2007 Asian Champions League title \u2013 named his 26 last week, only 10 faced the long trip east from Europe. The names of the players are familiar but their clubs less so. Cahill is no longer a blue but a New York Red Bull, Mark Bresciano is with Al Gharafa of Qatar, not Parma, and Lucas Neill is clubless after recent stints in the Middle East. Over a quarter of the latest squad play in Asia - if you include those playing in Australia, it becomes a majority. And include you should - the country has been a member of the Asian Football Confederation since 2006.  Australia is an Asian football nation in name at least, but now the nature is slowly changing. Clubs in the A-League, established in 2005, have flirted with Asian players, but have still yet to really commit. Minds need to open before arms and that will be helped by the four dozen or so Australian professionals active in the giant continent from Iran to India to Indonesia.  The 2008 introduction of the Asian quota allowed clubs from Tehran to Tokyo to sign a fourth foreign player provided he was from an AFC nation. Given the financial constraints of the A-League and its strict salary cap, Australian players were usually cheap and, after receiving significant salary increases, cheerful. Bosnar kicked around smaller European leagues for a while before moving to Japan in 2008. Four years later, he made the short journey to South Korea and Suwon Samsung Bluewings. &quot;Players get homesick too and Asia is closer to home than Europe and the time difference is small. But the reasons to come to Asia were financial,&quot; Bosnar said. &quot;The money is better in Asia than it is in Australia.&quot; Money talks and so does success. Sasa Ognenovski&apos;s Korea move could not have gone better as he joined Seongnam Ilhwa in 2009, a club owned by the Moonies. Nothing fazed the big defender, who was almost 30 when he arrived. In 2010, he led the Yellows to the Asian Champions League title, became the first Australian to be named Asian Player of the Year and was called up for a national team debut. It was a reminder that there was talent down under \u2013 Korean teams were soon scrambling for clones of &quot;The Og Monster&quot; \u2013 and showed Australian players that there was more to Asia than just money. Brendan Schwab is the chairman of the Asia/Oceania Division of FIFPro, the world players&apos; union. Another Australian active in Asia, he welcomes the growing continental presence of his compatriots, especially given the relatively small number of professional opportunities at home in the 10-team A-League. &quot;The challenge is to develop players who are talented and worldly enough to pursue a variety of career options,&quot; Schwab said. &quot;There is another important group \u2013 those who could struggle for A-League careers but who have embraced the next tier of Asian football, such as Indonesia. They are ambassadors. Provided the players can bring the media and the fans along with them then Australia can become an Asian football nation. Football has an important role to play in increasing Australia&apos;s &apos;Asian literacy&apos;.&quot;  There are cons to this growing army of Asian pros. &quot;The ultimate goal is players capable of playing in the world&apos;s best leagues,&quot; Schwab said. &quot;This remains essential if our national team is to be internationally competitive. Australia is falling away in this respect. Japan is now exporting players to these leagues in increasing numbers.&quot;  More than half of Japan&apos;s squad is based in Europe. The Asian champions have dominated the group in qualification and need only a draw to book a Brazil berth while the Socceroos, with just six points from the first five games, have work to do.  Former Socceroo and Crystal Palace star Craig Foster, now a leading analyst, wrote recently that the number of young players going to Asia was &quot;alarming&quot; and urged them to go to Europe. Bosnar argues that it is more a question of producing players of the required quality. &quot;I had talent but wasn&apos;t good enough to go to one of the top leagues so I came to Asia. Let&apos;s be honest, the best European leagues are better than Asian leagues. If Australia produces players that are good enough, they will go to Europe.&quot;  Schwab believes the relative lack of Australian players at the very top level is due to damage done to the country&apos;s development system a decade ago, damage that, he says, is being remedied. Asia is a big place. Not all leagues are equal, with Japan No 1 and Korea probably next. Less respect is given to the likes of Qatar and UAE.  &quot;I don&apos;t think West Asia is a good idea,&quot; said Bosnar. &quot;But I&apos;d be a hypocrite if I said I wouldn&apos;t go where the money was. But to say &apos;I am going to play in Qatar as there are less games so I can be fresh for the national team&apos; is bollocks. You are going there to make more money. But if selectors choose players from west Asia to play for the national team then they must be good enough.&quot;  We will see next Tuesday when this increasingly-Asian Australian team takes on the European stars of Japan. It should be quite a match. The Socceroos may be changing, but the desire to get to the World Cup is as strong as ever."}, {"sentences": ["This year&apos;s entries will be on display in Kichijouji, Tokyo until the end of the month and online at famicase.com."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Wii", "Xbox", "PlayStation", "PC", "Crowdfunding", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-28T07:57:11Z", "title": "Press Start: XBox One region lock and more reactions and details", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/may/28/game-links-press-start", "article": "A selection of links, hand-picked by the Guardian games writers.

Of course, Sony has made remote play a key feature of the PS4 proposition, so it was always likely we&apos;d see something similar on Xbox. According to Polygon&apos;s source, it works in conjunction with Skype, so that while chatting friends can take over each other&apos;s games. It&apos;s the Siri-like talk function that Polygon&apos;s story focuses on though, highlighting this rather startling possibility:  In one possible scenario, Kinect used its facial recognition to scan a room full of people and note if there was someone in the room it didn&apos;t recognize. It then told the console owner that there is someone in the room it didn&apos;t recognize and asked the new person to identify themselves. Once the person said their name, Kinect welcomed them and saved their information to the console.

We take it very seriously. We aren&apos;t using Kinect to snoop on anybody at all.

To do that, you need a product that solves a need. The problem the Xbox One solves best is a gaming one: &quot;how can I play great games on my 42&quot; screen?&quot; The other problems it solves (&quot;how do I control my television with my voice?&quot;, &quot;how do I stream television content through the same box I play my games on?&quot;) are not problems that consumers know they have, so they are unlikely to rush out to spend several hundred dollars to solve them. The Xbox 360 was a games device first and foremost, yet more than half of the time spent on the console is now spent consuming other media. Score one for the Trojan Horse tactic. That&apos;s why it seems so odd that Microsoft have abandoned the tactic so well in the last generation.  &quot;Stay away from DRM&quot; \u2013 campaign targets Sony | VG247  Fearing Sony might implement similar policies concerning used games sales and DRM to those Microsoft is rumored to be using for the Xbox One, fans have kicked off a Twitter campaign to reach out to key PlayStation employees, urging them to steer clear of such policies for the PlayStation 4. The campaign which took off via a forum post over at NeoGaf has been started to ensure Sony gets to know gamers&apos; opinions regarding restrictive DRM and used game policies and how they don&apos;t want such restrictions to be placed upon them when it comes to gaming on Sony&apos;s next-gen console: the PlayStation 4.

She was the eldest of three daughters of a British diplomat, Sir Michael Wilford, and his wife, Joan: her childhood homes were in Berlin, Paris, Rabat and Beijing. Following boarding school, at Oak Hall in Surrey, which Jane hated, she studied art in Rabat and then went to Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, to read philosophy, politics and economics. She loved working backstage in the theatre, as for Neville Coghill&apos;s memorable 1966 Oxford University Dramatic Society production of Dr Faustus, starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. In 1969, Jane joined her future husband, Ivan Bergerol, in Paris, where she became a reporter with the Financial Times. His work as an architect took them to Ivory Coast, where she continued with the FT, but in 1973 they divorced. On her own initiative, in 1975 Jane went to Angola and reported for the FT, the Observer and BBC radio. She helped to expose the truth of the invasion by South African forces and the atrocities that followed \u2013 actions the apartheid regime wanted to conceal, not least from the white electorate in South Africa. I met Jane on the eve of independence in November 1975, when arriving in the capital, Luanda. We became travelling companions, and later produced a book together, Angola in the Front Line (1983): Jane was particularly expert on the military aspects. In 1980, Jane and her partner, Jabulani Zikalala, had a daughter, Nonkululeko, meaning freedom - Nkuli for short. Jabulani, a combatant for Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress, died in Angola when Nkuli was less than a year old. Jane studied medicine and qualified as a physician in the Angolan system in 1985. Then she retrained at University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London, qualifying there in 1991, and went on to junior posts at the North Glasgow university hospitals. After nearly two years in Johannesburg (1994-95), Jane and her daughter returned to Glasgow, where she specialised in drink and drugs-related problems in accident and emergency work, becoming a consultant in occupational health (2002). From 2005 onwards she was a senior consultant in London, advising institutions such as the Foreign Office and then British Council, and from 2010 was chair of the London group of the Society of Occupational Medicine. To both her careers she brought a deep determination to help others. Jane was the best cook and conversationalist one could ever meet: the gap between what we survived on in Angola and the diplomatic entertaining described in letters from her parents in Tokyo could be bridged only with a considerable leap of imagination.

He had an autopsy because he suffered a sudden death. I guess because I didn&apos;t see him, I was left to wonder a lot about it.&quot; Baseman is talking about the death of his younger brother, and how such a close personal loss directly influenced the choice of subject matter for his latest work, Deadness \u2013 a study of embalming that opens at Matt&apos;s Gallery this month. Baseman is an artist who deals in other people&apos;s stories. He takes them, chews them up and transforms them into something else. He is the artistic equivalent of literature&apos;s unreliable narrator: a story told by Jordan Baseman is not the story he was told, and not the story that was expected. But unlike his literary equivalent, Baseman usually provides evidence to support his retellings of other people&apos;s lives. His chosen technique is the interview, conducted over several sittings, which he then chops and changes into a final piece of film. Many are simple, straight-to-camera talking heads, a form familiar from TV; some, like Deadness, are installed with a visual track of still images. &quot;I would describe what I do as experimental portraiture,&quot; Baseman says. &quot;They&apos;re all portraits, but they&apos;re really self-portraits \u2013 it&apos;s just that I&apos;m not there.&quot;     In black and white \u2026 another photograph included in Deadness. Photograph: courtesy the artist and Matt's Gallery, London    His use of a technique normally associated with journalism raises ethical questions: how complicit are Baseman&apos;s participants in the way their stories are used? How does he reconcile his concern for their feelings with the desire to produce compelling art? &quot;All the participants have seen my work prior to taking part,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m totally up front. I think of it as creative non-fiction. They offer up a situation, then the context changes radically. The participant has got to be OK with it, because it&apos;s their life I&apos;m hijacking for my own means. It&apos;s a mutually exploitative situation: they have a reason to participate and I want them to.&quot; For Green Lady, recently shown at Index Gallery, Baseman presents the audio interview of a woman talking about her mother&apos;s death alongside an unconnected series of images shot on Super 16mm film. The final film is an emotive story narrated by its subject with jarring, dispassionate clarity. Baseman&apos;s use of a collage of semi-abstract images adds to the sense of detachment; perhaps this distance is necessary for Baseman&apos;s technique to flourish. In Deadness, Baseman counterpoints the cheery testimony of John Troyer, from Bath University&apos;s Centre for Death and Society, with a procession of snapshots of the dead photographed in their coffins. While Troyer declares that &quot;one of the reasons early photographers could work so well with the deceased was that they didn&apos;t move&quot;, the viewer&apos;s eye is drawn to quirky preparations for the afterlife \u2013 the number of corpses wearing glasses; the grim visages of undertakers caught on camera, angels of death at a stranger&apos;s funeral; a shovel stuck in the mound of earth behind a baby lying in a casket propped up in the snow. That quirkiness soon gives way to unease: this unrelenting parade of the dead is gruelling. Baseman acquired the photographs in online auctions, a fact which heightens our sense of intrusion as viewers.     Jordan Baseman's Deadness Photograph: courtesy the artist and Matt's Gallery, London    If this is ethnography, it is flawed: the work is too manufactured. But the predetermined nature of Baseman&apos;s work is what makes it interesting art, taking it beyond the realm of the observational and into the performative. Baseman says that all the participants in his films \u2013 from the two men with the failed Thornton&apos;s chocolate shop to the chroniclers of Soho&apos;s underbelly and Jump!&apos;s Steve &quot;Krusher&quot; Joule \u2013 are pleased with the results. But for the audience, they prove unsettling viewing, provoking a sense of complicity. Is his art cruel? &quot;I think it&apos;s OK to say it&apos;s cruel,&quot; he says. &quot;It has cruelty within it. Sometimes it&apos;s a little close to the heart of something, and that&apos;s what makes it a little cruel. Some of that is from me, some is the situation. Pointing the camera at people is a difficult thing in real life.&quot; Baseman was born in Philadelphia in 1960, and studied fine art in his hometown and at Goldsmiths College in London. He paid his way through college in Pennsylvania working in an emergency psychiatric shelter that he describes as &quot;Stephen King meets Ken Kesey&quot;, a place where &quot;there were people who had murdered and people who were trying to get clean all wandering around or playing ping pong&quot;. Despite working with video and film at college, he moved into sculpture after graduating, finding success, showing at the Saatchi Gallery with works such as Surrender (1995), an array of cherubs and human teeth, and The Cat and the Dog (1995), described in the deadpan manner of artists&apos; labelling as &quot;Skinned cat and dog with modelled heads&quot;. But one day, during a residency at Camden Arts Centre, he decided he&apos;d had enough of sculpture. &quot;A gallerist came along and said, you know if you make 10 of them I can sell them all. And I was generally not having a good time, so I stopped. I woke up and thought: I&apos;m not doing this any more. I&apos;ll make films.&quot; Since Green Lady, Baseman has made Tokyo = Fukushima, which received its British premiere at Index, Deadness, and The Last Walk, a tremendous shaggy dog/self-immolation story narrated by the artist Stuart Brisley. But now, Baseman says, he is done with death. &quot;I&apos;m stopping that now. I&apos;m deathed out. It&apos;s depressing.&quot; From death he&apos;s moving into crime, and is currently looking for interviewees with experience of crime. Baseman finds his participants through a variety of routes, from chance encounters to introductions to placing adverts in local newspapers and magazines. And what do the adverts say? &quot;Got a story to tell? Call Jordan.&quot; \u2022 Deadness is at Matt&apos;s Gallery, London, from 29 May to 21 July."}, {"sentences": ["[Sombre] I&apos;d like to have it in Tokyo because the food is so good.", "Seeing as you&apos;ve had your final meal in Tokyo, we may as well fit in some karaoke afterwards."], "tags": ["Australia rugby union team", "British & Irish Lions", "Rugby union", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-30T04:26:00Z", "title": "George Gregan: 'I would have loved a southern hemisphere Lions'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/30/george-gregan-small-talk-lions", "article": "Morning GeorgeMorning Small Talk Small Talk heard the Lions described as the best team in the world on the radio the other day.

[With immense satisfaction] There you go: perfect. [Returning to the subject in hand] Mate, it&apos;s hard to say they&apos;re the best team in the world because they only get together once every four years. They&apos;re certainly a unique team in the way they&apos;re formed from different sides. Who&apos;s going to take the series then? And don&apos;t say the best team over three gamesWell, I&apos;ll go with the Wallabies, they&apos;ve got home advantage. The opening game is really important but I think it&apos;ll be a close series and will come down to the decider. Is this a better Lions squad than the last time they toured Australia?It&apos;s hard to say, Small Talk. The 2001 team had some very good players. You had Brian O&apos;Driscoll, Martin Johnson. Matt Dawson couldn&apos;t even get off the bench until Rob Howley got injured and some of the English guys in the squad went on to win the World Cup a few years later. Then there are players in this squad who I think will be stars at the 2015 World Cup. Names, George! We want names!Well, the Lions have a good mix of youth and experience but someone I&apos;m looking forward to seeing is Sam Warburton. He&apos;s a young captain but he&apos;s the type of player that can thrive under pressure. I think he showed that in the World Cup in New Zealand [in 2011]. It strikes Small Talk as a bit unfair that Australia don&apos;t get to play in a Lions-style super team. Which side would you have liked the Wallabies to have joined up with in your pomp?Oh, I think a southern hemisphere team with New Zealand, Australia and South Africa would have been great. We&apos;ve got the Tri-Nations tournament anyway, so a best-of-the-best team would have been brilliant. Having said that, there&apos;s some wonderful Pacific Island teams so an overall southern hemisphere team would have been pretty exciting. If you could play with guys you competed against for years, that would be wonderful. You&apos;ve travelled the world listening to all kinds of brass bands, opera singers and reality show winners belt out national anthems. Which country has the best toe-tapper? Apart from Australia, of course.[In a flash] France. You couldn&apos;t help humming along to that. [Launching into La Marseillaise with gusto] Marchons! Marchons! [Coming back to reality] Although I&apos;ve got to say the South African one has some really beautiful parts. What&apos;s the hardest hit you&apos;ve ever received in rugby?[With glee] Oh, I remember that one actually: it&apos;s a funny one. It was Zinzan Brooke: he knocked me out in the 1997 Super Rugby final. [With awe] He knocked me out. I remember him getting the ball and the next thing I remember is waking up in the changing room with the doctor standing over me. [Once again, surprisingly jaunty]. He knocked me out. Zinzan had a huge melon, like one of those Easter Island statues. I caught up with him after a game a few months later and he said he still had a sore head from the clash. [Proud] His big melon and my hard head caused that. In a theoretical universe, you&apos;ve been convicted of a crime you didn&apos;t commit in a hick town in Texas and you&apos;re on death row. What&apos;s your last meal?[Anguished] Aaaaah, good question Small Talk. [Thinks] Oh, what would I have? [Mulls] That&apos;s a good question. [Ponders] What would I have? You can have starters, main and dessert. The governor is pushing the boat out.[Sombre] I&apos;d like to have it in Tokyo because the food is so good. [This may violate the terms of George&apos;s sentence, but Small Talk will let it go] I&apos;m going to have sashimi for starters. For the main, I&apos;d have \u2026 [really thinking] aaaah \u2026 some beautiful steamed fish on rice with ginger and dark soya sauce. And steamed chinese spinach with garlic and ginger. And the dessert \u2026 the dessert would be \u2026 [Decisive] Tell you what, I&apos;m not a dessert man so I&apos;d just go with a really nice coffee, an espresso and some vanilla bean ice cream. [With satisfaction] There you go, nice and simple. Seeing as you&apos;ve had your final meal in Tokyo, we may as well fit in some karaoke afterwards. And then we&apos;ll have the execution. What does George Gregan like to belt out of an evening?That&apos;a a good point, I do like a bit of karaoke. I&apos;d go for [Canadian No1 with a bullet in 1997] Every Morning by Sugar Ray. You&apos;ve got to know the range of your voice to do karaoke well, Small Talk. Athletes are usually annoyingly good at all sports. Were there any you struggled with at school? Subaquatic golf? Cross country cricket? Downhill polo?I&apos;m not a good swimmer. Anything water based I&apos;m terrible at [Small Talk places a cross next to subaquatic golf]. Surfing, I can&apos;t do that. Golf, tennis, badminton, cricket: anything that requires movement I&apos;m good at. But darts or snooker, I&apos;m not very good at those. What&apos;s your best break in snooker? As low as 140?I&apos;d be happy just to pot one ball, Small Talk. I&apos;d be running around the table naked in celebration. [Rueful] I&apos;m terrible at snooker. Who&apos;d win in a fight between a kiwi, a wallaby, a springbok and a cockerel? We&apos;re talking animals rather than the players here\u2026Awwwhhh. Excellent question [that&apos;s three good questions in one interview readers. THREE!] Well, the kiwi&apos;s not going to do much. That&apos;s a lover not a fighter that one. The springbok&apos;s fast but I wouldn&apos;t fancy its chances either. A kangaroo would be OK but [emphatic] a wallaby&apos;s going to struggle. I think it&apos;s going to have to be the cockerel, it&apos;s the only one that will stick around and fight. If it was a kangaroo rather than a wallaby, I&apos;d back the roo \u2013 a big red or something. They&apos;ve got a bit of mongrel in them. But stick me down for the rooster: they don&apos;t turn their backs and run. [Satisfied with his choice] Beautiful. And what&apos;s the last movie you watched?[George goes through a tunnel at this point] Saw CRACKLE on the plane \u2026 with CRACKLE! running around in a garbage bag CRACKLE! a girl CRACKLE! looks like he&apos;s got CRACKLE! issues. [Small Talk hazards a guess at Silver Linings Playbook, the movie of which was at least 34 times better than the rubbish excuse of a book]What&apos;s your thoughts on the beard in rugby? The average front row looks like an oversized hipsters convention these days.Well, it&apos;s always been a thing on tour \u2013 guys growing a beard. It&apos;s definitely something for the tight-five guys, the bigger guys can pull it off. Some of the guys who grow big ones start to complain about itchiness around the two-week mark anyway. But I was never able to grow a good one myself. [With a dash of melancholy] I wouldn&apos;t have minded a neat one with a moustache. On that down note, we&apos;ll leave you be George.No worries, Small Talk.

Michinoku Farm, based in Saitama prefecture, north of Tokyo, had advertised jerky-like snacks for dogs made from North Atlantic fin whales imported from Iceland. The treats were removed from its website hours after protests from four groups, including the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) in the US. Michinoku&apos;s president, Takuma Konno, said he had decided to pull the product even though its sale is legal in Japan. &quot;Dogs are like family members for many people in Japan. We just wanted to sell a wide variety of food for dogs,&quot; he told the AFP news agency. &quot;Campaigners look at whales as important animals, but we consider dogs to be just as important. &quot;Maybe I was ignorant of the debate over whaling, but it&apos;s not worth selling the product if it risks angering some people.&quot; The firm, which also sells pet snacks made from kangaroo and Mongolian horse, had been selling the whale chews in packets of three sizes, including a 500g bag for 3,780 yen (\u00a325). Japan has imported Icelandic fin whale for human consumption since 2008, but appears to have moved into the pet food business amid a dramatic decline in consumption of all types of whale meat among diners. &quot;The most likely reason for shops to sell the whalemeat dog treat is to target affluent Japanese who want to show off their wealth with something different,&quot; said Nanami Kurasawa, executive director of the Japan-based Dolphin and Whale Action Network. &quot;The product description identifies the meat as being fin whale of Icelandic origin. Its use in pet food suggests that new markets are being explored.&quot; Susan Milward, executive director of AWI, said: &quot;We are extremely pleased to see Michinoku Farm respond in such a progressive, compassionate and prompt manner, and we would strongly urge all other businesses to follow suit and end such sales.&quot; Similar products are still available elsewhere on the internet, however, including through Rakuten, Japan&apos;s biggest online retailer. &quot;It is grotesque that this Icelandic company is flouting two international conventions in order to feed endangered fin whales to pampered pets in Japan,&quot; said Clare Perry, a senior campaigner with the EIA. &quot;In the face of such blatant disregard for species conservation and international agreements, internet retailers such as Rakuten need to take more responsibility for the sustainability and acceptability of the products they market, and should follow the example of Amazon and Google, which have banned the sale of all whale products in Japan.&quot; Fin whales, the world&apos;s second largest mammals after blue whales, are listed as being at risk of extinction, although Iceland says populations have recovered enough to withstand sustainable hunting. Campaigners said they questioned the &quot;environmental and economic logic of using meat from an endangered species for the manufacture of dog treats&quot;. Michinoku&apos;s move comes as Iceland prepares to resume its controversial hunt of more than 180 fin whales this year for the export market. Hvalur, the Icelandic company that exports the whalemeat to Japan, caught 148 fin whales in 2010, but hasn&apos;t slaughtered any for the past two years due to a collapse in demand following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami on Japan&apos;s north-east coast.

Sample dialogue: &quot;And how many cocks can you &apos;entertain&apos; with that cute little cum-dumpster of yours?&quot; Her Crystal is an abrasive, chain-smoking, bottle-blonde Messalina tottering around in fuck-me shoes and too much eye makeup, wielding Virginia Slims as though they were deadly weapons. She&apos;s the Barbie from hell, as if Paris Hilton had suddenly lived 20 more years and had a personality transplant from Lucy Liu in Kill Bill: Volume 1. Just as the hotel chain heiress apparently modelled her own makeover on Mattel&apos;s fashion doll, so Barbie&apos;s doe eyes, pert nose and pouty lips have somehow become the facial standard to which many women aspire. Some even have themselves surgically altered to this end. Woman or doll? Crystal is all woman. How can you tell?

When the objects of his amorous obsessions are not singing themselves to death or trampling over dead men&apos;s souls with gold-painted toenails, they&apos;re bewitching him with their ballet \u2013 and since Olympia is played by Moira Shearer, who already danced herself to death in The Red Shoes, you know her terpsichorean skills are something special. What Hoffmann doesn&apos;t realise, because he&apos;s wearing magic spectacles (read: beer goggles), is that Olympia is a clockwork doll. Only when his nemesis (played by Robert Helpmann, aka the Child-Catcher) and an irate ophthalmologist start squabbling over unpaid bills and tear her to pieces does Hoffmann discover the truth. He,\u00a0and we, are left with the disconcerting image of Olympia&apos;s still-blinking severed head, while a wistful lackey strokes her dismembered hand. This is the movie that made George A Romero want to make movies. Woman or doll? Olympia is one hell of a doll. How can you tell? The way she keeps running out of power until someone winds her up again is a dead\u00a0giveaway. What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? 1962            &quot;Folks, have you ever seen such a lovely doll?&quot; It&apos;s hard to tell whether Mr Hudson is talking about his daughter, precocious vaudeville star Baby Jane Hudson, or the Baby Jane dolls on sale at her gigs for $3.25. But &quot;the diminutive dancing duse from Duluth&quot; in blonde ringlets certainly embodies the living doll-like qualities of Hollywood child stars such as Shirley Temple and, more recently, Honey Boo Boo. Baby Jane, of course, grows up into Bette Davis in Robert Aldrich&apos;s classic slice of American grotesque, which started a trend for casting ageing actresses in campy gothic horror movies. Davis and Joan Crawford play reclusive sisters locked in an abusive relationship in their crumbling Hollywood mansion; wheelchair-bound Blanche (Crawford) is tormented by Davis as the increasingly batty Jane, who dreams of making a comeback. No one can play the terrorised victim like Joan, but it was Bette, with her gloriously unhinged rendition of I&apos;ve Written a Letter to Daddy, who got the Oscar nomination. Woman or doll? Baby Jane is a woman. But &quot;Woman Jane&quot; wouldn&apos;t have the same ring, obviously. How can you tell? Because no sane toymaker would design a baby doll that looked like 54-year-old Bette Davis, unless they were actively seeking to traumatise a child. (Or perhaps appeal to a collector&apos;s market \u2013 I&apos;d snap up one in an instant.) Blade Runner 1982            The Tyrell Corporation (&quot;More human than human is our motto&quot;) prides itself on the manufacture of &quot;replicants&quot; so realistically human-looking they can only be detected by expert application of the Voight-Kampff empathy test. And Ridley Scott&apos;s adaptation of the Philip K Dick novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? raises philosophical and ethical questions about the differences between humans and &quot;skin-jobs&quot;. Any film that manages to wring world-class performances out of both Daryl Hannah and Sean Young deserves a special niche in cinema history \u2013 they and the other actors do a fine job of incarnating creatures &quot;designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions&quot;, but experiencing the rudimentary stirrings of those emotions all the same. Pris, played by Hannah, is &quot;a basic pleasure model&quot;, the futuristic equivalent of the inflatable sex-doll. She has rebelled against her preordained role, but later, in the toymaker&apos;s loft, hides in plain sight, in a roomful of dolls. Woman or doll? It&apos;s complicated, like the film. Pris is a replicant posing as a woman posing as a doll. How can you tell? Oh I don&apos;t know, maybe the way she can plunge her arm into a container\u00a0of boiling water to extract a hard-boiled egg without scalding herself? Or how about throttling a bloke with her thighs? Kamikaze Girls 2004            Tetsuya Nakashima&apos;s candy-coloured adaptation of Shimotsuma Story, Novala Takemoto&apos;s cult &quot;light novel&quot; (the Japanese equivalent of young adult fiction), essentially offers an introduction to Japanese girl fashion tribes, which are a lot more fun than the well-worn cliques in American high-school movies. Momoko (Kyoko Fukada) lives in a deadbeat rural region of Japan with her feisty gran and loser dad, but this doesn&apos;t stop her obsessing over Rococo-era France, grooving to Johann Strauss and dressing like a Marie Antoinette shepherdess in frocks from a Tokyo clothes store called Baby, the Stars Shine Bright. This is a real store which caters to the so-called Lolita tribe, members of which deck themselves out with bonnets, parasols and petticoats in a bid to resemble the sort of crinoline-clad dolls one normally associates with kitsch toilet roll covers. Woman or doll? Momoko may look like a doll, but she is most definitely a young woman. How can you tell? Nakashima&apos;s film is boppy live action with outbreaks of anime and cartoon-like violence, but, like its heroine, the story is not nearly as fluffy and mindless as it first appears. Momoko values her status as an aloof loner, but is won over by aggressive but genuine overtures of friendship from a biker chick called Ichiko.

Like students studying for exams who can hear the parties of those who have finished, the men in green and gold may be feeling envious when the final whistle blows, but need to head home quickly for there is still work to do with the visits of Jordan and Iraq on June 11 and 18 respectively.  With just six points from the first five games in Group B, Australia need something similar from the final three games to take the second automatic qualification spot behind the Samurai Blue. It&apos;s tight. Just two points separate second and fifth. The Socceroos are third, a point behind Jordan but with a game in hand. Given that the three west Asian teams in the group have all taken points off each other (and Japan&apos;s dominance has helped), it could be a lot worse. Since joining the Asian Football Confederation in 2006, Australia have never been such an overwhelming underdog when playing a fellow member. The cricket team winning the Ashes in England would be less of a shock than the Socceroos leaving Japan with three points. Low expectations may help Australia at the home of the star-studded continental champions. After all, they haven&apos;t really performed against the so-called smaller teams of late. Much has changed since Lucas Neill and company arrived at the Asian Cup in 2007 and predicted they would triumph without losing a game. Now 35 and clubless, Neill is just one of eight of the old guard still at their posts from the 2006 World Cup, while Japan have one. Australia had the second-oldest squad in South Africa at the 2010 World Cup and would be in contention for first in Brazil \u2013 evolution that hasn&apos;t been matched in most other departments. If winning would be a shock, a starting 11 with an average age under 30 would be a surprise. Holger Osieck was appointed in 2010 and part of his remit was to develop and refresh an ageing squad. That has been largely ignored by the German, forgotten by the FFA (perhaps wary of the famous Osieck temper) and \u2013 until recently \u2013 forgiven by much of the media. Fans have long pointed out that not all that glitters is old. There is young talent around and while some is in the squad, few expect it to start on the pitch. Tommy Oar has enjoyed a fine season in the Netherlands and Tom Rogic, a year younger at 20, joined Celtic this year. By now, they could have had a decent amount of competitive international experience under their belts. Others have been ignored completely. Player of the year for champions Central Coast Mariners, Trent Sainsbury, 21, is out, while Robbie Cornthwaite, the Blackburn-born man-mountain, who has spent most of the season on the bench at Chunnam Dragons, South Korea&apos;s answer to Fulham, makes the cut. The final round started last June with a goalless draw in Oman, not a bad result given the heat in Muscat. Then was a rush back to Brisbane to draw with Japan, a result and performance that was supposed to be a foundation to build on. Defeat in Jordan put paid to thatm and if Tim Cahill and Archie Thompson had not scored two late goals against Iraq to turn what would have been a disastrous defeat into a vital victory, the Socceroos would have been propping up the group at the midway point.  For Australia, this was always a group of two halves. Take Japan out of the equation \u2013 which they managed to do by themselves by soon disappearing over the horizon \u2013 and the first half was all played in west Asia. For the second, Oman, Jordan and Iraq had to travel for the kind of games Australia usually win at home. In the early stages, when the indifferent performances mounted while the points on the board did not, that thought calmed nerves. The problem is that having three winnable home matches does not equal nine automatic points. So it proved when a lively Oman team took a 2-0 lead in Sydney in March. It took another Cahill intervention to drag the plodding Socceroos back to scrape a 2-2 draw. That priceless point means that if Australia beat Jordan and Iraq at home, the result in Japan is irrelevant. But that leaves no margin for error. Any misstep and the Australians head into third place and the play-off route that was supposed to have been left behind in Oceania. A result in Japan would not only make things easier, it would lift the mood and the pressure. Games between the two have been close over the years and there is a rivalry developing that the Japanese enjoy, bereft as it is of the historical and regional factors that can make games with South Korea and especially China bad-tempered affairs. The 1-1 draw last June in Brisbane was entertaining, though it was Japan who played most of the football. Faced with the likes of Shinji Kagawa of Manchester United, who usually plays on the left for his national team, Keisuke Honda behind the striker, the cultured Makoto Hasebe and Yasuhito Endo in the middle, not to mention flying full backs Atsuto Uchida and Yuto Nagatomo, the Socceroos increasingly invoke good old Aussie spirit, passion and fight. And then there is the height. Josh Kennedy is the only one of the visitors to play his club football in Japan, yet far from bringing influence from Asia&apos;s most cultured league into the Australian ranks, the tall striker has a more basic recommendation. &quot;Japan are wary of our aerial threat and they will be nervous if we get plenty of bodies into box and provide some really good service in there from free kicks, corners and the like.&quot; That may have been the case once, but it bothers Japan less and less. Coach Alberto Zaccheroni wants to get this match and qualification out of the way and focus on Brazil, Italy and Mexico at the Confederations Cup later in June. The Italian has been fine-tuning since he took over after the 2010 World Cup, when only a penalty shootout deprived the Samurai Blue of a quarter-final spot. This is now a team as settled as it gets and a 2-0 defeat at home to Bulgaria on Thursday was unexpected but experimental. As well as Kagawa and the influential Honda, who arrived in the country only on Sunday after winning the Russian Cup with CSKA Moscow, the team is packed with players from the Bundesliga, Serie A and Premier League.  The hosts may be clear favourites, but since the 2006 World Cup, all five meetings between the two have ended in draws after 90 minutes. For Japan a convincing win against their rivals would put the icing on the cakewalk that has been qualification. But given a sixth successive stalemate would mean a fifth successive World Cup spot, they would probably settle for that.

Tens of billions of yen earmarked for employment schemes was spent on a range of initiatives located far from the tsunami-hit region, such as counting sea turtles, publishing a restaurant guide and publicising a mascot for a local prefecture, a Japanese newspaper said. The evidence of wasteful public spending, uncovered by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, will come as an embarrassment to the government, months after it was revealed that a quarter of the \u00a511.7tn the government initially allocated to rebuild the region had been spent on other unrelated projects. The Asahi found that \u00a5108.5bn of the \u00a5200bn employment budget had been spent in 38 prefectures other than the nine that were affected by the 11 March disaster, in which more than 18,000 people died. Those nine include Iwate and Miyagi, which were hardest hit by the tsunami, and Fukushima, scene of a triple meltdown that forced more than 150,000 people to leave their homes. The government&apos;s top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said the Asahi&apos;s claims were being investigated. &quot;After seeing the results, we will take firm measures with a view to stricter rules [on the use of funds],&quot; he told reporters. On the second anniversary of the disaster, more than 300,000 people were still living in temporary accommodation; many have been unable to find new jobs. The money, which was spent under the previous Democratic party of Japan administration, was intended to help survivors find employment, but a breakdown shows that 97% of people who were given jobs were unaffected by the disaster. Of the 65,000 people employed under the scheme, just 2,000 came from the disaster-hit region, the Asahi said. The paper speculated that local authorities across the country had exploited ambiguous rules governing distribution of the funds to create jobs for local residents. Officials in Kagoshima prefecture, located more than 600 miles (1,000km) south-west of the damaged coastline, spent \u00a53m employing 10 people to count sea turtles as they came ashore as part of a conservation project. &quot;We were not even asked to move eggs to a safe place,&quot; the Asahi quoted one of the employees as saying. &quot;The project did not help sea turtles, let alone disaster victims.&quot; Central government officials defended the spending, saying many survivors of the disaster had relocated to areas across Japan. The data showed, however, that 12 of the prefectures employed fewer than 10 survivors, including one each among almost 2,000 people hired using tsunami budget cash in Yamaguchi and Miyazaki prefectures, both located hundreds of kilometres away. Shinzo Abe&apos;s Liberal Democratic party came to office last December promising to speed up the recovery after criticism that his predecessor, Yoshihiko Noda, had failed to quickly provide proper homes and jobs to displaced people. The following month, Abe increased the disaster reconstruction budget from \u00a519tn to \u00a525tn over five years. Building work in the dozens of towns and villages affected by the tsunami has helped create jobs, but little has been done to find long-term work for farmers and fishermen whose industries were seriously damaged by the tsunami and nuclear accident. Officials admitted there was little they could do to check how money was spent once it has been distributed to local authorities. This is not the first time officials have had to explain the misuse of reconstruction funds. Questionable expenditures for the 2011 portion of the disaster recovery budget included \u00a5500m for road construction in Okinawa, more than 1,000 miles (1,750km) away, and \u00a5330m to repair a sports stadium in Tokyo.

This hazy lattice of spindly white rods, which hovers above the ground like a digital apparition, is the 13th annual Serpentine Gallery pavilion, designed by the Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto. At 41, Fujimoto is the youngest architect to be selected for the commission, and he brings a fresh, experimental energy to the project. &quot;I wanted to create a structure that was somewhere between architecture and nature,&quot; he says, &quot;something like the primitive beginnings of a building.&quot; His pavilion is not composed of walls or roofs, but rather is seemingly grown from a steel matrix that extends upwards and outwards in all directions, like a garden trellis on steroids. It forms a shape-shifting mass with no discernible edges. Here and there, it rises into pert peaks and swells outwards in dramatic overhangs; from other angles, it appears to slump like a deflated meringue. As you walk around, over and through the structure, the layered grids play games with your eyes, creating ever-changing patterns in a three-dimensional tartan weave. In some places it seems solid, forming dense, rocky crags; in others, it is barely there at all. Stepping inside, surrounded by this all-pervasive grid, feels like entering a computer mainframe, as imagined in the 1980s. It is a dazzling, Tron-like landscape of infinite white lines, the modular, cubic units of which form terraces of seating and steps, side tables and a coffee bar, as if Fujimoto has revealed an invisible geometric order of which the whole world is made. The cubes are not closed, but rather extend in projecting rods, like the frayed edges of fabric, suggesting the network might continue to grow. On an overcast day, it&apos;s hard to tell quite where it ends. Relating his design to a distinctly Japanese conception of nature, Fujimoto describes how the process of crafting the form was &quot;like clipping a bonsai tree&quot;. Working from hand drawings and large-scale models, he &quot;pruned&quot; sections of the grid to provide nooks and crannies, creating a multi-levelled terrain of places to perch and explore. &quot;Architecture,&quot; he says, &quot;should provide a background structure that allows people to behave in a different way. I want visitors to find cosy spaces here.&quot; It is an idea that runs through all of his buildings, which he compares to caves and nests, trees and forests: natural landscapes to be inhabited. His transparent House NA, in Tokyo, is as close as you could get to a treehouse of steel and glass, with clusters of rooms suspended within an impossibly slender frame. It is, like the pavilion, a beguiling nest of what he calls in-between spaces that elegantly dissolve the boundaries between the private interior and the busy street on a cramped urban site. But Kensington is a long way from the dense plots of inner-city Tokyo. Here, his utopian frame looks like it could do with something to rub up against. It is a shame that, where it meets the realities of safety and access, his continuous landscape is fettered with balustrades and safety rails to stop you hitting your head \u2013 as well as layers of acrylic discs to keep out the rain. Like the dreamy megastructure projects of the 1960s before it, the relentless aerial grids of Yona Friedman and the tree-like towers of the Japanese Metabolists, with their plug-in living pods, Fujimoto&apos;s cloud is somewhat deflated when it meets the real world. But as a powerful distillation of a young architect&apos;s ideas and one of the most radical pavilions to date, it sets a promising direction for the Serpentine programme."}, {"sentences": ["On the day itself blue-shirted legions were packing out the trains heading north from Tokyo on the Keihin Tohoku Line four hours before kick-off; three hours before there were lines half a kilometre long outside the turnstiles; and with two hours to go, the arena was almost half-full."], "tags": ["Australia", "Japan", "World Cup 2014", "World Cup 2014 qualifiers", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-04T23:37:00Z", "title": "Japan v Australia World Cup qualifier: five things we learned", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jun/05/japan-australia-world-cup-qualifer-2014", "article": "Holger Osieck has saved his job \u2013 for another two weeks at least There were well-sourced\u00a0whispers before the game that the German would be on his way this week if Australia lost convincingly. They didn\u2019t and so he won\u2019t. Australia may have been massive underdogs, may have been on the ropes for most of the second half but this was a resilient, determined and energetic performance at the home of the best team in Asia. It is stating the obvious to say that Australia would have settled for a point before the game but were devastated to be denied a famous win by a last-minute penalty. The watchword in training all week had been structure and that was evident from the start. The defence was well-organised, if a little deep, and stood firm against the intricate Japanese patterns and for the most part got plenty of bodies in the way of Shinji Kagawa and Keisuke Honda. For the second half of the first half, the Socceroos had the home team worried with some fast-paced counter-attacking play and though Japan dominated for much of the second, Australia defended from the front and took the punishment. After the lethargy of the Oman draw in March, Osieck has to ensure that his players can produce the intensity they showed against Japan in their next two World Cup qualifiers against Jordan and Iraq. Six points will be needed. Open play was the Aussie way Before the game, the press pack from down under believed that the team\u2019s only chance of a goal would be from a set piece. It was expected to be an aerial assault, a long-ball battering but Australia were at their best on the floor and, indeed, rarely threatened from corners and free-kicks. In the first half especially, there was much to like about how the visitors broke forward at pace whenever the opportunity presented itself. Mark Bresciano, reintroduced to the starting line-up after being benched against Oman, was composed and controlled in possession \u2013 though forced deep in the second half, Brett Holman was excellent in both distribution and movement while the pace of Tommy Oar worried the defence if his final product was a little unpredictable \u2013 as Japanese goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima would testify. Australia were never going to match the Japanese in terms of the quality of football but were better than expected. The Japanese like to do things early  Hundreds of fans had marked their place in the line outside Saitama Stadium in previous days with tape and plastic bags. On the day itself blue-shirted legions were packing out the trains heading north from Tokyo on the Keihin Tohoku Line four hours before kick-off; three hours before there were lines half a kilometre long outside the turnstiles; and with two hours to go, the arena was almost half-full. Then 90 minutes of constant chanting and support was, in the end, rewarded with a goal and the stadium exploded with noise to make the ears hurt. A minute later and the final whistled sounded to signal Japan becoming the first team to qualify for the 2014 World Cup (after the hosts, Brazil), to make it a hat-trick after doing the same in 2006 and 2010. The players performed a lap of honour with Time To Say Goodbye ringing out into the warm evening air as Honda promised that the Samurai Blue will do their best to win the Confederations Cup later this month. Keisuke Honda is a showman \u2013 and available He was the last to join up with the squad, arriving from Moscow on Sunday with a baby in tow, announcing as he did so that he was ready to leave Russia for one of the big leagues. He was the last to emerge from the team bus as it arrived at the stadium, his nonchalant exit bringing by far the biggest cheer from the fans watching the scoreboard inside. And he was the best player on the pitch. Honda in the middle may reduce J\u00fcrgen Klopp to tears by forcing the impressive Kagawa to the left but he brings smiles to the faces of the entire nation of Japan every time he gets the ball and against Australia, he got the ball a lot. Playing just behind the striker, he was always available, always moving, always dangerous, just one of those players who demands to be seen in the flesh. It was fitting that he scored the all-important goal. Old guard repaid Osieck\u2019s faith Much has been written about the advancing years of some Socceroo members \u2013 the average age of the starting 11 was 30.6 \u2013 but sometimes, the vets are the best. Mark Schwarzer was almost flawless in goal, showing why he is still a Premier League goalkeeper at the wrong side of 40,\u00a0in terms of pace, Lucas Neill started his career slowly and has since faded but what the former Blackburn Rovers and West Ham United defender lacks in speed he makes up for in leadership. It was Neill\u2019s best game in the green and gold for years while Sasa Ognenovski was solid in the tackle. Tim Cahill worked hard as the main man in attack, dragging Moya Yoshida around the backline with the aforementioned Bresciano showing his class, especially in the first half. For months, years, Aussie fans have been calling for young blood on the pitch and while they got some in the shape of Oar, they also got plenty of sweat and inspiration from the oldies. They need to get some rest."}, {"sentences": ["A team of researchers at Sony Computer Science Laboratories in Tokyo is embedding tiny motors, cameras, and actuators into Lego blocks."], "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-05T06:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: iPhone 4's US ban, Obama's troll-chasing, Lego + Sony, and more", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jun/05/iphone-us-ban-obama-patents", "article": "A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team ITC bans importation of older iPhones and iPads into the US over 3G-essential Samsung patent &gt;&gt; FOSS Patents Florian M\u00fcller:   basically, Apple would have to make the iPhone\u00a04S its entry-level iPhone model and discontinue U.S. sales of older iPhones (and the &quot;new iPad 4G&quot;, the third-generation iPad, its entry-level model for iPads with cellular connectivity; WiFi iPads are not affected at all).

Sony and Lego collaborating on toy research &gt;&gt; Network World  Sony and Lego are working together on creating a new generation of products that bridge the gap between toys and video games. A team of researchers at Sony Computer Science Laboratories in Tokyo is embedding tiny motors, cameras, and actuators into Lego blocks. One demonstration uses two small motorized Lego platforms, one of which is computer-controlled and will relentlessly pursue the other, which can be maneuvered using a wireless PlayStation controller or by hand. Any combination of blocks can be built up on the platforms, and more platforms can be added. The system could be used to create Lego battles, or simply play tag. The research team has also added actuators that can cause Lego structures to crumble on demand, and camera blocks that can beam first-hand video of the action to tablets and smartphones.

Hard Choices: Intel&apos;s &apos;orrible new Haswell chips &gt;&gt; Rock, Paper, Shotgun Jeremy Laird:   Intel reckons Haswell is the biggest step forward in processor efficiency in the history of its x86 CPUs. Yup, even bigger than the transition from Pentium 4 to Core. Thus, if Haswell is anything like as good as Intel claims, it&apos;s going to shake things up. Think tablets that combine iPad proportions with proper PC levels of processing prowess. Microsoft&apos;s Surface Pro, as nice as it is in some ways, doesn&apos;t quite deliver on that. Haswell, according to the hype, will. I&apos;ve long wanted a tablet convertible that&apos;s no bigger than an iPad but has the power of a proper PC. So I&apos;m genuinely excited by the prospect. But it&apos;s got naff-all to do with gaming PCs.  Given that laptops are outselling desktops by 4:3, and that gaming PCs make up a tiny fraction of desktop sales, this might not be a surprise.

As the hero of Rain trudges through the bleak shadowy city, his shoulders hunched against the cold and the night; and as the girl he is searching for is glimpsed at a balcony, scared and alone \u2013 memories of Fumito Ueda&apos;s beautiful PlayStation 2 adventure will flood back. Not that this promising downloadable title from Sony Japan&apos;s C.A.M.P studio is a mere copycat. It&apos;s just that it captures Ico&apos;s sense of constant vulnerability \u2013 and it has at its centre a relationship between a boy and a girl, thrust together in an unforgiving world. The story \u2013 told at the beginning of the game through a series of abstract water colour images \u2013 has the young hero running into the street, following a girl who, in turn, is being chased by a monster. He follows them into some sort of vortex, emerging in a parallel world where all living things are invisible, and it is always raining, always dark. The only time the player can see any character is when they walk beneath an open sky, allowing the shower to mark out their form. It&apos;s a strange, almost supernatural effect, accentuating the other-worldly feel.       The player directs the boy via simple controls \u2013 just one analogue stick to move and buttons to jump, run and interact with objects. The camera is automatic, subtly centring on the protagonist at all times, hinting his whereabouts to you, even if you can&apos;t see him. Part of the joy of early exploration is working out how the environment helps you keep track of your invisible charge: if he walks through mud you see his footsteps; if he&apos;s inside, the designers have placed lots of physics objects about for him to bang into.  The world he walks through is one of gloomy tenements and abandoned factories, bathed in shadow and strewn with rubbish. &quot;We gathered references from many cities and towns around Europe,&quot; explains producer Noriko Umemura, who previously worked on the critically acclaimed RPG, White Knight Chronicles. &quot;There are Japanese influences too - we wanted a world in which everyone could find a connection or a similarity to the neighbourhood they grew up in.&quot; Inhabiting this sodden distopia are a range of scary invisible monsters, which the boy usually has to avoid by stealth \u2013 he&apos;s too small and weak to fight. While he&apos;s undercover, he can move unspotted, but once in the rain, the beasts can detect him. At one point in the demo, I have to splash in a puddle to get a monster&apos;s attention, before running under a balcony to become totally invisible before sneaking off; on another occasion, I get one of them to follow me as I run away, tricking it into smashing into a pillar, which brings down a ledge for me to climb up. It&apos;s all about working with the environment and the elements.      The creature designs are vague and formless, helped of course by the fact that we only see them as outlines. &quot;We kept it very simple so that players can add their own imagination on to them,&quot; says Umemura. The idea is to explore the fears and imaginative processes of childhood. &quot;Were trying to tell an adventure story that evokes childhood memories,&quot; she explains. &quot;When you&apos;re a kid, you often get lost exploring your neighbourhood - and although you&apos;re scared, you&apos;re curious - you want to go a little bit further and see a little bit more. It&apos;s that mixture of fear and curiosity that want to capture - we want to remind everyone of how that felt.&quot; Throughout the early chapters, the girl is seen in snatched moments, perhaps walking along a distant corridor, or high up on a rooftop while the boy is stuck far below. Eventually the two meet, and the boy needs to solve a a puzzle to save her from her monstrous nemesis. He does so, placing himself at risk - and later she returns the compliment. But where will they go from here? Will they work together? It is the wordless innocence of this relationship that conjures Ico; the fallibility of the participants. &quot;We didn&apos;t take direct inspiration form any particular title,&quot; says Umemura, when asked about influences. &quot;However, our team are all from the same generation and we grew up with the same game - and we all like Ico. The emotional experience offered by games like Eco; that&apos;s something we want to evoke.&quot; It will be fascinating to see where it goes.  Rain is only the latest offbeat title to come out of Sony Japan&apos;s experimental C.A.M.P studio, which pairs creative people from different sectors with experienced development teams. &quot;Japan studio is encouraging us to create innovative titles, they want more diverse gameplay,&quot; says Umemura. &quot;We always work with other developers - this time we&apos;ve been working with Acquire Corporation. We mix that with the new talent at Playstation C.A.M.P and things come together. It gives us new ways of thinking.&quot;            For Umemura, C.A.M.P is a symbol of how the country&apos;s games industry is pulling itself out of a long dip. &quot;It&apos;s my opinion that Japanese development is at a turning point,&quot; she says. &quot;We have struggled for the last decade compared to the Western industry - now, we are looking for new talent; we&apos;re looking to the indie sector as well as people outside of this business, to make games that haven&apos;t been done before. Everybody is trying different things. Some studios have attempted to follow the Western model, but at Sony Japan, we&apos;re interested in working on games that only we can create. We&apos;re in a lucky position, Japan studio encourages us to work in different ways. I feel lucky to be exploring new things - not everyone has that opportunity&quot;.  The team, which rose to 70 at its height, but started out with a core of just six, is still tweaking the structure of the game, though it will be several hours long. The feel is very different from the studio&apos;s last cult hit, the surreal Tokyo Jungle \u2013 in some ways it is more traditional, harking back not only to Ico but also to classic survival horror.  However, in its attempt to portray the powerlessness and inquisitiveness of childhood, and in its assured construction of a weird gothic world, it also appears to be something much more interesting than a mere collection of well-worn gaming ideas.\u2022 Rain is released on PS3 in the autumn"}, {"sentences": ["Shi Yinhong, an expert on Sino-American relations at Renmin University, said that China will also want to discuss US relations with Japan in the context of the territorial dispute over the Diaoyu or Senkaku islands, which both Beijing and Tokyo claim."], "tags": ["US news", "US foreign policy", "Barack Obama", "Obama administration", "China", "Xi Jinping", "Espionage", "North Korea", "South Korea", "Japan", "California"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-06T21:47:00Z", "title": "Obama heads for US-China summit with high hopes for progress", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/obama-us-china-xi-jinping-summit", "article": "The last time the presidents of China and the US met in such informal circumstances, it was for a barbecue lunch and a tour of George W Bush&apos;s ranch in Texas, lasting just four hours and to mark the retirement of Jiang Zemin in 2002. When Barack Obama sits down with the newly installed Xi Jinping at the Sunnylands country estate in California on Friday and Saturday, they will be aiming for a superpower retreat of an altogether different ambition. Though the shirt sleeves will be carefully rolled up, to suggest a relaxed affair, expectations are building on both sides for a historic meeting that attempts nothing short of carving out a new world order. Rather than the traditional pomp and circumstance of state visits, a handful of key advisers will gather among the eucalyptus trees for open-ended discussions on issues that affect not just the world&apos;s two largest economies, but scores of other countries too. Jeff Bader, who as National Security Council director for east Asia helped organise a dozen Chinese meetings in Obama&apos;s first term, remembers stuffy affairs with barely room for everyone to sit. &quot;This one will have small groups of five or six people from each side, rather than 20 or 30,&quot; he says. &quot;This is a new type of great power relationship. In the past they always insisted on the pomp of a state visit as a mark of respect, but Xi is more confident than that.&quot; Washington hopes such confidence is tempered by a recognition of mutual weaknesses, pointing out that the Chinese economy is softening while the US recovers, and stressing shared anxiety over North Korea. &quot;The Chinese know that the relationship between rising powers and existing powers doesn&apos;t always end happily, so they are seeking something more co-operative,&quot; says Bader, who is now with the Brookings Institution thinktank. Cybersecurity     Cybersecurity is a key US concern. Photograph: Getty Images    Whether such sunny Californian optimism is matched by reality will depend greatly on the first of three issues at the top of the US agenda for the meeting. In the past, superpowers clashed over spy planes and missile launchers. Today, the battle for dominance is measured in computer hacks and denial-of-service attacks. Anger has been mounting in Washington at what the administration sees as brazen attempts to steal commercial and military secrets by Chinese government agencies exploiting the openness of the US internet. Last week the defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, described the broader problem of cyber-attacks as &quot;the security challenge of our age&quot;, and published a long report on recent incursions. In private, US officials are more sanguine about parts of the Chinese threat. Military espionage, such as the alleged theft of weapons designs, is seen as a fact of life, best fought with tighter security and counter-measures. The risk of electronic sabotage against power stations and infrastructure is also seen as a greater threat from countries with less to lose from retaliation, such as Iran and North Korea. But the threat from Chinese commercial espionage and theft of intellectual property has inflamed not just the political class in Washington but corporate America too, and it poses a risk to what is otherwise a rapidly improving bilateral relationship. The White House hopes to convince Xi that this is a lasting issue for the US and not just this month&apos;s Washington fad. Though there is sympathy for the argument that branches of the Chinese government and industry may be acting without central direction, US officials feel it is time for Beijing to crack down on cyber attacks. Obama&apos;s problem, however, is what he can offer critics in Washington to show he has made progress with Xi on the matter. White House officials are keen to play down expectations of any formal summit communique or statement from the Chinese, who feel the issue has been overblown. Instead, watch out for briefings from advisers pointing to vague agreements on &quot;new international norms&quot; governing cybersecurity, and hints that Xi has had his arm twisted in private. The economy In recent years, summits between China and the US have been dominated by talk of currency manipulation and trade imbalances. Though the trade deficit hasn&apos;t gone away \u2013 reaching a record $315bn between the two countries last year \u2013 Chinese agreement to let the renminbi appreciate against the dollar has taken the heat out of the political anger in Washington, which hopes the worst may have passed. For once, US economists are also more concerned about weakening of Chinese growth rates and generally support efforts by Beijing to stimulate domestic demand rather than exports. With the US economy showing gradual signs of recovery, they also expect fewer smug lectures about Anglo-Saxon capitalism from the Chinese than was common after the financial crash. Instead, presidential talks in California are likely to focus on trade, where both countries believe they share common interests. The US recently negotiated a major free-trade agreement with other Asia economies, which deliberately sought to exclude China and bolster regional rivals. Now China wants in on the deal, and the US will be looking to emulate controls it sought on the activities of state-owned enterprises in Vietnam, to make sure China&apos;s companies are not unduly subsidised when competing internationally. China wants the US to increase access for its investors. &quot;Both state-owned and private companies are very keen to invest in other countries and the US is a very big market. But \u2026 they face many constraints, especially on the political side,&quot; said Xu Bin, professor of economics and finance at the China Europe International Business School. The Chinese tech firms Huawei and ZTE are only the most obvious examples. North Korea     North Korea, under Kim Jong-un has become a concern for the US and China. Photograph: Uncredited/AP    Hopes are highest over foreign policy, a subject that China has tended to avoid in recent summits. But if Beijing is serious about seeking superpower parity, expect to see warm words about international co-operation, particularly in relation to North Korea and its nuclear ambitions.  Washington is encouraged by signs of irritation from Beijing towards its smaller communist neighbour during a recent ratcheting up of tensions with the US. A warm invitation to Beijing for South Korean president Park Geun-hye was seen as a decisive snub toward the bellicose northern leader, Kim Jong-un, as was the Bank of China&apos;s closure of accounts related to North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme. Recent statements by Xi stressing China&apos;s desire for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula may just be a pre-summit &quot;gift&quot; to the US, but it&apos;s one that the White House will be keen to unwrap. Expect to see statements designed to prevent Pyongyang from playing Washington and Beijing off against each other. Shi Yinhong, an expert on Sino-American relations at Renmin University, said that China will also want to discuss US relations with Japan in the context of the territorial dispute over the Diaoyu or Senkaku islands, which both Beijing and Tokyo claim. Expectations Beijing is more concerned with improving the working relationship than specific topics. &quot;This meeting in itself is what China wanted to achieve,&quot; said Shi. Analysts warn against unrealistically high expectations of a two-day meeting. Linda Jakobson, director of the east Asia programme at the Lowy Institute for International Policy, said that while there seem to be attempts to centralise Chinese foreign policy decision-making, it remains highly complex, with many actors.  &quot;Leadership does matter,&quot; she said, &quot;but we shouldn&apos;t have exaggerated expectations that if Xi and Obama get along, tensions will decrease instantaneously or even automatically. In both countries there is a political establishment behind both men \u2026 There are so many forces in both Washington and Beijing which also tend to lean towards perceiving the other in a prism of distrust.&quot; A more personal relationship between the two leaders &quot;can easily be achieved&quot;, said Shi Yinhong. &quot;But interpersonal relations are not the same as bilateral success.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The French presidentm Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, on an official visit to Tokyo, described the assault as &quot;an odious act&quot;, while the S\u00e9nate, the upper house of parliament, denounced what it described as an &quot;abominable assassination&quot;."], "tags": ["France", "Europe", "World news", "The far right", "Gay marriage", "LGBT rights"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-07T13:46:53Z", "title": "French student's fatal beating sparks calls for far-right ban", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/07/french-students-beating-call-far-right-ban", "article": "A brilliant young student and leftwing activist who was beaten up by skinheads in Paris died on Thursday evening amid calls for radical far-right groups to be banned. Cl\u00e9ment M\u00e9ric had been left brain dead after being hit several times by an attacker wearing a knuckleduster on Wednesday near the Saint Lazare railway station. Police said they had arrested seven people in connection with the attack. The death of the 18-year-old student at the prestigious Institute of Political Studies, known as Sciences-Po, comes after months of bitter debate and homophobic violence in France linked to the anti-gay marriage movement. Several politicians have blamed the protests against homosexual marriage for creating an atmosphere of fear and violence in the country. M\u00e9ric was a member of the Solidaires students&apos; union and a far-left anti-fascist movement. The French presidentm Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, on an official visit to Tokyo, described the assault as &quot;an odious act&quot;, while the S\u00e9nate, the upper house of parliament, denounced what it described as an &quot;abominable assassination&quot;. M\u00e9ric was attacked around 6pm on Wednesday in the busy 9th arrondissement, not far from the famous Galeries Lafayette and Printemps department stores. He and three friends were reportedly at a private sale of Fred Perry clothing, where witnesses said an altercation erupted between them and three youths with shaved heads wearing bomber jackets. On Thursday, as police interviewed those present, it was not clear how the fight started, but reports claimed the assailants left the building and waited outside on the street for M\u00e9ric and his friends. The student was then allegedly struck several times in the face by an assailant wearing a knuckleduster and hit his head as he fell. Passersby rushed to give him first aid, but he remained unconscious. The French interior minister, Manuel Valls, promised his &quot;total determination to eradicate this violence that bears the hallmarks of the extreme right. Our values and the republican pact are threatened. There is no place for far right factions who see the nation as the enemy, there is no place for political violence.&quot; Traditional tensions between the far right and far left have been exacerbated in France by the so-called &quot;marriage for all&quot; bill allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt. The law was passed last month and saw hundreds of thousands of conservative and Catholic protesters take to the streets to oppose the change. There were reports of homophobic attacks across the country. The anti-gay marriage campaigner who calls herself Frigide Barjot admitted at the time some protests had been hijacked by extreme rightwing troublemakers. However, on Thursday she reacted angrily to accusations by the businessman philanthropist Pierre Berg\u00e9, former partner of the late fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, that her movement had &quot;paved the way&quot; for violence. On its Twitter account, the anti-gay marriage group Manif Pour Tous (Protest for all), led by Barjot, said it &quot;renewed with force its condemnation of all forms of violence&quot;. Xavier Bongibault, a spokesman for the organisation, said he would &quot;not accept anyone accusing us of being responsible&quot;. Barjot has threatened to sue Berg\u00e9 for defamation. Leftwing activists have accused members of the far-right Jeunesses Nationalistes R\u00e9volutionnaires (Young Revolutionary Nationalists \u2014 JNR) of being involved in the attack and called for the group to be banned. The JNR denied the claim. Marine le Pen, leader of the far-right Front National, told French radio: &quot;It&apos;s terrible, the death of a young man is terrible. Unacceptable.&quot; Asked about reports that one of the attackers was wearing a Front National T-shirt, Le Pen warned against jumping to conclusions. &quot;I will wait to see what justice says. You have no proof of anything,&quot; Le Pen told RTL radio. &quot;The FN has no connection near or far with this aggression.&quot; M\u00e9ric, who came from Brest, in Britanny, was accepted at the Sciences Po, after passing his baccalaureate with top honours last year. Police said they were hunting for three men allegedly involved in the attack on the student, and a woman who was with them. There were calls for student demonstrations in Paris and other major cities, including Bordeaux, Lyon, Lille and Montpellier on Thursday afternoon."}, {"sentences": ["The likes of Hutong in Hong Kong, a branch of which is about to land upstairs from Oblix; and the restaurant in the Hyatt Tokyo (scene of Lost In Translation and an entry in Oblix's owner Rainer Becker's CV)."], "tags": ["Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-08T08:00:04Z", "title": "Restaurant: Oblix, London", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/08/restaurants-food-and-drink", "article": "'An amazing view,\" the pal says, looking out of the vast plate-glass windows over the Gherkin, St&nbsp;Paul's and&nbsp;ribbon-like expressways, \"is a bit like a good-looking husband.

The Scottish brothers were not the first celebrated, publicity-shy electronic duo to break a long absence with a series of teases this spring \u2013 that would be Daft Punk. But BOC&apos;s release countdown certainly repaid elevated levels of geekery and perseverance, shoring up the reputations of Mike Sandison and Marcus Eoin as dextrous seminators of mystery, as well as a cult band of rare beauty. First there were the unmarked vinyl records whose numbers combined with other clues to direct fans to announcement of the album. At least one enterprising soul sold one on eBay for $5,700. Then there was a broadcast of a grainy video accompanied by hazy, impending ambient music at a busy Tokyo intersection (later revealed as the second track on Tomorrow&apos;s Harvest, Reach for the Dead). Finally, there was a playback in an abandoned leisure park in the Californian desert, a locale chiming splendidly with BOC&apos;s guiding principles: nostalgia, remoteness, unease and, this time around at least, the prospect of a dystopian future. Their album&apos;s title, Tomorrow&apos;s Harvest, echoes that of a US &quot;family preparedness&quot; website selling dried food and survivalist supplies in the event of the breakdown of civilisation. The album&apos;s cover may (or may not) suggest a sunset (or a nuclear explosion) over San Francisco. Whatever it all means, Tomorrow&apos;s Harvest does pretty much reward both\u00a0the eight-year wait and the Easter\u00a0egg hunt, particularly for those who would hate for BOC to acknowledge the digital advances of the day overmuch. Tomorrow&apos;s World maintains all the Boards sonic signatures of old. There are out-of-fashion breakbeats and arpeggiating synths, redolent of 70s film soundtracks. Crackly transmissions alternate with washes of amniotic analogue sound, all studded with rare vocal samples whose purpose is rarely comfort. Five tracks in, Telepath features the album&apos;s first intelligible human interjection: a sinister vocodered voice counting down. Little snippets that could be numbers recur on Transmisiones Ferox, in keeping with BOC&apos;s preoccupation with codes and numerology. Boards of Canada&apos;s last album, 2005&apos;s The Campfire Headphase, renosed the duo&apos;s compositions closer to optimism, away from the neo-pagan dread that characterised Campfire Headphase&apos;s predecessor, Geogaddi (2002). Texturally, Tomorrow&apos;s Harvest rides some thermals of blitheness. Thirteen tracks in, Nothing Is Real is a substantial incursion of bleary sunshine, its nagging melodic motif recalling a My Bloody Valentine guitar loop. Mostly, though, the fear is back, although not at the levels that peaked in Geogaddi, whose ambience suggested The Wicker Man with machines. The standout track is probably Jacquard Causeway, whose elegant rhythmic and melodic elements come in at angles to one another, roughing up the glide beautifully. There are times (the excellent Cold Earth, Sick Times) when this album&apos;s dystopian bent recalls Thom Yorke&apos;s neurotic electronic side projects in spirit, if not sound \u2013 a full circle, perhaps, given the debt Radiohead&apos;s Kid A owed to Boards&apos; 1998 debut, Music Has the Right to Children. That old album title was, of course, thrillingly polysemic: cutesy and pro-internet (music having the right to reproduce) or, alternately, carnivorous (music actually consuming our progeny). Tomorrow&apos;s Harvest is another intriguing Rorschach blot of a record from a splendidly arcane band. There are numerous patterns here, guiding interpretation. But for the most part, Tomorrow&apos;s Harvest reflects back your own take on what sort of future we are reaping."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Europe has become more stable, but it must now be oriented toward growth,&quot; he said during a speech in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Fran\u00e7ois Hollande", "World news", "Eurozone crisis", "European Union", "European monetary union", "Economics", "Banking", "European banks", "Financial crisis", "Financial sector", "Euro", "Europe", "Business", "France", "Unemployment and employment statistics", "Unemployment", "Spain", "Portugal", "Greece"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-09T18:25:31Z", "title": "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: the eurozone crisis is over", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/francois-holland-eurozone-crisis-over", "article": "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, has declared an end to the eurozone debt crisis, despite record unemployment across the continent. &quot;You must understand that the crisis in the eurozone is over,&quot; Hollande told an audience in Japan during a three-day state visit. &quot;Europe has become more stable, but it must now be oriented toward growth,&quot; he said during a speech in Tokyo. &quot;I believe that the crisis, far from weakening the eurozone, will strengthen it. &quot;Now, we have all the instruments of stability and solidarity.

Cameron Carpenter, the instrument&apos;s punk prodigy, is scathing about those responsible for its fate. &quot;The supreme indifference of organists to the needs and wishes of a broader audience can be observed at an organ concert in any city,&quot; he declaims. &quot;The audience will be comprised of either organists, or inveterate organ nerds who carry their clothes around in paper bags and breathe through their mouths.&quot; Carpenter&apos;s strategy for wrenching the instrument out of its torpor is first to dress like an ice-dancing Skrillex, then to deliver performances of great physical drama, his body convulsing, his legs moving like Fred Astaire. This would be mere window dressing, however, were his performances not both cerebral and emotional explorations of an unexpected repertoire. &quot;If music is a language and the organ is a megaphone, then the message is really what it comes down to,&quot; he says. &quot;It has something to do with ecstasy. In fact, one of the things that first attracted me to the organ was its violence. There can be a great beauty to expressive violence, and the organ has it in vast amounts. In the Bach cantata we&apos;re going to do at Manchester, you feel that you may have brushed up against something very evil indeed, and come out of it duly reminded of how glad you are to be alive.&quot; He&apos;ll perform Bach&apos;s Ich Will Den Kreuzstab Gerne Tragen alongside Shostakovich&apos;s Suite On Verses Of Michelangelo Buonarroti, in cahoots with two fellow creative iconoclasts: director Peter Sellars and bass baritone Eric Owens. Carpenter, who is only 31, describes Sellars as &quot;a mentor, and a person who has consistently been at the forefront of the idea that not only classical music, but also dance and drama, should be examined anew.&quot; Owens, he says, is &quot;an organ of a man \u2013 a giant temple of tone. I&apos;m trying to frame him in a way that is going to be equal to the art inside the frame.&quot; Carpenter says he&apos;ll relish &quot;not having to be Atlas on stage, not having to hold the entire performance on my shoulders,&quot; as he has done throughout his career on what he calls &quot;the loneliest instrument.&quot; He began playing after &quot;as a tiny child I saw a highly evocative encyclopedia entry on an organist playing in a movie palace. It was almost sinister in its power, and I was forever ruined to serious dedication to any other instrument.&quot; An education at the Juilliard conservatory in New York led to a recording contract and the first ever Grammy nomination for a solo organist, then on to a globetrotting series of tradition-baiting performances. For Carpenter, it&apos;s not just the harrumphing of the organ nerds that raises his hackles \u2013 it&apos;s the church that so many organs are stationed in. &quot;For centuries, the organists themselves have been stamped out \u2013 go into to a big English church and see if you can see the person playing. This kind of vile pissing down upon the person who is actually completely responsible for the music, for me, has parallels with the many ways in which science and the arts are thanklessly pressed into the service of religion. Like many other secular aspects of art, the organ has over the centuries been co-opted into being a handmaiden for old men who would lie to children.&quot; He scoffs, wonderfully, at the &quot;cliched hobgoblinry of ecclesiastica&quot;, although ultimately he asserts that &quot;my values are artistic, not religio-political&quot;.

So successful was the experiment it spawned an entire new phrase in culture-fuelled regeneration: the Guggenheim effect. There has certainly been no shortage of cities queuing up to repeat Bilbao&apos;s success ever since. In the last decade or so new Guggenheims have been mooted in Tokyo, in Taiwan&apos;s Taichung, in Rio de Janeiro, Guadalajara and in Vilnius. A Gehry-spawned addition to the network is currently being built on an artificial island off the coast of Abu Dhabi (next to a new branch of the Louvre \u2013 in the Gulf nothing is ever done by half measures). Back in Europe, however, the glittering prize of a new starchitect-designed Guggenheim was won by Helsinki. Or so it seemed, until city council members decided to bin the proposal despite a $2.5m feasibility study giving its glossy stamp of approval. Finnish frugality played a part. So did a debate about the role of a global brand in a nation with a self-made reputation in art and design. It was a form of inward cultural investment that many Finns, including the culture minister, felt they could do without. Was Finland&apos;s loss another&apos;s opportunity? When proposals for a Welsh Guggenheim surfaced last month, it seemed so. Wales is, in many ways, a late nation playing catch-up on a multitude of fronts, especially in the visual arts. Until recently, we were one of the few countries in the world to lack a national gallery, an omission that is at long last being rectified through the National Museum of Wales, under the capable leadership of David Anderson. But a major contemporary art gallery is still a missing piece in the national jigsaw. Could our visual arts sector emulate our recent sporting success, catapulting us into the art world&apos;s premier league? Welsh art certainly offers up an inviting narrative: the Davies Sisters&apos; collection of French impressionism and post-impressionism masterpieces is an early echo of the Guggenheims&apos; own philanthropy, also built through mine-owning riches. Our cultural conception of art, displayed in the Arts Council of Wales&apos; art and society exhibitions of the 1970s also mirrors the non-elitist approach of Guggenheim in its record-breaking Art of the Motorcycle exhibition two decades later. We have in Artes Mundi a truly global art prize and in Lumen, the world&apos;s pre-eminent digital art competition. What Guggenheim could offer Wales, as demonstrated by the Basques, is the chance to transform our image internationally. Set alongside other infrastructure investments \u2013 airport upgrading, electrification of the railway, an international convention centre and a Valleys metro \u2013 the project would signal our transition from manual past to creative future. Public response to the idea has been in contrast to the lukewarm reception among ordinary Finns. Keen discussion off and online has focused not on the whys and wherefores of a Welsh Guggenheim, but on which part of Wales would be the most fitting location. Cardiff, like three of Guggenheim&apos;s previous suitors in the 1990s, was already the intended site of a Zaha Hadid building \u2013 in our case, an opera house that would have been her first actual commission but sadly was never built. This would be a wonderful opportunity for redemption, perhaps on the site of the current Brains Brewery on the banks of the river Taff, due to be vacated in 2017. An equally good case could be made for Swansea, home to one of the UK&apos;s oldest art schools. But what of the world&apos;s first rural Guggenheim? The Bilbao Guggenheim developed advanced plans, now shelved, for a new facility in the Urdaibai nature reserve some 40km from the city. &apos;Gubai&apos; was intended to be a cultural innovation based not so much on an iconic building but an iconic landscape, with an artists-in-residency creativity lab and a space to explore the relationship between art, architecture and ecology \u2013 think the Tate St Ives and Eden Project in one. Pembrokeshire, which has long been a haven for artists \u2013 from the Welsh siblings Gwen and Augustus John through to English exiles like Graham Sutherland and John Piper \u2013 offers interesting possibilities in this direction, as does Snowdonia. If the idea has struck a chord in Wales, it has touched a nerve in New York. The Guggenheim Foundation was quick to quash speculation that a Welsh Guggenheim had any traction. The reasons became clear when it confirmed that they have engaged the Finnish PR firm Miltton in an attempt to revive the stalled Helsinki project. Paavo Arhinm\u00e4ki, Finnish culture minister and leader of the Left Alliance party that was instrumental in the alliance of Socialists and Greens that blocked the original proposal, continues to oppose it. However, Guggenheim&apos;s rejection of Wales may turn out to be the greatest gift imaginable. The end of our conversation with New York, at least for the time being, has created a space for a richer debate at home. In an age of Twitter-fuelled transparency and post-crisis economics, big bold ideas can no longer be developed in stealth. Public value-for-money dictates that the public must now be in on the ground floor of all our ideas. Perhaps this reflects a wider shift in the nature of museums themselves. From encyclopaedic &quot;cabinets of curiosity&quot;, to echoing cathedrals for the larger-scale work (and reputations) of artists, museums are now entering a third age as collaborative spaces, where artists, audiences and curators interact in the co-production of culture and value. Charlie Leadbeater has described this new wave of the avant garde as the &quot;art of with&quot;, echoing Alfred Barr, founding director of New York&apos;s other great gallery, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Barr&apos;s vision of the museum was a laboratory in whose experiments the public would be invited to participate. I am not sure that even MoMA has lived up to that revolutionary ambition. Wales, this little late nation, could yet surprise the world and build that future here.

Over 200 developers will show up, spending many millions on huge stands and massive banks of monitors and demo machines. They will show their latest titles to more than 40,000 attendees and the whole thing will be broadcast, tweeted, reported and recorded by more than 4,000 journalists, all endlessly trudging the show floor. This is the most important event of the year as far as retail games are concerned. If you&apos;ve never been, here&apos;s a quick rundown of what happens and what you should look out for... The press conferences The Monday before the E3 exhibition officially opens, the biggest companies in the industry all run their own big press conferences, usually in the ornate old theatres littered around downtown LA. Microsoft, EA, Ubisoft and Sony will use their respective conferences to reveal what they&apos;ll be demo-ing when the actual show begins. This are all streamed live over the internet and most of the big game sites, the likes of GameSpot, IGN, Joystiq and CVG, will be hosting the streams. Also, I have organised a livestreaming event in the UK, EToo London. We&apos;ll be running all the conferences, with debate and analysis, via the EToo London YouTube channel. Here are the times of the conferences: Microsoft \u2013 9am Eastern (5pm UK)EA \u2013 1pm Pacific (9pm UK)Ubisoft \u2013 3pm Pacific (11pm UK)Sony \u2013 6pm Pacific (2am, June 11, UK) The E3 event E3 itself kicks off at the LA convention centre on Tuesday morning and continues through until Thursday. The event takes up two huge halls of the complex, as well as a number of other smaller locales around the site. Last year over 45,000 people attended, most of them video game publishers developers, retailers and journalists. It is a trade-only event, so there&apos;s no public access, though these days, the lines are blurred \u2013 lots of bloggers and YouTube video-makers will apply for press passes, and many will be accepted. Hence, the show&apos;s unique atmosphere \u2013 part-business event, part-showcase, part-community get-together. How to stay up to date We&apos;ll be covering the key events here on Games blog, but all of the specialist game sites will be absolutely bloated with E3 coverage over the next few days. If you want a UK perspective, go for CVG, VG247, Eurogamer or VideoGamer. Also check out the official websites of all the key publishers and developers, who&apos;ll often publish new trailers and footage as soon as it&apos;s announced. There&apos;s also an official E3 Expo site that will be jammed with footage. The key players you want to be following are: Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Activision, Bethesda, Warner, Capcom, Konami, Sega, Square Enix and Namco.  What should we be looking out for? The four big questions from the press conferences Here&apos;s what the gaming press want to know from Monday: 1. What does the PlayStation 4 look like? The console was announced at an event back in February, but Sony didn&apos;t actually show the machine itself. Everyone wants to know how it will compare to the rather boxy Xbox One.     PlayStation 4: glimpses of the console itself have been elusive. Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters    2. What is going on with &apos;always on&apos; internet connectivity. Lots of console owners are worried by the revelation that the Xbox One will need to be connected to the internet every 24 hours if you want to continue playing games. There are also likely to be restrictions on the selling of pre-owned titles. Microsoft and the major publishers are keen to find new ways of preventing piracy and ensuring they make money from every copy of a game that gets distributed. However, how this works is highly ambiguous at the moment. Also, Sony hasn&apos;t revealed whether it has similar plans for PlayStation. The head of worldwide studios, Shuhei Yoshida, has stated that PS4 won&apos;t require a constant internet connection, but details are sketchy.3. What will be the big new gaming announcements?There are lots of titles we know are going to be at E3 (see our gallery of anticipated titles), but there will also be plenty of announcements \u2013 especially at the Sony and Microsoft press events. Some of the titles people are hoping to see confirmed are LittleBigPlanet 3, Fable IV, Dead Rising 3 and Mirror&apos;s Edge 2. We&apos;re also expecting to get glimpses of Bayonetta 2, Saint&apos;s Row 4 and the second season of the excellent Walking Dead adventure series from Telltale Games. The likes of Dead Souls II and the Wii U versions of Mario Kart and Super Mario will also be popular. 4. That&apos;s a lot of sequels, how about original titles?     Knack: Sony will show off the PS4 platformer at E3    Good question \u2013 and always one that journalists dwell on during the E3 week. Sony has open-world racer DriveClub and platformer Knack, both for PS4. Microsoft is promising 15 totally new &quot;franchises&quot; and we&apos;re expecting one of those to be Crytek&apos;s Roman hack-&apos;em-up, Ryse. EA should have Titanfall from Respawn Entertainment, the studio set up by the original creators of Call of Duty. And Activision is has space opera Destiny, from Halo originator, Bungie Studios. Elsewhere, look out for Bethesda&apos;s survival horror opus The Evil Within (from the original creator of Resident Evil) and Square Enix&apos;s intriguing thriller, Murdered: Soul Suspect. Industry insiders on the E3 experience We asked a number of developers and journalists about their E3 thoughts and memories. Here&apos;s what they has to say... How would you describe the experience of E3 to someone who has never been? Tom Bramwell, editor, Eurogamer: For most people who attend E3, it is a frenzy of appointments to hear product pitches and discussions conducted in dark, imposing exhibition halls full of ludicrously expensive fibreglass dioramas that have been designed to reflect product features - usually science fiction, military or fantasy settings - while providing space to house demo units. It&apos;s like a funfair where you&apos;re also supposed to do business. It&apos;s very silly. The weird thing is that I love it, probably because it creates so much work and allows for so much interesting analysis of how games are made and sold, although these days I prefer to enjoy it from afar. Ste Curran, game developer and writer:  Imagine fighting through a cardboard city constructed from adverts; through a slow-shifting swamp of unlikable men, saran-wrapped in logo-stained T-shirts, shambling like the dullest zombies. Imagine 100 desperately-competitive bloggers holding their iPhones above their heads to capture a Picadilly-Circus screen showing a digital countdown to the same Call of Duty trailer that has been playing on loop for six hours. Imagine a migraine. Jon Hicks, editor, Official Xbox Magazine: It&apos;s like three days in a violence-obsessed Disneyland, only crammed into a couple of warehouses with no natural light, and you know that nearly all the rides are going be really similar to ones you&apos;ve already tried and got bored of but you have to go on them anyway. The small children have been replaced by shuffling 20-something men grimly determined to harvest as much terrible merchandise as they can carry, and the wandering Disney characters have been replaced by scantily-clad women who they take cameraphone pics of. There is a constant, deafening soundtrack of rival booths trying to have the biggest explosions, interspersed with looping sales pitches that by the third day you can quote verbatim. You are usually late, and hungry, and reaching an appointment in a blank, white, air-conditioned meeting room away from the main hall feels like finding an oasis in the desert.      Destiny: eagerly awaited space opera for PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One    Rich Stanton, veteran freelance writer: E3 is a show in the truest sense \u2013 the bottom line is money, but what really matters is the performance. It&apos;s well known how closely the big platform holders and publishers brief their retail partners before and around E3, but then the job is to convince the people in attendance and the millions watching that your console, your particular game, is the best. It&apos;s a competition for attention, and so brings out the very best and worst of the industry \u2013 from amazing surprises to booth babes. There are other events comparable to E3, but none offers quite this level of exposure \u2013 for one week, LA is the biggest stage in video games, and everyone&apos;s watching. For the biggest companies in gaming that makes it, for once, as much about the performance as the business. What do you think are going to be the big themes this year? Simon Barratt, develoepr and founder of FourDoorLemon: The PS4 vs Xbox One battle is going to be the ongoing theme for the whole week and I expect a new battleground will emerge with every new announcement from third parties throughout the show. I&apos;m excited to see how much VR sneaks in, certainly it has been getting great coverage and with the new Omnidirectional treadmill Kickstarter doing well and new devices coming from Razer, there is certainly a wave of exciting stuff for &apos;early&apos; (early for the new dawn of VR at least) adopters. I hope to see indie games become more of a focus for the show, although IndieCade and larger indies have attended for a long time there has been something of a spotlight put on the indie community by the new platforms and their support for them. Neil Long, editor of Edge Online: It&apos;ll be a good old-fashioned format war \u2013 Xbox One versus PlayStation 4. Microsoft and Sony know this is the most important E3 for years \u2013 they each have a new console to sell at the end of the year and the hardcore games player has a straight choice between the two. In terms of game announcements, they have to dazzle; big name games are vital, but a few fan favourites and some credible indie projects will show that they each understand where the future of their business lies \u2013 they need to empower and harness this new generation of independent game developers. Meanwhile, I honestly think Nintendo has done the smartest thing for them by stepping out of the race entirely. With its simple, cost-effective Nintendo Direct videos it is ditching all the silly bombast and taking its news straight to its audience. I think Nintendo could really surprise us: its Wii U hardware is confusing, but its games have never been in question \u2013 we&apos;re guaranteed a new Super Mario, Mario Kart, Smash Bros and more Zelda. Nintendo always throws in a few fan-pleasing favourites, too. A huge Wii U price cut is essential, though.     'A huge Wii U price cut is essential.' Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters    Nicholas Lovell, industry analyst and author: Microsoft will do a bunch of pointless stuff about you can watch sports on your console. The F2P guys will be less visible (E3 isn&apos;t for them) but Microsoft and Sony will both showcase F2P games on their new consoles. Publishers will unveil a bunch of new IPs, because the best time to launch a new IP is at the start of the console cycle. It will set the stage for the launch of PS4/Xbox One, but everyone will be disappointed: there won&apos;t be enough new IP. There won&apos;t be enough information on console launch plans. There won&apos;t be enough F2P or there will be too much. There will be too much about TV and sports and films. Andy Payne, CEO of Mastertronic and AppyNation: It&apos;s going to be all about the new set-top boxes \u2013 sorry, consoles \u2013 that Microsoft and Sony want to launch. And the games that will look ace. But eyes must also be peeled for more Oculus Rift action and ears open to see what Apple reveal at WWDC up the road in the eminently more cooler San Francisco. Whatever happens it will all be mad and bad in equal measure. Oh yes and there will be some very cool action in London at EToo. Don&apos;t miss it! What is your most memorable E3 experience? Ellie Gibson, associate features editor, Eurogamer: I always love the press conferences. Nothing beats that heady combination of exciting announcements, laughable hyperbole and graphs. And the highlight of every press conference is the bit where the executives try to do some comic banter.  The best ever example of this can be seen in the video of Sony&apos;s 2007 conference (skip to 13 min 45), where a virtual version of Jack Tretton shows us his &quot;new tricked-out apartment&quot; in PlayStation Home. &quot;I&apos;ve left the door open, so hopefully a few of those hot chicks from the square will pop in and join us,&quot; he says, before pretending to be surprised to find a virtual Kaz Hirai on his balcony.  &quot;Hey Kaz, what are you doing here??!?!?!&quot;  &quot;HA HA HA HA HA,&quot; says Kaz. &quot;I got some burgers and some hot dogs on the grill, what can I do you for?&quot;  There follows a bizarre exchange about turkey burgers and PSP before Tretton announces he is going to &quot;chill here on the deck&quot;.  At Eurogamer, we enjoyed this so much we even created a special trophy for our annual E3 awards \u2013 the &quot;Let&apos;s Chill Here on the Deck Memorial Award for excellence in strained banter.&quot; Jon Hicks: 2010 was just weird all week. Microsoft&apos;s Cirque du Soleil event unveiling Kinect was a long, baffling fever dream that felt like a religious sect gathering for the birth of a new and highly confusing deity. Activision&apos;s peak Guitar Hero moment was a live event featuring an unending string of massive music acts that went on so long I actually went to another event for an hour and came back. And then a variety of work-related crises required me and a publishing rep to work 20-hour days trying to coordinate across different time zones, which ended with me having a little breakdown in a Hollywood diner from a combination of stress, malnutrition and sleep deprivation. We&apos;ve tried to look back on it and laugh, but the scars run a bit too deep for that.     Cirque du Soleil at Microsoft's launch of Kinect for Xbox 360 at the World Premiere Experience at E3 2010. Photograph: Casey Rodgers/AP Images for XBox    Martin Hollis, developer: The indiscreet charm of a video game arcade as large as two fields must be acknowledged! but the ambience destroys most games and bleeds out the soul of many others. E3 is a meat-market for bangs. The same broad strokes apply to any industry-led exhibition including, sadly, Tokyo Game Show. Fewer games, fewer genres, less interesting work and marginal opportunity to discover fun new ideas. Rezzed, EToo, IndieCade, GameCity are all enormously more exciting to me than E3. An illustrative example: E3 2011 was notable to me as a show which included a game built around a kissing controller by Hye Yeon Nam and Deep Sea, a sensory deprivation and negative experience game by Robin Arnott, both in the IndieCade E3 booth. If I went again it would be for IndieCade."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;And then there are those who say we should turn our backs on the world and on our wider obligations, that we should cut ourselves off from influential organisations in the belief that we can go it alone.&quot; He said both arguments were appealing but amounted to denial \u2013 &quot;denial of a world where our young people are competing for jobs with graduates from California to Tokyo, where a revolution thousands of miles away can affect the guy filling up his van at a service station."], "tags": ["G8", "David Cameron", "Politics", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Economics", "Business", "United Nations", "World news", "European Union", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-10T13:51:55Z", "title": "UK success not in blindly embracing globalisation nor in going it alone \u2013 PM", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/10/cameron-uk-success-globalisation-g8", "article": "Britain will be on the path to national renewal, with a big global footprint, so long as it becomes more competitive at home, engages with the fastest growing countries in the world and projects its values abroad in the EU, the G8 and the UN, David Cameron has said. In a set-piece speech on Britain&apos;s role in the world before next week&apos;s G8 summit, Cameron on Monday tried to offer a vision in which the country rejects an unthinking embrace of globalisation, exemplified by New Labour, or the timid alternative of go-it-alone Little Englandism. He also tried to present his domestic reforms to welfare and education in the context of the global race for jobs and competitiveness, adding that Britain, so long as it did not lapse into denial, could still make the choices that would determine its own fate. He claimed: &quot;This is the generation that hasn&apos;t passed the buck. Where there has been a fork in the road between doing what is easy and doing what is right, we have chosen what is right.&quot; Cameron chose the dramatic setting of the London Gateway, near Tilbury, the largest private sector infrastructure investment in the UK, being overseen by the Dubai-based DP World. The speech itself was months in preparation and is seen as the most important statement of his vision for Britain outside the party conference season. He said the need for domestic reform was being driven by the pace of global competition. &quot;Those who defend the case for an ever bigger state and ever bigger spending, or those who say we don&apos;t need to radically reform welfare or education, they&apos;re fundamentally saying we can ignore these leaner, fitter countries who are breathing down our neck. &quot;And then there are those who say we should turn our backs on the world and on our wider obligations, that we should cut ourselves off from influential organisations in the belief that we can go it alone.&quot; He said both arguments were appealing but amounted to denial \u2013 &quot;denial of a world where our young people are competing for jobs with graduates from California to Tokyo, where a revolution thousands of miles away can affect the guy filling up his van at a service station. Denial that we are a premier trading nation whose prosperity depends upon the maintenance of global peace and security \u2013 in which we play such an important role.&quot; But he also rejected those who &quot;embrace globalisation so enthusiastically that they lose sight of the national interest \u2013 &apos;Open your borders. National sovereignty is obsolete. Multilateral relationships are the only ones that matter, bilateral ones are so 20th century&apos;.&quot; Cameron said both approaches represented a form of national timidity \u2013 too wary of engaging with the modern world or too afraid to stand up for national interests. He said his plan for national renewal had already identified &quot;our key areas of potential national weakness compared to the rest of the world. One, our debt-fuelled, unbalanced economy. Two, our bloated welfare system. Three, our underperforming education system.&quot; He said Britain had been &quot;a 20th-century economy wheezing and limping into the 21st century&quot;. The UK was already in the top 10 countries in the world to do business, he said, and he predicted that the reforms he had introduced, from corporation tax to infrastructure, would make Britain rise in the next three years to being &quot;in the top five places in the world to do business and as the number one country to do business in Europe&quot;. He also tried to make his plea for reform in the EU in the context of the global race for competitiveness. He pointed out: &quot;Europe today accounts for just over 7% of the world&apos;s population, produces around 25% of global GDP and has to finance 50% of global social spending. To the vast majority of the emerging economies, the idea of a welfare system that incentivised people not to take a job would be regarded as national stupidity.&quot; He also attacked the British education system, saying it had been &quot;increasingly comfortable with failure while grade inflation robbed our qualifications of rigour and respect&quot;. He said the education secretary, Michael Gove, would set out his plans for reform to the GCSE exams on Tuesday. Giving a foretaste, he said: &quot;We spent two years analysing what they teach in the world&apos;s best school systems, from Hong Kong and Singapore to Massachusetts in the US, so we can import the best of their curricula into our own. &quot;We&apos;re proposing more arithmetic and algebra in maths, more detail in science, more clarity on punctuation and spelling in English, more emphasis on modern methods of computing like coding.&quot; But he rejected an entirely insular approach. He said: &quot;When your prosperity is won in far-flung places, when your fortunes are disproportionately affected by what happens beyond your borders, then your national interest is not just about standing up for yourself \u2013 but standing up for what&apos;s right, and standing for something more.&quot; He said: &quot;Over the past three years, we have been steadily transforming the entire outward-facing effort of the United Kingdom into a coherent plan to make sure Britain succeeds in a more competitive world. A big part of that plan is connecting up with the fastest-growing parts of our planet, re-forging friendships where they were forgotten. &quot;This policy of engagement, of connecting with the fastest-growing parts of the world \u2013 it is paying off. Over the past three years our exported goods to Brazil have gone up by half; to India by more than half; to China, almost doubled; to Russia, up by 133%. This is how British foreign policy is making the world work for us.&quot; Cameron defended Britain&apos;s involvement in large international bodies, saying: &quot;When a country like ours is affected profoundly by those rules, I want us to have a say on them. That doesn&apos;t mean supinely going with the flow of multilateral opinion \u2013 the lowest common denominator approach to democracy, as we&apos;ve seen in the past.&quot; He also promised the same ambition \u2013 and practical results \u2013 for his G8 summit next week \u2013 &quot;not for us some turgid communiques with little purpose&quot;. He said his key ambitions were: \u2022 The free trade agreement between the US and EU \u2013 which could add as much as \u00a310bn to the UK economy. \u2022 Getting behind African efforts to tear down the bureaucracy and red tape that prevents people from trading freely with one another. \u2022 An international agreement on tax evasion \u2013 &quot;because we can&apos;t just clamp down on this in the UK, the cash would simply move elsewhere&quot;. \u2022 Transparency in mining, oil and gas so that people in developing countries can see how their mineral wealth is being used. He concluded: &quot;This is how our country thrives \u2013 when we lead, when we strive to be more than the sum of our parts, the small island with the big footprint in the world \u2013 and that&apos;s the way it must stay.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The Tokyo trial, the biggest and most important allied war crimes trial arising out of the Pacific war, tried and failed to arrive at a clear and authoritative assertion of what constituted &quot;aggression&quot; and &quot;defence&quot; in that conflict."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2013-06-11T12:59:06Z", "title": "Guardian Weekly Letters, 14 June 2013", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2013/jun/11/guardian-weekly-letters-14-june", "article": "Gillard is just a careerist It&apos;s all too typical of Australian PM Julia Gillard that, when faced with annihilation at the upcoming election, she should prioritise ridding herself of the independents and Greens who put her into office (Gillard asks for a chance, 31 May). A quintessential political careerist, her professed &quot;Labor vision for Australia&quot; has never meshed with her performance, which has regularly poached on the ideological territory of her Tea-Party-ish Liberal party opposition. She has attracted UN opprobrium for her government&apos;s callous treatment of seaborne refugees, her virtual abandonment of a meaningful carbon tax and her capitulation to mining industries over protection of the World Heritage-listed Barrier Reef.

You are less persuasive when advocating solutions. Beefing up the UN, sustained mediation, neighbourhood guarantees, a lesser role for Washington and impartiality have been tried before and rely largely on the goodwill between participants that has previously been lacking. They form part of the smart bombs/stupid policy of Kabul \u2013 fed to us incessantly by the regime in power. Afghanistan has always been a federation of gun-wielding, poppy-cultivating, greedy, feudal warlords bound only by religion. New ways must be found to break their grip. Education appears to be one way out of the impasse: a system of boarding schools in regional centres where security can be guaranteed by coalition forces. The brightest children from across the country would be offered fully paid scholarships. Studying with their peers from other regions would promote friendships, networks and common goals, which would last far into adulthood, eventually undermining feudalism. Of course, this will take time and should have begun years ago. Money would be needed to operate such a scheme but the costs would be minuscule compared to that already spent on armaments. Will it ever happen? Probably not: it is far too simple a proposition for global powers intent on enhancing their spheres of influence. It seems the Afghanis are left with the same old choice between nationhood and feudalism.Graham AllottPerth, Western Australia Who defines aggression? The repeated justification of Toru Hashimoto, the rightwing mayor of Osaka, that the terrible treatment of the comfort women by the Japanese in the 1930s and 40s is explainable in terms of the realities of war, while otherwise objectionable, does have some basis in truth (Mayor says war brothels were necessity, 24 May). We pretend it&apos;s otherwise but, regrettably, prostitution on all sides involving women being forced into it by economic or physical coercion has long been a feature of wars. On a broader front, the mayor&apos;s claim aligns with the recent questioning of whether Japan&apos;s wartime conduct in Asia could be described as aggression by the nationalist Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe: &quot;The definition of what constitutes aggression has yet to be established in academia or in the international community. Things that happened between nations will look different depending on which side you view them from&quot; (Japan backs off revision of war apology, 17 May). Again: unpalatable though it is, there is something in this claim. The Tokyo trial, the biggest and most important allied war crimes trial arising out of the Pacific war, tried and failed to arrive at a clear and authoritative assertion of what constituted &quot;aggression&quot; and &quot;defence&quot; in that conflict. It was a victors&apos; trial that lacked moral authority. Our definitions of aggressor and defender still vary according to which side we are on. Still, as we look to our future we mustn&apos;t be misled by these extremist Japanese pronouncements on the reality of war. They are self-serving and as such we need to be wary of them. In an increasingly fractious Asia, we must temper realpolitik in international relations and do our utmost to avoid wars by using diplomacy to settle our differences.Terry HewtonAdelaide, South Australia Zimbabwe&apos;s bad old days Bill Mathew&apos;s letter reminded me of the story about the Egyptologist who had never been to Egypt (Reply, 31 May). He ignores the corruption, the innumerable deaths, Mugabe&apos;s part in the war in Congo that cost so many lives and only enriched his henchmen, the disappearance not only of people but most of education and development in rural Zimbabwe, to mention just a few things. The system Mugabe replaced with a one-party set-up had opened up voting for blacks, the first university was multiracial then and closed most of the time now because the students are vigorously against him. The white farmers had bought their farms from the Mugabe government, after having done all the development in the first place, the same as in Kenya, where they were not been evicted afterwards; nothing like the kind of murderous violence and destruction that was done by Mugabe&apos;s thugs occurred there. During one post-independence visit some years ago, when one independent (black) newspaper was still allowed and its (equally black) reporters had not yet fled the country to save their lives, as most of the others had had to do, we bought one copy that we have kept since. The front-page headline reads: The Good Old Days. Guess when that was deemed to be in the article? The time of Ian Smith, of all things. Observations based on nothing but blinkered prejudice surely should have no place in a paper like the Guardian, which claims to bring the truth.Ellen PyeDelta, British Columbia, Canada \u2022 Simple mathematics and the opportunity costs are missing from Bill Mathew&apos;s letter justifying Robert Mugabe. A loss of, say, 90% of the productivity of white farmers is not the same as a gain of 9% on what was left, even if the west is now pleased that there is a turnaround. Only a fatalist would argue that other strategies could not have been implemented, including by Mugabe, without destroying the existing farm base.Darian HilesAdelaide, South Australia French language is in decline Andrew Gallix pretty well sums up the debates that we have been reading in the French press about a possible revision of the Toubon law to allow a few university classes to be taught in English (31 May). I agree: the French language has been under threat lately, but not from the borrowing of any foreign word. Any language will shine by and dazzle with what it produces, but sadly, we have made nihilistic literature our speciality, to cite only literature. I still cannot figure out why our critics bask in such books as the ones by Michel Houellebecq or Christine Angot, to name but two authors. Reading the last by Angot, the depiction in minute detail of an incest, one realises that Marcel Pagnol and the nostalgia of his childhood are definitively over, as is the wit of Ast\u00e9rix. The enthusiasts of the French language, like Claude Hag\u00e8ge, mainly regret that French is not in the dominant position \u2013 our lost American future. Hag\u00e8ge states that English implies economic liberalism, and hence the capitalism bias. But this thesis forgets that English also was the language of Henry David Thoreau and Emily Dickinson. Now, with the possible new law, I would rather be concerned about the poor English that French university professors might soon impose on their students: oh no ...Marc JachymParis, France \u2022 The historical irony of the French tongue is that, were it not for imperialistic Latin, it would have turned out something like Breton or Gaelic (or even possibly German, judging from appropriated nouns). Romance French began as a Latin superimposed on the subjugated (and preliterate) Celts. And, were it not for Julius Caesar&apos;s scribe&apos;s ear, we would have no first record of Celtic culture: no Lutetia (Paris), no plucky chieftains like Vercingetorix and Dumnorix, nor any British Boudicca, druids and naked warriors in woad. And alas, no Ast\u00e9rix and Obelix, sprung from Goscinny&apos;s head. Andrew Gallix (delightfully Ast\u00e9rixesque name, that) formidably defends besieged French as a medium of instruction against the steamroller of American English, but quixotically. Even former African colonies are beginning to relinquish French pedagogy for English. Like Latin, French is fated to become an antiquarian, literary language, a historical cul-de-sac, its vestiges living on through English (as Latin lives on through French). Marianne Faithfull saw it coming on in the 80s: &quot;Don&apos;t say it in Russian, don&apos;t say it in German, say it in \u2013 broken English.&quot;R M FranssonDenver, Colorado, US Humans are the real danger Your article on New Zealand&apos;s attitude to cats highlights the fact that &quot;pests&quot; have become the villains for continuing loss of both fauna and flora (Not so cool for Kiwi cats, 24\u00a0May). It diverts attention from the true exterminator: people. Though cats are a serious predator, their contribution to species loss pales compared to the damage caused by the human race. Gareth Morgan himself highlights the issue; he has organised a campaign called The Million Dollar Mouse to rid the Antipodes islands of mice. The intention is to saturate the islands with the most deadly rat poison of all, brodifacoum; it will be spread by helicopter as mouse-sized baits, just the right size for birds. The programme uses questionable techniques condemned by the US Ornithological Council following the Rat Island eradication programme in the Aleutians, which was supervised by New Zealand department of conservation &quot;experts&quot;. That programme destroyed 46 of the resident bald eagles, showing people could achieve something on those islands that cats cannot: extinctions of birds found nowhere else in the world.W F BenfieldMartinborough, New Zealand Briefly \u2022 The spread of US drone technology to other countries, fanatics and enemies is only a matter of time (31 May). Already unmanned aerial vehicles have spread from war zones to toy shops. Now anyone can use a drone to point a camera into your private spaces; laws can&apos;t stop them. From good purposes, such as surveillance of surf beaches in Queensland, to attacking the innocent, no holds are barred. Drones are like boomerangs in this respect.Valerie YuleMount Waverley, Victoria, Australia \u2022 Kory Stamper evidently believes Mary Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein was &quot;the monster&quot;, but he was not (31 May). Frankenstein was the wretched doctor discovered constructing a gothic monster from various bits and pieces. But a combination of the dreaded collective unconscious plus the neologisms of popular culture have melded monster and doctor into a grotesque unity represented by Boris Karloff, but unrecognisable to those who have read Shelley&apos;s book.Paul LindseySeville, Victoria, Australia Please send letters to weekly.letters@theguardian.com"}, {"sentences": ["Before the 2002 World Cup, the British embassy in Tokyo organised public talks to ease Japanese fears about English football hooligans."], "tags": ["World Cup 2014", "World Cup", "Brazil", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-11T22:00:01Z", "title": "A year until the 2014 World Cup begins and Brazil's unease is growing | Jonathan Watts", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jun/11/world-cup-2014-brazil-host", "article": "In the heart of Recife, a stadium pulsates with the cheers, chants and boos of more than 50,000 fans in belligerent, festive mood. Most are in their team colours, filling the ground with black, white and red, but a handful wear fancy dress: there&apos;s an Elvis, Jesus, Superman, Centurion and Cobra (complete with giant plastic snake) adding to the carnival atmosphere already created by the bat\u00e9ria drummers and the pre-match barbecues and copious bottles of Skol. The football is not bad either, with occasional touches of skill that would not be out of place at the highest level. Yet this is the home of Santa Cruz, a Serie C (third-division) Brazilian club from the north-east who claim the most devoted fans in the country, perhaps even the world. More often than not, this lowly team draw more fans than giants like Flamengo, Botafogo or Fluminense. For big derbies, attendances often outstrip those of Stamford Bridge or the Etihad. But it is also in this heartland of Brazilian and world football that you can feel the greatest unease about the changes being wrought before next year&apos;s World Cup finals. Violence, corruption, gentrification and the poor form of the national team have eroded confidence in Brazilian football, which is undergoing a painfully accelerated transition as a result of next year&apos;s tournament. Attendances are down, violence is rampant, and the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) is fending off allegations of corruption, secrecy and mismanagement of the preparations for 2014. Recife will host five World Cup games at a new \u00a3180m stadium being built in the suburbs. It should help to develop one of the poorest areas in Brazil. But many inner-city fans feel distant \u2013 geographically, financially and culturally. &quot;I can&apos;t afford a ticket. I&apos;m poor. I live among the poor. I don&apos;t know anyone who is going to a World Cup game,&quot; said Santa Cruz&apos;s most famous fan, Bacalhau, who has worn nothing but his team&apos;s colours for 38 years and had all his teeth extracted and replaced with tri-coloured dentures. &quot;I&apos;m not really interested in the national team,&quot; complains another fan, Jesus Tricolor, who has been coming to games for 12 years dressed as the Messiah. &quot;At the top level it is too corrupt so I have given up on them. Now football is all about money. The World Cup contributes nothing to society. It&apos;s just for the elite.&quot; Fans in all countries love to grumble, but disappointment and suspicion about the way football is run in Brazil threatens to diminish what ought to be the best tournament in history. Over the past half century, Brazil has defined world football. In terms of success, style and fun, it has set the benchmarks that other nations have followed. We expect it to be the best and most passionately supported. &quot;England likes to say it is the home of football because it wrote down the rules, but the passion is here in Brazil. This is as good as it gets,&quot; said Walter de Gregorie, FIFA communications director. That may once have been true, but at the moment it is anything but. Clubs like Santa Cruz are becoming an exception. In the Serie A, the average attendance plunged to 13,196 in 2012, down by 13.6% on the previous year. Japan&apos;s J League and Major League Soccer now attract higher crowds. Banks of empty seats are now the norm to the shock of many newcomers. &quot;One thing that surprised me here in Brazil was how few people go to the stadium,&quot; the former Holland midfielder Clarence Seedorf said after moving to Botafogo last year. The main reason is violence, which is starting to define the stadium experience just as it did in England in the 1970s and &apos;80s. Before the 2002 World Cup, the British embassy in Tokyo organised public talks to ease Japanese fears about English football hooligans. In Brazil, such an operation would be redundant because violence in stadiums here is far deadlier than anything in the UK. Largely as a result of clashes between armed organizadas (supporters groups), there have been more than 150 killings in football since 1988. At Santa Cruz a fan was shot three months ago and fell into a coma. By one estimate, the death count in Brazil is now the highest in the world. As in the UK, the authorities are trying to push the game upmarket to draw in more revenue and squeeze out unruly elements. Ticket prices have risen sharply, stadiums are being modernised and TV-rights sales are surging as more people watch pay-per-view TV rather than go to the ground. Yet clubs are deeply indebted and the best players continue to move to Europe, as the national team&apos;s biggest star, Neymar, has just done with a transfer to Barcelona. &quot;Brazilian clubs have never had so much money,&quot; said Tost\u00e3o, a World Cup winner in 1970, told the Guardian. &quot;But they also have never spent as much \u2013 far more than they receive. The management of Brazilian football lacks proficiency and seriousness.&quot; Like many, Tost\u00e3o blames the CBF. Long associated with nepotism and corruption, growing evidence of incompetence has made this organisation one of the most reviled institutions in the country. For decades it was headed by Ricardo Teixeira (the son-in-law of former Fifa kingpin Jo\u00e3o Havelange) but he was forced to resign last year amid a bribery scandal. His successor, Jos\u00e9 Maria Marin, who is accused of collaborating with the dictatorship that ruled the country until 1985, is thought to be under Teixeira&apos;s influence. Marin declined requests for an interview and the CBF has not responded to the Guardian&apos;s request for a comment. The government has made little secret of its frustration with the CBF. (President Dilma Rousseff, who was tortured during the dictatorship era, is said to be very reluctant to share a public stage with Marin). &quot;There is little the government can do to interfere with an independent, private organisation like the CBF, but it supports the &quot;professionalisation&quot; of Brazilian football clubs, which means higher standards of transparency, accountability and due process,&quot; said Luis Fernandes, vice minister for sport. The former Brazil striker Romario has started a petition calling for Marin to stand down. All might be forgiven if the national team were playing like world beaters, but the current squad is arguably the weakest in 60 years after the constant chopping and changing of players and manager. The five-time world champions have won only two of their six games since Luiz Felipe Scolari replaced Mano Menezes as coach in November and last week, Brazil slipped to a historic low of 22 in Fifa&apos;s rankings, below Ecuador, Bosnia-Herzegovinia and Ghana. Impatient supporters have booed the team off the pitch. The public are desperate for the hosts to win next year and shake off the ghost of the last World Cup here in 1950 (when Brazil lost to Uruguay in the final), but it is hard to find anyone who believes that is possible. &quot;The group of players we have now look unlikely to win the World Cup, even with home support,&quot; said the legendary Zico. &quot;We are a year from the World Cup and still don&apos;t know who the first XI is. The Brazil team is still very young. A whole new generation came in at once. So now you get all the responsibility on a player like Neymar, who is only 21 and has never even played in a World Cup qualifier before. We need some players who have been there and done that so the spotlight is on them rather than the young, up and coming players.&quot; The team&apos;s struggles have not stopped the authorities in Recife from hoping 2014 can prove positive and mark a turn away from football&apos;s descent into violence, debt and scandal. Ricardo Leita, the head of the local organising committee said the city&apos;s first all-seater stadium can help improve behaviour. &quot;After the World Cup, we think the fans might change,&quot; he said. &quot;We hope they will be different \u2013 calmer and less aggressive. That&apos;s our goal \u2013 to make football more civilised.&quot; But he acknowledges something essential will also be lost: &quot;The supporters will be different. There won&apos;t be the same passion as you can see at a game between Santa Cruz and Sport [another local side].&quot; The concern at Santa Cruz, who were the first club in Brazil to accept black players, is that the core support may be left behind and the inequality that this tournament is supposed to address might grow worse. &quot;More than 100 years after the abolition of slavery, I see the World Cup as a means of integrating society. It is training people to raise standards. Brazil will show its best side to the world,&quot; said Sylvio Ferreira, a former player-turned-psychology professor who heads the Santa Cruz advisory council. &quot;But it is also true that the World Cup is not for the lower class, it is for the middle class. That is the global trend. It&apos;s very cruel.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The Tokyo stock exchange has risen around 50%, while the yen has fallen about 25% against the US dollar since late last year, to the relief of hard-pressed exporters.", "&quot;Japan has taken the right steps so far, which is unusual for a Japanese government, and this is being reflected in the mood of optimism and support levels for Abe,&quot; said Martin Schulz, chief economist at the Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo.", "France&apos;s socialist president, Francois Hollande, conceded during a visit to Tokyo last weekend that Abe&apos;s focus on growth held lessons for European leaders obsessed with belt-tightening.", "&quot;The economy is doing okay under Abe,&quot; said Toshio Watanabe, a &quot;salaryman&quot; in his early 50s who was taking a cigarette break with colleagues in the Tokyo business district of Hamamatsucho.", "This is Japan&apos;s last chance to get it right before it finds itself at the edge of a very steep cliff.&quot; Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, says Abenomics will only have succeeded if it narrows the growing gap between rich and poor in one of the world&apos;s wealthiest societies."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Economics", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-12T13:31:40Z", "title": "Meet the Japanese girlband whose skirts get shorter when the Nikkei rises", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/12/japan-girlband-skirts-shorter-nikkei", "article": "To get an idea of how Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is faring in his quest to lift his country out of two decades of stagnation, look no further than the skirts of the girl group Machikado Keiki Japan. The band, whose name translates roughly as &quot;street corner economic conditions&quot;, became a bellwether for the health of the world&apos;s third biggest economy earlier this year when they promised to shorten their skirts every time the country&apos;s stock market made significant gains. The four-member group&apos;s novel economic indicator has raised a few eyebrows \u2013 not least because one of the members is a 16-year-old schoolgirl \u2013 but there is no faulting their interest in the fortunes of the Nikkei 225 stock index. Their debut single, Abeno Mix \u2013 complete with unlikely singalong references to quantitative easing and construction bonds \u2013 takes its cue from Abenomics, an ambitious programme of fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reforms that its chief architect believes will lift Japan out of 20 years of deflationary purgatory. Six months into the experiment, Abe&apos;s vision is taking shape. The Tokyo stock exchange has risen around 50%, while the yen has fallen about 25% against the US dollar since late last year, to the relief of hard-pressed exporters.     Japan's PM Shinzo Abe (Kenichiro Seki/Xinhua)    This week the government said the economy had grown at an annualised rate of 4.1% during the first quarter, while rising exports and solid private consumption prompted the Bank of Japan to raise its assessment of the economy for the sixth straight month. &quot;Japan has taken the right steps so far, which is unusual for a Japanese government, and this is being reflected in the mood of optimism and support levels for Abe,&quot; said Martin Schulz, chief economist at the Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo. As world leaders prepare to meet at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland next week, Abenomics is attracting interest from other developed economies battered by austerity. France&apos;s socialist president, Francois Hollande, conceded during a visit to Tokyo last weekend that Abe&apos;s focus on growth held lessons for European leaders obsessed with belt-tightening. Abe&apos;s growth-led strategy and fight against deflation, Hollande said, was &quot;good news for Europe, because in Europe we also have to give priority to growth&quot;. Abe&apos;s early success has enriched investors and brought relief to exporters, but workers say they have yet to feel the benefits. &quot;The economy is doing okay under Abe,&quot; said Toshio Watanabe, a &quot;salaryman&quot; in his early 50s who was taking a cigarette break with colleagues in the Tokyo business district of Hamamatsucho. &quot;But I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve reached the point where we can say things have definitely improved. All I can say now is that the weak yen has made it more expensive for me to go on a foreign holiday.&quot; His colleague, Takeshi Tomoda, believes that most Japanese back Abe&apos;s mission. But having known nothing but deflation all his working life, Tomoda&apos;s optimism is tinged with caution. &quot;Japanese people tend not to get carried away, they always harbour doubts,&quot; he said. &quot;People who are about to retire probably don&apos;t worry about the economy too much, but for my generation it&apos;s an urgent problem. I&apos;ve already resigned myself to the fact that I won&apos;t get a pension anywhere near as big as my parents&apos;, if I get one at all.&quot; Economists agree that Abe&apos;s experiment will fail if his aim falters with the &quot;third arrow&quot; of economic revival: structural reform. He has yet to flesh out how he intends to bring more women into the job market, help a shrinking workforce support the country&apos;s rapidly ageing population, and overcome strong opposition from the country&apos;s powerful farming lobby to agricultural liberalisation. &quot;Structural reform is the area in which he could get into trouble,&quot; Schulz said. &quot;That is why everyone is taking this so seriously. This is Japan&apos;s last chance to get it right before it finds itself at the edge of a very steep cliff.&quot; Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, says Abenomics will only have succeeded if it narrows the growing gap between rich and poor in one of the world&apos;s wealthiest societies. The last time corporate profits made significant gains, in the mid 2000s, coincided with the rise of low-paid contract workers and larger numbers of people falling into poverty, Nakano said. &quot;Abenomics is mesmerising financiers with opportunities for quick profits, but it&apos;s not going to solve Japan&apos;s economic woes,&quot; Nakano said. &quot;Bigger profits for financial institutions isn&apos;t the same as helping ordinary workers. Abe hasn&apos;t concocted a magic potion to solve the economic woes of our time.&quot; Dramatic fluctuations in the Nikkei stock average in recent weeks have played havoc with Machikado&apos;s hemlines, which become longer whenever share prices falter.

As well as the waterway, the draft agreement between Nicaragua and a Hong Kong registered firm \u2014 Nicaraguan Canal Development Investment Co Limited \u2013 includes provisions for two free trade zones, an airport and a &quot;dry canal&quot; freight railway. &quot;This will be the largest project in Latin America in 100 years,&quot; Ronald Maclean, the executive fronting the operation in Managua told the Guardian. &quot;If Nicaragua gets to do this, it is going to be a transformational project not only for Nicaragua but for the region.&quot; Given the government&apos;s large majority, parliamentary approval is expected to be a formality, but critics warn the plan is being rushed through without adequate scrutiny of the environmental impact, business viability and public well-being. A one-year viability study is now under way and the operators soon plan to tap international financial markets in New York, London and Tokyo for investment in a scheme that they say will be entirely privately funded. President Daniel Ortega is also said to be promoting the scheme in meetings with ambassadors from Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Canada. Although hydro-engineering techniques have advanced considerably since the 48-mile (77 km) Panama canal was completed in 1914, the logistical challenge will be enormous. The new canal, which will pass through a much wider stretch of land, is likely to be more than 250km long. It will also be much wider to allow passage by the biggest container ships. The project will be operated by HKDN \u2014 a Hong-Kong based firm set up last year that has established a holding company in the Caiman Islands. It will pay $10m a year for 10 years to the Nicaraguan government. Bigger benefits are expected in the wider economy. Paul Oquist, secretary of public policies of the presidency of the republic, said the Great Interoceanic canal will allow Nicaragua&apos;s GDP to double and employment to triple by 2018. Legislators have complained that congressional committees had only two days to review a bill that could shape the country for a century. &quot;Given its complexity, the length of the concession and its importance for all Nicaraguans, this project deserves to be fully discussed and explained, seeking the broadest national consensus,&quot; noted the Nicaraguan Foundation for Economic and Social Development, an independent think-tank. &quot;How can we as Nicaraguans be sure that the conditions stipulated in the bill are the best that could have been achieved?&quot; Details of the possible route have yet to be disclosed, though it is thought likely that it will run through Lake Nicaragua, the most important source of freshwater in the country and a home to sharks and numerous other species. Jaime Incer, a renowned environmentalist and presidential adviser, urged caution. &quot;There are alternatives for linking one ocean to the other, but there are no alternatives for cleaning a lake after a disaster has happened. We don&apos;t have another Lake Nicaragua,&quot; he told the Confidencial newspaper. Indigenous groups also say they have not been adequately consulted. The operator says it has hired one of the world&apos;s leading consultancies, Environmental Resources Management to conduct impact assessments: &quot;HKND Group has committed to develop the project in a manner that conforms with international best practices, delivers significant benefits to Nicaragua and its people, generates local job growth and economic development, honours the local population and heritage of the country, and serves the best interests of Central America and, indeed, the world.&quot; But little is known of the group behind the project, which is headed by Wang Jing, the head of one of China&apos;s biggest telecom firms Xinwei. It is unclear whether he has any experience in the field of hydroengineering, shipping or infrastructure, but earlier this year his company signed an agreement with the state-owned China Railway Construction Company, and Jing has met senior leaders in Beijing, including president Xi JInping. Margaret Myers, director of the China and Latin America programme at the Inter-American Dialogue, said Wang&apos;s involvement did not necessarily mean the involvement of the Chinese government. &quot;The extent to which this project will increase &apos;China&apos;s&apos; influence in the region and on global trade routes is unclear. This would depend on a wide variety of factors, including HKC&apos;s connections to the Chinese government and who else, if anyone, decides to invest in the project,&quot; she wrote. The Nicaraguan government was due to be a 51% shareholder in the projects, according to preliminary legislation passed last year. There is no mention of this in the latest bill, but Maclean said there has not been a change. &quot;I think it involves a gradual transfer from the company to the government over the life of the concession and that eventually the government will own the canal,&quot; he said. Opposition lawmakers said immunity, tax breaks and other preferential treatment for foreign investors in a still-to-be determined project was a violation of nation sovereignty. The Sandinista Renovation Movement said it would oppose the bill and &quot;any document that gifts a concession, privileges, exonerations and tax exemptions to an unknown company, for an unknown route, for a period of 100 years.&quot; &quot;We are going to hand over the country&apos;s sovereignty without knowing where the canal is going to go, how much it is going to cost, its ecological impact or how long its construction is going to last,&quot; Independent Liberal party legislator Eliseo N\u00fa\u00f1ez, told La Prensa.

Twenty or so years later, the 12-year-old Mancunian Anthony Burgess, who would eventually become a composer as well as a renowned novelist, was taken to the same venue by his father to hear the Hall\u00e9 orchestra perform Wagner. Morley&apos;s book, however, fails to record that this great musical tradition suffered a steep decline. Three decades later, I myself stood on the stage of the Free Trade Hall clad in red blazer and grey shorts, singing shamelessly chauvinistic songs as a member of the\u00a0school choir on Speech Day. The chauvinism, I now recognise, was an\u00a0attempt by my Irish immigrant community to ingratiate itself with mainstream English culture. Within a few square miles of my home, a band of Salford men and women en route to\u00a0stardom revealed their Irish origins in their surnames: Albert Finney, Shelagh\u00a0Delaney, Steven Morrissey, John Cooper Clarke. Burgess can be an\u00a0Irish name, and so can Morley. Another Irish Salfordian, LS Lowry, overshadowed them all. My mother recalled how he was given a wide berth\u00a0by the local populace, though whether this was because he was an artist or a rent collector was never clear. He in turn shunned the British establishment, turning down a CBE, OBE and knighthood. The Salford of my youth was also secretly breeding Ben Kingsley, Mike Leigh and Peter Maxwell Davis. It had previously given\u00a0birth to the great folksinger and cultural activist Ewan MacColl, and today is a home to an exiled bunch of BBC producers. Who said cotton mills were inimical to culture? There&apos;s no need to get too misty-eyed about the region, however, a warning Morley would have been wise to heed. This affectionate piece of anthropology is marred by a tiresomely rhapsodic tone. &quot;I found it, my north,&quot; he gushes, &quot;smoking and babbling, battling and loving, scattered and glittering, lush and brisk \u2026 rickety and\u00a0plush, conspiring and crackling.&quot; Reticence is not this author&apos;s strong point. There is a compulsive use of\u00a0the couplet: &quot;brilliance and persistence, acceptance and slyness, dirt and glamour&quot;. There is\u00a0also a reference to northerners who speak &quot;with a certain sort of\u00a0tough, scuffed and striven fluency&quot;, preferring the &quot;slap, twist and thud&quot; of their own speech to &quot;the\u00a0slur, sting and snap of near neighbours&quot;. There is certainly a glut of scuffing, slapping and thudding in these extravagantly overwritten pages, in which Ian Brady and Myra Hindley become &quot;charred, trapped scraps of frustrated northern will&quot;. It makes them sound\u00a0even worse than serial killers. Liverpool, predictably, provokes Morley to a bout of severe verbal flatulence: &quot;Liverpool, passion. Liverpool, moving, Liverpool, moving cotton, sugar, slaves, invoices, music, ideas here, there and everywhere \u2026&quot; Writers who wish to avoid hoots of southern derision would do well to avoid sentences like: &quot;There was only one tree in our garden, which never produced any leaves.&quot; One can almost hear the cries of &quot;Luxury!&quot; from satirists of the prolier-than-thou syndrome. If you begin a paragraph: &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t remember my dad making anything other than a pot of tea, eccentrically spreading marge on\u00a0his Weetabix and dousing his Kellogg&apos;s Cornflakes in milk and sugar&quot;, you have only yourself to blame if a reader scrawls &quot;before feeding the lot to his whippet&quot; in the\u00a0margin. This grab-bag of\u00a0a book mixes poetry\u00a0and sociology, history\u00a0and autobiography. Yet if some of it suffers from a rather slipshod lyricism, the\u00a0auto-biographical sections are too\u00a0flatly naturalistic. It\u00a0is interesting to\u00a0know that the Beatles were turned away from the restaurant of Manchester&apos;s Midland hotel\u00a0for being inappropriately dressed, and that Les\u00a0Dawson was able to pull such grotesque faces because he broke his jaw in a boxing match, but not that Morley used to catch the bus at five past eight so as to be at school by a quarter to nine. He grew up in a part of\u00a0Stockport called Reddish, and the book&apos;s obsession with the place is so relentless that one begins to wonder whether it is meant to be self-parody. We are provided with a nerdish list of bus stops, a grim, socialist-realist-type\u00a0photo of the local 92 bus and a small, Sebald-like map of the terrain. Like many a\u00a0life-writer, Morley is too ready to assume that things are important simply because they happened to him. Freud once noted the gap between the vividness of our dreams for us and the tedium we inflict\u00a0in telling them to others, and\u00a0much the same can be true of\u00a0recounting your life history. Even so, the book partly redeems itself by its passion and chutzpah. It\u00a0is a great baggy monster of a love\u00a0letter to its author&apos;s provincial origins,\u00a0ranging all\u00a0the way from ice age Cheshire to the\u00a0invention of the eccles cake. There are times when it seems to mistake northern England for the streets around Stockport Viaduct (the Geordies don&apos;t get much\u00a0of a look in), but there is some impressively erudite stuff on the hat-making industry, the Lancashire genius for comedy and a good deal more. We learn that a Liverpool man invented the crossword, and that Beatles manager Brian Epstein grew up\u00a0on the same street of the city as Gladstone. Sheffield produced the jelly\u00a0baby as\u00a0well as knives and forks, and Stockport, not Tokyo, came up with the first karaoke machine. It&apos;s just\u00a0that it would have been nice to make these discoveries without all the\u00a0romantic froth. \u2022 Terry Eagleton&apos;s How To Read Literature is published by Yale University Press"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s almost like, these days you know, when a black man is tackling harder than the other, it seems to be the way.&quot; Asked if Pacific island teams [including Fiji, who are the Eagles&apos; opponents in Tokyo on 19 June], were singled out, he said: &quot;Absolutely.", "But Canada is going to be huge and that&apos;s what we&apos;re building towards.&quot;  With that in mind, as well as the looming trip to Tokyo to face Fiji and Japan in the remaining PNC matches, he has picked a team of mixed experience."], "tags": ["USA rugby union team", "Tonga rugby union team", "Canada rugby union team", "Rugby union", "Race issues", "US sports", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-13T13:00:00Z", "title": "US Eagles prepare for physical Pacific Nations Cup test against Tonga", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/13/us-eagles-tonga-pacific-nations-cup", "article": "The US Eagles will be prepared for an extremely physical challenge when they play Tonga in a Pacific Nations Cup match in Carson City, California on Friday night, although the islanders will be without three key players who have been suspended for foul play. Tonga lost to Canada in Ontario last Saturday, 36-27, having played some of the match with 12 men against 15. The full-back David Halaifonua was subsequently banned for six weeks by the International Rugby Board, for a high shoulder charge on the Canada winger Matt Evans; prop Eddie &apos;Aholelei was suspended until 12 July, for punching the flanker Jebb Sinclair; and the centre Siale Piutau was banned for three weeks for punching the hooker Ray Barkwill. The Eagles \u2013 particularly in the form of their tough-tackling blindside flanker, Samu Manoa (who is of, in rugby terms, distinguished Tongan heritage) \u2013 are not averse to a touch of physicality themselves, but the game will nonetheless be played under something of a media spotlight, after the Tonga coach complained of unfair treatment from IRB officials on and off the pitch. After the Canada game, Mana Otai said Pacific island teams were unfairly penalised for physical play. &quot;I couldn&apos;t really see why [the yellow cards were issued],&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s almost like, these days you know, when a black man is tackling harder than the other, it seems to be the way.&quot; Asked if Pacific island teams [including Fiji, who are the Eagles&apos; opponents in Tokyo on 19 June], were singled out, he said: &quot;Absolutely. It&apos;s a perception a lot of times.&quot; Canada&apos;s coach, the former New Zealand full-back Kieran Crowley, said the IRB suspensions were justified. &quot;I don&apos;t know how you could say they were legal tackles,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought the definition of a tackle was you had to use your arms, for a start. It&apos;s pretty clear when you have a look at those incidents that they deserved [the sanctions] they got.  &quot;This is about the third or fourth time I&apos;ve heard it, the racist sort of things. You&apos;ve got to play within the laws of the game. And if you don&apos;t play within the laws of the game, you get dealt with.&quot; The Eagles had a taste of that philosophy in their 15-12 defeat by Ireland on Saturday night \u2013 which attracted a US-record crowd of 20,181 to the BBVA Compass Stadium in Houston. The home team lost their captain, Todd Clever, for 10 crucial second-half minutes, after he was adjudged to have made a dangerous tackle on Devin Toner. However, the Manoa tackle on Ireland captain Peter O&apos;Mahony shown below was legal, and coach Mike Tolkin must instil in his men the need to follow suit, while following through correctly, against the Tongans.            Tolkin sees the Pacific Nations Cup as a chance to develop players, husbanding his resources in a busy summer that culminates in two World Cup qualifiers against the Canadians. &quot;It would be great to win the Pacific Nations,&quot; he says, as &quot;frankly, we haven&apos;t won anything since the [1924] Olympics. But Canada is going to be huge and that&apos;s what we&apos;re building towards.&quot;  With that in mind, as well as the looming trip to Tokyo to face Fiji and Japan in the remaining PNC matches, he has picked a team of mixed experience. A callow side having lost their opener, 16-9 to Canada in Edmonton in May, overseas professionals like Clever and Scott Lavalla start \u2013 Manoa, however, is rested, having had an arduous season with Northampton Saints. Tonga and the USA have met five times, the Eagles winning only the first game, in San Francisco in 1999, and Tonga winning a meeting at the 2007 World Cup in France. The two teams&apos; last game, in North Wales in November 2012, produced a 22-13 victory for the &apos;Ikale Tahi \u2013 the nickname means &quot;Sea Eagles&quot;, although the crest on Tonga&apos;s shirts carries the (not supposedly ironic) image of a dove. Tonga went on that month to defeat Scotland in Aberdeen, their first victory over a major European country in Europe. They beat France, the eventual runners-up, at the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand.  The Eagles&apos; game (which kicks off at 7.30pm PT, live on Universal Sports) will be part of a double-header at the Home Depot Center, after the US Women&apos;s Eagles have kicked off against France at 5pm PT.

Back in 2005, we were at the height of a global boom and there was a real sense that this could be the summit to Make Poverty History. I was proud to be a small part of the campaign that urged world leaders to boost aid, cancel debt and &quot;make trade fair&quot;. We only got two out of three: debt and aid, and aid was not fully delivered. Yet despite that relative failure, the wins we did get made a massive difference to millions of the world&apos;s poorest people. To take just one example, 30% fewer children die of malaria in Africa than did in 2004 \u2013 that&apos;s 300,000 lives saved every year. The week before the G8 convenes once again is a natural time to reminisce about the good old days but this is about more than nostalgia. Even in today&apos;s age of austerity, the G8 has a chance to build on the successes of the Gleneagles summit and, in particular, tackle the forgotten scandal of hunger. A child dies every 10 seconds from malnutrition \u2013 not because their parents are reckless, stupid or lazy \u2013 but because they were unlucky enough to be born at a time and place where there is too little food available or, perhaps more tragically, where people cannot afford to buy the food that is. One in eight people in the world will go to bed hungry tonight. That&apos;s 870 million people. The total population of the G8 is just 890 million. Just imagine the urgency to act if those 870 million lived in the G8 rather than in Africa, South Asia and other poor countries. Since 2005, I&apos;ve visited developing countries and campaigned with Oxfam at a number of G8 and G20 summits \u2013 pushing leaders to deliver on their promises to the poorest and seeing for myself the difference the money can make. In Tanzania, I met the charming and humbling villagers of Engare Sero, who explained to me that for them aid meant a grain bank so they no longer had to endure a life-sapping 10-day round trip for a single bag of maize. In Nairobi&apos;s Kibera slum I met girls as young as eight scavenging for food who were forced to give sexual favours to the criminals who controlled the dump so they could get to the fresher garbage as it was unloaded from the lorries. At Tokyo and then Toronto leaders pledged again to deliver the aid they had promised, but with the notable exception of the UK, those expected to stump up significant sums have fallen short \u2013 increases, yes but billions shy of their promises. In Cannes at the G20, we hoped a Robin Hood tax on banks might fill the gap \u2013 it still might. Eleven countries in Europe are pressing ahead with a financial transaction tax that could raise tens of billions from the sector that caused the economic crisis to help people in Europe and poor countries. The UK is not only not one of those countries, but George Osborne is going to court to block it. This year&apos;s G8 is unlikely to see much movement on aid beyond the very welcome additional money for nutrition announced at last weekend&apos;s hunger summit. The UK has let it be known that this will not be a pledging summit. But that does not mean it cannot help the villagers of Engare Sero, the slum girls of Kibera and millions like them. Protecting poor people from land grabs, making it easier for them to find out what companies and their governments are doing and stopping the ridiculous situation where G8 members&apos; policies actively encourage land to be used for growing fuel rather than food: all these will help. But perhaps the biggest step forward the G8 could make would be to end the scandal that sees companies dodge more than $160bn a year in tax they should pay poor countries. It is money that could be invested in farms \u2013 providing the seeds, equipment and knowhow to get more food from the same plot of land. And it could be used to provide safety nets to help people whose ability to earn a living has failed to keep pace with rising food prices. In the 6th century BC the Chinese philosopher Lao Tsu observed: &quot;The people are hungry: it is because those in authority eat up too much in taxes.&quot; Now in large parts of the world the reverse is true. The actions the G8 needs to take are relatively simple. They need to agree new global rules \u2013 on information exchange and public information so it is clear who assets belong to \u2013 to ensure that companies can no longer use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share here and in poor countries. Here David Cameron has a crucial role to play \u2013 the UK is responsible for more tax havens than any other country in the world. As the prime minister said earlier this year: &quot;The fact is the poorer the nation the more they need the tax revenues but often the weaker the capacity they have to collect them. All of this in developed and developing countries alike comes down to a simple issue of fairness.&quot; I couldn&apos;t have put it better myself."}, {"sentences": ["The earning years were \u2013 naturally \u2013 at Goldman Sachs, where he was marked out as one of the very highest flyers while working in London, Tokyo and New York."], "tags": ["Mark Carney", "Bank of England", "Business", "Canada", "Americas", "World news", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-13T17:48:23Z", "title": "Mark Carney: Bank governor's journey from wilderness to heart of the City", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/13/mark-carney-bank-governor-city", "article": "Mark Carney, the Canadian banker hand-picked by chancellor George Osborne to take the reins at the Bank of England has a life motto: &quot;Learn, Earn, Serve&quot;. And so far, it has all gone exactly to plan. So important was learning that as an 18-year-old he left his home country and enrolled at Harvard, then Oxford, twice, once for a masters and back a few years later for a PhD. One don who taught Carney still has one of his essays tucked away in a filing cabinet: because he rated it so highly, he took a photocopy. One of the examiners of Carney&apos;s doctoral thesis in 1995 was John Vickers (now Sir), who ran the Independent Commission on Banking. Little can he have imagined that less than 20 years later he would be competing against \u2013 and losing out to \u2013 this promising student for the job of governor of the Bank of England. The earning years were \u2013 naturally \u2013 at Goldman Sachs, where he was marked out as one of the very highest flyers while working in London, Tokyo and New York. The switch to public service \u2013 and the public profile that brings \u2013 came with a move into central banking, first as deputy and then as governor of the Bank of Canada, in a spell that included the global financial collapse. Canada came through the turmoil in far better shape than many and Carney&apos;s role during the crisis, and as chairman of the international Financial Stability Board, the central bankers&apos; club which is rewriting the rules of banking in the wake of the meltdown, marked him out, according to Osborne, as &quot;the outstanding central banker of his generation&quot;. Serving, however, has not put an end to Carney&apos;s earning power. Using the hard-nosed negotiating skills learned on Wall Street, he secured a pay package to move to London of \u00a3874,000, including a \u00a310,000-a-month housing allowance \u2013 nearly three times the salary of outgoing Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King. On the first day in his new job, 1 July, which happens to be Canada Day, Carney will arrive in a very different workplace from the one he has just left. In the 70s-era glass and slate foyer of the Bank of Canada, opposite Ottawa&apos;s green-roofed mock baronial parliament buildings, instead of the august and gloomy hush that greets visitors to the Bank of England, there is a cheerful buzz as staff arrive back from lunch clutching giant coffee cups, joshing and planning their weekends. Some are even wearing trainers or jeans, unheard of in the hallowed corridors of the Bank, where new arrivals are detained at the door by pink jacketed, top-hatted flunkies. The pavements outside in Ottawa are dotted with tourists, instead of the sharp-elbowed City workers of the Square Mile. It&apos;s not just the BoC&apos;s relative youthfulness \u2013 at 78 a mere stripling next to the 318 years of the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street \u2013 that explains the lack of haughtiness here. Close observers of Carney&apos;s five years in charge (it was meant to be seven, until Osborne made him an offer he couldn&apos;t refuse), say his leadership style has been instrumental in transforming its culture. One of Carney&apos;s first acts when he arrived, in the teeth of the worldwide financial crisis in February 2008, was to insist that senior staff were issued with Blackberrys \u2013 anathema to his predecessor, David Dodge. Staff soon realised why: even the lowliest number-cruncher could expect to receive sudden email requests for information or analysis. &quot;He just collapsed the hierarchy,&quot; one insider recalls. Surprise candidates who clinch top jobs are often said to have &quot;come from nowhere&quot; but for the driven 48-year-old, it is almost true. Fort Smith, where Carney spent the first six years of his life, is a tiny town of fewer than 2,500 people, way up in Canada&apos;s north-west, more than 600 miles from the nearest city, Edmonton. He may have taken his first degree at Harvard, his doctorate at Oxford, and acquired the carefully-groomed air of a Goldman Sachs banker, but friends say his formative years in the back of beyond still matter. &quot;His roots govern his perspective of the little guy, of the common person. Is he urbane? Yes. Is he urban? Yes and no,&quot; says Mel Cappe, professor of public policy at the University of Toronto, and a former secretary of cabinet, who knows Carney well. The family (his parents were teachers) moved to Edmonton, in oil-rich Alberta, where Carney attended the Catholic St Francis Xavier high school. He is still a fan of the local hockey team (don&apos;t say &quot;ice hockey&quot;), the Edmonton Oilers. Westerners, as people from this part of Canada are known, pride themselves on being self-reliant outsiders. When the federal government made a grab for a larger share of the region&apos;s oil revenues during Carney&apos;s teenage years, in a bid to cap prices for energy users across Canada after the Middle East oil crisis, a favourite local bumper-sticker read, &quot;Let Those Eastern Bastards Freeze in the Dark&quot;. Perhaps it is a residual memory of this deep suspicion of federal interference that has encouraged Carney to make communicating with the public central to his job. Indeed, so keen is he on making himself understood in England that he is bringing his own press spokesman with him from Ottawa. As governor of the Bank of Canada, Carney has travelled far and wide across the vast country to try to justify his policies to ordinary people \u2013 and observers say this ability to explain comes from that upbringing out west. &quot;He&apos;s very good at making monetary policy make sense for citizens,&quot; says Scott Brison, economic spokesman for the Liberal party \u2013 known as &quot;finance critic&quot; \u2013 and , a personal friend of Carney&apos;s. A sojourn in Brison&apos;s cottage in Nova Scotia fuelled speculation that Carney might be flirting with a move into politics \u2013 something many believe is still likely, since he has made clear he only wants to stay in England for five years, instead of serving a full eight-year term. &quot;I think he definitely took a look at whether he wanted to take a run at being the leader of a political party, and maybe the prime minister, and I don&apos;t think you can rule out political aspirations of some kind in the future,&quot; says Ted Carmichael, managing director for strategy at the giant Canadian pension fund OMERS, and a former chief Canadian economist for JP Morgan. Carney arrived at the Bank of Canada as a relative unknown. &quot;He kind of came out of the blue here. There was this vacancy at the Bank of Canada, and this guy nobody had ever heard of got it,&quot; says Carmichael. It came about after he had been spotted by Dodge. There was a plan to privatise Ontario&apos;s hydroelectric power generator, Hydro One, and Goldman Sachs had sent its savviest, most impressive young Canadian up to Toronto to try to clinch the deal. The privatisation never came off, but Carney had made his mark in the minds of the public officials who met him. When the deputy governorship of the Bank came up in 2003, he applied, and got the job. Soon afterwards, he moved over to the finance department, the equivalent of the Treasury, to become the brightest of its bright young men. Peter DeVries, a long-time senior civil servant who saw him at close quarters at that time, recalls: &quot;I guess when he first arrived, a lot of us were just taken aback by his brilliance. He became the go-to guy when people were looking for a solution. You would have 20 people in the boardroom and everyone would wait for him to clear his throat.&quot; That picture is echoed repeatedly in Canada&apos;s close-knit policymaking circles, where Carney is proudly, and affectionately, referred to as a &quot;rock star&quot;. &quot;There are few rooms he&apos;s going to walk into where he&apos;s not the smartest guy in it,&quot; says Don McCutchan, a former senior finance department official, now at Toronto law firm Gowlings. &quot;Mark Carney is a very strong personality: he tends to dominate a room,&quot; agrees Carmichael. By the time Dodge&apos;s term was nearing an end, in early 2008, few in the financial markets had any illusions that the turmoil in financial market, that had already been raging for months, would get far worse. The job was widely expected to go to a senior insider, Paul Jenkins. But crucially, Carney was regarded as possessing the financial nous that would be necessary as the shockwaves from the US sub-prime crash spread. Dodge had already cut interest rates once before he stepped down, but during Carney&apos;s first few months in office, he slashed them to record lows, and pumped unprecedented liquidity into the financial system to stabilise the banking sector. Helped by its massive oil and gas resources, Canada suffered a short, shallower recession, instead of the deep downturn that is still hobbling most major economies. Paul Martin, the Liberal finance minister from 1993 to 2002, and later prime minister, says: &quot;He was a very strong central bank governor. He had a lot of experience, he had the skills, and he was an excellent communicator.&quot; Throughout the downturn and the recovery, Carney has used communication aggressively in a bid to make monetary policy more effective. In 2009, just as the economy started to recover and markets and mortgage-borrowers feared that rates were about to rise, he committed the Bank to keeping them low for another 12 months \u2013 barring a surge in inflation. Carney has since been a strong advocate of such &quot;forward guidance&quot;, as a way of preventing borrowing costs across the economy from shooting up as investors bet on a rate rise. Osborne, presumably under the influence of Carney, has offered the Bank of England the opportunity of adopting the same approach. &quot;I think it helps,&quot; says Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada. &quot;At a minimum it sends signals to the markets that the Bank&apos;s not going to turn on every wiggle in the data. It also sends a message to consumers and businesses. I think that makes sense in the UK environment.&quot; As well as using new tools in monetary policy, Brison says Carney&apos;s ability to stand toe to toe with bankers has been critical. &quot;Mark has the economic background; but also he has personal understanding of the industry. He has peer-to-peer credibility with some of the top bankers in the world. There&apos;s a language; there&apos;s a cadence.&quot; In his international role, as chairman of the G20&apos;s Financial Stability Board, he has not only been a strong advocate of tighter regulation, but notched up a furious shouting match with JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon. Perhaps not surprisingly, given how fast he has risen, Carney has a steely side: several people remembered being warned off disagreeing with him. And he had that life-plan from a relatively early age. &quot;I have heard him say &apos;learn, earn, serve,&apos;&quot; says Brison. &quot;He is someone who chooses public service: he is not a materialistic guy.&quot; In other words, the young Carney set himself the deliberate aim of making big money early in his career, so that he could go into public service later. That&apos;s an idea corroborated by his doctoral supervisor, Margaret Meyer, who recalls that as a postgraduate student at Nuffield College, Oxford \u2013 after his first stint at Goldman Sachs \u2013 he already had a plan to take up a policy role. Like many who came across the young Carney, Meyer remembers being impressed. &quot;What really distinguished Mark Carney from other students was his intellectual versatility and the rapidity with which he was able to get up to speed with new approaches and new techniques. He has a very agile mind&quot;. Carney&apos;s British-born wife, Diana, an economist whom he met at Oxford, is also a policy wonk. She worked at the Department for International Development and the Overseas Development Institute thinktank before moving to Canada. More recently, she has worked at the progressive thinktank Canada 2020, speaking out on political issues such as rising income inequality. The Carneys have four young girls, and while many acquaintances seem to rack their brains when asked what the smartest guy in the room he does for fun (&quot;he&apos;ll have a pint and a plate of nachos like the rest of us&quot; was the best one colleague came up with; an Ottawa neighbour mentioned super-fast jogging), he is by all accounts an enthusiastic dad. One fellow member of the Five Lakes Fishing Club, in the wilderness of the Gatineau Hills outside the capital, says affectionately that his most vivid picture of the central bank governor is of him &quot;standing there in his swimming trunks, holding up his three-year-old daughter \u2026 Mark and his women&quot;. It&apos;s hard to imagine someone with so much evident self-confidence managing to remain quite so well liked as Carney is by the easy-going Canadians; but Ed Clark, chief executive of TD, one of Canada&apos;s largest banks, who knows him well, says he can do self-effacing if he needs to. &quot;He&apos;s going to get the lie of the land, he&apos;s going to listen to people, he&apos;s going to have to figure out what&apos;s politically possible. You&apos;ll be surprised how quickly he comes out and says, &apos;I&apos;m not God: I&apos;m an above-average guy.&apos;&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June to correct the spelling of Gatineau Hills and the reference to the Liberal party being the opposition.

Now it seems as if the one thing worse than more QE is less QE. More seriously, emerging market equities have again demonstrated how hard it is for them to decouple from developed markets, particularly during a wider sell-off.&quot; Meanwhile, Portugal&apos;s deep recession and rising political tensions risk undermining the country&apos;s bailout programme, despite a fresh easing of its deficit targets, according to the International Monetary Fund. In its latest progress report on Portugal, the IMF confirmed that it has agreed Lisbon&apos;s tough deficit reduction goals should be loosened \u2013 by 1 percentage point in 2013, and 1.5 percentage points in 2014 \u2013 as the economy slows. &quot;In view of the significant deterioration in the macro-fiscal outlook, there was agreement that the fiscal deficit path under the programme needed to be recalibrated,&quot; the IMF&apos;s report said. Portugal&apos;s debt-to-GDP ratio is now expected to peak at 124% next year, two percentage points higher than at the IMF&apos;s last review earlier this year. That decision has been seen as part of a gradual shift away from doctrinaire austerity within the &quot;troika&quot; \u2013 the coalition of the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank that has overseen eurozone bailouts. But despite the more accommodating stance towards rescued governments, Portugal&apos;s deficit targets remain tough, and the IMF is concerned that the public could reject the austerity measures being demanded of their government. &quot;The hitherto sturdy social and political consensus that has buttressed strong programme implementation has weakened significantly,&quot; it warned. The IMF stressed that the outlook for Portugal&apos;s economy remains &quot;sombre&quot;. The economy contracted by 3.25% last year, and it is now expected to shrink again, by 2.25%, this year, partly driven by the slowdown across the rest of the euro area. &quot;Strong export growth, which has hitherto helped offset the contraction in domestic demand, has of late started to decrease reflecting weakening demand from the rest of the euro area&quot;. It added that unemployment, which is already at 18%, is likely to continue rising until at least 2014. Portugal will receive the next tranche of its bailout, worth \u20ac657m, as a result of the IMF&apos;s review."}, {"sentences": ["(&quot;I have no desire even to visit.&quot;) Likewise Tokyo: too many great restaurants already."], "tags": ["Chefs", "Restaurants", "Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Travel", "Singapore", "Hong Kong", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-15T20:30:00Z", "title": "Jason Atherton: a 21st-century cook's tour of the east", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/15/jason-atherton-cooks-tour-east", "article": "There are times, travelling with Jason Atherton, as he does the rounds of his new restaurants and soon-to-be restaurants and not-quite-fully-formed-ideas-for restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong and Dubai over the course of five intensive days, when you are profoundly grateful you are not in the company of either of his sometime mentors, Gordon Ramsay or Marco Pierre White. One such moment is at the luggage information desk at Dubai&apos;s colossal, soul-sucking airport where, after the third overnight flight, the inevitable has happened and our bags have finally gone astray. Atherton has just done a full cooking shift at 22 Ships, his inspired tapas bar in the heart of Hong Kong&apos;s old red light district, while simultaneously checking in with staff about the lunch service at his Michelin-starred London home, Pollen Street Social, and fielding emails about his new ventures in Sydney and Shanghai. He&apos;s due at a meeting with a developer working with the InterContinental hotel group in Dubai at 9am to sign off on a deal to open a new waterfront property worth several million dollars. He is in the jeans and T-shirt he has tried to sleep in on the plane, and unshowered. At 7am the glum manager of the luggage information desk, at which we are the sole customers, is showing little interest in our missing bags. After extensive walkie-talkie conversations and a languid, fruitless search for a pen with which to take our details, a long hour or so has passed before he relays the information that &quot;I think your bags are somewhere in the system&quot;. At which point you might imagine Gordon or Marco, testosterone pumping, jetlag jagging, would have taken some selfish relief in reducing the manager, his system and the entire luggage information operation at Dubai International to a lightly astringent jus. Atherton, who worked for Ramsay for 10 years, creating the highly successful Maze, and who has, as I have witnessed in various time zones, an obsessive interest in the efficiencies of service, remains courteous. &quot;I tell you what,&quot; he says, &quot;I wanted to have a look at the fish market this morning before the meeting, so we&apos;ll head out there, and perhaps if our bags turn up we can pay for them to be sent on to the hotel?&quot;     Jason Atherton at Deira Fish Market in Dubai. Photograph: Richard Saker    We head to the fish market, a dockside hangar in which an extraordinary variety of sea creatures have been dredged from the Gulf to be vigorously descaled, chopped and then examined by some of the desert city&apos;s army of chefs. Atherton is in his element, enthused by the idea that &quot;there are probably 30 species here I&apos;ve never cooked&quot; and therefore further excited by the prospect of his Dubai kitchen, which might be open by the autumn, if he makes his InterContinental meeting. We head to the hotel to find the bags have been delivered, testament to Atherton&apos;s patience and local knowledge (&quot;I worked here for Gordon for four years and I know if you start shouting the odds to locals you are screwed&quot;). The chef makes his meeting, signs his deal, does a walking tour of the first-floor shell of a skyscraper fronting the marina in which his restaurant will take shape, and is still smiling at lunchtime when he sits down at the waterside opposite the building site, and celebrates the contract with a carrot juice. &quot;The thing is,&quot; he says of our morning, &quot;if I start to get annoyed about a lost bag or whatever, I just make sure I immediately give myself a kick up the butt. You know, I&apos;ve had more difficult days than these\u2026&quot; Atherton&apos;s journey to this particular waterfront began at a seaside about as far from the glass-fronted fantasy of Dubai&apos;s marina as you can imagine. Born in Sheffield, he moved with his mother to Skegness after his parents separated when he was three. He lived with his mum and his sister in a caravan, &quot;quite cosy but frigging cold in the winter&quot;, and got his first taste of kitchens and hotels at a guesthouse, the Maryland, that his mother set up on Skegness&apos;s North Sea coast. &quot;Even in the holidays we always had to work,&quot; Atherton, now 41, recalls. &quot;I would get up early to help do the breakfasts, then go out and be a donkey boy, doing rides for kids on the beach all day, then come back, help with the evening meal. My stepdad Dave was a joiner. He would be out first thing on building sites, then come back and put a dickie bow and a white shirt on and work the bar until midnight. On a Friday, the treat for my sister and me was to watch the telly, plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car, with pop and crisps, for an hour before the battery ran down.&quot;     Jason Atherton's quote which is on the wall of his 22 Ships restaurant in Hong Kong. Photograph: Richard Saker    This work ethic has clearly never left Atherton. After &quot;24 years busting my nuts in other people&apos;s kitchens&quot;, he invested every last penny of his savings into Pollen Street Social in Mayfair only two years ago; with the help of partners he now has eight restaurants and counting across the world (two others opened earlier this year in London, Little Social, over the road from the original, and the Social Eating House, in Soho). All have quickly won praise and awards and, more to the point, customers. &quot;We have two kinds of restaurants, extremely successful ones and successful ones, but they all make money,&quot; he says and shows me the daily incoming texts of takings to prove it. Esquina, for example, has paid back its investment in just 10 months. Atherton, who is married to Ihra, a Filipina who worked with him in Dubai, and has two daughters, aged seven and two, is about to start filming a TV series for Sky, My Kitchen Rules, in which couples compete to create pop-up restaurants in their front rooms; he has three cookbooks in the works. It is, you might say, his moment; but having seen casualties of previous such moments up close, he is anxious, desperate, not to let it go to his head. One of the fascinations of Atherton&apos;s rise \u2013 White singled him out recently as one of only three or four &quot;proper&quot; British cooks \u2013 is that he is very much a second-generation figure; he has learned from the excesses of the celebrity fathers. He won&apos;t say a bad word about Ramsay but they don&apos;t see each other now \u2013 &quot;his choice not mine&quot;; the Scot was characteristically annoyed that his protege eventually left Maze, but still Atherton has learned, he says, from his old boss, &quot;both what to do and what not to do&quot;. Much of this is detail. In his autobiography, Ramsay reveals that when he started out he was in the habit of chucking any complaints from customers in the bin. The chef was always right. In the course of our travels, Atherton has any complaints made in any of his outposts immediately texted over to him. In Hong Kong he discovers that a lunch party in Singapore had to wait 20 minutes for dessert, while one of 100 diners in Soho at lunchtime thought his steak a little fatty. Atherton immediately responds with questions to sous chefs and maitre d&apos;s, and apologies to customers. He talks in passing, &quot;don&apos;t quote me&quot;, of memorably truculent guests over the years but prides himself on never losing his rag. &quot;I&apos;ve never chucked anyone out,&quot; he says, &quot;and I don&apos;t imagine I ever will. I have had people in Pollen Street say &apos;there is not a single thing on this menu I like&apos;. But I kill them with kindness. I go out and say, tell me what you want and I will happily cook it for you. I&apos;m not interested in &apos;chef knows best&apos; bullshit.&quot; When Atherton worked for Nico Ladenis in London in the early 90s they weren&apos;t allowed to put salt and pepper on the table. &quot;If people asked for pepper, Nico would likely ask them to leave. To me, if someone likes a lot of pepper, it&apos;s not a problem. He has paid for it, he can do what he likes.&quot; It&apos;s tempting to think that some of this spirit is a legacy from Skegness. He agrees that there was probably no tougher crowd to please. &quot;We had busloads every week from Doncaster, Barnsley, Rotherham, Nottingham,&quot; Atherton recalls. &quot;We would have Leicester week, in which the only question you ever heard was &apos;Ow much is it, duck?&apos; I&apos;d have to check with my mum but I think to start with it was about \u00a33.50 for the weekend, bed and board, so it wasn&apos;t bad value.&quot; Atherton brought a good deal of that can-do possibility down to London with him. At 16, he wrote to the top 20 chefs in the country, from Raymond Blanc down, and asked if they might find a space for him. He received a positive reply from one, Boyd Gilmour, who had left the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to set up Boyd&apos;s in Covent Garden. Atherton came down with his knives and his whites, said he could start tomorrow and that was that. He lived in the youth hostel in Earl&apos;s Court for two years with about a tenner a week to spend and &quot;loved every second of it&quot;. He didn&apos;t travel abroad until he was 22, working a season at the three-star Auberge de L&apos;Ill in Alsace. Five years after that he became the first non-Spanish speaker to work with Ferran Adri\u00e0 at El Bulli having turned up with a backpack and refused to leave until he got a trial in the world&apos;s best kitchen. In between times he cooked with White in his heyday at Harvey&apos;s and then at the Hyde Park hotel. His time in Spain perhaps gives most clues to the kind of cooking Ahterton aspires to now \u2013 smart, witty plates, with intense flavours, made with sharing in mind. &quot;You stepped into that kitchen and it was like you were in a different world,&quot; he says of El Bulli. From White, the original el bully, he learned something about man management. &quot;You&apos;d try not to catch Marco&apos;s eye at midnight when he was off hunting with his mates, otherwise you would be up making bacon sandwiches for them when they got back at five in the morning and then straight on to prepping,&quot; he says. He put up with that, and even, he hesitates to suggest, the occasional physical confrontation, because &quot;Marco was the best chef working in Britain. He was so fast and so perfect, all out of this complete chaos.&quot;     Jason Atherton and staff outside his Pollen restaurant at Gardens by the Bay in downtown Singapore. Photograph: Richard Saker    As I witness a few times, watching him at work, at the futuristic Pollen in Singapore, which is housed in a glass-domed botanical gardens on the bay, or at Esquina, his tapas bar in that heart of that city, Atherton is hardly reticent when imposing his standards on his chefs. He is only here for a day or two, so each observation has to count. &quot;When I do give someone a hard time it&apos;s usually if they disrespect ingredients, or if the veg is not packed away properly in the morning. I know it sounds OCD but my organic carrots, I don&apos;t want them tossed in a scruffy container: they are laid down nicely all facing the right way and treated with respect. I get angry if stuff like that is not done, but not madman angry.&quot; A running theme of our travels is the fact that Atherton only ever gets asked two questions by journalists: &quot;How did you survive working with Gordon?&quot; and &quot;Aren&apos;t you in danger of spreading yourself too thin?&quot; In a sense one of the questions answers the other. Atherton eventually left Maze not because of Ramsay, &quot;but because I couldn&apos;t work with his father-in-law [Chris Hutcheson, Ramsay&apos;s then business partner]. I tried for years. But it was time to move on.&quot; Atherton has so far been luckier with his own business partners. His principal backer is Mrs Mavis Oei, owner of the Goodwood Park group of hotels and daughter of the late Khoo Teck Puat, once Singapore&apos;s richest man. Oei was seduced by Atherton&apos;s food \u2013 he cooked for her first at Maze and then at her homes in Bray and in the Far East. Having invited him over to discuss a business proposition in 2011, she refused to let him return to the UK until he had signed a deal by which she offered an initial \u00a33m as finance for a 25% stake in what became Pollen Street Social. The rest of the opportunities have flowed from there.     In a meeting with business partner Peng Loh.  Photograph: Richard Saker    In Singapore, Atherton has breakfast with Peng Loh, a former lawyer who has hotel and restaurant interests throughout the world, including London&apos;s Viajante and One Leicester Street. Their plans for the former Foster&apos;s brewery building in Sydney are laid out on the table. &quot;What do the Australians eat for breakfast?&quot; Peng wonders. &quot;Well, I do this great kind of mini-English breakfast on a proper pizza,&quot; Atherton suggests, which sounds about right. In Hong Kong he meets Yenn Wong, perhaps the most immaculately groomed woman I have ever encountered, with whom he is renovating PMQ, the former colonial police barracks in the middle of town, with a casual &quot;bread oven-type place&quot; downstairs and a &quot;farm-to-table eating&quot; restaurant upstairs. There is talk of tracking down &quot;the only properly organic farmer in China&quot; for the veg. Yenn takes a precise note. She helped to design 22 Ships and they have plans for a speakeasy across the street. All of which begs an answer to the second of the two questions Atherton is perennially asked: is he in danger of spreading himself too thin? Inevitably, I guess, but the trick is to find chefs who instinctively know what he wants, for each of his satellites, and to keep them happy. He has a scheme for Andy Walsh, a young Irish chef doing precise wonders at Esquina, which gives him a 10% profit share. His chefs in Hong Kong and London are on the same incentive once the restaurants have earned back their investment. &quot;I feel like the bloke who did Dolly the Sheep,&quot; he says at one point. &quot;We clone them and we put them in a box and we ship them out. It&apos;s like Madagascar 3, crates of chefs marked fragile.&quot;            Atherton will have to find a few more crates yet. Three other London properties are planned for this year or next. A collaboration with the ultimate concept man Ian Schrager in the now defunct Berners Hotel; a City Social satellite of his deconstructed Pollen Street concept in Tower 42; and perhaps something in the old Bow Street Magistrates building in Covent Garden. Only a few places are beyond the pale. He was recently approached to do something in Moscow. (&quot;I have no desire even to visit.&quot;) Likewise Tokyo: too many great restaurants already. Otherwise, the world still seems a newly shucked oyster. Looking at that world through the eyes of a chef like Atherton is a curious thing. Cities become not so much multi-faceted metropolises as the home to places you can buy food. &quot;When we are not working in restaurants we are eating in restaurants,&quot; Atherton says, and in my time with him this seems literally true. In Singapore he takes his chefs for spicy crab at the beach on their Sunday lunch off; in Hong Kong we visit the cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant in the world, the dim sum canteen Tim Ho Wan. In Dubai he checks out, and loves, La Petite Maison, and puts his head round the door of the outpost of Wheelers, to which Marco Pierre White has given his name, which is all but empty. And all the time he seems to be thinking, sniffing, tasting opportunities. In his efforts to coolly colonise the world, one site-sensitive neighbourhood tapas bar at a time \u2013 &quot;we are not into concepts, we are not fucking TGI Friday&apos;s&quot; \u2013 it seems he is not alone. One night, on our way between Esquina in Singapore and his bar over the road (which requires a password to enter, and in which a Buddhist cocktail impresario serves drinks in miniature wooden dhows), Atherton meets Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, another graduate of El Bulli. Andr\u00e9s is puffing on a big cigar, and also covertly looking for new opportunities. Outside 22 Ships in Hong Kong, Atherton runs into Alvin Leung, the so-called Demon Chef, who has just exported his &quot;extreme fusion&quot; cooking to London. They talk of cities not yet on the international restaurant radar, Rangoon, Bangkok, Manila. There is, Atherton suggests later as we wait for a plane, hardly a departure lounge in which he does not meet one Michelin star or another, all scenting possibilities in the global foodie air. A few days after we return, I look in on Atherton in Pollen Street Social. After the spin of the previous week he seems relieved to be grounded. Before an impeccable lunch he shows me around with pride and joy. The kitchen in which all the carrots, and everything else, are facing the right way, the dessert bar, and the Buccleuch beef ageing behind glass. Downstairs is his office, in a corner of the prepping kitchen, no bigger than a Skegness caravan bedroom. He doesn&apos;t have a PA, so he runs his mini-empire from here by email. What you&apos;ve got to remember, he says, not for the first time, is that, &quot;we are just a bunch of guys cooking food and having fun&quot;; and the thing is, he still just about believes it.

Williams will make one of sport&apos;s unlikelier returns on Tuesday after being picked on the wing against the ACT Brumbies in Canberra alongside fellow replacements Christian Wade, Brad Barritt and Billy Twelvetrees. Not since a 41-year-old Colin Cowdrey walked out to bat for England at the Waca in 1974-75 has there been an Australian tour comeback to match this one. The 36-year-old Williams, who scored 58 Test tries in an outstanding career, has been playing club rugby in Japan for the Mitsubishi Dynaboars but retired from international rugby 18 months ago and was due to be working this week as a radio pundit for the radio station Talksport. He has been summoned for one game only but this is no predictable, run-of-the-mill tour. The Lions are hunting for a left wing for Saturday&apos;s Test because George North is highly doubtful with a hamstring problem and Tommy Bowe is recovering from a broken bone in a hand. With Jamie Roberts out of the Brisbane Test, and possibly the tour, after injuring a hamstring in the 47-17 win over the NSW Waratahs and Manu Tuilagi recovering from a shoulder problem, the Lions management have now called up eight replacements with the tour only at the halfway stage. Williams could barely believe it when the Lions assistant coach Rob Howley phoned him in Tokyo. &quot;I am more shocked than you are,&quot; he told Talksport listeners. &quot;I will give 100% effort and commitment and do whatever it takes to help the team out. I don&apos;t feel my age and I feel fresh. If I had any doubt that I wasn&apos;t capable or good enough I&apos;d have said no. There is no way I would let the Lions down.&quot; Gatland is also confident that Williams, who toured with the Lions in 2005 and 2009, will be fit enough to make a valuable contribution, even if it does prove to be for one night only. &quot;You can never rule out something 100% but at the moment he only comes in for that game. &quot;Christian Wade is coming over and Tommy Bowe is not far away. It is one of those situations where we have players who have small knocks and niggles and will probably look to come back at the same time. If I&apos;ve made the wrong call you can have a crack at me.&quot; It remains to be seen whether Roberts&apos;s absence proves a major blow, although Gatland insisted the centre&apos;s injury would not &quot;change the way we are going to play&quot; or wreck his unbeaten squad&apos;s chances of a series victory. &quot;I think we&apos;ve got a strong squad and if we do pick up one or two injuries there are a lot of people capable of coming in and doing a job for us. We&apos;re in a good place. &quot;It was interesting talking to a few of our players last night after the game. They were talking to a few of the Waratahs who said Australia are in for a tough match next week. We&apos;re a little bit hardened up now and there&apos;s confidence in the squad. We have players with experience of playing southern hemisphere teams and a lot of them are feeling good about themselves. We feel that physically we&apos;re in good shape, we&apos;re big, we&apos;re powerful and we play some good rugby.&quot; Gatland also suggested that losing to the Brumbies would not be a disaster \u2013 &quot;No one is going to remember if we win all the other matches and lose the Test series&quot; \u2013 while Tom Croft made clear the Lions are hell-bent on winning their first series anywhere since 1997. &quot;We&apos;re not going to be bullied as a side,&quot; said the Leicester flanker, one of a number of stand-out performers in a physical contest with the Waratahs. &quot;We are not going to start taking backward steps because bigger boys are pushing and throwing punches.&quot; The Welsh centre Jonathan Davies, in line to replace Roberts in the Test side, is similarly motivated. &quot;There is an opportunity now to make sure we create history because it has been a long time since we won a series.&quot; South Africa 2007 World Cup-winning coach, Jake White, now in charge of the Brumbies, was among those impressed by the Lions&apos; efforts in Sydney, where the full-back Leigh Halfpenny contributed 30 points, the highest tally by any Lions player in Australia. &quot;This is a good Lions side, a really talented and well-prepared Lions side and we have no illusions what&apos;s awaiting us,&quot; said White.

It is not so much that the hosts currently occupy top spot on the Super 15 ladder as the fact that half of the Lions&apos; back division were still watching this tour from other continents as recently as two days ago. No wonder Shane Williams used the word &quot;surreal&quot; as he tried to articulate his feelings about his unlikely Lions recall, having answered an emergency call to plug the injury-related gaps in Warren Gatland&apos;s midweek side. &quot;It has been a crazy 24 hours,&quot; confirmed the former Wales international, who flew into Sydney from Tokyo via Hong Kong on Monday. &quot;The flight has come and gone and all of a sudden I&apos;m training with the British &amp; Irish Lions. After [the assistant coach] Rob Howley phoned me I just lay on my back most of the night just thinking: &apos;Did that really happen?&apos;&quot; Now 36 and playing second-tier club rugby in Japan, Williams also confessed to finding the Lions&apos; short, sharp pre-match training session hard work physically before he clambered aboard yet another plane to the Australian capital. What struck him even more forcibly was the collective desire of this squad to go home as series winners, a goal which will feel even more achievable if the Lions can retain their tour unbeaten record. According to the returning Lion, who scored a memorable try in the third Test win against South Africa in Johannesburg in the summer of 2009, it is the Wallabies who should be anxious. &quot;You can sense the hunger in the management and certainly in the players. &quot;They seem a lot more focused and more confident in each other&apos;s ability. Just running alongside them today, there is almost like an arrogance running off them that they believe they can win this series. That&apos;s great to have. Sometimes these tours are won mentally rather than physically and they are in a strong mental place at the moment.&quot; It has also clearly been a joy to fetch up in the same team as another winger who explodes the argument that rugby is solely a game for giants. Christian Wade, summoned along with Williams and Brad Barritt as cover for the injured Tommy Bowe, Jamie Roberts, Manu Tuilagi and George North, has rare pace and Williams, for one, is looking forward to watching him use it. &quot;I doubt they are going to be sending us up on any crash balls but I enjoy watching him. He is a player that excites me and I have had many discussions with [the Wasps assistant coach and former Wales fly-half] Stephen Jones about this guy. He just enjoys taking defenders on, and that&apos;s great to see in the modern game. Maybe we will bring a little bit of diversity to the team. He could score six tries tomorrow and be starting on Saturday. That&apos;s the great thing about the Lions.&quot; No sooner have the cavalry turned up, however, than the battered original troops are showing signs of improvement. Roberts (hamstring) and Bowe (broken bone in a hand) are effectively out of contention for the first Test but Tuilagi (damaged nerve in his neck) and North (hamstring) have yet to be completely ruled out. North was able to do a series of controlled shuttle runs at training on Monday and the team doctor, James Robson, was able to give a more upbeat bulletin. &quot;The guys we have got coming back now will be in contention for this weekend,&quot; he said. &quot;If we get over the midweek game we suddenly have a wealth of riches. I am certainly not losing sleep. If this was a club we wouldn&apos;t be seeing any headlines. I was alarmed [about the volume of injuries] after 2009 but, overall, we have come back from that brink. I do believe that rugby has made a bigger effort.&quot; The Brumbies head coach Jake White, meanwhile, believes the current Lions are a superior team to the one which lost narrowly to his native South Africa four years ago. &quot;I think this is a really special Lions team. If you compare this side to the 2009 side, this side is much better. &quot;When I was coaching the Springboks we got to the [2007] World Cup final and we had 649 Test caps. To put that in perspective we&apos;re playing a Lions team with 580 caps, while we&apos;ve got Peter Kimlin with two caps and Clyde Rathbone with 26.&quot; The only non-Test sides to have beaten the Lions since 1997, furthermore, are Australia A in 2001 and the NZ Maori in 2005. White, however, still has a decent side, with Jesse Mogg one to watch at full-back. The Lions do not possess their hosts&apos; sense of familiarity but their back-row of Sean O&apos;Brien, Justin Tipuric and Toby Faletau will take some stopping. The Brumbies reckon it would make a decent Test unit and are particularly wary of O&apos;Brien. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to single out players because they&apos;ve got so much talent but one chap for me is O&apos;Brien,&quot; said White. &quot;He&apos;d make most other teams \u2026 he&apos;s a fantastic player.&quot; ACT Brumbies: J Mogg; H Speight, T Kuridrani, A Smith, C Rathbone; M Toomua, I Prior; R Smith, S Siliva, S Sio, L Power, S Carter, S Fardy, C Faingaa, P Kimlin (capt).

The mobile game is Where&apos;s My Mickey?, which is the latest in Disney&apos;s series of Where&apos;s My games. The franchise first launched in September 2011, and notched up more than 100m downloads in its first year. Where&apos;s My Mickey is being released for iOS, Android and Windows Phone simultaneously, with more than 100 physics-puzzle levels spread across five chapters, and the promise of cameo appearances from Pluto, Goofy and other Disney characters. It&apos;s setting the scene for the new cartoon-shorts series, titled Mickey Mouse, which will make its debut on the Disney Channel network on 12 July. The series is aimed at 6-14 year-old children, as well as their families, with its global ambitions shown by Disney&apos;s decision to set episodes in cities including New York, Paris, Beijing, Tokyo and Venice. Disney says the style harks back to the original 1930s Mickey Mouse cartoons, while the scenery will be inspired by cartoons from the 1950s and 1960s. There is plenty of modern talent involved in creating the new series, though, with creatives drawn from shows including Star Wars: Clone Wars, SpomgeBob SquarePants, Dexter&apos;s Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls. Disney is hoping to reach children through multiple screens with the new shorts, which will be made available on the Disney.com website and Watch Disney video-on-demand site.            The new cartoons and game come as Disney tries to ensure its most famous characters remain relevant for children who are growing up with apps like Angry Birds, Talking Tom Cat and Cut the Rope, as well as virtual worlds like Moshi Monsters and Bin Weevils. All these brands have expanded beyond their digital origins to sell merchandise and other physical products, representing a challenge to companies like Disney. Just this week, Angry Birds maker Rovio announced an expansion of its licensing deal with Hasbro to make toys and physical games based on its games, including the Angry Birds Star Wars game that \u2013 in a neat twist \u2013\u00a0is based on a film franchise now owned by Disney. That said, Disney has been learning fast. The company partnered with Talking Tom Cat&apos;s creator Outfit7 on a series of webisodes that generated more than 100m views on YouTube, for example. Meanwhile, the first Where&apos;s My Water? mobile game was an attempt to make a mobile star of a brand new Disney character, Swampy the alligator, before taking him into the world of webisodes and consumer merchandise. Now the lessons learned from Swampy are being deployed by Disney in support of its most famous character, Mickey Mouse."}, {"sentences": ["The news of the threatened closure of institutions which preserve our industrial and cultural heritage is particularly ironic, given that it follows shortly on the heels of the prime minister announcing his strong backing for the creation of a London-based Margaret Thatcher Museum and Library, at a cost of \u00a315m.Peter Scott Professor of international business history, Henley Business School at the University of ReadingEtsuo ABE Meiji University in TokyoAlison Bancroft Queen Mary, University of LondonBernardo Batiz-Lazo Professor of business history and bank management, Bangor UniversityMark Billings University of ExeterRegina Lee Blaszczyk Professor of business history, University of LeedsAlan Booth Professor of history, University of ExeterDavid Boughey Associate professor &amp; associate dean, University of Exeter Business SchoolMartin Campbell-Kelly University of WarwickJohn Chartres Emeritus professor of social &amp; economic history, University of LeedsMartin Chick University of EdinburghD&apos;Maris Coffman Director, Centre for Financial History, University of CambridgeBill Cooke Professor of management and society, Lancaster University Management SchoolRichard Coopey University of AberystwythStephanie Decker Aston Business SchoolNeil Forbes Professor of international history, Coventry UniversityDave Goodwin David J Jeremy Emeritus professor of business history, Manchester Metropolitan UniversityJohn Killick University of LeedsKatey Logan Business Archives CouncilPeter Lyth Nottingham University Business SchoolNiall MacKenzie University of StrathclydeMairi Maclean Professor of International Management and Organisation Studies, University of Exeter Business SchoolChristine MacLeod Josephine Maltby  Professor of Accounting and Finance, University of York Ian Martin Senior Lecturer in Business Information Technology, Leeds Metropolitan UniversityRory Miller University of Liverpool Management SchoolRobert Millward Professor emeritus of economic history, University of ManchesterPeter Miskell Henley Business School at the University of ReadingSimon Mollan University of Liverpool Management SchoolStephen L Morgan Professor of Chinese Economic History, University of NottinghamSimon Mowatt Associate professor of management, AUT University, New ZealandLucy Newton Henley Business School at the University of ReadingRichard Noakes Senior lecturer in history, University of ExeterDerek J Oddy Emeritus professor of economic and social history, University of WestminsterBrian O&apos; SullivanDavid Paulson University of CambridgeAndrew Perchard University of Strathclyde Business SchoolAndrew Popp University of Liverpool Management SchoolMichael Pritchard De Montfort UniversityMichael Rowlinson Professor of organization studies, Queen Mary, University of LondonPhilip Scranton Professor, hstory of technology and science, Rutgers University, USAKevin D Tennent University of YorkSteven Tolliday (University of Leeds), past president, Business History ConferenceSteven Toms Professor of accounting, joint editor, Business History, University of LeedsDavid Walker Scottish Oral History Centre, University of StrathclydeJames Walker Professor, Henley Business School at the University of ReadingMaggie Walsh Emeritus professor of American economic &amp; social history, University of NottinghamPeter Wardley Head of history, University of the West of EnglandDeborah Woodman University of Salford &amp; HuddersfieldJudith WrightChris Wrigley Emeritus professor of modern British history, Nottingham University \u2022 This article was amended on 19 June 2013."], "tags": ["Museums", "Culture", "Science", "Rail transport", "Transport", "UK news", "Science", "Media and film studies", "Education", "Media", "Engineering"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-18T20:02:00Z", "title": "Letters: Northern museums", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jun/18/northern-museums-concern-threatened-closure", "article": "We are concerned at the threatened closure of the northern &quot;national&quot; science museums: Manchester Museum of Science and Industry, the National Railway Museum, York, and the National Media Museum, Bradford (Report, 5 June).

The object of their desire is Sugamo&apos;s famed shio daifuku. The heavy, glutinous patties of pounded rice containing salted, rather than the usual sweetened, bean paste are the perfect accompaniment to an afternoon cup of green tea. The sweets are perhaps the one guilty pleasure that elderly shoppers here will own up to in a diet that is otherwise faultless in its simplicity, not to mention its commendable lack of transfats and refined sugar. Diet is part of the reason for Japan&apos;s impressive longevity, exemplified by Jiroemon Kimura, the world&apos;s oldest person until his death last week at the age of 116. For Michiko Ono, an 82-year-old from Tokyo, accompanying her daughter on a shopping expedition, the day begins with an unusually carbohydrate-heavy meal of white rice with a raw egg cracked into it, an unbuttered bread roll and the first of several cups of green tea. The Japanese originally drank green tea, or ocha, for strictly medicinal purposes, convinced that it lowered blood pressure, aided digestion and prevented certain cancers. Green tea consumption is in decline among younger Japanese, but the drink still looms large in the diet of their grandparents and great-grandparents. &quot;I drink about six cups a day,&quot; says Masaru Nishimori, 85, who is sitting in the shade of Koganji temple while he waits for his wife to return from the shops. In the afternoon, Nishimori will allow himself to veer from his otherwise strict regimen of two modestly sized meals a day with a snack of tea and rice crackers or, if he is feeling particularly reckless, a Japanese-style sweet. The retired hospital administrator describes himself as practically a vegetarian and credits his perfect health to very rare dalliances with meat, and then only a single stick of grilled yakitori chicken. &quot;If I could point to one thing that has kept me healthy all these years, it would be the lack of meat in my diet,&quot; he says, although giving up alcohol and smoking at the age of 25 can&apos;t have done him any harm. Ono, a lifelong non-drinker and non-smoker, isn&apos;t quite as abstemious when it comes to meat. She likes pork, but only lean, thin slices mixed with bean sprouts and other vegetables. Like Nishimori, most of her protein comes from grilled fish: for her, oily arabesque greenling; for him, Pacific saury or sardines. Aside from rice and green tea, the octogenarians share other perennials in their diets: miso soup, drunk regularly but in small quantities due to its high salt content, and nimono, a low-calorie dish of vegetables simmered in mirin, soy sauce and cooking sake. Neither has suffered a serious illness and both deal with the Tokyo heat and humidity with far more poise than I do. &quot;When I go for my annual checkup, my doctor sends me away with the same words every time: &apos;There&apos;s nothing wrong with you,&apos;&quot; Nishimori says. &quot;The only physical problem I have right now is a slightly crooked front tooth.&quot; Michiko Ono&apos;s menu  Breakfast (6:30am) Boiled white rice mixed with raw egg; bread roll; green tea.

But when Bernanke laid out a timetable on Wednesday night for cutting off the Fed&apos;s bond purchases by mid-2014, his words prompted a violent sell-off, which began in New York after European markets were closed, and ricocheted around the world on Thursday, from Tokyo to Istanbul and Oslo to Jakarta. In London, the 2.98% decline in the FTSE 100 index was the steepest since September 2011. Elsewhere in Europe, shares suffered their biggest one-day fall in 19 months, with Spain&apos;s Ibex losing 2.9%, and the German, French and Italian markets all down by more than 3%. The slide on Wall Street resumed when US markets reopened on Thursday. After heavy selling throughout the day the Dow Jones closed down 2.3%. &quot;We&apos;ve had a market that for some years has been addicted to stimulus, and it&apos;s taken a brave man to say it has to end somewhere,&quot; said Neil Mellor, of BNY Mellon. He added that the true test of whether the US economy was strong enough to cope without QE would come when the prop of cheap money had been removed. &quot;We don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a credible recovery there; we&apos;re peeling back the plaster.&quot; Bond prices also fell worldwide, a trend that will push up borrowing costs for governments and consumers if it is sustained. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England&apos;s outspoken director for financial stability, warned last week that through QE, policymakers had deliberately inflated &quot;the biggest bond bubble in history&quot;. He added that a &quot;disorderly reversion in the yields of government bonds globally&quot; was the greatest risk to financial stability. The yield \u2013 or interest rate \u2013 on British government 10-year bonds jumped to 2.3%, the highest level for more than a year, although it remains low in historical terms. Growing fears of problems in China&apos;s banking sector, as the authorities try to manage the transition from rampant, export-led growth to a more sustainable, consumer-led economic model, also helped stoke investors&apos; alarm. Those concerns sent the price of many commodities \u2013 dependent on Chinese demand \u2013 deep into the red. The price of gold plummeted more than 6% on the day, falling through $1,290 an ounce, down 30% from its peak. Investors who feared that QE would unleash a wave of inflation have taken refuge in the safe haven of the precious metal over the past two years. Silver fell even further, down more than 8% on the day. The cost of a barrel of oil also dropped, by almost $4. Commodity firms were among the biggest fallers on the FTSE, with BHP Billiton down by 4.6%, and mining and trading company Glencore Xstrata down by 4.75%. Bernanke, who looks likely to leave his job at the end of his term next January, was careful to stress that bond purchases would be halted only if the economy continued to improve. But investors nevertheless took his statement as a strong signal that the days of cheap money are coming to an end. &quot;The markets are extrapolating,&quot; said Russell Jones, of Llewellyn Consulting. &quot;The danger for policymakers is that if it continues, and you get a big interest rate shock through the bond markets, and a big equity market shock, that in itself slows the economy down. There comes a time when this sort of reaction becomes self-defeating. We&apos;re not there yet, but if this goes on, it&apos;s a risk.&quot; With bond yields rising and currencies falling across scores of emerging markets, there is also a risk that vulnerable countries, heavily dependent on flows of &quot;hot money&quot; from foreign investors, will be plunged into crisis. In Turkey, where a wave of recent protests has highlighted the political risks for investors, shares closed more than 21% lower than their high last month."}, {"sentences": ["Takaragawa Onsen is in Japan, in the Gunma prefecture, about four hours from Tokyo."], "tags": ["Travel", "Culture", "Japan holidays"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-20T23:33:00Z", "title": "Josh Pyke on Takaragawa Onsen - My favourite place ", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jun/21/josh-pyke-takaragawa-onsen-favourite-place", "article": "Where is your favourite place? Takaragawa Onsen is in Japan, in the Gunma prefecture, about four hours from Tokyo. It&apos;s a traditional onsen, with hot baths fed by natural springs, and a beautiful river running through the centre of the complex. What draws you to it?  It&apos;s the most peaceful place I&apos;ve ever been. Truly a place where you can switch off and clear your mind. The accommodation is the traditional Japanese Ryokan style, and as soon as you set foot in the rooms you feel like you&apos;ve stepped into another world. Tatami mats, rice paper screens, amazing, traditional, locally sourced meals three times a day, and no TV, internet or phone service. Are there particular memories it brings to mind?  The night bathing brings back the most special memories. The mist rises off the river, and off the baths themselves, the stone path ways are lit by lanterns, and it&apos;s silent except for the gentle splash of the water. I remember walking over the bridge that links the accommodation to the baths, wearing the traditional yukata they provide you with, and overlooking the scene just feeling like I was looking at a movie set of the archetypical Japanese scene!     Takaragawa Onsen. Photograph: Flickr/Noriko Puffy    How would you spend your perfect day there? Since the aim is to relax and unwind, you roll off your tatami mats, and start with a beautiful hot breakfast. Stroll down to the baths and spend an hour or two just sitting in the water, exploring the different pools. Head back for a pre-lunch nap, and then enjoy a meal. Head back to the baths, or take a stroll around the grounds which are very wild and mountainous, just beware of the bears that roam the woods! Maybe indulge in another nap, or have some green tea and a read overlooking the river. Have an early dinner, another long bathing session and then to bed, somehow feeling exhausted even though all you done all day is eat, sleep and bathe! Any recommendations if we were visiting? My main recommendation is to spend at least three nights there. I found it hard to relax and let everything go on the first day, and whilst I reckon I was getting into the groove of full-on down time by the second day, it wasn&apos;t until the third day and night that I felt I really embraced the notion of doing nothing and found myself totally unwinding. It was the most relaxed I&apos;ve ever been! \u2022 Josh Pyke&apos;s new album The Beginning And The End Of Everything is out on 5 July through Ivy League records, and he is touring nationally through August and September"}, {"sentences": ["Last year Ted Baker opened six stores abroad, including Beijing, Tokyo and New York&apos;s Fifth Avenue, bringing its global tally to 110 outlets."], "tags": ["Retail industry", "Business", "Fashion", "Life and style", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-21T19:12:59Z", "title": "Ted Baker sales soar 31% on back of flair for fun and fashion", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/21/ted-baker-sales-soar-ray-kelvin", "article": "Ray Kelvin was 11 when he started helping out at his uncle&apos;s clothing shop in Enfield. Aged 33, he opened his own shop selling shirts in Glasgow. Today the fashion entrepreneur presides over one of the great success stories of the British high street, exporting his sharp suits and jewel-coloured dresses to more than a dozen countries and earning revenues of \u00a3255m. Ray Kelvin is not a household name, but his quirky brand alter ego has crept into the UK&apos;s smartest high streets and swishest department stores \u2013 Ted Baker. If he were real, Ted might manage a wry smile. Sales soared by 31% in the five months to June compared with last year, the company announced on Thursday, pushing its stock price up \u00a32.30 to \u00a317 \u2013 just enough to buy an itty-bitty paisley pocket handkerchief in the summer sale. The city is swooning over the retailer&apos;s &quot;relentless focus on the product&quot;, cost control and on-trend womenswear. &quot;You won&apos;t get many companies doing plus-30% sales growth in this environment, especially when they are predominantly UK focused,&quot; Alistair Davies at Oriel Securities said. &quot;It is an excellent trading statement.&quot; If Ted Baker has thrived, while rivals such as French Connection have lost their way, this is much to do with the idiosyncratic vision of Kelvin, whose business cards describe him as &quot;the closest man to Ted&quot;. Kelvin, a camera-shy Londoner, says the idea for the brand came to him while he was out fishing. Since setting up that Glasgow shirt business 25 years ago, he has earned an estimated fortune of \u00a396m, according to the Sunday Times rich list, and catapulted into the fashion aristocracy. But Kelvin, who avoids having his face photographed by posing behind artfully-placed props, never wanted to give the business his name. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to use my real name,&quot; he told Vogue in a rare interview last month. &quot;I thought I&apos;d be a failure. I could have gone bankrupt, then my name would have always been associated with a failed company. I&apos;m camera-shy too, that sort of thing isn&apos;t what I&apos;m about. Also, I&apos;m ugly \u2013 I don&apos;t want to see my picture everywhere. I&apos;m funny though, which helps.&quot; Kelvin&apos;s ironic humour permeates the brand, which has diversified into womenswear, shoes, children&apos;s clothes, accessories, perfume, bedding, mobile phones, glasses and now a chain of old-school gents&apos; barbers in London. &quot;Ted Baker is successful because it has a strong brand identity and brand personality which is rooted in the founder Ray Kelvin&apos;s own quirky nature,&quot; observes Karinna Nobbs, senior lecturer in fashion branding and retail strategy at the London College of Fashion. &quot;Ted Baker communicates its brand to a very high standard and with a British point of view and sense of humour.&quot; This tongue-in-cheek style comes across at Ted Baker&apos;s flagship London store, located on a quiet cobbled street in Covent Garden near discreet designer shops, rather than alongside M&amp;S and Boots on the crowded main drag. Lurid pink wellies or bow ties in school-uniform stripes shout out for attention, alongside fashionable pastel jackets, sequinned skyscraper heels and holiday T-shirts. And unlike the identical white box shops of its rivals, every Ted Baker store is different. The Ted Baker shop that opened in Kuwait last month \u2013 making eight in the Middle East \u2013 is all buttoned-up Britishness with an arched eyebrow. A union flag made from London bricks, bakelite telephones and changing room cubicles with suburban front doors contribute to the sense of a brand striving to show it doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously. This fabled attention to detail explains why the brand is so successful in foreign markets, thinks Nobbs. &quot;It is performing especially well in the traditionally difficult to crack northern American markets.&quot; Sales were up 59% in the US and Canada last year, and 65% in Asia, albeit from a low base. Last year Ted Baker opened six stores abroad, including Beijing, Tokyo and New York&apos;s Fifth Avenue, bringing its global tally to 110 outlets. But the bulk of the business is still in the UK, with 181 shops and concessions. Given the difficulties on the high street, this makes last year&apos;s 11% sales growth all the more remarkable \u2013 not least because Ted Baker does not sell its products at throwaway, Primark-style, prices. It is \u00a329 for a plastic i-pod case and \u00a399 for a floaty summer top \u2013 albeit one made with organic cotton and recycled polyester. &quot;The Ted Baker customer wants good quality pieces which can be worn for more than one season,&quot; says Nobbs. &quot;The fashion is not directional or edgy but it is confidently on trend and this is valued by its loyal customers.&quot; The typical shopper is aged 20-40, she says, although products such as the &quot;ikon shopper&quot; \u2013 \u00a329 bow-festooned bags in a variety of sweetshop colours \u2013 are used by all ages. &quot;It is a bit daring, not very classic,&quot; 31-year old screenwriter Mihaela Manea says as she leaves Ted Baker&apos;s Covent Garden store with a bold floral print dress and two pairs of trousers snapped up in the sale. At the start of this year, sales of womenswear \u2013 overseen by director Catherine Scorey \u2013 overtook menswear for the first time, delighting city analysts. &quot;It is becoming more of a womenswear business than a menswear business,&quot; says Freddie George at Cantor Research. &quot;The menswear side is more quirky, it is more geared to a particular type of customer, whereas the womenswear has a mainstream-type appeal so it is a broader market.&quot; &quot;They are doing well, there is no question,&quot; he says. However, George reckons the shares are overvalued, riding on the coat tails of a bull market. &quot;At the moment the stock seems to be going onwards and upwards but there has to be a point [when] it is going to come off quite aggressively at some stage.&quot; For now, the sound of ringing tills is keeping everyone happy. Kelvin muses about opening a hotel in that Vogue interview. &quot;There&apos;s nothing in the plan, but who knows? I just want to continue this journey and do more of the same, but better.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["110 mins The Iranian auteur turns in an ambiguous study of an encounter between a college-age Tokyo call-girl and an elderly academic."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-22T05:00:13Z", "title": "World War Z, Before Midnight, Spike Island: this week's new films", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/22/this-weeks-new-films", "article": "World War Z (15) (Marc Forster, 2013, US/Mal) Brad Pitt, Mireille Enos, James Badge Dale. 116 mins In the end, the much-reported delays, reshoots and overspend have at least resulted in a watchable disaster epic, even if this brings little to the zombie apocalypse party save for a huge guest list.

Meanwhile a grandmother is reduced to a series of plaintive voice-mail messages, and a neighbour talks of her thwarted desires to become a wife. Unfolding at an unhurried, observational pace (which crucially never provokes impatience) this is an intriguing, elliptical affair, the emphasis on reflective surfaces (and off-screen voices) reminding us that we are only ever seeing an opaque refraction of the whole picture. The recurrent mistaken identity motif is employed to subtle effect, with every character seeing only as much they choose, each telling a version of their own story. Masks are donned, roles played (and reversed), lives intersected. Like so much of Kiarostami&apos;s work, the further away from it one gets, the more it seems to mean; his real skill, perhaps, is in making the profound appear lightweight, its gravitational pull noticeable only during the escape trajectory."}, {"sentences": ["In a day of tribute to Jonathan Harvey, who died last year, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and conductor Ilan Volkov gave the UK premiere of 80 Breaths from Tokyo (2010)."], "tags": ["Benjamin Britten", "Classical music", "Music", "Festivals", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-22T23:05:50Z", "title": "Gloriana; 66th Aldeburgh festival \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/23/gloriana-britten-66th-aldeburgh-festival-review", "article": "Britten&apos;s Gloriana, written to honour the coronation of Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II, was a flop at its Covent Garden premiere in 1953. An unfortunate attempt to revive it \u2013 a decade later on the composer&apos;s 50th birthday \u2013 coincided with the assassination of JF Kennedy. Despite Opera North&apos;s excellent production in 1992, this queasy study of the ageing Elizabeth I, and her infatuation with the young Earl of Essex, has always seemed blighted. For Britten&apos;s centenary, as well as the diamond jubilee of the coronation, the Royal Opera has dared attempt a new staging, already seen in Hamburg, by Richard Jones. Back in the 1950s the fear was that Britten had created a grim operatic almanac for the new queen&apos;s reign: foolish or recalcitrant courtiers, unrequited crushes on young lords in yellow hose and the humiliation of being caught sans wig by the object of your desire. Today, royal hair and marbles intact, no such insult or confusion is possible. As if to prove the point, on Thursday \u2013 the day the curtain rose on Gloriana \u2013 the Queen made history as the first monarch to win the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot. Or her horse did. Equestrianism features in Gloriana too, but only with a rather tame joust at the start between two pretty young nobleman with nice ankles. Thanks to a strong ensemble cast led by Susan Bullock and Toby Spence and conducted by Paul Daniel, the production is a roaring success, even if the work itself remains a dodo. Jones is the ideal choice of director, bringing tenderness to intimate moments, splendour to the grand choruses and extensive pageantry. His suburban Tudorbethan Falstaff, currently triumphing in its Glyndebourne revival, might have been a dry run for the world he and his designer Ultz create here. The action, if such it can be called, happens as an am-dram play in a 1950s village hall, two Elizabethan eras merged into one in crazed mirror image. Our newly crowned monarch, evidently on a royal visit, walks past in &quot;La Cigale&quot; Dior-style dress, attended by a mayor and half a corporation. Prize marrows and a group of handbell enthusiasts convey notions of postwar modesty and aspiration. Locals in brown overalls, tweeds and woollies watch this enactment of merrie England, when armadas were seen off and men wore tights. All is furnished \u2013 or &quot;besprent&quot; as the dire cod-Elizabethiana text by William Plomer might have it \u2013 with bright, toy colours and visual wit. It&apos;s a wonder Britten didn&apos;t return the entire libretto to sender. The sample line &quot;Your plainings I can ne&apos;er refuse&quot; is plum Plomer, and can anyone really sing &quot;supersedeth&quot;? In words that make Wagner&apos;s views on German nationhood seem more benign, Plomer described Elizabeth I&apos;s golden fame as &quot;part of our racial memory, part of every educated or part-educated Englishman&apos;s conception of our national character and destiny&quot;. As a part-educated Englishwoman, I suggest trying that one out in thine local Tesco. As with Britten&apos;s Albert Herring, Gloriana has stopped appearing out of date and ripened into history. It is better for it. There&apos;s wonderful music, as well as superb performances from Bullock (at her best), Spence (worth the ticket just to see his smiling frolicks and let&apos;s not mention his legs), Patricia Bardon, Mark Stone, Kate Royal, Clive Bayley and everyone else, including chorus and orchestra. See it on Monday 24 June in cinemas. Tonight, the festival Britten founded with his partner, the tenor Peter Pears, ends in Snape Maltings with his most popular work, The Young Person&apos;s Guide to the Orchestra, as well as the last of this year&apos;s commissioned premieres (by Wolfgang Rihm) \u2013 a key feature of the 66th Aldeburgh festival, which has honoured Britten rather than genuflected. In a day of tribute to Jonathan Harvey, who died last year, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and conductor Ilan Volkov gave the UK premiere of 80 Breaths from Tokyo (2010). This delicate, Buddhist-inspired work, complete with glass chimes, Taiwan temple bowls and electronics, explored Zen breathing via elements of repetition. The premiere of Charlotte Bray&apos;s Fire Burning in Snow \u2013 a highlight of BCMG&apos;s Chamber Music Century \u2013 was vividly delivered by mezzo-soprano Lucy Schaufer, who even wore red shoes to match a line in Nicki Jackowska&apos;s poems. Smaller in forces yet towering in impact, Harrison Birtwistle&apos;s Songs from the Same Earth (2013) demands acute concentration. A first hearing, though the crystalline, minimal scoring is immediate in effect, takes us only to the threshold of this 40-minute cycle for tenor and piano. Ten poems, independent yet breathing the same air of memory and melancholy, begin in silence and end with a momentary gleam. The poet is David Harsent, librettist of Gawain and The Minotaur, who would never write &quot;supersedeth&quot; except under a pseudonym. Mark Padmore and pianist Andrew West matched the oscillations of text and music to perfection. All fed into their compelling performance of Schumann&apos;s Dichterliebe \u2013 a pinnacle of German lieder that Britten and Pears performed in the National Gallery in October 1942, when London was being bombed by the Luftwaffe. As if in oblique reminder, a Spitfire swooped low then circled away to invisibility, marking the dramatic start of Peter Grimes on the beach at Aldeburgh, the most talked about event of the season, not least sartorially. (Hoodies are now de rigueur at the opera.) No one present will forget Alan Oke, a noble and poetic Grimes, standing high amid upturned fishing boats, an outsider against the elements, fighting real, gusty winds to be heard. The whole enterprise, written about exhaustively elsewhere, was a feat on the part of director Tim Albery, his technical crew and his fearless singers. Each deserves highest praise for a Peter Grimes like no other. While a chill nor&apos;easterly, as Plomer might have put it, whipped around our ears, we too became part of the action.

The LDP became the biggest single party in the 127-seat Tokyo metropolitan assembly, with 59 seats, up from 39 before the vote. Its coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito, won 23 seats, giving the parties a comfortable majority. The election saw the continued decline of the left-of-centre Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) \u2013 which led the national government just a year ago \u2013 and a surprise resurgence by the Japan Communist party, which drew support from voters who have yet to feel the benefits of &quot;Abenomics&quot; \u2013 Abe&apos;s programme of massive public investment, monetary easing and structural reforms. &quot;We have received a good evaluation of our handling of the government over the past six months,&quot; Abe told reporters. &quot;We would like to do our very best so people can feel that the economy is recovering as soon as possible.&quot; Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, said the result &quot;could not have been better&quot;, describing it as &quot;a blessing from Tokyo&apos;s voters to the Abe government&quot;. The win was the LDP&apos;s biggest in the capital since 2001, when it was led by the popular reformer Junichiro Koizumi. The result has given Abe added momentum as the LDP prepares for upper house elections on 21 July. Victory in that election would give the party control of both houses of Japan&apos;s parliament, the National Diet, ending the political stalemate and giving Abe free rein to press on with his political agenda. Abe, a defence hawk, wants to revise Japan&apos;s constitution to allow its forces to play a more active role overseas, including coming to the aid of the US and other allies under attack. He has also hinted at reassessing Japan&apos;s &quot;masochistic&quot; view of its conduct during the war, a move that would raise tensions with China and South Korea. The rightwing Japan Restoration party, a potential ally in Abe&apos;s push for constitutional reform, lost one of its three seats in the assembly and is expected to struggle in next month&apos;s upper house elections. The Restoration party&apos;s co-leader, Toru Hashimoto, recently sparked a diplomatic storm after claiming that tens of thousands of Asian women forced to work as sex slaves in Japanese military brothels before and during the second world war had been &quot;necessary&quot; to main discipline among troops. Hashimoto has indicated he will resign if his party performs badly next month. The Communists were the chief beneficiaries of a near-record low turnout of 43.5% and the absence of a viable mainstream alternative to Abe&apos;s LDP. &quot;This tells us that the LDP is likely to win the upper house primarily because the opposition is divided and there is no alternative,&quot; Steven Reed, a political science professor at Chuo University in Tokyo, told Associated Press. The Communist party more than doubled its strength in the Tokyo assembly to 17 seats, making it the third-largest party. &quot;We are very happy because voters supported us on the issues we campaigned on,&quot; Kazuo Shii, the party&apos;s chairman, told reporters. &quot;It is important to take on the LDP and offer an alternative.&quot; The election was a disaster for the DPJ, which won the 2009 general election by a landslide on promises to support families and the low-paid, and steer Japan&apos;s foreign policy away from reliance on the US. The party, the biggest in the assembly before Sunday with 43 seats, slumped to 15 seats. &quot;It&apos;s a tough outcome for us, and we humbly accept it,&quot; the DPJ&apos;s former leader, Katsuya Okada, told reporters."}, {"sentences": ["Istanbul is vying with Tokyo and Madrid to host the Games for the first time and had been a frontrunner alongside the Japanese capital before protests broke out earlier this month.", "Avoiding controversy is a key factor for the IOC \u2013 senior sources at the organisation told the Guardian that with every infrastructural problem ahead of the Rio 2016 Games, Tokyo&apos;s chances increased.", "Tokyo&apos;s middle ground of reasonable expense alongside a secure economy could be the preferred option.", "Budgets Istanbul has set aside $19.2bn for its infrastructure costs, dwarfing Tokyo&apos;s $4.9bn and Madrid&apos;s $1.9bn.", "Bid slogans Istanbul Bridge Together Tokyo Discover Tomorrow Madrid Illuminate the Future Transport Istanbul&apos;s major concern is that the IOC will deem their transport system unable to deal with the influx of thousands of spectators to the city, despite their claim that the average journey time for athletes from accommodation to venue will be 16 minutes.", "Tokyo is confident its existing infrastructure, with the majority of commuters using a renowned railway system, is sufficient to host an Olympics.", "History If awarded the Games Tokyo would become only the fourth city to host the Olympics for a second time, having in 1964 staged the event which symbolised Japan&apos;s re-emergence on the international stage after the second world war.", "Madrid has staged a number of high-profile football matches including recent Champions League finals, while Turkey is hosting this year&apos;s Under-20 World Cup and Japan will stage the Rugby World Cup in 2019, for which a new 80,000-seater stadium will be built in Tokyo.", "In Madrid, 27 of the 36 venues already exist, with the Bernab\u00e9u penciled in for the football finals, while Tokyo would build 11 new grounds and have plans in place for a state-of-the-art national stadium.", "Madrid expects to have 50,922 rooms available by 2013 and a further 44,000 within a 50km radius of the city, while Tokyo will not have to build any additional hotels as it already has 83,000 rooms in the city centre."], "tags": ["Olympic Games", "International Olympic Committee", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-24T12:51:04Z", "title": "Istanbul anxious to stay focused on 2020 vision for Olympic Games", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/24/olympic-games-istanbul-turkey", "article": "A sporting event seven years from now may not be the priority for a country in the midst of its biggest political crisis in years, yet while the protests in Istanbul have rocked the country and sent shockwaves across the world, Turkey remains focused on securing the 2020 Olympics.

Then the talk centred around the bid&apos;s slogan &quot;bridge together&quot;, with emphasis on an east meets west mantra that at the time held a poignant resonance. &quot;If the world were a single state, Istanbul would be its capital,&quot; Napoleon once said of a city where the Bosphorus separates Europe and Asia. The bid&apos;s chief, Hasan Arat, used such romantic rhetoric in abundance and played on the historical location of the city, insisting: &quot;This time Turkey is serious about hosting the Games, this time we are ready. Turkey bid four times as an emerging nation, this time Turkey is bidding as an emerged nation.&quot; A youthful and vibrant population (50% of Turkey&apos;s 76 million inhabitants are under 25) was regarded as one of the bid&apos;s key strengths. However, the police&apos;s handling of the recent protests in Taksim Square that began following a peaceful demonstration against the pending redevelopment of neighbouring Gezi Park has caused widespread condemnation. Approximately 5,000 people have been injured during the protests and at least four have died, with police using teargas, rubber bullets and water cannon to dispel those who were initially unhappy that the small inner-city park was to be turned into another shopping centre, with the situation since escalating. In recent years Turkey has been one of the world&apos;s leading economies and the government would argue that its financial strength has been a direct result of the city&apos;s increased commercialisation. Indeed, the bid to stage the 2020 Olympics is extremely impressive. Istanbul&apos;s bid budget for infrastructure is $19.2bn (\u00a312.5bn), compared with Toyko&apos;s $4.9bn and Madrid&apos;s $1.9bn. A significant proportion of that sum will be spent on long-term projects in an attempt to cure the city&apos;s infamous transport problems \u2013 a third bridge over the Bosphorus is under construction, which will be named Olympiat if the bid is successful, as is a rail line under the waterway called the Marmaray Project. A third airport will also have been built by 2020, potentially the biggest in the world. The Ataturk Olympic Stadium, located in the north-west of the city, has been selected as the focal location should the bid be successful. The Olympic village would be built here, next to the stadium that would host track and field events, while seven &quot;clusters&quot; have been planned in a blueprint that would spread the Games across the entire city. Rugby sevens would be staged in Besiktas&apos;s rebuilt football ground, with bid officials quick to point out that teams could kick a conversion from Europe and aim it into Asia. The marathon runners, meanwhile, would cross over a bridge between continents for the first time. Turkey&apos;s culture and tourism minister, Omar Celik, hopes the lure of a first Games in a Muslim country will be appealing to the IOC. &quot;Turkey is an Islamic country but at the same time a western country,&quot; he said. &quot;It is the only Islamic country with a secular structure. When you walk in our streets you see churches, synagogues and mosques side by side.&quot; Yet the IOC must decide whether Istanbul is now a risky option, despite the bid&apos;s clear strengths. Avoiding controversy is a key factor for the IOC \u2013 senior sources at the organisation told the Guardian that with every infrastructural problem ahead of the Rio 2016 Games, Tokyo&apos;s chances increased. Madrid is the outsider for 2020 owing to Spain&apos;s economic problems, although they aim to convince the IOC that a low-budget proposal would bring in much-needed revenue and buy into the commission&apos;s vision for an austere Games. Tokyo&apos;s middle ground of reasonable expense alongside a secure economy could be the preferred option. It lost out to Rio in 2016 but if selected would become only the fourth city to host the Olympics for a second time, having staged the Games in 1964. Their Olympic Stadium will be knocked down and rebuilt with a capacity of 80,000 for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, at a cost of $1bn, while only 11 new venues will need to be built as they look to renew the legacy of the 1964 Games by using existing stadia. Istanbul&apos;s bid team have responded swiftly to the problems in the city, which recently saw a number of people hold a silent vigil in Taksim Square following one man&apos;s decision to stand still for eight hours, facing a portrait of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern, secular Turkey. &quot;The feedback Istanbul 2020 has received from IOC members and the wider Olympic family continues to be positive and very understanding,&quot; bid officials said in a recent statement. &quot;While they are obviously as keen as we are for a swift and peaceful resolution, the majority of people we have spoken to recognise that 2020 is still seven years away.&quot; Ugur Erdener, the president of the Turkish National Olympic Committee, believes the bid can be strengthened by the protests. &quot;The path of a democratic nation is not always an easy one but it is the right one,&quot; he said. &quot;In Istanbul, the voice of progress will be tempered by the voice of tolerance. The bond of our secular democracy, and its responsibility to govern, will be strengthened \u2013 and Istanbul will be an even better host for 2020.&quot; A key test for Turkey will be the Under-20 World Cup that kicked off in Istanbul on Friday. If the tournament runs without any hiccups then the IOC may be convinced that there is no risk associated with the city. Istanbul&apos;s bid is now working full tilt to assure the IOC that the city is capable of staging the Games and argue that there have been a number of recent anti-government protests in Brazil, as well as the London riots before last year&apos;s Olympics. A bid insider told the Guardian: &quot;The IOC is not asking for reassurances but we are providing them anyway. The protests have to be put in perspective. Istanbul is not burning and the people are not against bringing the Olympics here.&quot; Rio&apos;s bid to host the Games in 2016 was boosted because no Olympics had previously been staged in South America. Indeed, London was an outsider for 2012 but Lord Coe&apos;s insistence that &quot;magic would happen&quot; and that a generation would be inspired played a key role in swinging the IOC vote narrowly in their favour. Istanbul has similar emotional pull, but right now, hosting the Olympic Games may be of secondary importance. Budgets Istanbul has set aside $19.2bn for its infrastructure costs, dwarfing Tokyo&apos;s $4.9bn and Madrid&apos;s $1.9bn. It seems an extortionate amount although Turkey claim a significant proportion of that sum will be spent on long-term projects regardless of whether they are awarded the Games or not. Bid slogans Istanbul Bridge Together Tokyo Discover Tomorrow Madrid Illuminate the Future Transport Istanbul&apos;s major concern is that the IOC will deem their transport system unable to deal with the influx of thousands of spectators to the city, despite their claim that the average journey time for athletes from accommodation to venue will be 16 minutes. Tokyo is confident its existing infrastructure, with the majority of commuters using a renowned railway system, is sufficient to host an Olympics. Madrid is similarly positive and says the average athlete&apos;s journey time will be less than 15 minutes. Turkey is considering waiving visa entry costs for tourists during the Games. History If awarded the Games Tokyo would become only the fourth city to host the Olympics for a second time, having in 1964 staged the event which symbolised Japan&apos;s re-emergence on the international stage after the second world war. Madrid has staged a number of high-profile football matches including recent Champions League finals, while Turkey is hosting this year&apos;s Under-20 World Cup and Japan will stage the Rugby World Cup in 2019, for which a new 80,000-seater stadium will be built in Tokyo. Istanbul pulled out of the running for Euro 2020 to focus on the Olympic bid. Games infrastructure Istanbul would have the biggest task in terms of new stadia, as it plans to build 20 venues if awarded the Games. In Madrid, 27 of the 36 venues already exist, with the Bernab\u00e9u penciled in for the football finals, while Tokyo would build 11 new grounds and have plans in place for a state-of-the-art national stadium. Accommodation Istanbul has pledged to have 100,000 hotel rooms in place by 2020, and the fifth most visited city in the world has an inventory of 55,229 rooms. Madrid expects to have 50,922 rooms available by 2013 and a further 44,000 within a 50km radius of the city, while Tokyo will not have to build any additional hotels as it already has 83,000 rooms in the city centre."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Japan believes it has a strong case because it complies with the international convention for the regulation of whaling,&quot; said a foreign ministry official in Tokyo who did not wish to be named.", "&quot;It doesn&apos;t sell in Japan, and I don&apos;t see that changing any time soon,&quot; said Nanami Kurasawa of the Dolphin and Whale Action Network, a Tokyo-based pressure group."], "tags": ["Whaling", "Japan", "Australia news", "Law", "International court of justice", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-25T03:52:00Z", "title": "It's Australia v Japan over whaling in the Antarctic", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/25/australia-japan-whaling-antarctic-challenge", "article": "Australia is hoping to put a permanent end to Japan&apos;s annual slaughter of hundreds of whales in the Southern Ocean, in a landmark legal challenge that begins this week. Australia, a vocal opponent of Japan&apos;s annual &quot;scientific&quot; hunts in the Antarctic, says it is confident that the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague will outlaw the hunts at the end of a highly anticipated case that is due to start on Wednesday. The whaling fleet attempts to kill 935 minke whales and 50 fin whales every year in the Southern Ocean \u2013 which Australia declared a whale sanctuary in 1999 \u2013 amid protests from conservation groups and countries in the region. Australia&apos;s attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said he was confident that the ICJ would ban the hunts before the next expedition begins at the end of this year. &quot;We want commercial whaling to stop and that includes the so-called scientific whaling programme that Japan has been carrying on for many years,&quot; Dreyfus, who will make Australia&apos;s case at The Hague, told reporters. &quot;There&apos;s no appeal from the decisions of the international court of justice. Of course we&apos;re hopeful of getting the result that we want,&quot; he said. Bill Campbell, the Australian agent who will present the opening case against Japan, told the Guardian: &quot;We have taken this case because we believe the whaling being done by Japan is blatantly commercial whaling and is not for any scientific purpose. It is in breach of the international convention. &quot;There&apos;s no higher court than the ICJ. Both Japan and Australia have said that if there&apos;s a decision they will abide by it. We hope they will decide to outlaw it before the next whaling decision. Our focus is whaling in the southern hemisphere. &quot;Japan is the only country in the world who carries on whaling on the basis of scientific research. Norway and Iceland do it on a different basis.&quot; The hearing will end on 16 July and a ruling is expected by the end of the year. Japan is permitted to catch a certain number of whales every winter for research under a clause in the International Whaling Commission&apos;s (IWC) 1986 ban on commercial whaling. Meat from whales caught during the hunts is processed for legal sale in Japanese supermarkets and restaurants. Critics say Japan is using the IWC provision to conduct commercial whaling under the guise of scientific research, adding that the mammals&apos; migratory, reproduction and other habits can be observed without slaughtering them. Japan is expected to challenge the court&apos;s jurisdiction to hear the case, and to insist that its whaling program is purely scientific and so does not violate the IWC ban. &quot;Japan believes it has a strong case because it complies with the international convention for the regulation of whaling,&quot; said a foreign ministry official in Tokyo who did not wish to be named. &quot;Japanese whaling is a lawful activity, conducted in accordance with those international regulations. &quot;Japan&apos;s whaling activities are conducted purely to enhance science for conservation and sustainable use, and we&apos;ll make our case based on those facts.&quot; Japan has killed more than 10,000 whales since the IWC ban went into force in 1986, according to the Australian government. Australia will argue that Japan is in breach of the ban on commercial whaling and of international obligations to preserve marine animals and the marine environment. In written submissions, it has asked the court to withdraw all whaling permits from the Japanese fleet. Don Rothwell, an expert on international laws relating to whaling at the Australian National University, believes Australia will struggle to win the case. &quot;If it was an easy case to make, previous Australian governments would have no doubt explored these options,&quot; he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. &quot;The arguments that Australia will be making are ones that have never before been litigated or decided before by any international court, let alone the international court of justice.&quot; The Antarctic hunts have divided opinion in Japan. While many Japanese believe their country has a right to continue its tradition of hunting and eating the animals, a significant number oppose the Southern Ocean hunts because they rely on huge government subsidies. Japanese activists also point to plummeting consumption of whale meat. &quot;It doesn&apos;t sell in Japan, and I don&apos;t see that changing any time soon,&quot; said Nanami Kurasawa of the Dolphin and Whale Action Network, a Tokyo-based pressure group. According to a recent study by the Nippon Research Group, whale meat consumption has fallen to about 1% of its 1960s peak. Current stockpiles of unsold whale meat have increased to nearly 5,000 tonnes, about four times greater than they were 15 years ago. &quot;Selling meat on the open market has been a total failure,&quot; Kurasawa said. &quot;If the court rules in Australia&apos;s favour, it will be a good opportunity for Japan to stop the Antarctic hunts. It would be the intelligent thing to do.&quot; Japan&apos;s whalers have struggled to meet their quota in recent years amid clashes with the maritime conservation group Sea Shepherd. Earlier this year it returned with a record low catch of 103 minke whales and no fin whales, blaming &quot;unforgivable sabotage&quot; by activists. Japan&apos;s delegation at the ICJ will be led by the deputy foreign minister, Koji Tsuruoka, who is chief negotiator over Japan&apos;s possible participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a region-wide free trade agreement that includes Australia. The foreign ministry official declined to speculate about the outcome of the legal bid, but added: &quot;Japan and Australia have different opinions about whaling, but we enjoy strong bilateral ties and I do not expect the whaling issue to undermine our relationship.&quot; Dreyfus said both countries agreed that the ICJ was the &quot;best place&quot; to resolve their differences over whaling. &quot;Both countries value our strong bilateral relationship and the friendship forged between our nations over many years,&quot; he said."}, {"sentences": ["Apple wins suit against Samsung in Japan on screen effects &gt;&gt; Businessweek  Apple won a patent lawsuit in Japan, as a Tokyo judge ruled that Samsung Electronics smartphones and a tablet computer infringed on its visual effects for touch panels."], "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-25T06:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: Google Mine, mobile app truths, seeking ET, and more", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jun/25/apps-google-mine-et", "article": "A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Style v substance in mobile software &gt;&gt; Mobile Opportunity Michael Mace has been user testing mobile apps:   The most common problem I saw in the tests was users struggling with mobile apps and websites that prioritized beauty over usability.

Or the Corsair Voyager Air wireless hard drive - almost inaccessible from Windows Phone (you can do it with a firmware update and DLNA). Or the Seagate Wireless Plus.

Terrestrial broadcast radio in the United States has successfully lobbied Congress to be exempt from paying the performers of the music (Frank Sinatra used to complain bitterly about this). Pandora is now trying to claim that by having purchased the South Dakota terrestrial broadcast radio station they can pay that royalty without the performer fees paid by Internet Radio.

They made the claims as the IOC published the detailed technical assessment of each of the three cities bidding to host the 2020 Olympics, with Tokyo&apos;s bid receiving the most praise ahead of Istanbul and Madrid. The technical, carefully phrased assessment from the evaluation commission, which visited all three cities earlier this year and is chaired by the British IOC member Sir Craig Reedie, was written before the recent turbulence in Istanbul. The 110-page report is seen as a staging post in the race to host the Games and will form the backdrop to next week&apos;s presentations to the IOC executive board ahead of the final vote in Buenos Aries on 7 September. It was at that presentation that Rio seized the initiative four years ago. Despite not impressing the evaluation team, its presentation and emotional appeal to the IOC impressed voters. All three cities offer &quot;high-quality&quot; bids and present their own &quot;unique approach&quot; to hosting the Games, according to the technical assessment. Tokyo is seen as the favourite in the wake of Istanbul&apos;s troubles, although it is unclear how much impact the instability in Turkey \u2013 and the protests in Brazil before the World Cup and Rio Olympics \u2013 will have on the electorate. The report touches on the financial crisis in Spain, saying the Games are feasible despite the recession. But the language is carefully framed to ensure that the promises made about the economic situation are in the words of the Madrid team rather than the inspectors. While Istanbul must deal with the issues created by the turbulence in the capital, and the political instability it has highlighted, and Madrid must answer questions about the financial crisis, Tokyo must present a compelling &quot;narrative&quot; for its bid. Previous Tokyo bids have failed to impress at the presentation stage. &quot;The Evaluation Commission made sure to produce a report that we feel is an accurate, objective and fair assessment of each of the three candidate cities,&quot; Reedie said. &quot;We are indeed very pleased with the quality of each bid and it is clear that the IOC members will have a difficult choice to make this September in Buenos Aires.&quot; Istanbul is bidding for a fifth time. Tokyo, which hosted the 1964 Olympics, is back for a second consecutive effort, and Madrid is trying for a third straight time. Istanbul would require the most spending and infrastructure work of the three cities, and the IOC report cited potential challenges with construction, traffic and other issues. &quot;This report confirms that Istanbul&apos;s bid is firmly on track,&quot; the Istanbul bid leader Hasan Arat said. &quot;We particularly welcome the IOC&apos;s clear endorsement of Istanbul&apos;s unique strengths. We know that we are at least on an equal footing with others in this race.&quot; Overall, Tokyo received the most glowing marks from the report, which described the Japanese capital as &quot;a modern, dynamic city that sets global trends&quot; and praised its compact venue plans and &quot;one of the most modern and efficient public transport systems in the world&quot;. &quot;I am extremely pleased with the report, which reflects the very positive and productive week we shared with the IOC team,&quot; said Tsunekazu Takeda, IOC member and president of Tokyo 2020 as well as the Japanese Olympic Committee. &quot;We are proud that the report confirms our bid&apos;s very strong technical excellence, which offers certainty in uncertain times for sport. There can be no doubt that we will deliver and offer the IOC a strong partnership.&quot; But while Tokyo are now narrow favourites, the race to host the Games has a habit of throwing up a late twist. London overhauled favourites Paris in 2005 and four years later the emotional pull of the first South American Games in Rio overcame rival bids from Madrid, Tokyo and Chicago. The Istanbul bid had the highest level of public backing, with 83% support among city residents and 76% across Turkey. Madrid was next with 76% in the city and 81% in Spain, with Tokyo trailing with 70% in the capital and 67% in Japan."}, {"sentences": ["In the exhibition Feel &amp; Think: A New Era in Tokyo Fashion, the organisers and curators go a long way to try to get you to consider that question.", "The show is collaboration between the Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation and the National Art School and features installation art works by five Tokyo-based fashion brands who go under a bewildering array of upper and lowercase neologisms including ANREALAGE, mintdesigns, SASQUATCHfabrix, THEATRE PRODUCTS and writtenafterwards.", "The Sydney iteration of the show, originally curated and staged at the Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery, comes under the imprimatur of Dr. Gene Sherman whose SCAF has been responsible for some highly credible and foreword-thinking exhibitions by international artists."], "tags": ["Art", "Fashion", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-26T00:40:00Z", "title": "Do high fashion and art really mix?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/australia-culture-blog/2013/jun/26/high-fashion-art-feel-think", "article": "The meeting of high fashion and art has always been a bit of a problematic idea. They are connected social worlds, alike in so many ways \u2013 not least when it comes to their sense of self-importance \u2013 but it&apos;s never been clear whether art and fashion really mix.  In the exhibition Feel &amp; Think: A New Era in Tokyo Fashion, the organisers and curators go a long way to try to get you to consider that question. The show is collaboration between the Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation and the National Art School and features installation art works by five Tokyo-based fashion brands who go under a bewildering array of upper and lowercase neologisms including ANREALAGE, mintdesigns, SASQUATCHfabrix, THEATRE PRODUCTS and writtenafterwards.  The Sydney iteration of the show, originally curated and staged at the Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery, comes under the imprimatur of Dr. Gene Sherman whose SCAF has been responsible for some highly credible and foreword-thinking exhibitions by international artists. And there are a series of fashion-related events tied to the show, and a very impressive clothbound catalogue/book with a fire engine red cover and many pages with pictures of fabric close-ups, giving the whole thing the vibe of a serious contemporary art show. Fashion is like art, argues Sherman, in her introduction to this catalogue. It is but one of society&apos;s many cultural manifestations and can be analysed and decrypted, perhaps by experts using semiotics, or by laypeople who know what they like, using their taste and discernment. Of course a lot of inflated claims get made for art, so the proof is in the pudding of the actual installations.  In the NAS Gallery the first thing you see is a life-size sculpture of a bull by SASQUATCHfabrix that is made from leather jackets. The installations don&apos;t have titles, just the name of the design houses, but it&apos;s fairly easy to discern what is being said: leather comes from somewhere. In this case, a bull. Next up is a room by writtenafterwards that features a naked mannequin looking through a window into an adjoining room where machinery appears to be operated by a series of adorable stuffed animals \u2013 rabbits, hens, foxes \u2013 who produce bundles of cash. The none-too-subtle message here is that fashion exploits non-humans, ie, factory workers, to make money for airhead fashion slaves who are, after all, as naked as the king.  Upstairs at the NAS Gallery, THEATRE PRODUCTS present a little hut complete with cash register and couture garments with barcodes attached. When the visitor swipes these labels with a handheld reader, a signal is sent to a data projector that plays a pleasing melody with barcode graphics in soothing colours. In the middle of the room is a massive installation of shredded fashion magazines that serve as a bed for an array of mannequins. Wideshortslimlong, the title of ANREALAGE&apos;s artwork, more-or-less describes the visual distortion created by the very wide, or very tall and skinny, mannequins set up in facsimiles of a shop floor.  As to what these three installations might be about I&apos;m not sure. The musical-swiper work is perhaps saying commerce is music to their ears, but as to the other two, all I can say is that when I looked away from the art, nothing remained. It was a pleasing visual experience that evaporated the second I stopped thinking about it.  The more interesting question that is raised by the exhibition is how art and commercial branding go together. It&apos;s the art world&apos;s greatest ideological battlefield, with those who believe that art means something spiritual and political attempting to resist the seductive forces that commodify art into mere product. By placing brands in an art gallery, the curators are asking that fashion be taken seriously as a form of cultural communication. But rather than doing so on its own terms, here fashion becomes a faint and absurd reflection of contemporary art, aping its style without its content. Perhaps I&apos;m overthinking it. With nothing more than nine years of watching various versions of Project Runway (US, Australia, Allstar) I admit I remain a fashion neophyte \u2013 but I wonder if the visual puns and forced playfulness of the installations in Feel &amp; Think is enough to justify putting fashion brands in a gallery. Fashion has the potential to be provocative and fun, stylish and elegant, aspirational and fantastic, but when a frock gets put on a mannequin in an art gallery, its potential dies. That&apos;s because fashion can exist in the world in a way that contemporary art can only dream of. So if fashion and art can mix, it&apos;s probably only through the garb of those attending galleries, rather than the work on show inside them.

The beaming 42-year-old from Tokyo was mobbed by around 100 \u2013 mostly, but not exclusively, Japanese \u2013 fans after beating Alexandra Cadantu, a 23-year-old Romanian, in the second round at Wimbledon. A middle-aged woman clutched an oversized tennis ball to her chest and unashamedly cried. &quot;Maybe older people take a message from her,&quot; said a reporter from one of Japan&apos;s daily newspapers, standing next to me. &quot;Never give up!&quot; The success of Date-Krumm is one of the most inspiring stories of the tournament. Her 6-4, 7-5 victory on Thursday made her the oldest player ever to reach the third round at Wimbledon. Ranked 84 in the world, her excellent all-round performance was an eerie throwback to her heyday in 1996, when she reached the semi-finals on these same grass courts, pushing Steffi Graf to three, tight sets. Not long after that loss, Date-Krumm \u2013 then plain Kimiko Date, world No4 \u2013 retired aged 26. She was not enjoying her tennis and hated the travelling, particularly the unfamiliar cuisines. She ate only Japanese food back then and, without any high-ranked compatriots, she found life on tour lonely and alienating. In 2001 she married the German racing driver Michael Krumm and for more than a decade her only exposure to tennis was coaching kids and commentating on Japanese television. Since her comeback in 2008, Date-Krumm&apos;s matches often feel like watching a player from a different era. She learned the game using a wooden racket in the 1970s and even now her groundstrokes have a flat trajectory, with little of the swirling, dive-bombing spin that modern equipment makes possible. Her metronomic serve does scarcely more than put the ball into play. On Thursday, against Cadantu, the speed gun registered 81mph so often that it seemed there must be a mechanical malfunction. In the early stages of her match, it looked like her age and the sport might be catching up with Date-Krumm. The Romanian is very much a modern player: swishing ponytail; suntan the colour of a teak coffee table; 100mph-plus serve. At the changeovers, Cadantu had a selection of three drinks of different shades, while Date-Krumm sipped from a bottle of Evian, old school. Experience, however, had to count for something. Despite making double the number of unforced errors, and hitting half the number of baseline winners, Date-Krumm invariably won the points that really mattered. At 4-4 in the second set she switched her racket from right to left hand \u2013 she plays right-handed but is naturally a southpaw \u2013 and hit a winning shot down the line. Her net play was instinctive and unerring. Date-Krumm puts down her longevity to renewed motivation from the years away; she also praises Japanese tea and has finally found an appetite for Western food, stuffing carbs into her slim, 5ft 4in frame. She skipped most of the clay-court season to make sure she was fully prepared for Wimbledon. &quot;I tried to focus on the grass,&quot; she explained afterwards. &quot;I have many good memories here. Luckily I didn&apos;t play a seeded player in the first rounds, so I&apos;m very happy.&quot; Her astonishing renaissance may be short-lived, at least at this tournament. In the next round, she faces the 31-year-old Serena Williams, who herself has shown the benefits of judiciously pacing her career and taking the odd sabbatical. Nevertheless, it is not a match that the reigning champion is taking for granted. &quot;I&apos;ve never played her,&quot; said Williams, after beating Caroline Garcia 6-3, 6-2. &quot;But I have so much respect for her. I think she&apos;s so inspiring to be playing such high-level tennis at her age. And she&apos;s a real danger on the grass court, I know that. I definitely will have to be ready.&quot; Asked whether she could see herself matching Date-Krumm&apos;s feats one day, she laughed: &quot;I didn&apos;t see myself playing at 31. I definitely do not see myself playing at 42.&quot; Date-Krumm returned the compliments. &quot;She&apos;s so strong,&quot; she said. &quot;I need to just try my best. I hope I can stay more than one hour, one hour half. It&apos;s very, very difficult to beat her.&quot; The oldest player in the men&apos;s draw, the 35-year-old Tommy Haas, a positive tyro by comparison, was due on court on Thursday against Jimmy Wang, a qualifier from Chinese Taipei. But the start of the match was delayed by late showers; they will try again on Friday."}, {"sentences": ["Essential to the festival&apos;s charm is the use of interesting spaces: this year you can see the Tokyo String Quartet play in an atmospheric church or children&apos;s storyteller David Campbell spinning yarns in a fully functioning potato barn."], "tags": ["Culture", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-29T05:00:22Z", "title": "This week's new events", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jun/29/this-weeks-new-events", "article": "Harrogate International Festival This packed arts festival features an opening performance from soprano Lesley Garrett, plus Michael Palin, Ann Widdecombe and Jeremy Bowen.

Between 2001 and 2003, he held over 200 meetings trying to raise enough capital to start the business. &quot;Cycling&apos;s image problem and its lack of cultural relevance in Britain was a huge issue,&quot; says Mottram. &quot;Cycling was completely under the radar. Added to that, we were proposing to start an e-commerce business selling clothes directly to British men \u2013 almost unheard of at the time. It was very, very difficult raising the money.&quot; A decade on, there must be a few money men ruing the decision not to invest. In 2012, Rapha sold \u00a318m worth of clothing, luggage, books and accessories to an affluent and burgeoning clientele of style-conscious cyclists around the world. There have been creative collaborations with the likes of Paul Smith, a keen cyclist himself, and Timothy Everest. In 2010 the company was included in the Sunday Times Fast Track 100 list. There are now offices in London, the US, Japan, Australia, Germany and Singapore, and permanent shops (called Cycle Clubs) in London and San Francisco. Pop-up shops have appeared in New York, Mallorca and Tokyo. In 2012 Rapha became the provider of Team Sky&apos;s clothing. Not every cyclist is a devotee of Rapha, though. In fact, like Marmite, the company splits opinion within the cycling fraternity. There is an amusing spoof website (&quot;Happy is the new misery: suffering was so 2012,&quot; one page announces). Some think the brand is pretentious, and when you&apos;re selling \u00a3300 cycling shoes made with perforated Yak skin uppers, it&apos;s difficult to duck the accusations of exclusivity. Whatever you think of Rapha, the company&apos;s role in putting a cut of dash back into road cycling is undeniable.     Rapha bicycle clothing company founder Simon Mottram. Photograph: Rex Features    &quot;The reason I started the company was that cycling clothes looked horrible,&quot; Mottram says. &quot;In the 90s, most cycling jerseys looked like an explosion in a paint shop. We had a vision to bring new standards of design to cycling clothing. Riding a bicycle is simple. The aesthetic of the clothes we make reflects that.&quot; The success of Rapha has done much to cement one of the more unlikely stories in the annals of British fashion \u2013 the rise of London as the centre of global cycling style. What began with the &quot;heroin-chic&quot; cycle messenger sub-culture in the late 80s has been crowned by the Mamil (Middle-Aged Man in Lycra), often seen wearing full Rapha. It is a wonder how these men \u2013 and I rank among them \u2013 have collectively overcome the traditional male British fear of shopping and turned cycling into a slavishly stylish pursuit. Stopping at a set of traffic lights on a popular cycling route out of London on a sunny Sunday morning can now feel like being in a\u00a0Ralph Lauren fashion shoot \u2013 hulking, panting, bronzed men dressed in several hundred pounds&apos; worth of mainly black apparel with the odd dash of white and a few pink details, ready to be unleashed on the road. I&apos;ve ridden a bicycle most days of my adult life. I ride to get to work, sometimes for work, to keep fit, to bathe in air and sunshine, to go shopping, to travel, to stay sane, to skip bath time with my kids, for fun, for a moment of grace and to hear my boy laugh. In my late 20s, I abandoned my career and pedalled round the world. Throughout most of my lifelong obsession with bicycles, I was never fastidious about what I wore out riding. From the 1970s, when I used to get my bell-bottom jeans wrapped round the chain rings of my Raleigh Hustler, through the garish DayGlo cycling shirts of my teens to the luminous yellow mountain-biking shorts I wore during the 90s, I never aspired to be the model of cycle chic. Cycling itself was deeply unfashionable. I never cared about what I wore &quot;on the Bummel&quot;. That changed when I rode a bike in Italy for the first time a decade ago. Every cyclist I passed in the Dolomites was meticulously turned out in a co-ordinated outfit. What you wear on the bike is such an important part of cycling culture in Italy, there is even an expression to embody it \u2013 bella in sella, which literally means &quot;beautiful in the saddle&quot;. It struck a chord with me that is still resonating. I&apos;ve since become a complete sucker for cycling fashion. By paying attention to what I\u00a0wear when I&apos;m riding, I feel I&apos;m expressing my respect for the bicycle both as a\u00a0machine \u2013 it&apos;s the most efficient form of human-powered transportation yet devised \u2013 and as an object of simple beauty. It is a machine that blurs the line between sport and art. Getting dressed for a long ride, I now earnestly try to synchronise shorts, shirt, rain jacket, gloves, water bottles, shoes, sunglasses and my helmet with the colour scheme of the bike I plan to ride. It is hopelessly vain. To the consternation of my wife, I&apos;ll lay out four outfits before packing my bike bag. Historically, cycling and style have seldom been bedfellows in Britain. During the 20th century, cycling in Britain was heavily cloaked in pragmatism and pastoralism rather than metropolitan chic. The road- racing scene was hugely undeveloped compared with that on the continent, which helps explain why there were so few British cyclists in the Tour de France until recently. The bicycle was for getting to work during the week and for going youth hostelling in britches with a flask of dandelion and burdock at the weekend. The sport of bicycle racing in Britain was strangled by the convention of Victorian rule makers. It largely consisted of time trials, codified in the 1890s by Frederick Thomas Bidlake, a man with a\u00a0peculiar passion for timekeeping. Competitors set off at intervals to ride alone against the clock, up and down a wind-slapped A-road. It&apos;s duller than crown-green bowling. In Europe massed-start racing (the lore of which Rapha plumbs unashamedly and extensively for marketing purposes) was much more popular. Races entailed breakaways and sprint finishes, chases and crashes, suffering and solidarity, tactics and alliances, co-operation and competition, vanity, honour and style. Massed-start road racing is underpinned by the unwritten etiquette of the peloton, something so complex that not even a Victorian Englishman could codify it into a\u00a0booklet of rules. As the French say of cycle racing: Courir c&apos;est mourir un peu \u2013 to race is to die a little.     Rob Penn wears Vulpine. Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer    Any hint of cycle style in Britain was imported from the continent. After the Second World War, the glittering, lightweight and innovative componentry, the stylish attire and the cyclists with film-star good looks that came out of Italy were like rays of dazzling light in Britain. Even the colours the Italians painted their bicycles \u2013 pearlescent white, yellow, pink, the &quot;heavenly blue&quot; of Bianchi, said to be the colour of the queen of Italy&apos;s eyes \u2013 filled the minds of English yeomen with wonder. Desperate to compete in continental style massed-start road races such as the Tour de France (there were none in Britain at the time), a group of cyclists broke away from the autocratic governing body, the National Cyclists&apos; Union, in the 1950s. The splinter organisation was named the British League of Racing Cyclists, and its rebellious adherents, known as &quot;Leaguers&quot;, distinguished themselves by their modishness, their postwar working-class confidence and their attire. They listened to modern jazz, drank coffee, rode hard and, crucially, looked sharp on the bike. Tim Hilton, in his loving memoir of the mid-20th-century cycling scene, One More Kilometre and We&apos;re in the Showers, wrote: &quot;There was certainly a smart and disobedient look. In the 1950s you could identify a Leaguer by his roadman&apos;s position on the bike, his continental equipment, his preference for derailleur gears, Campag if possible, a\u00a0flashy Italian road jersey and dark glasses.&quot; In some ways the London Mamil is a\u00a0middle-class reincarnation of the long-deceased Leaguer, with a modern twist. For Mottram the recent emergence of the style-conscious British cyclist has coincided with the rise of &quot;metrosexual man&quot;. &quot;There&apos;s a bit of a revolution going on among men,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;re more body conscious, fitter, better toned, able to talk about skincare and more thoughtful about what we wear and how we present ourselves than ever before.&quot;     Rob Penn wears Levi's cycling clothing. Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer    Nick Hussey, the founder of Vulpine, believes the development of British cycle style is also related to the marriage of high-end performance fabrics with the long tradition of excellence in British tailoring. &quot;The essence of British styling is classical with a twist, using good fabrics and good stitching. It&apos;s about creating beautiful, practical clothes that people feel comfortable in. It was inevitable that those qualities would eventually be applied to cycling clothing.&quot; Vulpine started selling technical, casual cycling apparel in 2012, and is already making waves. James Greig, also a designer, previously worked at Chanel while Jools Walker, in charge of sales, is a well-known cycle-style blogger. The Vulpine range has multiplied to more than 30 products and has established itself as the brand of choice for creative professionals who commute across cities by bike.\u00a0&quot;I knew I\u00a0had to make clothes I completely believed in. They had to be authentic and high quality, in the British tradition,&quot; says Hussey. &quot;It&apos;s also helpful to a young company like us that cycling culture is undeveloped. It would be harder to make a noise in, say, Holland, Belgium or France. There is a blank canvas to write on here, and that is attractive to young designers.&quot; Young companies such as Rapha, Vulpine, Quoc Pham, Ana Nichoola and Velobici may be setting the pace of British cycling style, but several older brands such as Brooks, Carradice and Howies are lending their weight, too. Their success has encouraged retail giants such as Levi&apos;s and H&amp;M to manufacture their own ranges of casual cycling clothes for men \u2013 unthinkable a decade ago. &quot;Success in the Tour de France and the Olympics, more commuters, better infrastructure \u2013 the cycling landscape in Britain is changing fast,&quot; says Hussey. &quot;Importantly, once you start riding a bike, you generally stay riding a\u00a0bike. The market is only going to increase.&quot; Mottram adds: &quot;At Rapha, we feel like we&apos;re just in front of a wave. We&apos;re gradually building a reputation as a cycling nation, and London is now the centre of global cycling culture. It is an extraordinary turnaround in 10 years. There are more bicycle-related concepts and retail ideas being born here than in any other city, and a huge number of flowering, small businesses \u2013 amazing when you think it remains one of the worst cities in the world to ride in.&quot; It&apos;s All About the Bike: the Pursuit of Happiness on Two Wheels by Rob Penn (Penguin, \u00a38.99).

Wealthier, Healthier Cities - how climate change action is giving us wealthier, healthier cities. Is the latest CDP Cities report, based on data from 110 cities around the world, really saying that climate change is having positive effects? &quot;No, we&apos;re seeing this very much as a co-benefit of climate change action&quot;, explained Claire Bonham-Carter, director of Sustainable Development at global technical and management services provider AECOM, who conducted the report analysis for CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project). &quot;It&apos;s not climate change that is giving us this, but the action that cities are taking to mitigate or adapt to it are not only helping to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or make the cities more resilient, but also they are having these other positive co-benefits.&quot; What has long been argued now has some very solid data. 110 cities is a significant increase from 73 in 2012 and 48 when the CDP Cities first reported in 2011. With the central aim of asking cities to measure and report on their GHG emissions, the survey also covers in-depth questions about the specific actions cities are taking. It is the economic side of this year&apos;s responses that prove most interesting. The cities reported over $40m (\u00a326.2m) in savings per year from tackling climate change. The vast majority, 91%, also believe that working to combat climate change will lead to economic opportunities. Conor Riffle, CDP head of cities, believes &quot;this is changing the nature of the argument from climate change being the sole driver (of emissions reduction), to saying actually if you want to be a competitive, healthier city, you have to make these changes.&quot; In addition, said Bonham-Carter, &quot;more and more cities are thinking and talking about climate change related actions in terms of job generation, cleaner air, decreased congestion, better public services, rather than GHG emissions reductions, just because it&apos;s much more tangible for people.&quot; The most popular actions cities are taking to reduce emissions are reducing energy demand in buildings, improving fuel efficiency in municipal fleets and lowering energy consumption and maintenance costs of outdoor lighting. For example Sydney will replace 6,450 conventional lights with LED technology, reducing its GHG emissions from lighting by 70% and saving the city $800,000 per year on its electricity bill. Terri Wills, director of global initiatives for the CDP&apos;s report partner C40 Cities, said the findings, &quot;help to build the political case for implementation...if cities want to pass an expensive Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) system, or like Tokyo undertake a cap-and-trade programme where they are requiring buildings to undertake energy efficiency \u2013 some of those policies get push-back...So by being able to quantify the benefits, city governments are able to bring these stakeholders along. If you go back to Tokyo, all those building owners have surpassed the initial emissions reductions requirements because in making efficiencies they discovered that they saved money too.&quot; The Greater London Authority&apos;s Matthew Pencharz, environment advisor to the Mayor of London, goes further. He said: &quot;We must fight the rhetoric that... taking climate action inevitably leads to a reduction in living standards or even a complete change in our way of life. We must say that there is no contradiction between being resource efficient and fostering economic growth and jobs... financial incentives will provide a much more persuasive message than reductions in GHG emissions.&quot; Of the 110 CDP respondents, 62% of actions taken to reduce GHG emissions have the potential to attract new business investment and grow the economy. These include, said Bonham-Carter, activities to &quot;help businesses operate more efficiently, make their buildings cheaper and easier to run. Less congestion allows their workers to get to the office more easily, they are nicer places to live and so can attract and retain the staff that they want.&quot; From London&apos;s perspective, said Matthew Pencharz, &quot;when a company wants to locate its international HQ...one of the indicators they look at is quality of life, and if we keep on improving on quality of life, for example by showing that the air quality is getting better, that&apos;s going to attract businesses. It&apos;s the same with parks and trees, green infrastructure...it&apos;s amazing how land value increases when it is a more pleasing, pleasant space.&quot; However there is a danger that all this talk of booming wealth and health masks the vast amount of work still to be done. The report also includes &quot;some sobering facts&quot;, said Bonham-Carter. &quot;98% of cities report climate change as a risk. Most of them are reporting risks from temperature increases, heat waves and storms or intense periods of rainfall. On the whole this is right now \u2013 this isn&apos;t something they are looking at for their children or grandchildren, it is current, in 2013.&quot; In New York, direct and indirect losses from Super-storm Sandy amounted to around $19bn in damages. Bangkok, Thailand, expects the economic damage of flooding to rise four-fold by 2050. &quot;An increasing number of cities are putting resiliency and adaptation plans in place \u2013 up from 63% in 2011 to 71% this year&quot;, said Bonham-Carter. &quot;San Francisco is already looking at a full triple-bottom line assessment of alternative storm infrastructure, because they are already seeing impacts of sea levels on sewer outflows.&quot; However she argues that if done well, and done now, such adaptation plans can again improve the attractiveness of a city to investors and businesses. Albeit on a smaller scale, she points to how Blackpool in the UK has utilised AECOM-designed coastal defences that also regenerated the city&apos;s public realm and sea front. A question also remains as to how far-reaching the CDP report is. Not even all the vanguard group of C40 Cities&apos; members report their GHG emissions, with 53 out of 63 currently doing so. National restrictions and ability to capture and collate the data remain barriers, explained Wills, butsaid &quot;we are actually going to roll out a protocol to give guidance to cities to say this is how you can capture and measure GHG emissions...that 53 will increase next year significantly.&quot; Meanwhile the central message of the CDP report is to be welcomed, said Matthew Pencharz: &quot;It is hard to overstate how useful reports such as (CDP Cities) are to city governments in working out how to take action... all of us working in this space must speak up clearly and say taking climate action saves money, and delivers jobs and economic growth.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

He will be missed. Canada came out of the financial and economic crises of 2007/08 relatively unscathed. And rightly or wrongly, most of that credit lands at the feet of Mark Carney. He acted decisively, slashing interest rates and working closely with bank regulators to ensure the health of our banking system. But to be fair, he also benefited from a highly regulated, concentrated banking system and the credibility of some 20 years of successful inflation targeting. Nonetheless, Canadians listened to him and respected him as a strong and very visible leader of the central bank. He did not shy away from controversy, admonishing Canadian companies&apos; propensity to hoard cash, and wading into the income inequality issue by voicing his support for the Occupy movement. Are the lessons learned in Canada transferable to the UK? The Bank of England now has responsibility as head regulator for the financial system \u2013 Carney&apos;s experience in Canada coupled with his role as head of the G20 financial stability board will stand him in good stead. But his powers of persuasion will be put to the test as a key difference is that in the UK he will have just one vote on monetary policy. His appointment of a female Bank COO may be a taste of things to come. My advice to Carney is to continue to act as an agent of change, remembering they are never popular. Outgoing governor King clearly opposed forward guidance and monetary policy activism. Carney will no doubt use all his talents of leadership and communications to try to change this. The UK needs Carney; economic growth is weak, inflation is high and the banking system is struggling to rise above recent scandals. He is the right man for the job, but expectations are very high. Nonetheless, I have no doubt Carney will succeed if the UK lets him. \u2022 Patricia Croft is the founder of Croft Consulting and the former chief economist of Royal Bank of Canada Global Asset Management Joseph Stiglitz: &apos;Make banks fulfil their responsibility to society&apos;      An excessive, almost exclusive, focus on inflation by many central banks has not served our economies well. A more comprehensive mandate, along the US model \u2013 inflation, employment, growth, and financial stability, would make the task that confronts bankers such as Mark Carney easier. With the threat of recession, slow growth and unemployment predominating, these should be where attention should be centred. Low interest rates help the economy by lowering the exchange rate, but would help even more if they were translated into more availability of credit at favourable terms, for example, to small businesses and potential homeowners. The credit channel has to be strengthened. And that means banks need to be reorientated back to their traditional functions of lending, not trading (including in derivatives), speculation, market manipulation, etc. Doing so would at the same time help create a more stable financial system. A more competitive banking system too would help in both regards: in most western countries, too big to fail, too interconnected to fail, and too correlated to fail financial systems pose an ongoing threat, one which has become worse in the aftermath of the crisis. These banks are not only to big to fail, but have shown themselves too big to manage, too big to be held accountable, too big to be brought to justice. Financial stability would be enhanced too by substantial increases in capital requirements. The regulatory framework of Basel III should be viewed as a minimum standard, not a maximum. The central insight of modern financial theory, that of Modigliani and Miller, was that increasing leverage simply shifts more risk to equity, and on to the public, as we saw in the 2008 crisis \u2013 it doesn&apos;t make something out of nothing. Making the financial system safer, more accountable, more responsible, more likely to full its societal role should be among the central missions of the Bank. It will require deeper and continuing reforms and monitoring. It will require, in addition to all the other changes noted above, prohibitions on bonus schemes that incentivise excessive risk-taking and short-sighted behaviour. In the days before the crisis, there was excessive faith in the efficiency and stability of markets, in the notion that keeping inflation low and stable was necessary, and almost sufficient, to attain sustained high growth, that monetary policy did and should exercise its influence mainly through interest rates. We now know all too well the deficiencies of these models. The failures were not just &quot;an accident&quot;, the consequence of a once-in-a-century flood. They were systemic. US monetary authorities have taken the lead in forging strong policies to help get the economy out of the hole that they had helped dig, but they have done little to create a framework for stable growth going forward. Carney&apos;s challenge will be to respond to the exigencies of the moment \u2013 made more difficult by the travails at his doorstep in Europe, which are likely only to get worse \u2013 at the same time as creating a new policy framework ensuring stability with full employment and high growth. \u2022 Joseph Stiglitz is a recipient of the Nobel prize in economics and former chief economist at the World Bank Merryn Somerset Webb: &apos;Stop transferring wealth to the rich via QE&apos;      Mark Carney is the great hope of the British political establishment. The idea is that he will bring dynamic innovation to our monetary policy. He is expected to reject out of hand the notion that the various strategies of begging banks to take almost free money, lowering interest rates to one quarter of their previous record level since 1700 and printing hundreds of billions of pounds somehow means that policy is &quot;maxed out&quot;. The idea is that he then uses our economy as a testing ground for some kind of mother-of-all-money-creation-experiments that will lift us out of recession and back into a fantasy land of fixed banks and fast growth. He shouldn&apos;t do it. It is easy to see why we started down the QE road. Back in 2008, with our banks mainly insolvent and crisis looming, Mervyn King would have felt he had no choice but to do whatever it took to keep the system from imploding. But QE comes with horrible side effects, the worst one being that it effectively acts as if it were a regressive fiscal policy rather than a monetary policy. By that I mean that it shifts wealth from the poor to the rich. QE is supposed to work in many ways \u2013 providing cover for the banks to slowly fix their balance sheets and keeping the supply of money constant even as the big banks contract lending (which cuts the money supply). However one of its main consequences is to keep asset prices high as all the new money leaks into prime property prices, stocks, bonds, farmland, art and the like. And who owns these assets? It isn&apos;t the poor. No, for them the effect of QE comes more in the form of non-existent interest rates on their savings, the steady erosion of the real value of their fixed wages to say nothing of the rise in the gap between the housing accommodation they can afford and the accommodation they want. It is, in the end, as the Bank acknowledged last year, a clear wealth transfer to the already rich. That&apos;s something of a moral problem. But it is also something that should now be voted on at a parliamentary level rather than just waved through by a desperate chancellor. So what Mark Carney should do is to acknowledge that transferring wealth and propping up stock markets is the only thing we know \u2013 so far \u2013 that QE can do. Given that the economy is not a machine but the sum of many million people&apos;s worth of generally irrational behaviour, the rest is guesswork. Then he should say firmly that the transfer of wealth in the UK is none of his business. And stop it. \u2022 Merryn Somerset Webb is editor in chief of MoneyWeek Adam Posen: &apos;Stop buying gilts&apos;      The impact of monetary policy depends on what a central bank buys, and what institutions it transacts with. The Federal Reserve is demonstrating this fact with the huge impact on US residential construction of its purchases of mortgage-backed securities over the last year; the Bank of Japan is putting this principle into action by buying long-duration Japanese government bonds as opposed to cash, purchases of which previously failed to counter deflation. It is time for the monetary policy committee (MPC) with its new governor to observe the examples around them, and listen to the longstanding arguments of current and past committee members for buying something other than gilts. The Bank of England should be buying securitised bundles of small, medium and new enterprise debt, as I first proposed in September 2011. The more different from cash the asset that the MPC buys is, the bigger the impact its purchases will have on the economy; the more the MPC concentrates its purchases on where British financial markets are dysfunctional, the bigger the impact as well. Both these factors direct the banks towards SME lending. The highly concentrated British banking system, dominated by four big banks and one big mutual society, has largely forgotten about high-street lending, at least to businesses. The funding for lending scheme (FLS), while clever and well-intentioned, was intended to go through that existing banking system rather than around it, and thus was ineffective. Governor Carney and the MPC will be tempted instead, for several reasons, to stick with some form of announcement by August that rates will not rise until certain targets are met. There are MPC members who think further QE is ineffective or harmful; there are those who think the UK economy is turning around; there are those who want to keep the Bank from taking on credit risk. Every one of these reasons, however, is misguided: credit easing will be more effective than QE or FLS while addressing a structural problem; the UK economy is still a huge way from overheating, let alone full employment or accelerating inflation; and central banks, including the Bank of England, have bought and sold private assets throughout history. Stopping at cheap talk will not be enough, and the time for giving credit where it&apos;s overdue has come. \u2022 Adam Posen is president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington DC. From 2009 to 2012 he was an external member of the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee Richard Koo: &apos;Tell the UK that it cannot afford fiscal consolidation&apos;      Unlike the former leadership of the Bank of England, who initially belittled the lessons from Japan and believed that a bold monetary easing would quickly turn the post-Lehman UK economy around, Mark Carney was one of the first central bank governors who took the concept of balance-sheet recession seriously, a concept that was developed to explain Japan&apos;s predicament. In particular, Japan was suffering from its private sector minimising debt instead of maximising profits following the bursting of its debt-financed bubble. But when the private sector as a whole is trying to remove its debt overhang by saving money (including paying down debt) even at zero interest rates, monetary policy loses its effectiveness because borrowers with balance sheets underwater are neither willing nor able to increase their borrowing in response to central bank easing. The economy then enters a deflationary spiral unless government acts as &quot;borrower of last resort&quot; and takes up and spends the unborrowed savings in the private sector. Today, instead of increasing borrowing in response to record low interest rates, the private sector in the UK is saving a shocking 6.6% of GDP. The same figure for the US is 8.4%, Ireland 5.4% and Spain 15.6% (all Q4 2012 figures seasonally adjusted). These are absolutely horrendous numbers and indicate that all of these economies are squarely in balance-sheet recessions. Since neither the government nor the central bank can force the private sector not to repair its balance sheets, Carney would do well to explain to the British public why the effectiveness of monetary policy is limited in this highly unusual recession. He should also argue along the lines of the US Fed chairman Ben Bernanke&apos;s warning on the &quot;fiscal cliff&quot; that the UK cannot afford fiscal consolidation until its private-sector deleveraging is completed. He should deliver this massage even if Messrs Cameron and Osborne don&apos;t want to hear it. Carney should also think of the ways to mop up the massive liquidity injected by his predecessor via quantitative easing before it is too late. Viewed as a multiple of required reserves, there is enough liquidity in the banking system today to increase money supply by 10 times in the UK, 16 times in the US and six times in Japan. This liquidity will do no harm as long as the private sector as a whole is deleveraging. But we are also facing potential inflation rates of 600%, 1000% and 1600% when those respective private sectors return to profit maximisation. Bringing this massive genie back into the bottle without destroying the bond market and the economy is a challenge only a person of Carney&apos;s calibre can possibly handle. \u2022 Richard Koo is chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute, Tokyo"}, {"sentences": ["Active as an editor, contributing articles and reviews to scholarly journals and books including the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and the Dictionary of National Biography, Marlow held posts as a visiting professor at universities in Tokyo, Texas, New England and New Zealand.", "He continued to work regularly with choirs, particularly in Tokyo, New England, California and Oregon (where he was the artistic director of the annual William Byrd festival), until 2011, when he was diagnosed with cancer."], "tags": ["Choral music", "Classical music", "Music", "University of Cambridge", "Culture", "Teaching", "Conducting"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-02T12:04:53Z", "title": "Richard Marlow obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/02/richard-marlow", "article": "Richard Marlow, who has died aged 73, was one of the leading choral conductors of the 20th century. Director of music at Trinity College, Cambridge, for 38 years, he was an influence on generations of students, both as a choral director and teacher. As a conductor, he directed several critically acclaimed recordings with the Cambridge University Chamber Choir and the choir of Trinity College, in addition to recording as a solo organist and harpsichordist and publishing widely as an editor and composer. His choirs were renowned for their purity of tone, immaculate tuning, dynamic variety, expressive range and musical elegance. Born in Banstead, Surrey, Marlow was a chorister at Southwark Cathedral, and sang at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Educated at St Olave&apos;s school, London, he went on to become organ scholar and later research fellow at Selwyn College, Cambridge. He was a student of Thurston Dart, and his doctoral studies focused on the 17th-century virginalist Giles Farnaby, whose keyboard works he edited and published as part of the Musica Britannica collection. After a brief spell as a lecturer at Southampton University, Marlow returned to Cambridge in 1968, succeeding Raymond Leppard as fellow, organist and director of music at Trinity College and lecturer in the university music faculty. In 1969, Marlow founded the Cambridge University Chamber Choir, which quickly established an international reputation for its performances of music rarely tackled by undergraduate ensembles. The group was one of the first student choirs to travel widely, and regularly collaborated with orchestras and instrumental groups, notably in performances of the passion settings of JS Bach in which the tenor Peter Pears sang the role of the Evangelist. Marlow invented the practice of singing from the towers, which now takes place in the Great Court of Trinity College on the last Sunday of the academic year, and revived the tradition of singing on the river, using the occasion to raise funds for the Cambridgeshire Handicapped Children and Adults Group, with which he was closely involved. Following the admission of female undergraduates to Trinity, Marlow founded the college&apos;s mixed choir in 1982; under his direction the group released more than 40 recordings, exploring both familiar and new repertoire with works by composers such as Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, Orlande de Lassus and Michael Praetorius being recorded for the first time in the early days of the compact disc. Classical Music magazine observed that: &quot;Richard Marlow has fashioned a marvellously responsive instrument from his mixed undergraduate choir \u2026 its repertoire is impressively wide and there is an intelligence and responsiveness which makes the transition from Parry to Sch\u00fctz, Purcell to Walton, wholly congruous.&quot; In 1975 he commissioned the firm of Metzler to design and build a new organ for the chapel at Trinity College. The instrument is regarded as one of the finest neoclassical organs in the UK and continues to be used for large numbers of solo recordings. Active as an editor, contributing articles and reviews to scholarly journals and books including the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and the Dictionary of National Biography, Marlow held posts as a visiting professor at universities in Tokyo, Texas, New England and New Zealand. As honorary general editor of the Church Music Society for many years, he was responsible for a number of publications which now form the staple diet of church, cathedral and collegiate choirs across the world. His influence as a key figure in Cambridge musical life for more than 40 years extended over all those who heard him lecture or perform, including many who have gone on to pursue distinguished careers in the world of music and the arts; and was felt most keenly by those whom he taught and those who sang and played for him on a daily basis. His care and affection for all his students was matched only by his devotion to the college of which he was so proud to be a part. As a conductor, his gentle, understated manner, coupled with musical discipline and scholarly integrity, drew performances from singers of which few had imagined they were capable. His insightful and expressive interpretations of music from Byrd to Stravinsky shone new light on familiar repertoire and opened up works unheard for centuries to choral singers across the world. Marlow retired as director of music at Trinity College in 2006. He continued to work regularly with choirs, particularly in Tokyo, New England, California and Oregon (where he was the artistic director of the annual William Byrd festival), until 2011, when he was diagnosed with cancer. He gave his last undergraduate supervision in February this year. He is survived by his wife, Annette, whom he married in 1964, their two sons, Giles and Andrew, and four grandchildren. \u2022 Richard Kenneth Marlow, musician and scholar, born 26 July 1939; died 16 June 2013"}, {"sentences": ["I saw the Stones for the first time nearly 20 years ago at the Tokyo Dome, thinking there would be few other opportunities."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2013-07-02T15:44:47Z", "title": "Inside the 5 July edition", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/jul/02/inside-guardian-weekly-abby-deveney", "article": "America the super-snooper.

Petra Kvitova is 6ft tall, the No8 seed and a former Wimbledon champion with serious big-match pedigree. Behind her, almost eclipsed, was 5ft 5in Kirsten Flipkens from Belgium, who this time last year was ranked 262 in the world. It was her first grand slam quarter-final in a career that looked as if it had stalled. But in a tournament defined by shock results, what is one more? Flipkens triumphed 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in just over two hours. Kvitova was suffering from the effects of a virus, and called on the doctor towards the end of the second set. But Flipkens&apos;s performance was one of considerable skill and breathtaking composure. In the final set, when everyone expected her to crack, she served relentlessly and moved an ailing Kvitova around the court with a dexterity that was almost sadistic. &quot;I don&apos;t even have tears,&quot; said the 27-year-old Flipkens. &quot;I was so calm on the court, because I had nothing to lose. I&apos;m so happy, you can&apos;t imagine.&quot; You might not have heard of Flipkens, but she was a brilliant junior player of whom much was expected. Ten years ago she claimed the girls&apos; singles title at Wimbledon and went to the 2003 US Open and won that, too. But, moving into the senior circuit, she found the expectation overwhelming and it was her fellow Belgians Justine Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters, a good friend, who dominated. This time last year, Flipkens was competing not at Wimbledon but at a clay court event in Middleburg, Virginia. Her ranking meant she was not eligible to even enter qualifying at SW19. And she no longer received any financial support from the Belgian tennis federation \u2013 she says they dropped her; they claim they gave an offer of reduced support. Flipkens had also endured a miserable run of injuries. There was wrist surgery in 2010, a debilitating knee problem in 2011 and then, most seriously, in April last year she was diagnosed with blood clots in her calf. She felt sluggish after a flight from Thailand and decided to check it out before heading to a tournament in Tokyo. &quot;The doctor told me that if I had taken the flight I would come out blue,&quot; Flipkens said recently. &quot;You start re-evaluating everything. Winning or losing a tennis match, it doesn&apos;t make much difference.&quot; The treatment was successful \u2013 though she still takes blood thinners on long-haul flights \u2013 but with no money to cover travel costs, her career hung in the balance. At this point, Jean-Pierre Heynderick, a Belgian industrialist and tennis fan, stepped in. Flipkens also started working with Clijsters, a four-times grand slam winner, as a training partner. In the aftermath of her victory, Flipkens was quick to acknowledge the debt she owed them. &quot;I can count on one hand the number of people who were believing in me,&quot; she said. &quot;Kim was one of those people and [Heynderick] was another.&quot; The results were almost immediate for Flipkens and few players have been as consistent over the last year. She has risen more than 230 places in the rankings and is now world No20. At Wimbledon she had glided invisibly through the draw \u2013 aided no doubt by the exit of Victoria Azarenka through injury \u2013 reaching the quarter-final without dropping a set. That record went pretty quickly against Kvitova, and the 23-year-old from the Czech Republic looked as if she might have a straightforward afternoon. But that&apos;s not really her style. If you think it&apos;s emotionally draining to be a British tennis fan sometimes, spare a thought for followers of Kvitova. No one on the women&apos;s tour has played more three-set matches than she has. She wins a lot of them but the statistic also tells you that she is deeply mercurial, often prone to lapses in concentration. As the match progressed, Kvitova became more reckless and \u2013 presumably because of her illness \u2013 tried to shorten the points with explosive winners. The plan, however, did not work. Flipkens was a wall, returning Kvitova&apos;s pummelling ground strokes with a sapping backhand slice that recalled Henin at her best. Kvitova&apos;s legs began to look heavy and at 4-4 in the final set she crumpled. We will leave the final words to Clijsters who, heavily pregnant, was watching the match from her home in the US. &quot;Still drying my eyes :-)),&quot; she wrote on Twitter. &quot;So proud of how [Flipkens] handled the big occasion for the first time!&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["This city is 3,000x bigger than London, New York or Tokyo...

So there must be a very sharp line drawn between the two models based on the look and feel.  Apple cannot have the bulk of its customers trade down to the budget phone from more expensive devices. It must make the entry-level model look so vulgar and cheap that most iPhone users will stick to the main line models, even if they have to pay a $200 to $400 premium. The budget phones have to look tackier than the new iPhone 5S, but that is not enough -- they must also be less desirable than the iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S... yet still appear more desirable than low-end Android phones.

The feedback was positive enough for Bing to generate a deal to handle Siri web queries in iOS 7, which launches later this year. Theoretically, a future version of OS X could also integrate Bing, a logical step if the iOS work is well-received by users.

Now the average male worker sets aside 518 yen a day for lunch, according to Shinsei&apos;s survey of 1,000 men in their 20s to 50s. They spend an average of 7,689 yen a month on drinking with colleagues, averaging 2.2 times a month and 3,474 yen a time, the latter figure up 21% from last year. While persistent deflation has given individual workers marginally more spending power, it has dulled consumption as households hold out for further drops in prices. That in turn hits corporate profits and keeps wages stagnant. The annual pocket money survey, which began in 1979, suggests that while the stock market is rising and the weak yen has buoyed exporters, ordinary workers have yet to feel the benefits of Japan&apos;s experiment with massive public investment, super-loose monetary easing and structural reforms. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, came to power last December promising to end deflation and make exports more competitive. The Tokyo stock exchange has risen by about 50% and the yen has fallen by about 25% against the US dollar since late last year. Abe&apos;s economic programme, nicknamed Abenomics, has sparked optimism that the world&apos;s third-biggest economy could emerge from years of stagnation. But for many salarymen, Abe&apos;s promise of higher wages has yet to materialise. &quot;People with assets, along with exporters, are seeing the benefits of Abenomics, but that hasn&apos;t been matched by conspicuous consumption,&quot; said Jun Okumura, a Japan specialist at the Eurasia Group. &quot;There is a sense among many people that the benefits have yet to accrue to them. If that continues, they are going to become disaffected, and that&apos;s when you&apos;ll see Abe&apos;s poll ratings begin to slide.&quot; Public support for Abe&apos;s Liberal Democratic party has weakened slightly in recent days, but it is still expected to win upper house elections this month, giving it control of both houses of parliament and handing Abe a mandate to continue with his economic and political reforms. Shinsei said: &quot;The effects of Abenomics have not been sufficient to affect the pocket money allowances of salarymen, despite causing improvements in the performance of some companies and rises in stock prices.&quot; The bank noted that some workers had received pay rises, which have been reflected in more generous allowances, but forecast that &quot;in most households, the monetary situation is expected to worsen&quot; due to rising fuel and other costs, and a planned sales tax rise next year."}, {"sentences": ["A meeting on Wednesday in the Afghan capital aimed to be the first step in this &quot;paradigm shift&quot;, grading the country on progress towards goals agreed last year in Tokyo.", "&quot;It&apos;s about teaching Afghans to readjust themselves, as the times of complacency are gone.&quot; Last year in Tokyo Afghan and international diplomats hammered out a &quot;mutual accountability&quot; pact.", "Donors are eyeing other controls, and warn that Kabul will have to work harder at meeting the Tokyo goals."], "tags": ["Afghanistan", "World news", "Hamid Karzai", "Aid", "Global development"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-03T15:51:32Z", "title": "West demands more progress from Afghanistan in return for aid", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/west-demands-progress-afghanistan-aid", "article": "After years of lavish spending in support of the now-waning military mission in Afghanistan, the west on Wednesday embarked on an attempt to reset its relationship with Kabul, demanding measurable progress in return for aid cash. Afghanistan has been promised around $8bn (\u00a35.2bn) a year in military and development spending after foreign troops leave in 2014. But Nato governments say the aid money comes with strings attached. A meeting on Wednesday in the Afghan capital aimed to be the first step in this &quot;paradigm shift&quot;, grading the country on progress towards goals agreed last year in Tokyo. But the assessment was sombre, despite praise for an unexpectedly &quot;realistic&quot; discussion. Only three of 17 benchmarks had been met in full, one western official said, and Afghanistan&apos;s president, Hamid Karzai, was notable by his absence from a high-profile meeting held just a stone&apos;s throw from his palace. Failures picked over include parliament&apos;s dithering over election laws that could result in the country going into a crucial presidential poll next year with no legal framework, the feeble sentences handed to the masterminds of the $900m Kabul Bank scandal and slow progress on asset recovery. Donors were also unhappy with Karzai&apos;s unilateral choice of new members of the country&apos;s well respected human rights watchdog. One is a former member of the Taliban, another said she hopes to run for president and a third is a former police general. The big question for Afghan officials keen to keep the cash flowing is what, if anything, the west plans to do about these failures. The last 10 years have been a catalogue of red lines drawn in the sand and then washed away, with criticism coming and going but funds staying more or less constant. Diplomats insist that is now changing, and the attitude of Afghan bureaucrats, who have been largely impervious to outside pressure, will have to change as well. &quot;There is a paradigm shift underway in our relationship with Afghanistan and it is critical everyone is aware of that,&quot; said a western official. &quot;It&apos;s about teaching Afghans to readjust themselves, as the times of complacency are gone.&quot; Last year in Tokyo Afghan and international diplomats hammered out a &quot;mutual accountability&quot; pact. It committed the west to long-term support, but Afghanistan to substantial change in return, particularly tackling corruption and protecting democracy and women&apos;s rights. For Washington and its allies much is at stake, primarily their hopes of leaving a government credible enough to hold onto power when Nato&apos;s military might is gone. They also need leaders who can justify unprecedented aid spending on a single country. &quot;We have said again and again, progress is needed for us to be able to justify sustained levels of support,&quot; said one US official. Those concerns put human rights and elections top of the agenda in Kabul. If next year&apos;s presidential poll goes smoothly it be the first peaceful transfer of power in Afghanistan since 1901. &quot;A free and fair election still remains the primary benchmark,&quot; said Mark Bowden, deputy head of the UN in Afghanistan, after the meeting ended. For the Afghan government too the stakes are high. For all its much-vaunted independence as the &quot;graveyard of empires&quot;, most of Afghanistan&apos;s rulers since the 19thh century have been dependent on foreign cash, skilfully playing off bigger powers to extract revenue in the form of development cash or straight-up subsidies and arms deliveries. The current one is no exception. Revenues have already started falling on the back of Nato&apos;s downsizing, making foreign cash even more important. And while divided about when to use carrots and sticks, the international community has made some first tentative moves towards punishing failure. The EU recently held back \u20ac20m ( \u00a317m) earmarked for a justice programme. Donors are eyeing other controls, and warn that Kabul will have to work harder at meeting the Tokyo goals. &quot;There was a lot of emphasis on the current extraordinary levels of aid. Faster progress with reforms, tackling corruption and especially ensuring credible elections are all essential if these levels of aid are to be sustained,&quot; another western diplomat said after the meeting."}, {"sentences": ["As the bidding teams from Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid vying to host the 2020 Olympics delivered their crucial final presentations to the IOC executive board on Wednesday, Coe was preparing to secure the more modest prize for 2018.", "There&apos;s a pretty important international dimension here.&quot; It was at this stage four years ago that Rio seized the initiative to edge ahead of Chicago, Madrid and Tokyo in the race to host the 2016 summer Games and all three bids tried to use their 45-minute presentations to accentuate the positives and deal with some of the negative aspects head on.", "For Istanbul that meant addressing the impact of violent protests that were beamed around the world from the heart of the city, for Tokyo dealing with the perception that their bid is unexciting and lacks a strong &quot;narrative&quot; and for Madrid facing down questions of Spain&apos;s parlous economic situation."], "tags": ["Lord Coe", "British Olympic Association", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-03T16:25:57Z", "title": "Lord Coe sets out to secure Youth Olympics for Glasgow in 2018", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/03/lord-coe-youth-olympics-glasgow", "article": "Almost exactly eight years since Lord Coe delivered the electrifying speech that won the Olympic Games for London, he will aim to bring the fledgling Youth Olympics to Glasgow in 2018 with the argument that it will help finish what he started. As the bidding teams from Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid vying to host the 2020 Olympics delivered their crucial final presentations to the IOC executive board on Wednesday, Coe was preparing to secure the more modest prize for 2018. &quot;This was always going to be a 20-year journey \u2013 three years to land the thing [London 2012], seven to deliver and 10 years to capture everything we witnessed last year,&quot; he said. &quot;For me, having a Youth Olympic Games at the midway point of that 10-year journey is fantastic. Not just domestically, but Keith [Mills] and I have basically kept the International Inspiration programme going, which is driving full throttle ahead. There&apos;s a pretty important international dimension here.&quot; It was at this stage four years ago that Rio seized the initiative to edge ahead of Chicago, Madrid and Tokyo in the race to host the 2016 summer Games and all three bids tried to use their 45-minute presentations to accentuate the positives and deal with some of the negative aspects head on. For Istanbul that meant addressing the impact of violent protests that were beamed around the world from the heart of the city, for Tokyo dealing with the perception that their bid is unexciting and lacks a strong &quot;narrative&quot; and for Madrid facing down questions of Spain&apos;s parlous economic situation. The IOC&apos;s Dick Pound said it remained a very close contest before the final vote in Buenos Aires on 7 September. &quot;It&apos;s still a three-horse race. This is one of the hardest to call. All the cases are quite different, but nonetheless compelling.&quot; Pound said Madrid gave the most compelling presentation and he did not believe the protests in Istanbul would have a major bearing on the result. &quot;We all live in a Chicken Little age where the sky is always falling in. It&apos;s seven years away and they will deal with the situation.&quot; Coe, the former London 2012 chairman who is British Olympic Association chairman, will be one of a four-strong presentation team that on Thursday will try to see off competition from Medell\u00edn in Colombia and Argentina capital Buenos Aires for the Youth Olympics, a pet project of the outgoing IOC president Jacques Rogge. Glasgow&apos;s rivals are likely to argue that the UK has had its share of major sporting events over recent years and that the development event, which brings together 3,600 athletes aged between 14 and 18 from around the world to compete in a range of sports, should go to a developing nation. But Coe, who will present Glasgow&apos;s case alongside 15-year-old young ambassador Elizabeth Pollard, bid leader Paul Bush and the British IOC executive board member Sir Craig Reedie, will argue that the event is still too fragile and would benefit from being held in a mature market in its third incarnation. &quot;I&apos;m committed to globalised sport, but you have to do it in a way where you send entities out there fully fledged and fully formed. Not to do it in a state where the roots are still pretty shallow,&quot; said Coe. &quot;You need to establish it then absolutely take it into areas of the world and cities that are probably never going to stage a major games or championships. I think you&apos;ll get a bigger reach keeping it in the larger media centres than if you send it out there undercooked.&quot; The bid, costing \u00a32m and jointly funded by the Scottish government and the City of Glasgow, will also be supported in Lausanne by Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy and sports minister Hugh Robertson. If it wins, the Games will cost \u00a3200m-plus to host. &quot;Glasgow is quite a forward-looking city,&quot; said Hoy, who is also an ambassador for next year&apos;s Commonwealth Games in the city. &quot;They realise the importance of sport and they&apos;re willing to invest in it.

The Tokyo delegation told the 86 International Olympic Committee members present that they were &quot;the right partner at the right time&quot;. Madrid, meanwhile, offered &quot;a realistic bid for realistic times&quot;. Both emphasised the extent to which, despite the airless cocoon in which international sporting bodies operate, the world beyond has changed since Lord Coe&apos;s bold pitch won the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005. Only Istanbul&apos;s case for the 2020 Olympic Games, from a bid on the back foot as a result of the violent protests and police brutality beamed around the world from Taksim Square over recent months, vowed to &quot;step beyond sport to make history&quot;. As the choreographed dance to the IOC&apos;s tune enters its final phase, three very different bids are jockeying for position. The lobbyists are out in force, drawn like bees to honey. It has become a bidding cliche, but the veteran IOC member Dick Pound said it was genuinely the closest race he could remember \u2013 partly because all the bids had obvious strengths and weaknesses \u2013 and still very much a three-horse race. Until six weeks ago, Istanbul&apos;s bold pitch to unite east and west and invest in an eye-catching Games that would bring the world to the banks of the Bosphorus was considered a narrow favourite. Events in Taksim Square, not to mention a technical report by an inspection team led by the British IOC member Sir Craig Reedie that highlighted the extent of the logistical challenges, have potentially changed all that. They were glad of the chance to look members in the eye and try to claw back some ground. &quot;Today we went a long way to giving the IOC members the reassurance that they sought,&quot; said one bid insider. Madrid, meanwhile, was rarely mentioned in dispatches in the early stages of the race, with the assumption being that its tattered economy would count against it. But there is historically a lot of goodwill for its bid in IOC circles and Madrid has worked hard to turn a negative into a positive by stressing that most of its venues are built already and its ability to deliver a low-cost, compact vision. Many are now speculating that it will make it through the first round of voting and, if it does, all bets will be off. Madrid&apos;s team were generally agreed to have given the most impressive presentation, with the contribution of the former Olympic sailor crown prince Felipe \u2013 who carried the flag for Spain at the Barcelona Games \u2013 garnering particular praise. As for the safe pair of hands promised by Tokyo, considered the narrow favourite ahead of this round of presentations at the home of the Olympic movement, its biggest challenge is to guard against the impression that its bid lacks a compelling back-story and is, to put it bluntly, a bit dull. To counter that notion they engaged the broadcaster Christel Takigawa as a &quot;cool ambassador&quot;, made an effort to speak in French and English and have promised to inject their final presentation in September with some stardust. The lobbies of Lausanne&apos;s finer hotels hum to the polite, sometimes inane, chatter that characterises this final phase of a long race. IOC members talk in riddles and refuse to show their hands, while the race to succeed Jacques Rogge as the next president (all six candidates will present their cases to the membership on Thursday) could also be a factor. A new introduction to the process four years ago, this final chance to present to the majority of the IOC membership (18 excused themselves, including Sepp Blatter and Princess Anne) behind closed doors is seen as crucial. This was the first and last opportunity for the bidders to engage the entire electorate before the final vote in Buenos Aires on 7 September. It was at this stage in 2009 that Rio seized the initiative from Chicago with its bid to bring the Games to South America for the first time, gaining a momentum that saw them over the line in Copenhagen two months later despite the late intervention of a then newly elected President Obama. The fact the next Games are in Rio, recently targeted by its own protesters and a logistical challenge to deliver, could also play in favour of the &quot;safety-first candidates&quot;. But by the same token it is impossible to underestimate the extent to which IOC members like to feel as though they are breaking new ground and making history, even in troubled economic times. They also like to feel themselves to be above the short-term vicissitudes of today&apos;s news bulletins. &quot;We all live in a Chicken Little age where the sky is always falling in. It&apos;s seven years away and they will deal with the situation,&quot; insisted Pound. A relaxed looking Coe \u2013 in town to front Glasgow&apos;s own bid for the 2018 Youth Olympic Games \u2013 could afford to smile at the sight of the harassed, dog-tired bid executives in their matching suits as he recalled the final weeks of London&apos;s bid in 2005. &quot;I saw them a couple of weeks ago and they look a lot more tired than [we did] then,&quot; said Coe. &quot;The real challenge is just to keep going now, to keep focused and to keep believing and not listening to the gossip. I feel their pain. &quot;It&apos;s not an exact science and never has been. We went into the conference hall in Singapore not really knowing if we were ahead, behind or had closed the gap.&quot; All three bidders for 2020, each flawed and compelling in very different ways, will enter the final straight knowing that the race is still open."}, {"sentences": ["The week leading up to the annual Diamond League meeting had been a frenzy of lobbying and politicking in the city&apos;s finer hotels as the three potential hosts for the 2020 Olympics \u2013 Tokyo, Madrid and Istanbul \u2013 and the six candidates hoping to replace Rogge presented their cases to the IOC members before a vote in September."], "tags": ["Tyson Gay", "Athletics", "Sport", "US sports", "World Athletics Championships 2013"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-04T21:17:48Z", "title": "Tyson Gay gives Usain Bolt world championships warning in Lausanne", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/04/tyson-gay-usain-bolt-world-championships", "article": "Tyson Gay has again thrown down the gauntlet to Usain Bolt before the world championships by reinforcing his status as the current fastest man in the world.

It was Gay&apos;s second-fastest time this year, while Powell and Rodgers recorded season&apos;s best times on a fast track with a tailwind just within the legal limit of two metres per second. Kim Collins, in fourth, beat his own St Kitts &amp; Nevis national record with 9.97sec. Gay, having shrugged off long-standing injury worries, said consistently recording fast times after so many years of frustration was key before a 100m at the world championships in Moscow that is shaping up to be an epic clash. &quot;It felt good. It&apos;s all about consistency and staying healthy because that&apos;s the key to success at this level,&quot; said Gay. &quot;Sometimes you wish you could take advantage of the wind a little more but at the same time I felt good.&quot; Gay had already served notice to his long-time rival Bolt that he may not have it all his own way in his attempt to regain his world title in August by recording the fastest 100m sprint in the world this year, with a time of 9.75 at the US trials last month. Before this race he said he hoped this season to beat his personal best of 9.69. He set that time in 2009, the last season when he was completely injury free, and claimed to be feeling as confident as he did then. The 30-year-old American, a world champion in 2007 and the second-fastest 100m runner of all time behind Bolt, had overcome Powell in five of their previous six encounters and again beat his Jamaican rival into second place. Powell finished second in 9.88 and Rodgers was third in 9.96. On a night of mostly underwhelming performances from the British contingent only the long jumper Shara Proctor, who finished third with a season&apos;s best jump of 6.92m, and the 110m hurdler Tiffany Porter, who recorded her season&apos;s best time of 12.53 in finishing fifth, could be truly satisfied with their work. In the women&apos;s 400m Christine Ohuruogu again faced the in-form 2011 world champion Amantle Montsho, having defeated her last week in Birmingham with a trademark late surge. But both finished behind the American Francena McCrory, with Ohuruogu unable to recover from a slow start and finishing fourth in 51.03. The Olympic high jump bronze medallist Robbie Grabarz had returned to form in Birmingham last week with a season&apos;s best jump of 2.31m. But here he crashed out of the competition with three failures at 2.27m, finishing dead last in a high quality field in which the 23-year-old Ukrainian Bohdan Bondarenko, who finished seventh behind Grabarz in London, recorded the highest jump since 1994 to win with a leap of 2.41m to the delight of the crowd. The Athletissima meeting at the atmospheric yet compact stadium in Lausanne, self-styled home of the Olympic movement, was attended by the IOC president, Jacques Rogge, and some of the 89 IOC members who earlier in the day voted to award the 2018 Youth Olympic Games to Buenos Aires, ahead of Medell\u00edn in Colombia and Glasgow.

Dozens of athletes are expected to be confirmed as having tested positive for banned substances after the International Association of Athletics Federations &quot;intensified&quot; its anti-doping efforts within Turkey this year, with particular scrutiny at the Mediterranean Games last month. The spate of positive tests comes after &quot;abnormalities&quot; were recorded in the blood biological passport of the Olympic 1500m champion Cakir Alptekin, who may face a life ban from athletics after being suspended in May. Commenting on the Alptekin case in March this year, after the 27-year-old won gold at London 2012, an IAAF spokesman told the Guardian: &quot;We have seen big abnormalities and it is not the only case from Turkey. More are coming.&quot; If the IAAF confirms the positive cases before the International Olympic Committee decides which city will host the 2020 Games in September, then it will be extremely damaging for Istanbul, which is vying with Tokyo and Madrid to stage the event. Another high-profile Turkish athlete who has tested positive for a banned substance is the two-times European 100m hurdle champion, Nevin Yanit. However, despite eight Turkish athletes reportedly failing tests at last month&apos;s European Team Championships in Gateshead, the National Olympic Committee of Turkey insists there is a zero-tolerance approach to doping in the country and the new cases will be resolved &quot;quickly and decisively&quot;. A spokesman said: &quot;The NOC of Turkey and the Turkish government have a zero-tolerance policy on doping in sport and therefore we have been cooperating fully with all relevant investigations to resolve these cases as quickly and decisively as possible. &quot;The recent doping discoveries have been fully assisted by the Turkish National Anti-doping Agency who have been working closely with the IAAF and World Anti-doping Agency. The Turkish Anti-Doping Agency is wholly compliant with Wada and is dramatically stepping up its fight against drug cheats. &quot;Any athletes found guilty of using banned substances will be punished to the full extent of Turkey&apos;s comprehensive anti-doping legislation, other laws, and in accordance with international anti-doping practices.&quot; It is unlikely that Turkey will be banned from competing at this year&apos;s world championships in Moscow, despite the high number of offences. No country has ever been suspended from a major event because of doping offences and the IAAF council, which has the power to make such a decision, does not sit until the eve of the championships in August, when Turkey&apos;s athletes will already be in Russia. With only eight weeks remaining until the IOC makes a decision on the 2020 Olympics in Buenos Aires, Istanbul bid insiders insisted that Turkey&apos;s Olympic committee had been working hard with anti-doping agencies to uncover potential cheats. When Alptekin won gold at last year&apos;s Olympics she claimed the result was down to &quot;Turkish power&quot;, although the British athlete Lisa Dobriskey immediately raised suspicions when saying she felt &quot;uncomfortable&quot; at the result. The IAAF would not confirm how many Turkish athletes are expected to be confirmed as positive but said in a statement: &quot;Following concerns highlighted by abnormal biological passport values the IAAF with the national anti-doping agency intensified the testing programme in Turkey, the results of which remain on-going in accordance with IAAF Rules.

Yoshida, 58, took early retirement from the plant&apos;s operator, Tepco, in late 2011 after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. He died in a Tokyo hospital on Tuesday, reports said. Tepco and Yoshida, a heavy smoker, said the cancer was not related to the nuclear accident caused by the March 2011 tsunami that hit Japan. Although Tepco has been widely criticised for its handling of the accident, Yoshida&apos;s courage and refusal to follow orders from the firm&apos;s headquarters after the plant was struck by a 42-foot tsunami on the afternoon on 11 March 2011 have been credited with preventing a catastrophic release of radiation that could have forced the evacuation of Tokyo. The 58-year-old stayed on at the plant to direct the perilous operation to cool its crippled reactors amid frequent aftershocks and hydrogen explosions inside reactor buildings. He will be remembered most of all for defying an order from senior Tepco officials in Tokyo to stop pumping seawater into one of the damaged reactors in a frantic effort to keep it cool. Tepco officials were concerned that pumping seawater into the reactors would render them commercially useless. His death will deprive experts of an important source of information for future investigations into the accident. More than two years after the triple meltdown radiation levels in key areas of Fukushima Daiichi are still far too high for on-site inspections. Workers at the plant are also struggling to treat huge amounts of contaminated water used to cool melted fuel deep inside three of the plant&apos;s six reactors. This week Tepco said it had detected a dramatic spike in radioactive caesium levels in groundwater in an area of the plant close to the sea. The discovery is another blow to efforts to clean up the site; the operation to remove melted fuel from the reactors and decommission the facility is expected to take about 40 years. Tepco officials said they had found levels of caesium-134, which has a half life of about two years, at 9,000 becquerels per litre inside a well on Tuesday \u2013 about 90 times higher than levels three days earlier and 150 times higher than Japan&apos;s safety standard. The company said it had yet to determine the cause of the radiation spike. The tsunami killed more than 18,000 people along Japan&apos;s north-east coast and forced the evacuation of 150,000 residents from villages and towns close to the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Yoshida, who had been manager of the plant for just nine months when the tsunami knocked out its regular and emergency power supplies, was reprimanded but later hailed as a hero as it became clear that his actions had saved the plant from a nuclear fission chain reaction \u2013 a potentially far more devastating scenario than a fuel meltdown. &quot;I bow deeply out of respect for his leadership and decisiveness,&quot; the prime minister of the time, Naoto Kan, wrote on Twitter after Yoshida&apos;s death was reported. &quot;I wish I had had the chance to talk to him at length about the nuclear disaster once again.&quot; Video footage from the earthquake-proof bunker from which Yoshida directed the mission to save the plant shows him occasionally apologising to colleagues for sending them out to connect water supplies to dangerously overheating reactors. He is later persuaded to abandon a &quot;suicide&quot; mission, which he offered to lead, to cool another reactor. Despite his largely calm demeanour at the time, Yoshida would later admit that he feared he and his colleagues would perish inside the plant. &quot;During the first week of the accident I thought several times that we were all going to die,&quot; he told journalists shortly before he retired. Yoshida insisted he had never once considered a total withdrawal from the plant, a prospect that brought him into conflict Kan, who had warned Tepco bosses that a total evacuation of the plant would spell the end of the utility.

Twenty years later, something had changed: Spielberg and DreamWorks were in production on a live-action remake of Ghost in the Shell, perhaps the next-biggest crossover anime title, with the beard buttering it up in the press as &quot;one of my favourite stories&quot;. But he missed the chance to be there at the beginning for artist-director Katsuhiro Otomo&apos;s earlier masterpiece \u2013 25 this year \u2013 when its enervating hyper-realism left retina burn in the eyes of action fans and film-makers worldwide. Akira swiftly became midnight-movie fodder in the US, on a small release through Streamline Entertainment. Its dynamism and attention to detail \u2013 honed by Otomo in the 2,300-page manga version he published during the 80s in a Young magazine anthology \u2013 caught everyone&apos;s attention. The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote: &quot;The drawings of Neo-Tokyo by night are so intricately detailed that all the individual windows of huge skyscrapers appear distinct. And these night scenes glow with subtle, vibrant colour. When its characters hurtle through space, they do it with breathtaking energy.&quot; Perhaps the metaphysical gloss applied by Otomo to his apocalyptic, future-Tokyo story \u2013 the kind of quasi-philosophical yadda-yadda that would became an anime trademark \u2013 also helped lend Akira its cult credentials. It went on release at the London&apos;s taste-making ICA (also crucial to spreading the word about J-horror several years later) in January 1991. Later that year, Streamline put the film out on VHS, and a subsidiary of Island Records followed suit in the UK; the company created Manga Entertainment to handle the release and exploit growing interest in Japanese animation.     'Violent, abrasive, radically stylised': a biker gang in the Neo-Tokyo of Akira    &quot;I started thinking [Akira] was more than a great film,&quot; Andy Frain, Manga Entertainment&apos;s founder, later recalled. &quot;This might be a phenomenon. Were there more films like this in Japan? If so, we could treat them in music terms like Def Jam, a genre in itself.&quot; Indeed there were more. Manga Entertainment alone handled Ninja Scroll, Battle Angel Alita, Vampire Hunter D, Death Note, Satashi Kon&apos;s Millennium Actress and Perfect Blue, and the infamous Urotsukidoji, becoming the premium anime label in the west in the process. Anime (and its print sibling, manga) arrived in the west at the right time; its thrilling sense of spatial possibilities and destructive glee showed up Disney&apos;s sentimental, character-focused approach and conservatism, as the American company slipped into its mid-90s slump. (Though Otomo had also admired Disney&apos;s professionalism when he was making Akira \u2013 he took on their practice of prerecording dialogue, which, because it slowed down the animation process, was not the norm in Japan at the time.) Led by Akira, anime expanded the idea of what animation could be: violent, abrasive, radically stylised, thoughtful and above all, adult. It arguably readjusted expectations ahead of the later revitalisation and maturation of the industry under Pixar \u2013 sweeping away the prejudice that anything with drawings was for kids. Along with a host of other cult and alternative influences percolating into the mainstream, its presence was widely felt by the late 1990s, from the west&apos;s embrace of Pok\u00e9mon fever, to tabloid moral panics, to the obvious visual transfusion received by The Matrix \u2013 which became the key touchstone for the next decade of Hollywood actioners. The Wachowskis put their debt on the record with their spin-off The Animatrix in 2003, just as Quentin Tarantino did with The Origin of O-Ren, the cartoon segment of Kill Bill Volume I. But anime&apos;s relationship with the western mainstream was elusive \u2013 all about influence, rather than grabbing the headlines directly itself. There was a lack of true breakthrough titles to follow Akira, which eventually grossed $80m globally. Otomo himself went back to completing the Akira manga and didn&apos;t resurface with another full-length feature until 2004&apos;s Steamboy. Manga Entertainment co-produced Mamoru Oshii&apos;s $10m Ghost in the Shell, which left dropped jaws in its wake but lost money in theatres. Too many foreign distributors focused on the usual talk-heavy techno-orgies (such as Metropolis, Appleseed, Paprika), which left anime firmly mired in geek territory. Fundamentally, anime stayed niche. It was only ever worth around a quarter of a billion dollars annually in exports at its mid-noughties peak \u2013 less than most blockbuster US animations grossed solo. The one Japanese company that broke out big, Studio Ghibli, did so by targeting the family demographic. But its films, carefully tied to the personal cult of Hayao Miyazaki, are so distinctive, so Ghibli, that they don&apos;t seem to belong with traditional anime. They&apos;re a last hurrah for hand-drawn 2D animation in an age of CGI, and there&apos;s a strain running through Ghibli that&apos;s reminiscent of vintage Disney: an emphasis on craftsmanship, a cultural nostalgia and a perfectly pitched sentimentalism. Only the first of those applies to the ruthlessly forward-looking Akira, which hits the ground running as it assembles its science-fiction apocalypse from memories of the second world war, immortalising sensory ephemera in the beats of its glorious animation. 2019 \u2013 Otomo&apos;s era of Neo-Tokyo \u2013 is just over the horizon, but Akira&apos;s futurist soul may well now be a thing of the past.

It sounds like a humdrum church newsletter, but the Yamaguchi-gumi Shinpo is the newly published official magazine of Japan&apos;s most powerful crime syndicate. The magazine, which is not publicly available, has reportedly been distributed among the group&apos;s 27,700 regular members in a bid to raise morale amid tougher anti-gang laws and a slew of bad publicity surrounding the yakuza, Japan&apos;s network of influential, and violent, underworld organisations. The Yamaguchi-gumi, headquartered in the western port city of Kobe, is still the biggest and most feared yakuza group, despite losing 3,300 members last year, according to police. The front page of the magazine, a professionally produced publication featuring the gang&apos;s familiar diamond-shaped logo, carries a piece by its boss, Kenichi Shinoda, instructing younger members to observe traditional yakuza values, including loyalty and discipline. The magazine&apos;s publication, which was reported by the Japanese media, comes soon after an apparent end to a damaging seven-year turf war involving other yakuza groups on the southern island of Kyushu, in which innocent &quot;civilians&quot; were among the victims. &quot;The problems in Kyushu reminded people that the yakuza can be violent and disruptive,&quot; said Jake Adelstein, an expert on the yakuza and author of Tokyo Vice, a memoir of his stint as a crime reporter in the Japanese capital. &quot;The magazine is the Yamaguchi-gumi&apos;s attempt to show the public that it&apos;s an old organisation that upholds traditional Japanese values; that its members are not a bunch of violent thugs like those guys down in Kyushu. &quot;It has sent the magazine only to regular members, but it knew that the details would leak out.&quot; In his column, Shinoda concedes that new anti-gang laws have made it harder for the group to make easy cash. Although membership of the yakuza is not illegal, the gangs&apos; activities are. They are deeply involved in extortion, payday lending, racketeering and blackmail, but have recently moved into white-collar crime, setting up front companies in an attempt to survive. &quot;They may feel that it has become harder to carry on with their activities under anti-mafia ordinances that bar them from opening new bank accounts and signing real estate contracts,&quot; the Mainichi Shimbun quoted a police source as saying. Pressure on yakuza finances intensified last year when the Obama administration said it would start freezing the Yamaguchi-gumi&apos;s US assets and ban it from conducting business in the country. The move came after the US treasury department said the group was earning billions of dollars through drug dealing, human trafficking, money laundering and other cross-border activities. Last year total membership of the yakuza stood at 62,300, down 7,100 from the previous year, according to the national police agency. The Yamaguchi-gumi accounts for about 40% of the total. The magazine may not succeed in recruiting members, but it at least offers light relief to those already leading lives of crime. Along with senior members&apos; diaries of recent fishing trips, there is a section devoted to satirical haiku and pieces on the strategic board games of go and shogi. Newly introduced penalties for individuals and firms that associate with crime groups have hit the once-thriving market in yakuza fanzines, and manga comics detailing the exploits of notorious gangsters have become far less visible on bookstore shelves, said Adelstein. &quot;With yakuza PR fading, this magazine looks like an attempt to fill the gap,&quot; he said."}, {"sentences": ["\u2022 For more of the best independent, cult or classic films and documentaries chosen by Guardian Film, keep an eye on the Guardian screening room Further reading Pablo Berger: &apos;A movie&apos;s like a paella, you put all of your obsessions in there&apos; Akira: the future-Tokyo story that brought anime west Reece Shearsmith: &apos;I&apos;m very unsure of myself as a person&apos; John Cusack: from hearththrob to psychopath Trailer Trash Jane Campion: this much I know This week&apos;s new film events And finally Follow us on Twitter Like us on Facebook"], "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-11T16:21:02Z", "title": "Close up: Disney needs a few dollars more to save The Lone Ranger", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/11/close-up-disney-lone-ranger", "article": "The big story John Carter may not have earned a sequel following the $282m it lost Disney, but it&apos;s found a spiritual successor in The Lone Ranger, a new take on the classic Western serial, which is on course to burn a similar sized hole in Mickey Mouse&apos;s wallet.

On a day when more Americans than expected claimed unemployment benefits, the central bank said the economy was underperforming and still needed very low rates to stay on course for recovery. In morning trading in New York the Dow Jones climbed to 15423, above its all-time closing high of 15409, reached in May this year. The S&amp;P 500 also climbed above its closing record to reach 1,668, following in the footsteps of the FTSE 100, which finished the day 33 points higher at 6539. The Fed statement was widely interpreted as a hardening of views in its Washington headquarters against pressure from investors and many rightwing politicians in favour raising interest rates. By a majority vote, the Fed open markets committee (FOMC) said: &quot;To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase programme ends and the economic recovery strengthens.&quot; The statement ended a month of uncertainty following a June question-and-answer session when Fed chairman Ben Bernanke had appeared to indicate that monetary easing was due to be scaled back before the end of the year. Bernanke&apos;s earlier remarks sent the FTSE 100 into freefall and knocked more than 800 points off the index. Reassuring speeches by Fed staff since then stabilised the atmosphere but failed to reverse the stock market trend significantly. Several policymakers on Capitol Hill have voiced fears that the Fed&apos;s quantitative easing (QE) programme, which involves the central bank creating $1tn (\u00a3660bn) a year of new money, will encourage investments in developing nation currencies, property and other risky assets. Critics of the Fed&apos;s strategy, which has kept interest rates at 0.25% for four years and caused purchase of more than $3tn of government bonds, have also argued the economy is strong enough to withstand a return to &quot;normal&quot; interest rates. Concerns that Tokyo&apos;s commitment to pump huge amounts of yen into Japanese economy to beat deflation was unravelling also fuelled panic on the international money markets. But in an apparent co-ordinated move, the Bank of Japan declared on Thursday that its own version of quantitative easing was improving economic growth and would be expanded over the coming months. BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda said while overseas economies were weaker than expected that would be offset by robust domestic consumer spending and a pickup in capital expenditure. He was confident consumer and business demand will increase, pushing inflation towards its 2% target in roughly two years. The Shanghai composite index reacted to the FOMC&apos;s comments with a 3.2% rise, its strongest gain since January. The index has bounced 12% from its low on June 26, when it hit the lowest point since January 2009. Worries about China&apos;s slowing growth rate have also weighed on global sentiment. Investors in China feared a collapse in demand for Chinese exports should the Fed choke of the US recovery with higher interest rates. Last week the new governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney joined European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi in issuing statements that interest rates would remain low despite the early signs of economic recovery. Carney is due to review the BoE&apos;s strategy for communicating to the markets how and when it intends to raise rates. It is expected he will persuade the nine-member monetary policy committee to adopt a Fed-style formula for issuing forward guidance, but it is not known if the UK will mimic trying a rise in interest rates to a large fall in unemployment. The Fed said it would keep rates low until unemployment fell to 6.5% from its current 7.6% and possibly longer depending on the level of inflation and growth. But Bernanke failed to persuade all FOMC members to sign the statement. Esther George said she was concerned continued high levels of monetary easing &quot;increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations&quot;. She joined hawk James Bullard in voting against the statement. The dissent supported the view that the monthly injection of $85bn into the US economy by the Fed will begin to taper in September, said Capital Economics."}, {"sentences": ["Jonathan Wright World&apos;s Busiest Train Station8pm, Channel 5 Alien visitors watching the daily scenes at Shinjuku station in Tokyo would be forgiven for thinking they were witnessing a form of mass punishment, as 4,000 people are packed \u2013 literally shoved by guards \u2013 into trains every 30 seconds."], "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-12T06:00:00Z", "title": "TV highlights 12/07/2013", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/12/tv-highlights-gmbc-proms-2013", "article": "Live Women&apos;s Football: England v Spain7pm, BBC3 Beaten finalists in the 2009 Women&apos;s Euros, England&apos;s women&apos;s side have seemed a far likelier source of silverware in recent years than their male counterparts.

After Basel and Miami, the leading western art show has invested in the former British colony. Art dealers, collectors and the merely curious enjoyed an artistic &quot;fusion&quot; in late May that mixed bankable western artists with Asian stars. But the east-west paradigm is not the only one at play in the contemporary art market; a pan-Asian shift is under way and local identities are being asserted. The art market, as usually understood by the players in the art world, has moved to Hong Kong to meet Asia, and is being transformed in the process. Unnoticed by the west, the Asia-Pacific region has developed several artistic centres and is now determined to assert its own tastes and preferences, with no regard for what some would call western diktats. This awakening of contemporary art in Asia is backed by abundant regional cash. According to a 2012 study by consultants Capgemini, there are more millionaires in Asia than in the United States. To lure them to the cause of art, quality art fairs have burgeoned since 2007 in Dubai, New Delhi, Hong Kong and Singapore, with the next one, the Sydney Contemporary, due in September. They share a common characteristic, which is that the Asian component dominates. The stars here are not British (Damien Hirst) or American (Jeff Koons and Richard Prince), but Chinese (Liu Wei), Iranian (Farhad Moshiri) and Indonesian (Eko Nugroho). Every country begins its artistic initiation with its own artists. People start out liking what they know \u2013 in other words what they recognise. In Asia, collectors are paying big money to acquire works by artists perceived as national heroes, and consequently propelling artists with only a local reputation and the occasional mention in public catalogues, to stardom. Few people outside Indonesia have heard of Nyoman Masriadi, but in 2008 he sold a painting for $1m at Sotheby&apos;s. For years, countries remained focused on their own artistic scenes, but today mentalities are changing. Collectors are no longer satisfied with pushing up the value of their national treasures but are broadening their spectrum to include the whole of Asia. That is where the novelty lies. Previously, after getting a national collection together, Asian art lovers would eye the west but ignore their immediate neighbours. &quot;Today if you don&apos;t know what&apos;s happening in Indonesia or South Korea, then you&apos;re not going to understand what&apos;s happening in Belgium,&quot; said Hallam Chow, a Hong Kong-based art collector who buys works by Indonesian artists as well as Chinese ones. Some dealers such as Jean-Marc Decrop, who specialises in Chinese contemporary art, expect the Middle East and Far East to draw closer artistically. &quot;Most Indonesian collectors I know are Muslim and do the Hajj pilgrimage. I know at least five who would like to collect art from the Arab world,&quot; he said. He has just opened the first gallery in Hong Kong to bring together contemporary Arab, Iranian and Turkish artists along with young artists from South-East Asia, Tibet and Central Asia. Asian institutions are following suit. In 2012, the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo held an exhibition called Arab Express. One consequence of this interregional dialogue is that the west is no longer the sole reference point for Asian artists who are now equally happy to be exhibiting in Asia. &quot;What&apos;s happening in London or New York remains important of course, but so is what&apos;s happening in Mumbai, Jogjakarta or Tokyo,&quot; observed Philip Tinari, director of the Ullens Centre for Contemporary Art  in Beijing, which hosted the Indian Highway exhibition in 2012. This all takes time. The mainland Chinese did not develop a sudden passion for Indian art after the Indian Highway exhibition, but the seeds were sown. The market will require structuring for them to grow. A well-organised art market is based on a foundation of collectors, experts and art critics as well as museums, galleries and auction houses (in other words a first and second market), in addition to framers, insurers, transporters and even specialised bankers. Only Japan and two of the four &quot;Asian Dragons&quot;, Taiwan and South Korea, currently have all the components of this artistic ecosystem. In South Korea powerful galleries have been forming the tastes of rich buyers for the past 30 years, while in Taiwan collectors are mainly descended from the Japan-influenced elite that emerged during the Japanese occupation (1895-1945) and the Chinese bourgeoisie that fled from the mainland with Chiang Kai-shek in 1949. Elsewhere the situation varies considerably from one country to another, with a massive contrast between the millionaire Chinese artists and the &quot;peasant&quot; artists in countries that are still essentially rural, such as Indonesia and the Philippines. But the curiosity is there. Not all Asian countries have achieved the same degree of maturity but they are all preparing to meet their cultural ambitions by opening museums. Some countries such as Singapore have a policy of supporting art and culture, and even the Chinese government has understood that imperialism can be cultural too. According to the British monthly, The Art Newspaper, the number of museums in China rose from 21 in 1949 to 348 in 1978 and 3,400 today, 175 of which are dedicated to visual art. Many however, are still empty shells. In India things are moving slowly but surely. Contemporary art is still only for a tiny elite and New Delhi&apos;s National Museum of Modern Art has a low visitor rate of 18,000 per year (the Louvre, in contrast, has 10 million). Despite that, Kolkata is planning to open the Kolkata Museum of Modern Art in 2015, a 23,000 sq metre building designed by Herzog &amp; De Meuron that will mainly serve Asian art. That is also the ambition of the M+ Museum of Visual Culture, which is due to open in Hong Kong by the end of 2017 and will be twice as large as London&apos;s Tate Modern. The director, Lars Nittve, intends to devote 70% of his acquisitions budget of $218m spread over five years to Asian artists. The curators of the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi, also due to open in 2017, will devote 50% of their collection to Asia, in the broadest geographical sense of the word. Asia&apos;s emergence on the artistic scene is therefore more that a mere geographic shift. Western sellers are getting in touch with Asian buyers and this is triggering a radical overhaul reminiscent of the migration of the art markets from the European capitals to New York in the early 20th century and the dominance of the American schools that followed. Asia is as diverse as it is vast and we may soon expect a multitude of Asian schools, art fairs and new collectors endeavouring to show their supremacy to the rest of the world.

And yet \u2013 come on, confess \u2013 we like literary prizes as well. I&apos;m not talking about the winning, though winning them can \u2013 and probably should \u2013 produce a potent, mingled sense of scepticism and pleasure. I&apos;m talking about the divide we may feel upon hearing that a certain book has won an award. On one hand, there&apos;s the prize&apos;s obvious absurdity \u2013 its inevitable subjectivity, not to mention the plain silliness of deeming one book better than another. (Quick, off the top of your head: is Middlemarch better than Bleak House?) On the other, there is our rightful devotion to the whole &quot;ta-da&quot; business: the pronouncement, the trumpet blare, the laying of the laurel wreath on the most gifted head in the arena. It&apos;s human. There is, however, a certain question that tends to arise among juries whenever prizes are being contemplated. Is it the fundamental purpose of the prize to acknowledge the writer who has veered closest to greatness that year (or decade, or century), regardless of the boxcar-loads of accolades that may already have been delivered; or is it to draw attention to an extremely good and possibly significant writer who seems to be passing more or less unnoticed? I don&apos;t think such bifurcation is called for where a contemporary prize is concerned \u2013 after all, history&apos;s verdict is still out on newer books. But I feel torn between naming one of the most obvious 50 or so best books, and naming a less-than-deified book. The list of undeniable greats is predictable, and so a little dull. However, if I were to name a book that has been (in my estimation) under-recognised, I&apos;d be implying that some lesser-known book leaves Middlemarch and Bleak House in the dust. And so, at the risk of disappointing those who like a savage singularity, and if we&apos;re talking about every book ever written in English, I have to suggest two Folio prizes. One for the greatest, and one for the wrongfully under-appreciated. The greatest I&apos;m afraid there&apos;s more equivocation to come. I&apos;d award the greatness prize to two books: James Joyce&apos;s Ulysses and Virginia Woolf&apos;s To the Lighthouse. I&apos;m not talking about a tie. I&apos;m talking about two seminal works of literature that should be considered in tandem. Let&apos;s pause to remember that the novel, in English, is less than 300 years old. Given its youth, its track record is remarkable. We&apos;ve had, in relatively short order, Pride and Prejudice, Wuthering Heights, The House of the Seven Gables, Moby-Dick, The Golden Bowl, The Sound and the Fury, and The Great Gatsby \u2013 just to name a few (Middlemarch and Bleak House have probably been sufficiently acknowledged already). For me, however, it was the modernists who engendered the most significant literary revolution. Suddenly, in the early 20th century, novels had as much to do with language as they did with events. They were about outwardly ordinary lives, and thereby established that there&apos;s no such thing as an &quot;ordinary&quot; life; there is only inadequate appreciation of humanity. And a novel was no longer meant as moral instruction for readers who were, perhaps, ever-so-slightly in need of it. Ulysses is, of course, Godzilla, and we are the citizens of Tokyo. Joyce&apos;s book changed everything. It&apos;s the novel most likely to inspire in a writer the question: &quot;Oh, well, now that&apos;s been done, why bother any more?&quot; To the Lighthouse doesn&apos;t slay and pillage in the same way, yet it is every bit as revolutionary as Ulysses, and for some of the same reasons. Like Joyce, Woolf knew the entire world could be seen by looking not only at the big picture, but also the small one, in more or less the way a physicist who studies subatomic particles is witness to miracles every bit as astonishing as those observed by an astronomer. Unlike Joyce, Woolf didn&apos;t wish to devastate her readers. Nor did she need her readers to comprehend how brilliant she was. And, of course, she cared more than Joyce did about the lives of women. If Joyce, in Ulysses, is the vengeful god \u2013 if he&apos;s the father who gives his children the occasional, all-too-clear sense of their own limitations \u2013 Woolf, in To the Lighthouse, is Winnicott&apos;s good-enough mother, the one who&apos;s able to love her children while simultaneously urging them towards lives of their own, beyond her reach or influence. For all their genius, both authors arrived with limitations, as humans always do. Woolf was a snob, and could not, would not, write about sex. Joyce was something of a bully on the page: he cared, at times (or so it seems to me), a bit more about his readers&apos; apprehension of his immense talent than he did about the readers themselves \u2013 or, for that matter, about the characters in his book. Mom is adoring and nurturing and ever-so-slightly out of touch. Dad is potent and challenging and ever-so-slightly uncaring. And so, I nominate Ulysses and To the Lighthouse, not by way of a draw, but as a pair \u2013 a marriage, if you will. A partnership in which each member is enhanced by the other, which creates a two-part entity more influential, and more important, than either individual. The under-appreciated As I&apos;ve said, if there&apos;s an unknown or neglected book on the same level as Ulysses or To the Lighthouse, it&apos;s unknown to me. It&apos;s also neglected by me, along with everybody else. There are, however, a number of books which (in my opinion) should be read by everyone, and haven&apos;t been. In alphabetical order, the prize(s) go to: The House in Paris by Elizabeth Bowen White Noise by Don DeLillo Train Dreams by Denis Johnson Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy The Little Disturbances of Man by Grace Paley Light Years by James Salter And that, surely, is more than enough out of me. \u2022 Michael Cunningham is an Academy member of the Folio prize, which is running daily blogs on the books academicians wish to see retrospectively awarded the prize."}, {"sentences": ["Its founder, Rebecca MacKinnon (who is a friend), is a senior research fellow at the New America Foundation, former CNN Beijing and Tokyo bureau chief, co-founder of Global Voices Online, and author of last year&apos;s influential Consent of the Networked: The Worldwide Struggle for Internet Freedom."], "tags": ["Internet", "Technology", "Technology sector", "Privacy", "US constitution and civil liberties", "Civil liberties - international", "Law", "The NSA files", "Surveillance", "US news", "World news", "Data protection", "Yahoo", "Twitter", "ISPs", "NSA"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-16T19:28:25Z", "title": "The internet advocates crusading for our privacy and security | Dan Gillmor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/16/internet-advocates-crusading-privacy-security", "article": "Thanks to the NSA leaks and resulting media interest in surveillance, the public is awakening to the threats posed by ubiquitous information dragnets. But our awareness is grossly incomplete \u2013 and that applies not just to direct surveillance by governments that do their best to keep it secret. Our knowledge and understanding of how tech and communications companies behave is also shallow, at best. Several valuable projects already seek to measure government censorship of the internet. In particular, the OpenNet Initiative has been doing deep research into exposing state-mandated filtering and censorship around the world. (Note: OpenNet is operated primarily by university research centers, including the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society, with which I&apos;ve been affiliated for many years.) The corporate actors in the burgeoning surveillance states have not gone unnoticed. But we know far too little about their practices, and even worthy efforts like the Global Network Initiative \u2013 aimed at &quot;advancing freedom of expression and privacy&quot; in the tech sphere by creating operating principles for those companies \u2013 have proceeded at a snail&apos;s pace. That&apos;s not surprising, given the organization&apos;s varied participants and their goals. Others have been working to help people learn to what extent they can trust at least a few of these companies to protect their data when government snoops come calling. The Electronic Frontier Foundation&apos;s &quot;Who Has Your Back&quot; project has surveyed a number of US companies in the internet ecosystem to create star ratings across six categories, including whether the company requires a warrant before giving up information to law enforcement. The least protective were Verizon, which got zero stars in this year&apos;s survey; one star each for Apple and AT&amp;T; the best were Sonic.net, an internet service provider, and Twitter, with six stars each. (The EFF gave Yahoo a special star for its recently revealed \u2013 but ultimately unsuccessful attempt \u2013 to protect users&apos; privacy from what it believed to be overbearing government surveillance; however, Yahoo ranks low overall in the survey.) Meanwhile, the Measurement Lab project has created a platform for researchers to deploy tools that help them measure how the internet is working, including such things as bandwidth. The Neubot, for example, is an Italian project designed to measure ISPs&apos; performance on &quot;network neutrality&quot;. Another promising new project, &quot;Ranking Digital Rights&quot;, wants to go deeper and more broadly into measuring and publicizing corporate data and communications responsibility. Its founder, Rebecca MacKinnon (who is a friend), is a senior research fellow at the New America Foundation, former CNN Beijing and Tokyo bureau chief, co-founder of Global Voices Online, and author of last year&apos;s influential Consent of the Networked: The Worldwide Struggle for Internet Freedom. Where the EFF focuses on American companies, MacKinnon is looking globally. She and her collaborators will be asking companies around the world to answer detailed questions about how they operate, with special attention to human rights issues. By publicizing the ones that have the best practices, she hopes, more will have an incentive to move in that direction. She sees this work as &quot;part of an emerging ecosystem of projects whose goal is to help the public to obtain measurable information what companies and governments are doing with and to the internet. The better-informed we are, the more we can do to make sure what&apos;s happening is in our interests and is accountable to us. All of these initiatives are useful, even essential. Yet, to operate in our modern world, we make a series of &quot;agreements&quot; with companies selling us services: they will collect and use data about us in return for providing the services. This is true for financial institutions, internet companies, hardware vendors and all the others. The agreements are one-sided: we say yes, and send our money or use the services in return for vast privacy invasions, or else we are excluded. But can we, using data from the EFF et al, genuinely challenge the increasingly tight controls companies and governments are exerting? How can we shame an ISP into doing the right thing when the ISP is either effectively a monopoly or part of a cozy duopoly, as is the case in much of the US? Can we depend on Google to protect our data \u2013 assuming, as the company swears, that it&apos;s doing the best it can today \u2013 when management of the company moves into new hands someday? And can we ever trust the tech industry in the context of regimes that create secret laws and regulations that make a mockery of what few privacy rights we have? As noted previously in this space, I&apos;m absolutely convinced that there&apos;s an opportunity for big companies and entrepreneurs alike to create products and services that are designed from the ground up with privacy and security in mind. But measurements and data of the sort these organizations are providing is going to be essential along the way.

It fills no fewer than five adjacent Earl&apos;s Court-sized exhibition centres with a vast array of cultural paraphernalia, including entire halls dedicated to anime, fashion and art. It is so immensely popular that, in 2005, the event had to be cancelled due to fears that the unmanageable numbers of incoming attendees could not be accommodated safely. When you enter the cavernous Paris-Nord Villepinte exhibition centre, the first Far Eastern import that greets you is the temperature. It&apos;s the heat of a Tokyo summer, which is perhaps best described as the heat of a parked car, leather sweltering in the noonday glare, a jungle air that dulls the lungs. One enterprising company near the entrance doles out sensu \u2013 paper-folding fans used to paddle the heat away \u2013 in exchange for your email address. Send me all the spam you can conjure, my resourceful tomodachi: just give me the damned heat-beater. This warmth isn&apos;t just a product of the weather, although Paris is baking in a gas mark 7 sort of throb this weekend. It&apos;s the people. Over the exhibition&apos;s four days, a quarter of a million Franco-Japanophiles move through the exhibition centre, chomping sushi, drinking cups of clear sake and clutching paper bags filled with Jap-tat. Some of the visitors come dressed in traditional kimono, but many more are decked out in cos-play, meticulously costumed to look like their favourite video game or anime characters. It&apos;s one of the few times when Princess Mononoke rubs a fur-draped shoulder with Street Fighter&apos;s Chun Li. At least, one of the few times when there isn&apos;t a rotund man dressed as a Marvel superhero taking snaps of the encounter from the sidelines: unlike this week&apos;s Comic-Con, this expo is purely eastern in its focus. But while the bustling manga and anime stalls bespeak an industry in rude health, the video game contingent appears less flushed with success. Apart from Nintendo \u2013 whose huge, white, spacious stand becomes a hub of StreetPass activity for visitors as they happily queue to play the company&apos;s forthcoming Wii-U titles \u2013 Square-Enix (Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts) and Namco-Bandai (Pac-Man, Tekken) are the only Japanese video game publishers to make a show. Sony, whose PlayStation 4 console will launch later this year, is nowhere to be seen, having long discarded its Japan heritage from its western corporate image. Indeed, the heart of the new PlayStation has, for the first time in the company&apos;s history, been designed by an American, one-time Atari employee Mark Cerny. The great decline The apologetic thinness of video game presence in the Villepinte exhibition centre is understandable: the Japanese have little to celebrate when it comes to the industry they helped define. In 2002, the country was the dominant cultural force in the medium, accounting for around 50% of the global market. In 2010, that share had shrunk to just 10%, a decline fuelled by a concoction of economic recession, the rise of American studios and publishers and, some would argue, a whiff of complacency. Japan or, more specifically, Nintendo, rescued the video game industry from the great crash of the early 1980s, brought about by American greed and unscrupulousness. Video games were Made in Japan, even if specific titles weren&apos;t. But in 2009, Square-Enix&apos;s then-president Yoichi Wada described Japan&apos;s video game industry as having become a &quot;closed environment&quot; and &quot;almost xenophobic&quot; in the Financial Times. He admitted a &quot;clear lag with the US.&quot; The same year Keiji Inafune, one of Capcom&apos;s star designers (in the late 1980s he designed Street Fighter&apos;s Ryu and Ken), said the Japanese games industry was &quot;finished&quot;. Another Square-Enix executive, Kouji Taguchi, claimed the company had only managed to save face by acquiring Eidos, the western publisher of the Tomb Raider series, describing the nation as having experienced a &quot;humiliating decline&quot; with regard to games. At the Japan Expo earlier this month, there were many opinions on how the Japanese industry reached this low point, but few offered solutions. &quot;There are so many great challenges facing the Japanese games industry right now,&quot; said Katsuhiro Harada, project director at Namco Bandai and the creative face of the Tekken series. &quot;It&apos;s not that there&apos;s a lack of ideas from Japanese developers, it&apos;s just that the system has changed. Japanese games companies are entirely focused on short-term profits today. &quot;In video games, it&apos;s very hard to take your idea and have it ready in a format that people can see and buy into. That takes money and months of work. It used to be that one company would come up with an idea, create it, take it to market and then, if it was a success, improve it in a sequel based on feedback. Now it&apos;s all divided up to spread the risks. One company will have the idea. Another company will make the game; still another will sell it and liaise directly with the consumer. I think this lack of a unified creative process has had a profound effect on the industry.&quot; Pac in the day     Pac-Man Party 3D \u2013 there\u2019s obviously nothing for Japanese video game creators to worry about.    Ryo Mito, another Namco-Bandai employee and producer of Saint Seiya, a fighting game adaptation of a popular Japanese anime series, believes that Japan is still king when it comes to building strong series. &quot;Japanese game creators are more successful at creating characters that companies can then build a series around,&quot; he said. But for Komori Kumito, the man now responsible for Pac-Man, the medium&apos;s oldest megastar character, basing games around a fictional personality has problems over the long term. &quot;We&apos;re still eager to make Pac-Man games for the people who are familiar with the arcade games from the 1980s. That&apos;s why we have the Championship Edition titles. But, on the other hand, they are now the generation of mothers and fathers. Their children don&apos;t necessarily know who Pac-Man is.&quot; For Namco-Bandai, the solution has been an animated series featuring the character that&apos;s aimed specifically at young children. But Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, which debuted in the US and the UK in June 2013, is an American and Canadian co-production, hardly the great Japanese cultural export that the original arcade game represented. &quot;Pac-Man is loved in Japan, but in America and Europe he&apos;s even more popular,&quot; says Kumito. &quot;I don&apos;t know why. Perhaps it&apos;s because Pac-Man appeals to [the] female market as well? Perhaps this is the solution for Japanese games.&quot; The Japanese video game industry has certainly failed to stay abreast of its western rivals on the technological front. Just last week Hideo Kojima, director of the Metal Gear Solid series and Fox Engine, the highest profile game engine in Japan tweeted, somewhat mournfully, that the Grand Theft Auto V trailer made him depressed as &quot;I don&apos;t think our V [Metal Gear Solid V] can reach that level.&quot; Hideo Baba, producer of the Tales series of RPGs, which enjoy a huge audience in Japan but struggle outside of their home nation, agrees. &quot;In western development, we see a high degree of realism and detail,&quot; he said. &quot;To be honest, I don&apos;t know if we can compete on that front. But we can compete on anime-style visuals, which I think are still beautiful. We have to keep working on this to make this style more recognised by a broader audience.&quot; But for Hashimoto Kunio, producer of the Dragon Ball series of video games based on the hugely popular anime, fundamental changes in approach are needed. &quot;Japan has to become more aggressive and offensive in order to find something new in games,&quot; he said. &quot;Of course, in terms of working with existing IP, if something&apos;s good and has an audience, the trick is to mix in new ideas with the old. But we always need to bring new things to our video games, otherwise people quickly grow bored.&quot; All of the negativity surrounding the Japanese video game industry has, arguably, shaken the nation&apos;s designers, producing a new strain of self-doubt. In the UK, the video game industry continues to lobby hard for tax breaks for games that pass a cultural test by demonstrating that they communicate a certain British-ness. It&apos;s a worthwhile campaign, and one that has benefitted the British film industry greatly in the past. But the truth is that all creative goods exhibit the cultural conditions in which they were created. It&apos;s not only the art style or music composition that reveals something of the nation of origin. Our interests, preoccupations values and worldview all infuse the things we create. With that in mind, it is perhaps disheartening to hear Koji Nakajima, producer of the One Piece game series, say at the Japan Expo that, &quot;cultural barriers need to be overcome territory by territory. You can&apos;t just aim for the world. You have to begin by learning about a certain culture and tailoring what we create accordingly.&quot; America is the greatest consumer of video games and, as such, exerts tremendous influence over a publisher or developer&apos;s creative process. Many designers curve their creativity towards the American market or demographic (real or imagined). But Japan cannot lead by following. It&apos;s a lesson that appears yet to be learned."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), reeling from recent criticism of its handling of contaminated water at the plant, said the reactor&apos;s spent fuel pool was stable, adding that there had been no significant rises in radiation levels in the vicinity."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan", "World news", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-18T09:46:00Z", "title": "Fukushima rainfall caused steam above reactor, says Tepco", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/18/fukushima-steam-reactor-radiation-levels", "article": "The operator of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant said on Thursday that radiation levels were stable after vapour was detected coming from one of the three reactors that went into meltdown after the triple disaster in Japan in March 2011. Video images showed the vapour, which is thought to be steam, rising from the damaged building housing reactor No 3. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), reeling from recent criticism of its handling of contaminated water at the plant, said the reactor&apos;s spent fuel pool was stable, adding that there had been no significant rises in radiation levels in the vicinity. A worker monitoring live camera images noticed that what appeared to be steam was hovering just above the primary containment vessel at 8.20am on Thursday. The vapour was still visible two hours later, reports said. Tepco said rainfall on Wednesday night could have been the cause. &quot;We think it&apos;s possible that rain made its way through the reactor building and having fallen on the primary containment vessel, which is hot, evaporated and created steam,&quot; said Mayumi Yoshida, a Tepco spokeswoman. The reactor is one of three at Fukushima Daiichi that went into meltdown after a tsunami knocked out the plant&apos;s regular and emergency power supplies on the afternoon of 11 March 2011. The building that houses reactor No 3 was also badly damaged by a hydrogen explosion in the aftermath of the tsunami. Radiation levels near the top of the building are still too high for workers to enter. Instead, they are using remote-controlled machinery to remove rubble and tsunami debris. Fuel inside the damaged reactors melted and is believed to be resting at the bottom of their primary containment vessels, where it is being cooled by huge quantities of water fed through a network of pipes and hoses. Tepco has admitted it is struggling to create enough storage space at the site for contaminated water. In April, the firm requested permission to channel water containing comparatively low levels of radiation into the sea, but the move was opposed by local fishermen. The vapour release comes soon after Japan&apos;s new nuclear regulation authority said it suspected that radioactive water used to cool the reactors was leaking into the Pacific ocean from underground.

Just four years after the press mauled his X-Men Origins story the fast-healing mutant is back. The wounds have sealed ($179m at the box office makes a good salve) and the purists are on board, wooed by the prospect of an adventure based on one of the character&apos;s best-loved comic book series: Chris Claremont and Frank Miller&apos;s Japan-set 1982 saga. Director James Mangold&apos;s take on Marvel&apos;s head boy transplants Wolverine to Tokyo, where the billionaire head of Yashida Corp, an old friend who was with Logan at the bombing of Nagasaki, is on his deathbed. He&apos;s offering Wolverine a chance at redemption. By passing on his healing power he can gain mortality and earn a chance to live as normal a life as a man with foot-long claws and indestructible metal grafted to his skeleton could ask for. Then \u2013 wouldn&apos;t you know it \u2013 the old man ups and dies too soon, leaving his granddaughter a fortune and the movie a reason to rattle on with Logan slicing &apos;n&apos; dicing inheritance-hungry yakuza. Mangold, writer of Girl, Interrupted and director of 3:10 to Yuma and Walk the Line, is more actors&apos; director than action man. He likes Logan more than the Wolverine. The film&apos;s opening hour is an evenly-paced gangster thriller that toys with the character as cultural export. He&apos;s a snarling beast, adrift in a society that runs on the individual&apos;s commitment to keeping their true nature concealed. There&apos;s obvious parallels with Logan&apos;s own struggle to contain his bestial nature, at least until Mangold unsheathes the set pieces and lets the Wolverine run riot. It&apos;s here \u2013 in the middle of the roaring and cutting that we&apos;ve seen rejigged many, many times before \u2013 that our interest falls to pieces. The fights are predictable, the scenery disappointingly drab considering the potential in Tokyo&apos;s neon-lit wonder-world. Wolverine&apos;s mutant foe \u2013 a slinky, acid-spitter called Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) \u2013 slides in and out of the narrative, shedding skin and goodwill with each appearance.            Hugh Jackman \u2013 now on his sixth turn as the character \u2013 knows what the Wolverine needs of him. Yet there&apos;s a hint of fatigue that hours in the gym and a lock-iron perma-scowl can&apos;t fix. Wolverine&apos;s back story has become bigger and itchier with each film since Bryan Singer&apos;s ensemble movies. This time around the past is represented by some truly bizarre fantasy sequences between Jackman and Famke Janssen as Jean Grey, the lover who Logan had to sacrifice in X-Men: The Last Stand. Janssen spends her screen time beckoning from the beyond in a swishy low cut nightie. The beyond looks like a spotlessly white villa on the dull side of Ibiza. You can understand Logan&apos;s inclination to get up and continue fighting. The X-Men films started promisingly, spun into a dive and seemed sucessfully rebooted thanks to 2011 prequel X-Men: First Class. We&apos;re now at a point where the franchise has been snicked into strands so twisted from each other that its getting tough to trace the genealogy. The flat hammerblows of The Wolverine bear little relation to the zing and pop of Matthew Vaughn&apos;s colourful treatment. Inconsistency is inevitable in a world that&apos;s constantly being dug up and done over, but it leaves us no time to fall in love with anything being flung at us. Heroes wander in, heroes wander out. Wolverine \u2013 the indestrucible centrepiece of the buffet&apos;s spread \u2013 isn&apos;t waning, but our interest is. Here a superhero strives to be ordinary. As Marvel continues to claw the character&apos;s mystique away, he&apos;s starting to get his wish."}, {"sentences": ["The 2010 version came just four months ahead of the World Cup and the anger inside Tokyo&apos;s National Stadium in 2010 as Japan lost 3-1 at home to South Korea and barely scraped a draw against the boys from Beijing was palpable."], "tags": ["Australia", "Japan", "South Korea", "China", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-19T02:29:37Z", "title": "East Asian Cup offers Brazil 2014 chances for uncapped Socceroos", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jul/19/east-asian-cup-australia-south-korea-football", "article": "Any doubts about the wisdom of inviting Australia to participate in the 2013 East Asian Cup should have been dispelled on Tuesday as the national team coach Holger Osieck revealed that the Socceroos had discussed boycotting their debut tournament. The German was angry at the hassle involved in getting Japanese and Chinese clubs to release his players. &quot;After some internal discussion and in the spirit of fair play, we decided to go... although the spirit of fair play is unilateral,&quot; he said memorably. Bickering on and off the field is a time-honoured East Asian tradition. Australia are entering into the spirit of things and dipping their toes in a football region of considerable history and intense rivalry. The East Asian Cup, which permanently features China, Japan and South Korea and one qualifier (this time Australia) who play each other in the round-robin style, is a strange tournament. It is supposed to be a biennial affair but two of its five editions have ended up being delayed a year. Nobody really notices when it&apos;s not there but when it actually kicks off, it can sometimes really kick off with passions running as high as some of China&apos;s tackles in the infamously bruising 2008 edition. It all reminds a little of England&apos;s big boys meeting each other in the early rounds of the League Cup. The trophy is not that important (Japan don&apos;t really care that they have never won it; South Korea fired their coach shortly after winning the 2003 edition), most of their stars are missing but they certainly don&apos;t want to lose to their rivals. South Korea love nothing more than beating Japan, China love nothing more than beating Japan and South Korea, while Japan love nothing more than pretending to be above it all. And Australia? That remains to be seen. Not all would have been too downbeat at a Green and Gold boycott. North Korea and Hong Kong, who have to qualify for the competition, were not too keen on the invitation being sent down under in the first place. The bigger boys felt however that Australia would add to the value of the tournament and have perhaps been proven right with the fact that the addition of the Socceroos means that three of the four teams involved will be at the 2014 World Cup. The coaches of South Korea, Japan and Australia will have an eye and a half on Rio while in Seoul. They will also be glad, for different reasons, that European-based stars are absent. Osieck has been accused of sticking by the old guard and not giving youth a genuine chance. The criticism ebbed after a strong finish in qualification diluted memories of earlier struggles and if the German can coax some strong performances from an untested team, his stock will rise higher than Tim Cahill at the far post. Brazil 2014 may be distant on the horizons of A-League youngsters such as Connor Pain, Trent Sainsbury and Mitchell Duke, just three of eight uncapped players, but at least it is visible. Some competition for the aging central defensive pairing of Lucas Neill and Sasa Ognenovski would not go amiss and a genuine goalscorer and a left-back would be nice too. After the trials and tribulations of qualification, Osieck will welcome three relatively-pressure free games in a week against decent opposition. Saturday&apos;s match in Seoul will be a tough introduction for any young Socceroo as it is the first in charge for South Korea&apos;s coach Hong Myung-bo. The captain of the 2002 World Cup was a legend of Asian football even before he led the Under-20 team to the last eight of the 2009 World Cup and the Olympic team to bronze in 2012. He now takes over a divided squad that limped over the line to Brazil in a forgettable qualification campaign. Korean football is still reeling at the storm \u2013 somewhat overblown- around English Premier League midfielder Ki Sung-yeung and Hong&apos;s predecessor Choi Kang-hee. Two days after Hong took the job on 1 July, Choi revealed splits in the Taeguk Warriors between Europeann and Korea-based players. The next day, 18-month old postings on the Facebook account of Swansea City&apos;s Ki Sung-yeung were made public. &quot;\u2026I bet everyone now knows that the team needs players from overseas,&quot; Ki had written. &quot;He [Choi] shouldn&apos;t have touched us, and I hope he doesn&apos;t show his proud face again. Watch out.&quot; Ki&apos;s time, and inevitable apology, in front of the Seoul media will come but, fortunately for the new boss, not just yet.  Some have blamed Ki&apos;s attitude, relatively brash for a Korean player, on a three year stint spent as a schoolboy in Brisbane but that is not going to add any extra spice to the opener. Since joining Asia in 2006, it is with Japan that the Socceroos have developed a rapport. Their meeting next Thursday in the sleepy Korean city of Hwaseong will not have quite the same intensity as their 1-1 draw last month when Japan qualified for the World Cup and Australia turned their campaign around. The Samurai Blue&apos;s road to Brazil was much smoother than their rivals but coach Alberto Zaccheroni is suddenly on the backfoot after the whitewash in the Confederations Cup and one win in the last seven. Zac, like Osieck accused of being overly faithful to a group of players, has named an experimental J-League squad. China have no World Cup to prepare for and no big-league European stars to be shorn of but this experienced squad does have a great desire to put a terrible June behind them. The last of the three home losses was a 5-1 thrashing handed out by a young Thai team. That was not even the real surprise. What really shocked was the fact that there was room for the stock of the national team to sink even lower among fans and media. It was the straw that broke Jose Camacho&apos;s back and the former boss of Spain and Real Madrid was finally fired. Fu Bo is the caretaker but the China FA wants Marcello Lippi, currently in charge of champions Guangzhou Evergrande, to take over but the Italian does not need the hassle. If China can repeat 2010, all will be happy. Three years ago in Japan, lifting the trophy was overshadowed by a first-ever victory over South Korea. It only took 29 attempts \u2013 no wonder the Chinese media talked of curing &apos;Koreaphobia&apos;.  There are other memories that stand out since it all started a decade ago. Lee Eul-yong&apos;s slapping of Li Yi of China in 2003 is still talked about to this day by fans in South Korea. The same supporters also cheered on their northern brothers to victory over Japan in 2005 on a dramatic night in Daejeon. In 2008. China&apos;s roughhouse tactics, especially against Japan, made the eyes water and Chong Tae Se, North Korea&apos;s hotshot who became famous for public tears at the World Cup in South Africa, announced his arrival on the continental scene with scorchers against the Samurai Blue and the Taeguk Warriors. The 2010 version came just four months ahead of the World Cup and the anger inside Tokyo&apos;s National Stadium in 2010 as Japan lost 3-1 at home to South Korea and barely scraped a draw against the boys from Beijing was palpable.  That&apos;s the East Asia Cup - the tournament that nobody cares about until it actually starts. Australia already seem to have it sussed off the pitch, it remains to be seen what happens on it."}, {"sentences": ["Young and Chris Smalling are due to join United in Tokyo next week, after recovering from injuries, while Nani remains at home.", "He doesn&apos;t want to come in and say give me a three-year bedding in time, I can just dilly-dally and be second or third.&quot; United now fly on to Tokyo and the third leg of the tour before finishing in Hong Kong."], "tags": ["David Moyes", "Manchester United", "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Chelsea", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-20T14:56:24Z", "title": "Manchester United's David Moyes ready for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's mind games", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/20/david-moyes-jose-mourinho", "article": "David Moyes has no concerns over any psychological pressure Jos\u00e9 Mourinho may try to exert, with the new Manchester United manager saying he is fully prepared should his Chelsea counterpart engage in mind games this\u00a0season. Moyes, speaking after overseeing United&apos;s 5-1 win over the A-League All Stars in Sydney, was asked if he was expecting any such ploys from the Portuguese. &quot;If you&apos;re from Glasgow you quite enjoy those kind of things, so bring it on.&quot; Moyes said this lightheartedly but he was also serious, and his intent to defend United&apos;s title keenly was illustrated in the professional manner of the win over the Australian side. &quot;It was a good performance. We could maybe have scored a few more goals \u2013 we hit the post as well \u2013 and had one or two chances,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought we stepped up and looked a bit more ready, although the temperature suited us a bit more than in Thailand.&quot; Moyes was content with the encouraging performances throughout his side, with the goalscorers Robin van Persie, Danny Welbeck and Jesse Lingard \u2013 the latter two scoring twice \u2013 all impressive. Van Persie was making his first appearance under Moyes, having joined the pre-season tour when United reached Sydney. After seeing the striker come on as a second-half replacement and score in the 86th minute, Moyes said: &quot;To get Robin back into the games was important, but it was also impressive that Danny got a couple of goals. I told him that he could have scored four or five, but you have to keep getting there to score and he did so. &quot;I have said to him that if he continues to work as hard for the team as he has been doing he will get his rewards. He made the keeper save with his feet, was a bit unlucky at other times, had some great runs and I think he showed a bit of versatility about himself. &quot;Jesse played well and I was hoping he would get a hat-trick. For a young boy [of 20] to get that for United would be a big thing. Not only did he play well, he worked really hard and showed a lot of maturity. It is good that I could see Jesse, Adnan [Januzaj] and Michael Keane in the second half. [Wilfried] Zaha also started his first game and he was unlucky not to score, and he showed moments that nearly got you out of your seat. That was a promising night for him.&quot; United lined up in their familiar 4-2\u20113-1 and Moyes stated that this may be his base formation as his hope is that he can be fluid in his tactics this season. &quot;I hope my systems will be flexible, but the basis is that it forms a basic structure and we can add different types of players when the likes of Nani, Ashley Young come back,&quot; he said. Young and Chris Smalling are due to join United in Tokyo next week, after recovering from injuries, while Nani remains at home. Rio Ferdinand, replaced by Keane at half-time, stated that he would have picked Moyes as Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s successor if asked to find the Scot&apos;s replacement. &quot;We&apos;ve got a manager who&apos;s very enthusiastic,&quot; Ferdinand told Sydney&apos;s Daily Telegraph. &quot;He&apos;s young and has the desire and appetite to be successful. After the manager we had, that was very much needed and he&apos;s someone I would have chosen. He&apos;s not someone who is looking to come in for three or four years \u2013 he&apos;d love to replicate what the last manager has done. There were people who&apos;d have come into the job, who maybe wouldn&apos;t have wanted to be here for that amount of time. I&apos;m sure the new manager sees this as a job for the long term.&quot; Despite Moyes signing a six-year contract, Ferdinand knows he will have little time to settle in. &quot;You can&apos;t get away from the fact that the fans, and us as players, expect to win,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve been used to it, so to say that the fans won&apos;t mind, that we should give the manager a bit of time to bed in, is lying. We want to win. And I am sure he is the same. He doesn&apos;t want to come in and say give me a three-year bedding in time, I can just dilly-dally and be second or third.&quot; United now fly on to Tokyo and the third leg of the tour before finishing in Hong Kong.

History, natural history, oceanography, art and the human imagination collide (not always successfully) in Aquatopia: The Imaginary of the Ocean Deep, at Nottingham Contemporary. It&apos;s a cabinet of watery curiosities and fabulous objects. Among the better known is Katsushika Hokusai&apos;s famous 1814 print in which a fisherman&apos;s wife is pleasured by a giant octopus. The octopus likes it, too. The show&apos;s excellent catalogue gives a helpful translation of Hokusai&apos;s accompanying dialogue, in which the woman commands: &quot;With the sucker, the sucker!! Inside, squiggle, squiggle, oooh!!!&quot; Taking her cue from the Japanese artist, Spartacus Chetwynd made her own octopus: a lovely, bloated, painted paper creature that lies stranded and perhaps exhausted on the gallery floor, its body flushed with interspecies desire. The creature was also used in a\u00a0performance by Chetwynd that left little (OK, nothing) to the imagination; it can be seen in a video.     Juergen Teller, Bjork, Spaghetti Nero, Venice, 2007.

What is it about octopuses?

The show is brimming with good and interesting things (only some of which are edible). Although we pillage the sea, almost all of it remains unvisited and unknown \u2013 who knows what&apos;s down there? There&apos;s a wonderful natural &quot;sea sculpture&quot; of broken Chinese porcelain here, lost at sea and &quot;glued&quot; back together thanks to coral growing on the seabed, then caught in a trawler&apos;s net. It looks like\u00a0one of Picasso&apos;s early cubist collages.

Paintings like JMW Turner&apos;s Sunrise with Sea Monsters and Francis Danby&apos;s apocalyptic, mid-19th-century works Deluge and The Shipwreck are class acts, with their tempestuous, weird weather, their light, foaming brine and squirming, doomed bodies. Sitting\u00a0on the gallery floor, and drifting against its walls, are Christian Holstad&apos;s\u00a0woven arrangements of netting, plastic tubing and reflective fabric. Helpfully, the American&apos;s skeins of stuff, which sit on drifts of blackish gravel, are collectively called This Is Not a Life-Saving Device. Ashley Bickerton&apos;s orange hammerhead shark, swimming through the air in front of the gallery window, seems to be wearing a sort of life vest. Behind it hangs Bernard Buffet&apos;s enormous \u2013 and very mannered \u2013 re-creation of a dramatic scene from Jules Verne&apos;s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Who rescued Buffet from Davy Jones&apos;s locker? I&apos;d throw him back. Karl Weschke&apos;s painting of a beached Caliban is a damp thing, a half-drowned figure who could be anyone washed up on the dimly lit Cornish coast, rather than on Prospero&apos;s magical isle; Liz Craft&apos;s bronze sculpture of an old mermaid, meanwhile, is silly and mawkish. I\u00a0much prefer Simon Starling&apos;s project for which he dunked a Henry Moore bronze sculpture in Lake Ontario, and let zebra mussels encrust its surface. This is one of the few works here that broaches the ecological changes we have wrought on our oceans, though such a topic would demand a much more wide-ranging exhibition. There&apos;s humour here, too. Alex Bag and Ethan Kramer&apos;s Cruel and Curious Life of the Salmonella Pod has a spoof natural-history soundtrack; and Guy Ben-Ner&apos;s re-enactment of Moby-Dick, filmed entirely in his own kitchen, is hilarious \u2013 with the Israeli artist playing peg-legged Captain Ahab and his small daughter playing Ishmael. Shark fins cleave the lino floor, and the whale spouts in the sink. There&apos;s no room in this show, of\u00a0course, for an actual whale. The best whale image in the show is Henry Scott Tuke&apos;s tiny 1910 painting The Whale Blowing. It teaches us that scale and size are different things. A small Turner watercolour of a gurnard took my breath away: there&apos;s almost nothing there on the scrap of paper, yet it&apos;s a miraculous invocation of the stolid little fish. Turner liked fishing, would sit for hours in the rain waiting for his line to twitch. It&apos;s the not knowing what is under the surface, what monsters lurk in this largely unseen world, that keeps the angler fascinated, whether it is a puddle in Bedfordshire or a whole oceanic trench. John Ruskin couldn&apos;t even see what was in front of him. Writing of Turner&apos;s painting of African women and their babies being thrown off a slave ship to drown (and save the slaver money), Ruskin barely noticed the human suffering. He wrote of the painting as &quot;the noblest seascape ever painted by man&quot;. His words come back to haunt us \u2013 sung with a folky lilt by one of the Otolith Group in their video Hydra Decapita. It&apos;s a work that involves a modern underwater myth: that of the water-breathing descendants of slaves, as recounted (or rather invented) by 1990s Detroit techno duo Drexciya. I\u00a0dozed in the film, dreaming of men with gills emerging from the Louisiana swamps and seeing words written in the rippling water that filled the screen. Later, I was told I had imagined them.

The Encyclopaedic Palace, at the current Venice Biennale, treats the whole world as a curiosity cabinet; and Brian Dillon&apos;s Curiosity, at the Turner Contemporary in Margate, is another such \u2013 it even has a stuffed walrus in it. Perhaps more than the exhibition itself (its loans are a bit patchy), Aquatopia excels in its studies and excerpts of literature concerning the seas and their denizens, both real and imaginary, and our complex relation to them. One thing missing is a sense of the scale of the oceans, their almost unimaginable volume. The things that live down there are more interesting than scary; the things that swim through our heads are another matter."}, {"sentences": ["Speaking in Tokyo on United&apos;s pre-season tour, the manager said that Ed Woodward, the club&apos;s executive vice-president, was dealing with negotiations.", "And you&apos;ve got to remember I only started the job on 1 July as well, so I&apos;ve only been in this job for three weeks.&quot; Moyes, who has been joined by Shinji Kagawa, Chris Smalling and Ashley Young in Tokyo, is clear that United must move on from Sir Alex Ferguson and enter the &quot;David Moyes era&quot;."], "tags": ["Manchester United", "Cesc F\u00e0bregas", "David Moyes", "Barcelona", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-22T23:21:00Z", "title": "Manchester United ponder club record \u00a335m bid for Cesc F\u00e1bregas", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/22/manchester-united-cesc-fabregas-record", "article": "Manchester United are considering shattering their record transfer fee to sign Cesc F\u00e1bregas after Barcelona rejected their second bid of \u00a330m for the Spain midfielder.

Speaking in Tokyo on United&apos;s pre-season tour, the manager said that Ed Woodward, the club&apos;s executive vice-president, was dealing with negotiations. &quot;My understanding is that Ed&apos;s had a response and he&apos;s spoken with them and again we&apos;ve made a second offer,&quot; he said. &quot;But Ed&apos;s dealing with that, rather than me personally here.&quot; Asked if a stage can be reached where it becomes fruitless to continue, Moyes said: &quot;I think a point does come but I think when you are interested in good players you want to give it every opportunity to materialise. And I&apos;ll do that. I&apos;ll hope that things can continue to move forward. At this moment I can only tell you that Ed Woodward is working hard to make the deals happen and we&apos;re hoping some of them will fall into place shortly.&quot; Moyes accepted that the longer United go on without making any major signings this summer the more anxious fans become. &quot;I can understand that but there isn&apos;t any real update I can give you. But I can understand why that might be the feeling,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think everybody had thought this might be the summer \u2013 with there being quite a few changes, my new position, other managers at other clubs \u2013 that it might be that the transfers are later in the month. I think that was always the thought I had when I came into the job. And you&apos;ve got to remember I only started the job on 1 July as well, so I&apos;ve only been in this job for three weeks.&quot; Moyes, who has been joined by Shinji Kagawa, Chris Smalling and Ashley Young in Tokyo, is clear that United must move on from Sir Alex Ferguson and enter the &quot;David Moyes era&quot;. While always respectful of Ferguson, the manager is intent on writing his own history as he prepares United for their title defence. That is why he brought in Steve Round, Phil Neville, Jimmy Lumsden and Chris Woods from Everton to join his backroom staff, he said, while embracing Ryan Giggs as player-coach. &quot;I needed it to be the David Moyes era now and I had to take David Moyes&apos; era and David Moyes&apos; time so that meant me taking some of my own people,&quot; he said. &quot;But I couldn&apos;t do it without the help of Ryan Giggs. Phil Neville had known a little bit at both clubs. But more importantly he probably knew how I worked at Everton more than Manchester United.&quot; He was young \u2013 him and Ryan are young, its really important in this job that you also keep young, open-minded thoughts because you don&apos;t want to get too old in your ways.&quot; Moyes underlined his desire to succeed when it was put to him that he may need six months or even a season for the side to become his. &quot;It is my team now. I have taken over, I&apos;m in charge,&quot; he said. &quot;As I have said, I will use the ex-manager as much as I can because of his knowledge but it is my team now and I have to take responsibility for that. From day one, it is my team and I have to get on and show that.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Now they&apos;ve expanded globally, carving cartographic inroads into other cities including Glasgow, New York, Tokyo and Copenhagen."], "tags": ["Travel", "Travel guides", "Books", "Travel writing"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-23T11:00:00Z", "title": "Beyond Lonely Planet: top 10 quirky UK guidebooks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jul/23/top-quirky-uk-guidebooks-print", "article": "Cities need guides. They&apos;re confusing, noisy, jumbled places. &quot;No two people live in the same city,&quot; writes Rebecca Solnit in her book Infinite City. &quot;A city is many worlds in the same place.&quot; We all have our own versions of a city, our islands of familiarity and straits of routine, but what&apos;s happening elsewhere and in other people&apos;s heads? Curiocity magazine (pictured above), which launched in 2011, highlights unexpected London experiences in its folded maps. Here are 10 more quirky guides from across the UK. Herb Lester (from \u00a34)     Herb Lester's collection of London maps    If you&apos;re an uncle at a loose end or you need some rubber wear in a hurry, Herb Lester has the map for you. Since 2010, Ben Olins and Jane Smillie have been producing eccentric, folded maps of London. Their avuncular pseudonym, Herb Lester, has proved the inspiration for a range of themes, from their first map, You Are Here, which charts quiet spots to work, to a Pub for All Reasons, an East End Companion and London on Two Wheels. Now they&apos;ve expanded globally, carving cartographic inroads into other cities including Glasgow, New York, Tokyo and Copenhagen. Bristol Cider Map (free) This free download is your ticket to a scrumptious cider trail around Bristol. If you get to the end before the streets start to swim, you&apos;ll visit 15 spectacular cider specialists, from the Apple cider boat to The Orchard, with its serried ranks of perries and artisan ciders. The map accompanies James Russell&apos;s Naked Guide to Cider, which is sadly not an alcoholic naturist&apos;s almanac, but a gloriously bucolic celebration of cider and a guide to enjoying it around the UK. It even has instructions on how to make it. Typographic Tour of Sheffield (free)     A Typographic Tour of Sheffield    It seems appropriate for our tour of printed guides to include a celebration of typography. Inspired by Stephenson Blake, the last type foundry in Britain, this beautiful poster map of Sheffield introduces you to a highly eclectic crowd of public typefaces. You&apos;ll pore over signs and pavements, spelling out fonts from ancient boundary markers to the Chick King takeaway. The stylish design agency Eleven has created the guide, which scours the city for serifs and stories, tracing tales of secret tunnels, underground societies and daredevil steeplejacks. They&apos;ll send you a copy in exchange for a stamped envelope. An Exeter Mis-Guide (\u00a34.99) What is a guidebook? The Wrights &amp; Sites team have stripped the idea down and blown it apart. These artist-researchers based at the University of Exeter have created a &quot;mis-guide&quot; to the city that challenges the way you approach the most familiar of urban experiences. Become a tourist on your own doorstep: trace touch trails of urban surfaces or walk your own version of Peru&apos;s ancient Nazca lines, plotted on a street map. Sound bizarre? It&apos;s not as disconcerting as their Mis-Guide to Anywhere, which could apply to any city in the world \u2026 Aal Aboot Geordie (\u00a34.95)     Aal Aboot Geordie guide    The UK&apos;s diversity should be celebrated, so we&apos;re thankful to David Simpson for Aal Aboot Geordie, which steers confidently through the proudly impenetrable language of Newcastle. In his words, tyek a keek te find oot aboot the burr, the bairns, the borns and the broon. He&apos;s also written the companion volume, Aal Aboot Newcastle, which deals with the history and landscape of the Toon, from the half-timbered houses of Sandhill to the breathtaking bridges over the Tyne. Literary Walks in Bath (\u00a315) The Georgian terraces and crescents of Bath evoke Empire lines, barouche-landaus and the barbed pleasantries of Jane Austen, but as well as charting the &quot;delightful place&quot; of Austen&apos;s novels, authors Andrew Swift and Kirsten Elliott track 10 other sets of literary footsteps in this scholarly volume. You rub shoulders with Mr Pickwick; stump up hills with Tobias Smollett; get romantic with Coleridge and the Shelleys; and drink a nostalgic cup of tea with John Betjeman. Apparently even Shakespeare came for a dip in the hot springs. Liverpool \u2013 In a City Living  This wistful tour of Liverpool&apos;s municipal memories is the passion project of historian Ged Fagan. The three books in his poetically titled In a City Living series collate his own photographs alongside archival images of Liverpool&apos;s wartime tenement housing blocks, most of which have long since disappeared. This record of domestic monuments is complemented by Ged&apos;s own memories of people and places, and tales of his life growing up in a tenement. The result is a ghost guide that will raise a nostalgic lump in anyone&apos;s throat. Lost in London (\u00a310)     Lost in London cover    Over half of London is green, and the best equipment for navigating its parks, woodlands, orchards, farms and rivers is Lost In London, the magazine for city dwellers &quot;with a taste for the good life&quot;. Edited by Lucy Scott and Tina Smith, the quarterly issues present seasonal compilations of natural wonders, with stunning photos and designs. Find the best wild swimming spots; cook up some local produce; wander through wildflower meadows; or hunt for dragonflies \u2013 all without leaving London. They&apos;ve also published a beautifully produced compilation volume (\u00a314.99). The Pocket Guide to Oxford (\u00a37.99)  This delightful romp around Oxford is the witty and erudite brainchild of Michael Johnson and the late Philip Atkins, both book designers at Oxford University Press. The inventive layout ricochets between subjects that include punting, Pitt Rivers and the Emperors&apos; heads, with illustrations from Lewis Carroll and the Victorian artist Orlando Jewitt. There are sardonic observations from the dodo in the University Museum of Natural History, who casts his world-weary editorial eye over the typescript, and is presumably a relation of the protagonist in the pair&apos;s other extraordinary book, A Dodo in Oxford. The Local&apos;s Guide to Edinburgh (\u00a39.99)     The Locals' Guide to Edinburgh    Extrapolating the maxim that it&apos;s people who make the place, Owen O&apos;Leary and Claudia Monteiro have hung their intimate guide to Edinburgh on interviews with 17 &quot;local legends&quot;. You can read the city through the eyes of taxi driver Bob McCulloch, or former Scottish rugby fullback Gavin Hastings. Each interviewee describes life in the city and recommends their favourite ways to savour its charms. The elegantly designed book also covers poetry, films, Edinburgh recipes and an essential glossary of words for weather.

The three proposed locations to the south of the current site were included in a submission to the Airports Commission before last Friday&apos;s deadline, but published on Tuesday to coincide with a meeting with a local consultative committee. West Sussex county council has voted to back the proposed expansion of London&apos;s second airport, giving Gatwick a unique measure of support among those competing for the approval of the commission. However, campaigners and residents groups vowed to step up opposition. Gatwick has drawn up rough plans for runways in three positions to the south of the existing airport. The options at a greater distance from the existing runway allow for more flexible use and more passengers \u2013 up to 87 million a year from the current capacity of 34.2 million \u2013 but at a greater cost in terms of swallowing up surrounding countryside and houses and extending the noise footprint. Gatwick says the maximum number of residents substantially affected by noise would be 11,000 \u2013 less than 5% of the total affected by aircraft noise at Heathrow. Stewart Wingate, Gatwick&apos;s chief executive, said the airport&apos;s submission would strongly argue against the need for a single hub airport such as Heathrow or Boris Johnson&apos;s Thames estuary site, and in favour of expanding Gatwick and then Stansted. He said: &quot;We fundamentally believe in the &apos;constellation&apos; approach. Gatwick getting the next runway will have the airports and airlines competing with one another, and it will provide the same level of connectivity as a mega-hub would. &quot;When we look at Moscow, Tokyo, Beijing \u2013 they are all world cities and are served by a constellation of airports. Mega-hubs tend to be in places like Atlanta or Dubai where the population is less than 2 million. For world cities it&apos;s our strong contention that competing airports is what&apos;s needed.&quot; He claimed Heathrow exaggerated its reliance on transfer traffic, where passengers fly into the airport before switching to long-haul services. But Gatwick has also put forward the possibility of the airport becoming a national mega-hub. In one paragraph of its submission to the Sir Howard Davies-led commission, the airport states: &quot;Construction of a second runway to the south of Gatwick would not prevent a further runway subsequently being developed to the north, if the latter was ever to be needed. A Gatwick southern runway, therefore, provides long-term flexibility, and should the Airports Commission decide that it wishes to investigate in more detail the development of a &apos;mega-hub&apos; in the south-east, then it would be appropriate for the commission to request information and/or submissions about the capability of Gatwick to deliver such a development.&quot; Brendon Sewill, chairman of the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign, said: &quot;When people begin to realise what is likely to hit them, there will be a tidal wave of public resistance.&quot; He said attempts to match Heathrow had previously ended in bankruptcy or failure, adding: &quot;The plans confirm that Gatwick is too small ever to provide an efficient airport.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["I didn&apos;t play in my favourite position, more as a striker, but I think I did well.&quot; In the third tour game, the 3-2 defeat by Yokohama F-Marinos in Tokyo this week, Januzaj lined up behind Robin van Persie."], "tags": ["Manchester United", "David Moyes", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-25T11:22:02Z", "title": "Manchester United playmaker Adnan Januzaj hopeful of big future", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/25/manchester-united-adnan-januzaj", "article": "Adnan Januzaj sees his long-term future at Manchester United, with the 18-year-old hopeful of signing a new deal soon.

Born without a shell to protect their vulnerable abdomens, their lives are a constant search for the next house, as they grow out of successive spiral lodgings. And for these squatters of the seabed, it&apos;s a matter of life or death: if they can&apos;t retract entirely within their shell, they&apos;re more likely to be eaten. It makes property guardianship\u00a0seem like an easy ride. Just like the desperate scrum of property viewing, on the rare occasions when a new shell becomes available, hermit crabs flock in their droves to the coveted carapace. In a curious model of hand-me-down housing, the biggest of the pack forces its way into the empty shell, while the others form a frenzied conga line from largest to smallest, waiting to scramble into the cast-off from the one in front. But things aren&apos;t always so civilised. Groups are known to gang up and forcibly evict fellow hermits from particularly desirable shells, while others fight to the death over deluxe homes. Mimicking our own housing crisis, there is a global rise in homeless crabs: thanks to our lust for shell-collecting, there simply aren&apos;t enough to go round.            But help may be at hand thanks to Japanese artist Aki Inomata, who has branched out into creating bespoke architecture for arthropods. From the soaring skyline of New York to the teetering townhouses of Honfleur, from the clustered hill-town of Santorini to the grand beaux arts blocks of Paris, hermits are now spoilt for choice. Using a CT scanner, Inomata constructed a 3D model of an unoccupied snail shell, complete with the spiralling apex inside \u2013 a crucial feature that allows the crab to grip on with the pointed end of its body \u2013 then added a range of architectural features, before printing the shells out in transparent plastic. She then left the assembled jewel-like follies for her lucky pet crab to choose from. It turned out that the ultimate favourite, into which the crab wriggled and refused to leave, was a shell modelled on the Moroccan mud city of Ait-Ben-Haddou.     Spoilt for choice \u2026 the hermit crab eyes up its options.

This concept made me think of hermit crabs, which change their shells. The same piece of land is peacefully transferred from one country to the other \u2026 Though the body of the hermit crab is the same, according to the shell it is wearing, its appearance changes completely.\u201d With the rise in home 3D-printing \u2013 along with a shell-printing initiative launched by Makerbot\u00a0last year \u2013 beach-combing might never be the same again.

On Saturday, it will be the turn of Jessica Ennis-Hill and Mo Farah to return to the spine-tingling scene of their Super Saturday triumphs as the 60,000 people watching try and recapture some of that Olympic magic. But beyond the confines of a stadium that now has a secure future as a home for West Ham and athletics, albeit at a cost of at least \u00a3600m to the taxpayer, the Olympic Park remains in a state of flux. And like the dusty expanses that once played host to a sporting wonderland and will soon become houses and parkland, the wider legacy promises \u2013 layer upon layer of them, like tiers of a\u00a0wedding cake, to justify the Games&apos; \u00a38.7bn cost \u2013 are a\u00a0work in progress. The L-word came to\u00a0mean so many things to so many people that trying to determine its success can be like searching for the end of the rainbow. As Farah, Ennis-Hill et al take to the track again, it is a reminder that it is both the physical regeneration of this once-scarred patch of east London, pump-primed with billions of pounds of public money, and the legacy of Britain&apos;s elite sporting infrastructure that appear most secure one year on. Even before the curtain had come down on the Olympics, the government had promised to boost its investment in\u00a0the next Olympic cycle by 11%, to \u00a3355m, to ensure our transformation from plucky losers to driven winners was sustained. The revolution in British sport \u2013 which began when National Lottery funding began to pour into the system \u2013 was honed by brilliant minds to combine with another huge boost in funding in 2005, and delivered an avalanche of medals in 2008 and 2012. Some of the smaller sports that enjoyed a moment in the sun in London have struggled since \u2013 victims of UK Sport&apos;s ruthless &quot;no compromise&quot; policy and a lack of commercial interest now that the bandwagon has moved on. But the principle of pouring large amounts of exchequer and lottery money into elite sport has retained broad public support. Liz Nicholl, the chief executive of UK Sport, which decides how that \u00a3355m should be divvied up, is clear that there is no turning back. She has promised to deliver more medals in more sports in Rio in three years&apos; time. &quot;During the Games, it was a unique opportunity for the whole nation to see\u00a0elite sport, to value it, to be proud of\u00a0it, to feel it, to experience it and be inspired by it. And our politicians were there, and they saw it and they felt it. They saw the nation was proud, and that\u00a0a proud nation is a happy nation,&quot; she says. Elsewhere, legacy remains in the eye of the beholder. Look left as you come out of a spruced-up Stratford tube station and you&apos;ll see that towering temple to consumerism, the Westfield shopping centre, which acts as the gateway to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, attracting more than 700,000 visitors a week and employing thousands of locals. Turn right, however, and walk through the indoor market stalls and discount shops of the Stratford Centre and on into Plaistow, and you&apos;ll still find plenty of locals wondering what the Olympics have done for them. But there are others who, while reserving judgment on the Park, concede that the Olympics have, at the very least, put their postcode on the map. It\u00a0suddenly feels like part of London rather than an afterthought, and many of the 11 million people who streamed into the Park last summer have already returned \u2013 whether to shop at Westfield or watch Bruce Springsteen. The lofty, endlessly stated aim of politicians was to use the Games as the catalyst for social change, to bring east London closer to the west in terms of prosperity, and change the much-quoted statistic that you lose a year in life expectancy for every station you pass eastwards on the Jubilee line between Westminster and Canning Town. London&apos;s mayor, Boris Johnson, was on typically ebullient form this week as\u00a0he delivered a series of set pieces bashing the &quot;Olympo-sceptics&quot; and, inevitably for a man drawn to the big idea like a moth to a flame, unveiling a new scheme for Europe&apos;s largest indoor ski centre next to the Park. &quot;The Olympics have helped trigger a\u00a0regeneration in east London that has been accelerated by about 70 years,&quot; he\u00a0said, pointing not only to Westfield but to the new iCity development that houses BT Sport&apos;s new studios and a planned &quot;tech hub&quot;. &quot;There&apos;s a secondary impact and I really believe it. There is no doubt in my mind that there has been an absolute fascination among international investors around London and east London. The idea that London was open and accessible and a great place to invest has caught on internationally.&quot; Paul Deighton, the man who brilliantly marshalled Locog (London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games) to deliver the Games and then took up a role as commercial secretary to the Treasury, in order to try to bring some of that stardust to large-scale infrastructure projects like HS2, is similarly enthusiastic. He says that a sceptically received UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) prediction that the Olympics would translate into \u00a340bn in extra inward investment by the end of the decade was in fact a woeful underestimate.     The Westfield shopping centre near the Olympic site in Stratford, east London, has given the area a boost, but not everyone locally has felt the benefits of the Games.  Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP    This is where the legacy again becomes open to interpretation. Westfield would have happened without the Games (albeit more slowly), and while Johnson says the Chinese investment in Royal Albert Dock was a direct result of the Olympics, others say it was nothing to do with it. Newham says 5,000 residents were helped into Games-time jobs, but most of those were temporary. Either way, there can be little doubt that the Games have helped transform perceptions of a small corner of the East\u00a0End. More uncertain is what sort of\u00a0place the Olympic Park and its surrounds will become. Executives of\u00a0the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) insist that it won&apos;t become an island of prosperity amid poverty, like Canary Wharf. &quot;This isn&apos;t going to be a gated community. In terms of the housing we&apos;re building, a large component is social housing with a rented element as well. It&apos;s always been our aim to create a mixed community on the Park that matches the diversity of the local area,&quot; insists the LLDC chief executive, Dennis Hone, as he walks around the track in the stadium. But Newham&apos;s chief executive, Kim Bromley-Derry, is just as quick to point out that it must also raise aspiration and provide employment where its residents can work as well as live. That is the balancing act this surprisingly cluttered and compact urban park must perform. But it is the claim that hosting the biggest sporting event in the world would inspire a nation to become fitter and healthier that remains most open to challenge. Here again, it can be hard to separate the rhetoric from the reality. Wander around Charlton Park and the adjoining Hornfair Park on a summer&apos;s evening and you&apos;ll see young people splashing around in the newly refurbished 50-metre lido, brand new tennis courts full to bursting, teenagers tearing around a new BMX track, the &quot;Adizone&quot; outdoor gym in regular use, and a queue for the outdoor table tennis table. All are\u00a0directly or indirectly linked to &quot;legacy&quot; projects. In Greenwich, one of the five Olympic boroughs, it feels as close as we may ever get in grimy south-east London to the continental idyll of community sports facilities in every town or suburb, offering cheap, easy access to exercise to all who want it. Yet, up and down the country, other local authorities are being forced to slash their sport and recreation budgets by up to 40%, putting facilities, coaching programmes and maintenance budgets under grave threat. Some, such as the closure of the Don Valley stadium in Sheffield, where Ennis-Hill trains, and of Newcastle&apos;s City pool, have been high profile. Others, such as a battle to maintain football pitches on Hackney Marshes in east London, less so. While grassroots sport quango Sport England has seen its annual investment of \u00a3300m go up as a result of coalition changes to the distribution of lottery income \u2013 a large chunk of which is channelled through sports governing bodies and targeted at 16- to 25-year-olds \u2013 it is just one part of a much wider picture. The official figures measuring sports participation are disappointing, though the former London 2012 chairman Lord Coe is right to plead for time. The latest numbers show that, of 29 sports that recorded a change in once-a-week participation figures, 20 suffered a\u00a0decline. And while 15.4 million people played sport at least once a week in April 2012, a\u00a0year later that figure has declined to 15.3 million. The government prefers instead to focus on the fact that 1.4 million more people are playing sport once a week than they were when the bid was won in 2005. An earlier promise to increase the number of people playing sport three times or more a week by one million, and a parallel promise by the NHS to increase the number of people taking exercise by the same number, were quietly dropped before the Olympics when it became clear they wouldn&apos;t be met.

Photograph: Gary Wolstenholme/Redferns/Getty    A new BBC poll showing that only one\u00a0in 10 people played more sport as a\u00a0result of the Games, but that seven in\u00a010\u00a0thought it was value for money, shouldn&apos;t come as a huge surprise. Beyond the rhetoric, the link remained tenuous at best. In some ways, elite athletes are the very worst people to ask whether inspiration can beget participation. They can all trace the spark of their sporting career back to a moment of inspiration, without realising that they are exceptional rather than typical. But as far as the younger generation is\u00a0concerned, those who were cynical about the link between watching feats of remarkable sporting achievement and increased enthusiasm for playing it were forced to eat their words last summer \u2013 up to a point. Anyone who witnessed the surge of enthusiasm in schools across the country, and at the Olympic Park in particular, would have had to work hard to hang on to their cynicism. But evidence in the wake of the Games showed a disappointing number ended up on waiting lists at the local athletics club or searching in vain for a gymnastics club that wasn&apos;t oversubscribed. Meanwhile, school sport remains in flux. &quot;For me, the biggest disappointment is still school sport. I think we have gone backwards. I can&apos;t say anything else and be honest,&quot; says Olympic gold medallist and Locog board member Jonathan Edwards. &quot;The primary school money is there, but there is no network and, anecdotally, some of the stories about how that money is being spent aren&apos;t brilliant. They might have had their faults, but school sports partnerships were essentially doing a good job. To dismantle that and start again from scratch \u2013 it&apos;s madness.&quot; And given that the central pledge of the Games was to &quot;inspire a generation&quot;, it seems bizarre that there is no way of actually measuring how many kids are playing sport. The coalition scrapped Labour&apos;s national school sport survey, saying it was overly bureaucratic, while Sport England currently only measures adults and relies on landline telephone surveys. An education select committee report published last week welcomed the \u00a3150m investment in primary schools announced in March, which replaces the \u00a3162m school sport partnerships that were axed in December 2010, but said it was far from enough on its own. It said that without extending the two-year commitment to invest \u00a3150m annually in primary school sport it risked being seen as little more than a &quot;gimmick&quot;, and said schools needed more support in how it was spent. A commitment to training more specialist PE teachers and to raising awareness among primary-age teachers of the importance of sport are to be welcomed, but there remains a lack of joined-up thinking. And too much time is still spent on the redundant exercise of championing competitive sport over some non-existent &quot;prizes for all culture&quot; when the emphasis should be on getting kids to exercise, whether that means hula-hoops or hockey sticks. Speak to those involved in the original bid, from Tony Blair down, and they\u00a0will claim that a key plank of their mission was to shift the centre of gravity so that sport would come to be seen as an integral part of education, health and social policy. With the NHS and education policy in a state of permanent revolution, it is little surprise that embedding sport and exercise are not at the top of their priority list. Coe is right to point out that the fact that these questions are on the agenda at all is a victory of sorts. Others, such as former Locog deputy chairman Sir Keith Mills, who has taken matters into his own hands with his Sported foundation, believe there is an awfully long way to go. During the seven-year run-up to the Games, it was as though the government was so taken with Coe&apos;s legacy pitch that it couldn&apos;t resist endlessly adding promise after promise to the list. The legacy for volunteering, for one, is harder to fathom. The whole nation was caught up in a wave of enthusiasm for the 70,000 purple and red-clad Games Makers a year ago, but here, too, there is a feeling that the momentum stalled as those treasured uniforms were returned to the wardrobe as keepsakes. There are other shifts in perception that shouldn&apos;t be underestimated. According to Sue Tibballs, chief executive of the Women&apos;s Sport and Fitness Foundation and a longstanding critic of the lack of media coverage for female athletes, the Games were a watershed moment in the way female sports stars are perceived.

Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA    In some sports there is a clear correlation between the investment that was guaranteed and maintained as a result of a home Games and their success in driving achievement at all levels. British cycling has become the exemplar of how to marry elite success with long-term growth at the grassroots, creating a virtuous circle of public and corporate investment to deliver ever more ambitious goals. Nicola Adams, the first British female boxer to win a gold medal, has almost single-handedly inspired a 79% uplift in the number of women practising her sport regularly. &quot;A lot of girls come up to me all the time and say I&apos;ve inspired them to take up boxing. It&apos;s really good to see,&quot; she says. Yet other sports, like netball, suggest it is not major events that boost participation but well thought-out, intelligent marketing and strategies. It has targeted lapsed players and mums with clever campaigns and offerings, and been rewarded with a rise in numbers despite not being an Olympic sport. But these are the exceptions that, in too many cases, prove the rule. While there are pockets of good practice among some governing bodies and some schools, there is no overriding sense that sport is becoming more central to our way of life. With various degrees of frustration, everyone from outgoing legacy tsar Coe to Locog deputy chairman Sir Keith Mills voices concern that the system is still far from joined-up enough. Most obviously, the education secretary, Michael Gove, had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table to put up a share of the cash for a new school sport policy to replace the one arbitrarily axed for ideological reasons in 2010. According to a survey commissioned by Asda this week, seven in 10 parents think more sport should be made available to children at primary school. &quot;It&apos;s vital. It&apos;s the biggest thing. We talk about finding champions of the future but, to be honest, they&apos;re probably always going to find themselves,&quot; says runner Paula Radcliffe, gazing at the finishing line as thousands stream across it having completed a National Lottery fun run around the Olympic Park. &quot;I don&apos;t think people realise that kids perform better at school, they&apos;re happier, and the economy is stronger if everyone does sport. It&apos;s making sure there is time allocated in schools, and that they have strong links with clubs. For me, as a parent, if you&apos;re told this is the first generation that is going to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents, then that is scary.&quot; This is the somewhat humdrum reality of turning all that glittered last\u00a0summer into lasting gold. While everyone lauds the cross-party consensus that delivered the Games, the legacy debate has descended into political point-scoring. The shadow culture secretary, Harriet Harman, went on the attack on Friday, accusing the government of\u00a0&quot;squandering the Olympic legacy&quot; and\u00a0wasting a &quot;once in a lifetime opportunity&quot;. Yet, even if all that the London Games did was give the country a shot in the arm and provide a stage for a magical six weeks of sporting action, many would argue it was still worth it. Jordan Duckitt, one of the seven teenagers who lit the flame at the climax of Danny Boyle&apos;s remarkable opening ceremony, says legacy &quot;isn&apos;t a thing but a feeling&quot;. Christine Ohuruogu, the London silver medallist who grew up a stone&apos;s throw from the Olympic Park, says the Games delivered an unquantifiable dividend that can&apos;t just be measured in pounds and pence. Which is why, despite continuing economic uncertainty and widespread social unrest, Tokyo, Istanbul and Madrid are desperately vying to host the 2020 Games. &quot;Some things can&apos;t be measured. General wellbeing, feeling better \u2013 you can&apos;t disregard that impact. Once you aim higher, you have more opportunity. You won&apos;t always measure it in monetary value, but I think in emotional, spiritual terms, people feel a lot better about themselves,&quot; says Ohuruogu. A YouGov poll published on Friday revealed that 75% of Britons believed London was right to have bid to host the Games, up from the 44% who were in favour of the Games in a poll conducted a year before the Olympics. Whether that is enough for the electorate \u2013 who this weekend will bathe in the warm glow of memories of a sporting summer like no other \u2013 remains the \u00a38.7bn question. &quot;This, for me, is not about a six-week dip in an active people survey. There are serious problems. The average kid in the UK is now 50% less active at the age of 15 than at the age of nine. That is unsustainable,&quot; says Coe. But without a serious, long-term, cross-party plan to equal that which delivered perhaps the best Olympic Games of modern times, one of its defining legacies could yet be a fatter, rather than a fitter, nation."}, {"sentences": ["From Up On Poppy Hill Youthful Japanese animation set on the eve of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "The Wolverine"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-27T05:00:00Z", "title": "Frances Ha, The Wolverine, Blackfish: this week's new films", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/27/this-weeks-new-film", "article": "Frances Ha (15) (Noah Baumbach, 2012, US) Greta Gerwig, Mickey Sumner, Michael Esper. 86 mins Gerwig does a winning line in klutzy/ditzy in what&apos;s essentially a tailor-made showcase for her natural comic talents.

With United yet to make a major signing this summer, Moyes&apos;s first business in the transfer market may involve losing a player rather than acquiring one. Monaco&apos;s sporting director, Vadim Vasilyev, claimed in the French newspaper L&apos;Equipe that the Portuguese winger, who was not on the tour because of a nose operation, &quot;has been offered to us&quot;. Vasilyev added: &quot;He is a very good player but at the moment there have been no talks. We have already changed our group quite a bit and we also want to offer opportunities to our young players.&quot; Nani has only a year left on his contract and Moyes is yet to have the chance to assess his worth, which will happen when the squad return to their Carrington training base this week. Regarding F\u00e1bregas, Woodward flew back to Europe early from Sydney during the second leg of the tour, with the pursuit of F\u00e1bregas high on his agenda. With Moyes leading the squad on the 21-day trip, this week will be a first chance for the manager to give the potential purchase of F\u00e1bregas his complete focus. Following the win over Kitchee in United&apos;s final pre-season tour game, Moyes was asked if Woodward had made any progress on F\u00e1bregas. &quot;No. I&apos;ve got no other updates to report just now,&quot; he said. With Barcelona rejecting \u00a326m and \u00a330m bids and stating categorically that the former Arsenal captain is not for sale whatever the price, Moyes is taking encouragement from the knowledge that F\u00e1bregas is open to the move. Moyes and Woodward will consider whether to make a third bid, which is likely to be in the region of \u00a335m, while F\u00e1bregas also has the option of putting in an official transfer request to try to force his way out of the club. But, given that Barcelona are his boyhood team, that is not thought to be a ploy he is likely to utilise.     The French club Monaco have claimed that they were offered the chance to sign Nani from Manchester United.  Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    The goalkeeper David De Gea has an injured finger that could make him a doubt for United&apos;s next friendly, the trip to AIK in Stockholm on 6 August, and he was rested for the game against Kitchee. &quot;David De Gea has got a finger [problem], so we just didn&apos;t risk him in the last games,&quot; said the manager, who a month into succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson is beginning to settle in. &quot;I&apos;m a bit more relaxed because of being around the players and them getting to know me and I think they&apos;ll feel a wee bit the same way, a new manager coming in, and I&apos;ve enjoyed being with them,&quot; he said. &quot;They&apos;ve been really good to work with and I think the work we&apos;ve asked them to do has been very good. &quot;They were already very good players. I&apos;m just taking on the baton and keeping it going, if I can. &quot;This was going to be a daunting job for anyone who takes it. For whoever was going to replace Sir Alex it was going to be a hard task. So it was always going to be daunting but certainly you grow into it and, as the days go on, you start to feel a bit more comfortable.&quot; After stops in Bangkok, Sydney, Tokyo, Osaka and Hong Kong Moyes conceded that the tour was not the best preparation for the title defence. &quot;I don&apos;t know if it would be ideal preparation. I don&apos;t think it is what every team would certainly choose,&quot; he said. &quot;I think in football now if you&apos;re one of the big clubs, you have to take your club to the supporters around the world. It means the extra money you earn from your marketing and from your sponsors is going to play a big part in the future. So I think it&apos;s something we&apos;re going to have to come to terms with and it is going to happen \u2013 and maybe even more so in the future.&quot; Moyes also stated that letting in nine goals in the five tour matches is a worry. &quot;We&apos;re concerned about conceding the goals,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think United were a bit like that at the start of last season and what they tended to do was score more than the opposition.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["United returned home on Tuesday after the club&apos;s three-week pre-season tour, which took in games in Bangkok, Sydney, Tokyo, Osaka and Hong Kong, two of which were won, two lost and one drawn."], "tags": ["Rio Ferdinand", "Manchester United", "David Moyes", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-30T22:00:00Z", "title": "Rio Ferdinand says senior Manchester United players can help David Moyes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/30/rio-ferdinand-manchester-united-moyes", "article": "Rio Ferdinand believes he and other senior Manchester United players can help David Moyes become a better manager as the manager begins his first season as Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s successor.

But after only a month with his new squad, Moyes, according to Ferdinand, can draw on the experience of the players around him. &quot;I just look at it as if I was taking the job on,&quot; said Ferdinand. &quot;Would you lean on players who have been here for many years, for their experience and ask questions and to better yourself? Of course you would. You&apos;d do the same in any job, so you expect that.&quot; Ferdinand identified himself, Ryan Giggs and Michael Carrick as players who could make a valuable contribution. &quot;I think the manager is fortunate he&apos;s got someone like Giggsy, among others, like myself and Carras, who have been here for many years and know the fabric of the club. If there&apos;s anything we can pass on, with our experiences, to help him to become a better manager and to help us win more trophies, then that&apos;s fantastic.&quot; Moyes has been in the job for only three weeks and has yet to manage a competitive match, and Ferdinand thinks it is premature to compare the styles of Moyes and Ferguson. &quot;I think it&apos;s still too early to talk about stuff like that between the two of them,&quot; he added. &quot;The manager before was a one-off, there won&apos;t be anyone like him ever again and you can&apos;t expect anyone to fill his boots exactly the same way. &quot;And with this manager, I don&apos;t think you can start drawing comparisons yet with them both. You&apos;ve got to give the manager time and hopefully the manager is at a club where he will get that.&quot; Jesse Lingard was among United&apos;s best performers on tour, finishing as top scorer with four goals, and Ferdinand said the winger was one of the younger players who could establish himself in the squad this season. &quot;If you asked anyone else in the club they&apos;d tell you the same thing about him \u2013 that he is a great little player. On the last tour he was one of our best players but it didn&apos;t work out for him last season,&quot; the defender said. &quot;This season it remains to be seen but he couldn&apos;t have done any more to put himself in the shop window in terms of the manager.&quot; Ferdinand said. The centre-back has also been heartened by the displays of the other young players, Wilfried Zaha, Adnan Januzaj and Michael Keane. &quot;The best part of the tour has been seeing the young lads come through,&quot; he said. &quot;Fitness is the most important thing but the young lads have come through and shown they have the right qualities. &quot;He [Zaha] came with a big price tag for a young player [\u00a315m] but he&apos;s come in here, he&apos;s got a great personality, he&apos;s fitted in straight away as a lad [and] you can see he has the potential to become a really good player and this is the best place to do that.&quot; Despite Moyes not yet having made a major signing, Ferdinand is bullish about United&apos;s prospects of retaining the championship. &quot;We&apos;re confident. If we had to go into the new season with the players we&apos;ve got now, I&apos;d be more than confident of doing well and winning trophies but if the manager can add to that and chooses to add to that, then great. But that remains to be seen. &quot;Winning the league last season, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s going to change massively from this season, in terms of the way we play and things like that.

Meanwhile, the scale of Chinese concealed local government debt, potentially \u00a31.1 trillion, is growing and possible defaults are emerging. As noted on the Local Leaders Network last week, a Detroit scenario would be unlikely here, given the contrasts between US and UK municipal finances and their sources of revenue, not to mention the law. Where we can find a more illustrative case is the Japanese municipality of Yubari, on the northern island of Hokkaido, which is closer in scale and scope to the likes of West Somerset in the UK. Yubari has become the face of municipal bankruptcy in Japan (whose national public debt ranks highest in the world at an eye-watering 220% of GDP), though it wasn&apos;t the first, as the coal-mining town of Akaike in the southern prefecture of Fukuoka went under in 1992. Yubari saw a substantial drop in population in the 1980s from a peak of almost 120,000 to just 10,000 (in an area almost the size of New York city) following the collapse of its economic base of coal mining in the 1980s. White elephant amusement parks and ski resorts followed as city leaders sought to save face, with an internationally-renowned film festival in the city, favoured by Quentin Tarantino, faring much better. But even Tarantino couldn&apos;t save Yubari and at the time of its financial collapse the film festival went into a hiatus for a couple of years. The city went to the wall in 2007, owing more than Y35.3bn (\u00a3150m) and having papered over the cracks for a decade to hide its debts following the double-whammy of cuts in central grants and the expiry of a national statute to fund former mining communities. When the crunch came, Yubari was forced to effectively halve the city&apos;s 300-strong payroll (even under Japan&apos;s stringent protection for public servants) in a manner familiar from more recent Californian municipal bankruptcies, cutting all but the most vital of services to its ageing population. School, library and pool closures followed. This is when the Japanese ministry of internal affairs and communications (which supervises Japanese municipalities and champions local autonomy in Tokyo) took charge of the situation and placed the municipality under centrally-directed special measures aimed at consolidating its debts \u2013 in exchange for the suspension of its constitutional autonomy it gained some breathing space, at least. In 2007 a &quot;No More Yubaris&quot; law was passed (the Local Finance Soundness Law) aimed at ensuring early warnings and recovery plans would be set in motion for any municipality where even the mildest signs of financial stress become evident. The law followed an earlier ministry report which identified that more municipalities faced going to the wall amid a perfect storm of excessive dependence on central finances, accumulated debt, declining populations, failure to market the municipalities&apos; unique characteristics, inadequate local civic participation and a lack of local financial transparency. Like Detroit, around the time of Yubari&apos;s financial collapse rumours persisted of this being the tip of the iceberg, but under the new law there is greater transparency of the municipalities&apos; finances, with an array of annual health checks around deficit ratios and future debt servicing. Earlier checks and enhanced media scrutiny helped the most stricken municipalities pull back from the brink. Yubari aims to be out of financial reconstruction by March 2030, having already repaid Y3.8bn of its Y35.3bn debt as of the end of July . The Yubari case offers a number of interesting lessons for the UK, not least in the area of turnaround leadership. In 2011, following a stint on loan to the city from the Tokyo metropolitan government, Naomichi Suzuki became Japan&apos;s youngest mayor at 30. He was implored by locals to return from Tokyo and finish the job. Suzuki is credited with reviving the local film festival and personally brokering more favourable terms for debt repayment. Other measures such as eliminating senior management posts and selling off land and buildings will probably be more familiar here in the UK. But as Suzuki himself cautions, if Yubari can&apos;t be saved then what hope is there for the rest of Japan?

The following year, after the British had overrun Bergen-Belsen in north-western Germany, Colville went with the Canadian 3rd division into the concentration camp where 10,000 bodies lay in an open grave. He sat down and sketched the scene. This dark experience yielded a macabre and awful image for the Canadian war museum in Ottawa and marked his art at a deeper level for the rest of his life. The most obvious touchstone for Colville&apos;s mature work is the American realist Edward Hopper, who was almost 40 years older. The undertones of alienation and psychic disturbance in Hopper&apos;s work take on an even darker shade in Colville&apos;s paintings, which at first glance are more often than not innocuous-seeming scenes of Canadian middle-class life.     Alex Colville at the Drabinsky gallery in Toronto, 1991.  Photograph: Keith Beaty/Toronto Star/Getty Images    Take one instance: Child and Dog (1952), a placid scene of a small naked girl standing no taller than the black dog beside her. Is the animal to be trusted? The child thinks so. Or another, Horse and Train (1954), intended as more overtly frightening: a black horse careers along a railway track towards a trans-continental train steaming towards it. It was inspired by two lines from the South African poet Roy Campbell: &quot;Against a regiment I oppose a brain/and a dark horse against an armoured train.&quot; Colville explained that the painting represents the eternal opposition of creation and destruction. This is the literary approach to painterly values that was inevitably scorned during the high tide of modernism. Reviewing an exhibition of Canadian art at the Tate Gallery, London, in the Burlington Magazine in 1964, Keith Roberts, after praising Colville&apos;s prodigious skill, made a more telling point: &quot;The enigmatic flavour of these paintings is, I suspect, superficial and technical rather than inherent and visionary.&quot; That is a difficult case to prove, and difficult to rebut. It could simply be said that some paintings succeed and some, equally fine technically, fail, and that this is rooted in the influences Colville chose: his other major experience of 1945 bearing on his painting was the ancient Egyptian art he saw in the Louvre, and in 1959 he visited Chicago to make a special study of the post-impressionist George Seurat&apos;s monument to stillness, La Grande Jatte. Colville chose to work with egg tempera, the medium of the pre and early Renaissance artists, and it is a medium that represents stasis superbly \u2013 think Piero della Francesca and Masaccio. So the ambiguity of Colville&apos;s girl and dog, both in stasis, is that the situation might change in a trice. The horse and train are static, too: but although they are evidently intended to suggest momentum, they lack the suggestive fluidity of, say, Turner&apos;s Rain, Steam and Speed. Menace and the drawing in of night is suggested only by incidentals, such as the railway engine&apos;s glaring cyclopean headlight. Colville was born in Toronto, the son of a Scottish emigrant father and Canadian mother, who moved to sea-girt Nova Scotia in 1929. Alex and Rhoda lived in Sackville, New Brunswick, from 1946 until 1973, when they moved to the house in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, where she had been born. So much of the work has a local maritime setting, from the faintly sinister panel of a man stripped to the waist, languidly leaning against a doorpost staring out to sea with a revolver lying on the table (Pacific, 1967), to the woman in a phone booth on a jetty as a cargo boat sails by (Departure, 1962), and a family piling into their car at the beach as the weather breaks up (Family and Rainstorm, 1955). He had studied for his degree at Mount Allison University, New Brunswick, and returned to teach there from 1946. With growing success in Canada and in New York, he felt secure enough in 1963 to earn a living solely from painting. He represented Canada at the 1966 Venice biennale and honours poured in: honorary degrees, membership of the privy council of Canada and being named in 1982 as a Companion of the Order of Canada. His work was exhibited at the Marlborough Gallery in London, and in Hong Kong, Beijing, Tokyo, Paris (where the Pompidou Centre has a Colville painting in its collection) and Cologne (where the Ludwig museum has acquired his work). Rhoda was a frequent nude model for her husband&apos;s paintings, causing mild scandal in the polite society of Wolfville, but like Pierre Bonnard&apos;s bathtub wife, stuck at it through to old age. She died last December after 70 years of marriage and a few months after the death of one of their sons, John. Colville is survived by their daughter, Ann, and two further sons, Graham and Charles. \u2022 David Alexander Colville, artist, born 24 August 1920; died 16 July 2013 \u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2013. The model for the painting Child and Dog was a girl rather than a boy, and the dog was not a full labrador. Alex Colville&apos;s mother was not a Scottish emigrant. He and his wife Rhoda, a painter as well as a poet, lived in Sackville, New Brunswick, from 1946 until 1973. He was already in the army at the time of his marriage.

But it was, for me, surprising to find that one of the very best movies at Cannes this year had such a shrill and hostile reception. Nicolas Winding Refn's brilliant, macabre and ultraviolent anti-revenge movie Only God Forgives \u2013 his most interesting work since the Pusher trilogy in the Mads Mikkelsen era \u2013 was deafeningly denounced at its first screening. Some booed from their seats, cupping their hands around their mouths so that the sound carried that vital few yards further. Then came the nervy, brushfire social-media consensus \u2013 a new feature of criticism at festivals \u2013&nbsp;as insecure pundits checked their Twitter feeds and committed themselves to derision, evidently taking Refn's supposed failure to be the \"story\", and in any case believing that something has to be seen to take a pasting if the praise-economy is not to go bankrupt. And all the while, middleweight products and franchise mediocrities are cordially waved&nbsp;through. \nI can only say that Refn's movie is entirely gripping, put together with lethal, formal brilliance, with bizarre setpieces of sentimentality and nauseous black comedy. It has its own miasma of anxiety and evil, taking place in a universe of fear, a place of deep-sea unreality in which you need to breathe through special gills \u2013 and through which the action swims at about 90% of normal speed through to&nbsp;its chilling conclusion. It is a kind of&nbsp;hallucinated tragi-exploitation shocker, an enriched uranium cake of pulp with a neon sheen. \n \n  \n  \n  A paragraph of dialogue \u2026 Ryan&nbsp;Gosling in Only God Forgives. Photograph: AP \n  \n \n The subject is expatriate American gangsters in a nightmarishly imagined Bangkok, self-exiled by traumatic family memories. Ryan Gosling plays Julian, a laconic tough guy who speaks hardly more than a paragraph's worth of dialogue throughout the whole film. He runs a drug business under the cover of&nbsp;a Muay Thai boxing club, co-managed with his brother, Billy (Tom Burke), a violent and hate-filled misogynist whose grisly fate is to involve Julian in&nbsp;a strange metaphysical duel with Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), an enigmatic, samurai sword-wielding cop. The situation is made even more eerie and grotesque with the arrival of Julian's exasperated mother, Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas), demanding acts of retributive violence. She is a widowed mob matriarch who knows very well what Julian can do: she is at&nbsp;once grateful and resentful and contemptuous, for reasons that emerge towards the end of the film, and which will make sense of Julian's behaviour. He seems paralysed by something that can't exactly be called conscience. With her icy-blue eyes ablaze \u2013 Julian's eyes are the same \u2013 Crystal taunts and denounces him, like some mix of Gertrude and Lady Macbeth. \n \n  \n  \n  Kristin Scott Thomas as widowed mob matriarch Crystal. Photograph: AP \n  \n \nIt is Chang who glides through the film with mysterious precision and ambiguity, calm and ruthless in his capacity for aggression, and for enforcing his own kind of natural justice on his own turf. Is he an avenger who punishes people \u2013 for seeking revenge? He could be a Zen master whose lifelong vocation is payback against payback, and whose students graduate with the loss of a limb. He could be a kind of black&nbsp;hole, drawing violent people in, nullifying them, cauterising them. Or perhaps he is just a Machiavellian figure with an instinctive gift for attracting and manipulating violence itself. \nEither way, Chang utterly upends what we might expect of a violent movie, and certainly what we might expect of a violent movie starring sexy&nbsp;Ryan Gosling. The winners and losers in straight physical combat are not obvious. And for all the director's mischievous public pronouncements about being a \"pornographer\", the violence here, though sometimes almost unwatchable, is effectively questioned far more than in many another straight action film. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n Refn's direction, Larry Smith's cinematography and Beth Mickle's production design are all superb. The disturbing tracking shots down infernal corridors brought to mind Travis Bickle's final descent in Scorsese's Taxi Driver. The queasily presented Bangkok, in which daylight looks like just another kind of neon, is a little like that in Thomas Clay's Soi Cowboy (2008) or the Tokyo of Gaspar No\u00e9's Enter the Void (2009), but a closer comparison might well be with a Thai director, Wisit Sasanatieng, and his deadpan genre comedy Tears of the Black Tiger (2000), which had the same trope: the desolate singing of songs about lost love. Chang is a karaoke enthusiast, taking to the stage with his microphone, to sing impassively of heartache while his fellow officers sit around, their caps placed on tables, as respectful and alert as if at a debriefing. It's a fascinating film, and it deserves to be seen."}, {"sentences": ["This was found out after the 1995 sarin attacks on the Tokyo subway by the Aum Shinrikyo cult."], "tags": ["Syria", "United Nations", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Science"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-01T17:26:00Z", "title": "UN team heads to Syria to inspect sites of alleged chemical weapon attacks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/un-inspectors-syria-chemical-weapons", "article": "UN inspectors are to go to Syria as soon as possible to investigate alleged attacks employing chemicals weapons at three sites in the country. The investigation was given the green light after a visit to Damascus last week by \u00c5ke Sellstr\u00f6m, head of the chemical weapons team, and Angela Kane, the UN&apos;s disarmament chief. &quot;The team will depart for Syria as soon as practical and is preparing to depart within days,&quot; Martin Nesirky, a UN spokesman, said on Thursday. The breakthrough ends months of negotiations that began when the regime invited the UN to investigate an attack at Khan al-Assal, a village near Aleppo on 19 March. The government and rebel forces blame each other for using chemical weapons in the attack. Plans to send inspectors into Syria were put on hold soon after the initial invitation, when the UN&apos;s request to visit other sites of alleged attacks was refused by Bashar al-Assad&apos;s government. The UN security council has reports of 13 alleged chemical weapons attacks in Syria since civil war broke out in March 2011. The inspectors will visit Khan al-Assal, but the UN has not disclosed the other two sites. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has previously called for an investigation in Homs, following reports of an attack last December. The investigation will look only at whether chemical weapons have been used, not who used them. The US, Britain and France have already said that the nerve agent sarin has been used in the war; samples smuggled from Syria, with security services&apos; help, have been analysed. In June the Obama administration moved to arm Syrian rebels, citing conclusive evidence that the regime had used sarin against the insurgents. Under Sellstr\u00f6m, a chemical weapons arms expert from Sweden, the UN has drawn together a team of interpreters and medics that will support inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). The team faces a big challenge given the number of sites it is restricted to, the small amounts of nerve agent likely used, and the time that has passed since some of the attacks. &quot;Some people say that it&apos;s already too late, and I can definitely understand that,&quot; said one inspector, speaking on condition of anonymity. &quot;People are afraid of a result that&apos;s neither positive or negative but an inconclusive maybe.&quot; Ralf Trapp, a chemical weapons expert and former OPCW scientist, said an uncertain result was a fair concern. &quot;The problem with coming back and saying we didn&apos;t find anything is that the allegations don&apos;t go away. If you can prove someone used it the questions you ask change. &quot;Sarin is not something you pick up at the pharmacy. So you move on to who had access, and who can make it. Sarin is not hard to make but it is extremely hard to make safely.&quot; Despite the difficulties, the investigation was worthwhile, Trapp said. The UN team was independent, he said, and it would base its conclusions on a wealth of evidence that could be used in court. &quot;That&apos;s not the case for a lot of what comes from the intelligence agencies.&quot; The first task for the inspectors is to visit each site. Charles Duelfer, the former US chief weapons inspector, said officials could deter inspectors by emphasising the dangers in an area. &quot;Once they&apos;re on the ground, the government can use that as a tool, as a way of constraining [inspectors&apos;] movement,&quot; he said. Another tactic of officials in the country, he said, was to assign minders to inspection teams, which could have a chilling effect on people being interviewed. To build up a picture of events at any particular site inspectors will interview victims, witnesses, doctors and residents, some a fair distance from the scene. In a sarin attack, about 85% of the chemical agent misses its target; it ends up in the soil, or blowing over to other neighbourhoods. Sarin is colourless, odourless and tasteless. It causes a range of symptoms, from respiratory failure, eye irritation, and blurred vision to constricted pupils and drooling. People foam at the mouth when forced to breathe through massive secretions of fluid in their lungs. The expelled foam can be tinged pink with blood. Weaponised sarin is usually dispersed though an explosive device that sprays droplets fine enough to be inhaled deep into the lungs, though the agent enters through the skin and eyes too. In the body, sarin blocks an enzyme, causing nerves to fire constantly. A lethal dose can kill in one to 10 minutes. Those people who survive the first 15-20 minutes usually live. Trapp said that what witnesses failed to say could matter as much as the details they described. &quot;There are certain things you&apos;ll see when chemical weapons are used, and if people tell you stories that don&apos;t include these things, you start to wonder what really happened.&quot; For example, some people may be killed almost instantly, but those who go to help can become contaminated too. Many of these will then suffer and they can die. This was found out after the 1995 sarin attacks on the Tokyo subway by the Aum Shinrikyo cult. Footage of suspected attacks in Syria shows victims taken to hospital without being stripped of their clothes or being isolated from others. &quot;These people still had their clothing on, so if there was a sarin attack they would be contaminated. Half the people who helped them would be dead, or would have picked up enough to be sick themselves,&quot; said Trapp. The reports that inspectors derive from people on the scene may be confused and inconsistent. For example, sarin can be mixed with other agents, such as military grade teargas, and people exposed might smell pungent fumes. The symptoms they experience may differ according to the agent. Ultimately, chemical and biological tests are needed to confirm which agent has been used. Interviews make up only one strand of evidence. Another comes from direct tests on soil and medical samples taken from victims. Sarin is volatile and breaks down quickly in contact with moisture. The process is speeded up by UV rays in sunlight, rain, humidity and wind. But traces of sarin and other agents can still be found years after an attack. The highest concentration of nerve agent will be where the canister, shell or missile lands. In most cases, the impact craters will be hard to find, but not in other circumstances. In May the mother of a family in the northern town of Saraqeb was killed after a device landed in the garden. Impact sites can retain contaminated soil and fragments of munitions. In 1992, Alastair Hay, an environmental toxicologist at Leeds University, worked with Human Rights Watch to investigate suspected chemical weapons attacks, four years earlier in Kurdistan. He took soil samples from four impact craters, and found a fragment of a bomb in one. Hay&apos;s evidence was passed for analysis to Porton Down, the UK&apos;s chemical warfare laboratory in Wiltshire. There, a scientist noticed a flake of paint on the metal shard. It was found that the material behind it tested positive for sarin. The OPCW has portable equipment for running tests in the field, but Sellstr\u00f6m&apos;s team will collect samples and send them to laboratories that make up the OPCW&apos;s global network. One is Porton Down. Other labs are in China, Russia, Japan and the US. Samples sent for analysis are worthless if there is any possibility of their having been tampered with, so they are all closely guarded. In April the White House said the &quot;chain of custody&quot; of samples that the US had tested was unclear, a problem that lay behind its statement which said it believed with &quot;varying levels of confidence&quot; that Syria had used the weapons. Inspectors are unlikely to find sarin in the soil long after an attack, but traces of its breakdown products might show up. Sarin first breaks down into a chemical called isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA), generally regarded as proof positive. One serving chemical weapons inspector said: &quot;There is no other nerve agent containing the structural features of IMPA that is known to be mass-produced, weaponised or fielded.&quot; While IMPA is solid evidence for sarin, it too breaks down, into a compound called methylphosphonic acid. This is not conclusive proof of sarin, and can come from other agents, such as soman, cyclosarin and VX. The inspectors will also test medical sample for traces of IMPA. &quot;My sense is that it&apos;s probably worth [the UN] going in. They&apos;d be the only party who really have an interest in the truth,&quot; said Duelfer. &quot;If they do this, it&apos;s a deterrent, and that is a supporting element of trying to keep chemical weapons under control. That&apos;s an important part of this \u2013 more because of the threat that it could get into the wrong hands.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Japan and China have been in a war of words for over a year, punctuated by alarming sorties by warships and fighter jets, over the question of sovereignty over the barren islands in the East China Sea that Tokyo calls Senkaku and Beijing the Diaoyu."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China", "Second world war"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-02T15:59:01Z", "title": "The Japanese finance minister's Nazi comments hark back to a dark past | Rana Mitter", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/02/japanese-finance-minister-taro-aso-nazi-comments", "article": "Constitutional reform \u00e0 la Hitler? That seemed to be the case made by Japan&apos;s finance minister, Taro Aso, earlier this week, when he suggested that his country might learn from the Nazis&apos; technique of undermining the Weimar constitution by stealth, if it wants to change the American-designed postwar constitution that prevents it rearming. On Thursday, Aso withdrew his remarks. But they were not an isolated incident. Japan and China have been in a war of words for over a year, punctuated by alarming sorties by warships and fighter jets, over the question of sovereignty over the barren islands in the East China Sea that Tokyo calls Senkaku and Beijing the Diaoyu. Both countries are in the latest stage of a crisis that began in 1937 and has never truly been resolved: Japan&apos;s invasion of China, and the unfinished business of a peace settlement in 1945 that failed to create a lasting framework for stability. The facts of that war bear remembering. On 7 July, 1937, fighting broke out between local Chinese troops and a Japanese garrison near the Marco Polo bridge, on the outskirts of Beijing. Within weeks, the fighting had expanded across China&apos;s territory. The Japanese captured China&apos;s major cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou, and notoriously Nanjing, where a massacre of thousands of Chinese civilians took place. Some 14 million or more Chinese were killed during the war, and some 80 million became refugees. Yet, despite the huge toll that the conflict cost the country, China refused to surrender, resisting until the defeat of Japan in 1945. Nearly 70 years later, neither country has fully come to terms with the war and what it means for its own politics both domestic and international. In China, the war still sits centrally in the national culture. In Nanjing, a sombre museum-cum-shrine recalls the horror of the massacre that devastated the captured capital city in December 1937. Nationwide, hundreds of thousands of videogamers, in multiplayer online games, compete to defeat Japanese armies recreated in pixels. But the view of the war in China is still heavily distorted. During the cold war, under Mao Zedong&apos;s rule, it was officially &quot;forgotten&quot; that much of the resistance, including the bulk of the fighting, was carried out by the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek, rather than by the Communists. For example, in the desperate battle for Shanghai in autumn 1937, some 187,000 troops were killed \u2013 all serving in the Nationalist armies. Yet after Mao&apos;s victory in 1949, Chiang and his rump regime fled to Taiwan, and it became impossible on the mainland to suggest that they had any role in winning the war. This situation began to change as the cold war thawed. Reunification with Taiwan was on the agenda, and it became a little easier to speak positively of some of the wartime efforts of the former regime. But the limits remain strict to this day. Official institutions in China still speak of the leading role of the Chinese Communist party in fighting the invaders. Wartime collaboration with the Japanese, which was widespread, is rarely discussed. In Chinese public culture, the war against Japan has become a melodrama, in which good and bad are defined in stark and often cartoon-like terms. This has encouraged a zero-sum view of Sino-Japanese relations that has raised tensions in the region. Yet the Japanese political sphere has to take its share of responsibility. In recent years, a particular strain of thought has gradually received greater respectability in some quarters: the idea that Japan&apos;s war in Asia was not an invasion but a &quot;liberation&quot; from the yoke of white imperialism. This view has become embedded in Japanese popular culture through the enormously popular graphic novels of Yoshinori Kobayashi. His 1998 novel Senso-ron (On War) portrayed the Japanese army as liberators of their Asian brethren; it sold some 650,000 copies. Of course, Japan is a democracy with a lively public sphere, and there are many who condemn the view that Japan&apos;s wartime behaviour can be whitewashed, from leftist teachers&apos; unions to members of the governing LDP party, who see the new nationalism as an embarrassing nostalgia for a dark part of Japan&apos;s history that hurts the country&apos;s international image. But the growth of Japanese revisionism on the wartime experience, if not checked, could inflame tensions further between China and Japan. Having spent a decade researching the origins and effects of that earlier war between China and Japan, I&apos;m certain that the confrontation between the two countries today is not yet as dangerous as that of 1937. But the similarities are real and too close for comfort. There is no effective multilateral organisation in Asia able to resolve disputes such as those over the islands in the East China Sea. And the crisis of 1937 was triggered by two countries with strong and contrasting ideological visions that exploded into war as the result of a small, almost trivial incident. Today&apos;s politicians need to be extremely careful not to make the same mistakes. Comments like those of foreign minister, Taro Aso, are profoundly unhelpful in the creation of a more stable Asia-Pacific."}, {"sentences": ["The setting is Yokohama in 1963, the year before the Tokyo Olympics and a time of hope and social change for Japan."], "tags": ["Animation", "World cinema", "Film", "Ursula K Le Guin", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-03T23:01:01Z", "title": "From Up on Poppy Hill \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/04/from-up-on-poppy-hill-review", "article": "This charming animated film is from the same director as Tales From Earthsea, the Ghibli Studio adaptation of Ursula Le Guin&apos;s fantasy stories for children.

I have found myself using more and more Google apps on my iPhone over the past 18 months or so. Google Maps replaced (surprise) Apple Maps, Gmail replaced Apple Mail, Chrome replaced Safari. I did voice search through Google&apos;s search app, not Siri. And so on. Why? Because Google&apos;s services are not only much more powerful but also very neatly integrated. The amazing Google Now is the best example for that. In fact, I was already using a Google phone running iOS underneath, and there&apos;s simply nothing in iOS 7 that makes me think I might switch back to Apple&apos;s stock apps. There&apos;s just frustration that iOS 7 has barely caught up with Android&apos;s current state.  Alternatively... App updates for iOS 7 &gt;&gt; furbo.org Craig Hockenbery:   While cranking along on the update, a couple of thoughts occurred to me: how many other developers were doing the same thing and were they going to commit fully to iOS 7? The depth and breadth of the changes in iOS 7 makes it difficult to support older versions of the OS. So I just asked. I also included a simple question that any developer who was actively working on an update would be able to answer as a sort of CAPTCHA. After a little over 24 hours, I had my answers: An overwhelming number of developers are updating apps for iOS 7. Of 575 valid responses, 545 developers indicated that they were working on an update for iOS 7. That&apos;s an adoption rate of 95%! Of those developers who were working on an update, I then calculated how many were going to require iOS 7 (and drop support for iOS 6): Just over half of developers (284 of 545) were leaving the past behind.

The scientists claim their work helps to unravel the mystery of the act, and trace it back to &quot;rudimentary forms of empathy&quot; in domesticated dogs. The team at the University of Tokyo asked 25 dog owners to yawn at their pets and noted how often the dogs yawned back. They then repeated the experiment, replacing the owner with a stranger. Around half the dogs, including a pit bull, a Pekingese, and a greyhound appeared to be oblivious to the yawns, but others seemed to respond in kind with a Siberian husky, a German shepherd, and several poodles yawning most. Writing in the journal Plos One, the scientists claim that not only did dogs find yawns contagious, but they yawned most when yawned at by their owners. The dogs were fitted with heart monitors to rule out yawning as a stress response. &quot;Our results make it likely that there&apos;s an empathic basis to contagious yawning, that it&apos;s modulated by emotional attachment with the owner,&quot; said Teresa Romero, an evolutionary biologist on the team.

Referring to the country&apos;s series of anti-gay laws, the latest of which was passed in June, the president told the Tonight Show host Jay Leno:  I think they [President Vladimir Putin and Russia] understand that for most of the countries that participate in the Olympics, we wouldn&apos;t tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently.  In Britain on Wednesday, the author Stephen Fry published a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron and the 2012 Games organiser, Lord Coe, in which he called for Russia to be stripped of the Games. Fry wrote that Putin &quot;is making scapegoats of gay people, just as Hitler did Jews.&quot; Fry&apos;s letter was also delivered to the Lausanne headquarters of the International Olympic Committee, by Guillaume Bonnet of the campaign group All Out. Bonnet also delivered a 320,000-signature petition which called for the IOC to denounce Russia&apos;s anti-gay law. In response, a spokesman said the IOC &quot;cannot enter into political debate&quot; and added:   Our challenge is to change the world through sport and in sport, and that is what we are doing.  On the contrary \u2013 the IOC can enter into political debate, and should, and has done so in the past. That is precisely how it can &quot;change the world through sport&quot;. On 18 August 1964, the IOC banned South Africa from the summer Olympics in Tokyo, after it refused to condemn apartheid. Though it was not intended to do so, the exclusion lasted. South Africa did not return to the Olympics \u2013 or to other international sporting competition, once even the hidebound likes of rugby and cricket had cottoned on \u2013 until 1992, when apartheid fell. In 2012, before the London Games, international pressure was brought to bear on Saudi Arabia, which did not propose to send any female athletes. The IOC joined in, and the Saudis relented. Despite such evidence, there are still those who say that sport and politics should not mix. They often cite the US boycott of the Moscow Games of 1980 and the Soviet Union&apos;s boycott of Los Angeles in 1984. Those actions were the result of geopolitical concerns; they were not based on issues of fundamental human rights. The IOC spokesman also said:  We very much respect and welcome gay athletes to the games. We will ensure to the best of our ability that people can come and compete and spectate free of discrimination.  This is a laudable sentiment. It is also a ridiculous statement. Under Russian law, gay people attending the games as athletes or spectators will not be allowed to &quot;spread propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations&quot; to anyone under 18. This means that they will not be allowed to behave or speak in any way that equates straight and gay relationships, or distribute material on gay rights. Fines have been instituted for individuals or media groups who might break the law. Foreigners can be fined, jailed for 15 days and deported. So, to anyone, Russian or foreign, athlete or spectator, who might be thinking of using the Winter Games as a platform for protest \u2013 and who hasn&apos;t been put off by a rise in physical attacks on LGBT people, or a ban on adoption by foreign same-sex couples \u2013 Putin&apos;s message is clear: don&apos;t. In his letter, Fry wrote:  An absolute ban on the Russian Winter Olympics of 2014 in Sochi is simply essential. At all costs, Putin cannot be seen to have the approval of the civilised world.      Saudi Arabia's Sarah Attar competes in the women's 800m heats at the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images    The IOC&apos;s exclusion of South Africa over apartheid was a civilised action which helped bring about that country&apos;s return to the civilised world. That two women represented Saudi Arabia at London 2012 was another victory, if a small one, for civilisation. The 2012 summer Games were the first in which every competing nation sent athletes of both sexes. The IOC does not tolerate political discrimination based on race or gender. It should not tolerate political discrimination based on sexuality. Russia should not host the 2014 Winter Olympic Games."}, {"sentences": ["John\u00a0Robinson World&apos;s Busiest Train Station8pm, Channel 5 Alien visitors to Shinjuku station in Tokyo would be forgiven for thinking they were witnessing a form of mass punishment, as 4,000 people are packed into trains every 30 seconds."], "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-09T06:00:05Z", "title": "TV highlights 09/08/2013", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/09/tv-highlights-09082013", "article": "Natural World: Sri Lanka \u2013 Elephant Island9pm, BBC2 Elephants have two traditional species: the African and the Asian.

The sea is in his family&apos;s blood, he says. His octogenarian father began working on boats when he was 12, and only retired three years ago. But even if his health permits, Niitsuma knows he may never again get the chance to board his boat and head out into the Pacific in search of sole, whitebait, flounder and greenling. The greatest threat to Niitsuma&apos;s livelihood, and that of other fishermen in Hisanohama, a small fishing town 125 miles north-east of Tokyo, lies just up the coast at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The environment ministry recently announcement that 300 tonnes of contaminated groundwater from Fukushima Daiichi is still seeping over or around barriers into the Pacific every day, more than two years after it was struck by a tsunami in March 2011. Government officials said they suspected the leaks had started soon after the accident, which resulted in a\u00a0nuclear meltdown. The admission by the ministry, confirmed by Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), which runs the plant, is likely to keep Hisanohama&apos;s 40 fishing boats in port for the foreseeable future. Tepco&apos;s failure to handle the contaminated water \u2013 and accusations that it tried to cover up the leaks \u2013 is a serious setback to attempts to clean up Fukushima Daiichi, 18 months after the government declared it had reached a &quot;safe&quot; state known as cold shutdown. &quot;I haven&apos;t been able to fish since the tsunami,&quot; Niitsuma said inside the concrete shell of the port&apos;s main building, whose foundations sank by up to a metre because of the force of the March 2011 quake. &quot;People want to be reassured that they are buying fish that is safe to eat, and we can&apos;t give them that guarantee at the moment,&quot; he said. Evidence that quantities of radioactive caesium-134 and -137 in locally caught fish have fallen to levels close to the government-set safe limit of 100 becquerels per kilogram is scant consolation, Niitsuma said. &quot;At times like this, it feels like the nuclear problem will never be resolved, and for that Tepco and the government must take responsibility.&quot; In a furious letter to Tepco&apos;s president, Naomi Hirose, Japan&apos;s national fisheries federation said the water leakages were an &quot;act of treason to all fishing industry workers and to all members of the public in Japan&quot;. The government imposed a ban on fishing in the Fukushima area after the tsunami, which killed more than 18,000 people along Japan&apos;s north-east coast and triggered the worst nuclear accident in the country&apos;s history. Niitsuma&apos;s 15-metre boat, Sueyoshi Maru, has been idle ever since. Unable to make a living from a sea poisoned by radiation, the town&apos;s 70 fishermen earn money clearing tsunami debris; the only fish they catch are taken not to market, but to makeshift labs where they are tested for radiation from the plant, located just 12 miles to the north. Tepco pumps out 400 tonnes of water a day of groundwater into the basements of damaged reactor buildings. There, it mixes with highly radioactive water that has already been used to cool the melted fuel, which is thought to lie deep inside the reactors. The firm had consistently denied there were any leaks, saying it had contained excess water by hardening soil with sodium silicate to form a chemical &quot;wall&quot; around areas thought to be at the greatest risk. But the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other experts have said the seepage will not affect areas beyond the sea directly off the coast of Fukushima Daiichi. &quot;Even 300 tonnes [a day] \u2014 that&apos;s still going to be diluted to an almost undetectable level before it would get to any US territory,&quot; said the commission&apos;s information officer Scott Burnell. Having conceded it had lost the ability to control the tainted water, Tepco promised to pump out tonnes of it and reinforce soil barriers. It also plans to build a 1.4km wall of soil, frozen solid by coolant, around four of the plant&apos;s six reactors by July 2015, in an attempt to prevent any further\u00a0leakages. Early estimates put the cost of the wall at 40bn yen (\u00a3266m), making it more likely that the government, which has already loaned Tepco billions of yen to compensate victims and decommission the plant, will use public money to help stem the flow of radioactive water. Tepco&apos;s sudden about-turn over the leaks have added to public anger about its handling of the crisis. The disaster forced the evacuation of 160,000 people as radiation spewed from the plant, bringing Fukushima&apos;s farming and fishing industries to their knees. &quot;It&apos;s like there&apos;s an allergy to the name Fukushima,&quot; said Takashi Niitsuma, head of sales at the Iwaki fisheries co-operative, of which Hisanohama is a part. &quot;Even if we could catch fish for sale, no one would buy them. We&apos;re talking about the Pacific Ocean, so it&apos;s not just Fukushima that&apos;s affected by the contamination. If Tepco allows more water to leak into the sea, the criticism will be worldwide. For us as fishermen, it&apos;s not a question of whether we can revive the Fukushima brand \u2013 we have no choice. We have to at least try.&quot; Tepco&apos;s promises to address the water problem did not even convince the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whose support for nuclear power remains unshakeable. &quot;There is heightened concern among the public, particularly about the contaminated water problem,&quot; Abe said this week. &quot;This is an urgent matter that needs to be addressed. Instead of leaving everything to Tepco, we need to create a firm national\u00a0strategy.&quot; Japan&apos;s newly launched Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) indicated that it, too, had lost faith in the utility&apos;s ability to manage the water crisis, the latest setback in a cleanup and decommissioning operation that is expected to take more than 40 years and cost $11bn. The authority said Tepco &quot;lacked a sense of crisis&quot; about the threat to the marine environment. &quot;Right now, we have an emergency,&quot; said Shinji Kinjo, an NRA official in charge of addressing the water leaks, adding that the flow of water &quot;could accelerate very quickly&quot;. Campaigners accused regulators of concentrating on the possible restart of Japan&apos;s idled nuclear reactors rather than ensuring Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s safety. &quot;More than two years after the Fukushima disaster, the Japanese government isn&apos;t any closer to taking control of the situation,&quot; said Hisayo Takada of Greenpeace Japan. &quot;The government must hold the nuclear industry responsible for the catastrophe and seek expert assistance from other countries. &quot;The leakage of radiation from the Fukushima plant to the ocean is a disaster for marine life and Japanese fisheries, but Tepco has consistently hidden and understated the seriousness of the leaks.Tepco is clearly incapable of dealing with the ongoing disaster and cannot be trusted to handle the situation appropriately.&quot; In the minutes before the tsunami crashed into Hisanohama, Kazuo Niitsuma, like many other fishermen, saved his boat by steering it out to sea and into the path of the waves. More than two years on, he can&apos;t escape the feeling that his act of bravery was in vain. His catch once fetched premium prices; now he lives off a government wage for collecting debris and modest compensation for loss of income. &quot;The nuclear disaster has left us with no motivation,&quot; he says. &quot;Nothing has changed, so there&apos;s nothing to look forward to. But I&apos;ve been a fisherman for 48 years and I&apos;m not going to give up now.&quot; \u2022 This article was edited on 12 August, 2013. A misleading comparison was removed.

The fallout from The Damned United wasn&apos;t particularly pleasant. I&apos;d written about police corruption, the miners&apos; strike, war criminals, problems in Tokyo with the American occupation, but I never imagined that the most controversial thing I would write would be a book about football. I wanted to write a book that would be more than another dark conspiracy. My plan was to write about Harold Wilson. Wilson was somebody whose life and achievements, I thought, had been forgotten. Then a film producer, Mike Jefferies, a passionate Liverpool supporter, was curious to know if I&apos;d ever considered writing a script about Bill Shankly. It sounds dramatic, but it was as if the scales had fallen from my eyes. Harold Wilson turns up in Red Or Dead: does that mean you&apos;ve now dealt with him? Having spent so long writing about that period of time, and with Wilson in the book, I thought maybe I&apos;d finished with it. But actually, now, a couple of months down the line, I realise I do want to write about him. I think he could have a relevance. What did you know about Bill Shankly before you started researching the book? My football memories really start in 1974. The first game my father took me to was when Brian Clough brought his Leeds team to play Huddersfield in a pre-season friendly. And Shankly, although I was aware of him, was never an active manager within my memory. Older friends talk about how Mike Yarwood used to impersonate him, but I just had this very vague notion that he was a good man. The book was really going to focus on the mystery of his resignation [as Liverpool manager, in July 1974] and the aftermath. But starting to do the research, I felt that you couldn&apos;t really talk about the retirement of the man without talking of the work of the man. I read everything on him. And at the end I did still feel that he was a good man, as close to a saint as you really could get\u2026 maybe that&apos;s over-egging the pudding \u2013 as usual for me. You&apos;ve lived in Japan since 1994. When you first arrived, you were heavily in debt. What was life like for you? I didn&apos;t know anyone at first, so my options were somewhat limited. I spent a lot of time walking about, but I didn&apos;t go down to the Roppongi, where all the foreigners go, and spend my nights drinking. I didn&apos;t go out in the English sense of going out \u2013 getting pissed. I&apos;d lived in Istanbul for the previous two years. But when I came to Tokyo, it oddly seemed an easier place to get your bearings more quickly. Silly things, but there was a Tower Records, and an HMV; that kind of thing didn&apos;t exist in Istanbul. Before going to Istanbul, you wrote a book that was rejected by everyone. What was it about? Up until Red Or Dead, it was the longest book I&apos;d written. There were three different voices: one in the first person, an unemployed pseudo-private detective solving a case of a missing girl; the second narrative was in the second person (which I&apos;ve used many times), a man obsessed with a woman; and the third voice was in the third person, set in the slight future, where the apocalypse had occurred and a man was in search of the birthplace of the antichrist, which turned out to be in Blackpool. So it didn&apos;t lack ambition? No, you could say many things about it, but it didn&apos;t lack ambition. That experience of being rejected \u2013 did it knock you back? It did initially. Certainly to me, being unemployed and living in Longsight, in Manchester \u2013 it was the time of Gunchester. It was endless bad news, one thing after another. And with the arrogance of youth, I thought it was just a matter of time before I was recognised as Britain&apos;s greatest author. And when that didn&apos;t happen, I went to Istanbul and didn&apos;t write for two years. You returned in 2009 to live in Yorkshire for two years, after 17 years away. What changes did you notice? It&apos;s all very subjective and I&apos;m wary of making sweeping pronouncements. There were many positive things. From abroad, I had an image that the education and healthcare were very developing world. But I didn&apos;t find that at all. My kids went to the local primary and secondary schools and I can&apos;t speak highly enough of them. Same with visits to the hospital. I had my wisdom teeth out, no complications. We&apos;d moved back to near Dewsbury and \u2013 not to look back with rose-tinted glasses \u2013 when I went to school in Batley it was a very racially mixed class. People got on and mixed. I had friends from all religions and so forth. It struck me that in somewhere like Dewsbury that seemed to have disappeared. Certain towns in West Yorkshire just seemed segregated. Friends of mine spoke openly: &quot;That&apos;s an area we don&apos;t go into.&quot; That&apos;s the biggest change. The only time I met people who were non-white was getting in a taxi or going for some food. How is your Japanese? In daily life I get by but when I do interviews I always do them with translators. This conversation, for example, I wouldn&apos;t have wanted to do in Japanese. That&apos;s a relief. Neither would I. Can you read Japanese? I can read the sports newspaper, but anything the equivalent of the Guardian is too much for me. Every year my new resolution is to get better. But I spend most of my life writing about Britain. What are going to do this evening? I was in the office at six this morning. It&apos;s been a very long day, so I&apos;m going to go home. My son, for my sins, is a Manchester United supporter. They&apos;re about to arrive in Japan.

Here are a few others Bracken may want to take notes from. Dawn Fraser            An official national treasure and semi-professional larrikin, Fraser won the 100m freestyle at three Olympics. She was involved in a spot of international diplomacy while still a swimmer: at the Tokyo Games in 1964 she was arrested after accusations she had stolen the Olympic flag from outside the emperor&apos;s palace (she was later released without charge). After retirement Fraser was briefly a publican. In this role she received excellent training for politics, listening to the semi-coherent ramblings of members of the public day in, day out. The experience obviously stood her in good stead \u2013 that and the fact that she was a national hero \u2013 and in 1988 she was elected to the New South Wales parliament until her seat, Balmain, was abolished in 1991.  Manny Pacquiao            If Fraser is a national treasure in Australia, Pacquiao is a diamond mine in the Philippines. The boxer has won 10 world titles and is one of the highest paid athletes on the planet. He first ran for election in 2007 and, in an achievement for someone so wildly popular, lost. Undeterred, he ran for congress in 2010 and won by a landslide. He is also head of the modestly titled People&apos;s Champ Movement.  Nova Peris            Remember the annoying kid who was brilliant at everything at school? Peris was that kid. She won Olympic gold in hockey at the 1996 Olympics before switching to athletics. She wasn&apos;t too shoddy on the track and picked up two golds (in the 200m and 4x100m relay) at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. She was still competing by the time the Olympics came to Sydney in 2000, reaching the 400m semi-finals. In January Julia Gillard selected her to stand for Senate in this year&apos;s election \u2013 if successful she will be Australia&apos;s first female Indigenous federal parliamentarian. The selection isn&apos;t without controversy. &quot;This sets a dangerous precedent that vulnerable MPs can simply be replaced overnight by somebody with name recognition to bolster the leader&apos;s numbers,&apos;&apos; an unnamed Labor MP told the Sydney Morning Herald at the time. Seb Coe            Coe had a brilliant career as an athlete, winning 1500m gold for Great Britain at the Moscow and Los Angeles Olympics. He entered politics as a Conservative MP in 1992 and was later given a life peerage, making him Lord Coe. He headed up the organising committee for the London 2012 Olympics and is now chairman of the British Olympic Association. He replaced Lord Moynihan, another politician with sporting pedigree \u2013 he won silver as the cox of the British men&apos;s eight at the 1980 Olympics. George Bush Forget the high-kicking, flashing smiles and pom-poms of the modern day cheerleader. During the 1960s cheerleading at Yale had a name and that name was George W Bush. While it&apos;s amusing to imagine Bush decked out in a tight skirt and low-cut top, pictures from the time show his main duties involved using a very large loudspeaker to shout nonsense from the sidelines.

I was lucky there was a big storm the night before, which cleaned the air, extending the visibility by many miles. I spent months putting the whole thing together, but still haven&apos;t seen every detail in the image. But I&apos;ve found a few nice highlights, including a guy sleeping on the ground after a rough night out, a Ferrari, a couple of guys practising baseball, and scores of little alleyways and streets where life is unfolding. I shot on a weekend so there are a lot of people simply doing their thing; there is a lot of life in the image.     Zooming in on the picture you can see the incredible detail at street level    I shoot almost exclusively 360\u00ba images. To me, it is the perfect kind of photography, capturing everything that exists from a single point in space. It is inherently geographic, in describing a single point on the earth, and in far greater detail than anyone could experience with the naked eye. I think it is amazing that I can extend the human senses in this way.     The image gives a birds'-eye view of thousands of Tokyo streets    I shot the image using a standard DSLR camera, a Canon 7D, and a 400mm lens. The only special gear used was a robot camera mount connected to a laptop, onto which I bolted the camera and lens. This expensive piece of kit allows you to turn the camera by precise amounts using powerful stepper motors. On this shoot, the camera was moving, and simultaneously focusing and shooting frames, all without stopping, which lets you accomplish something that would otherwise take 10 times longer.       Photograph: Jeffrey Martin    The entire image, taken from the Tokyo Tower, is made from three different sections which were shot pointing out from three different places around the tower. (These sections were joined together at the very end, on the computer.) Each section of images took 30-90 minutes to shoot, depending on the speed that the robot was turning the camera. So, I shot a whole set of images twice, on two different days."}, {"sentences": ["But the biggest immediate problem for Abe is that the weak growth has raised doubts about whether he will go ahead with the increase in consumption tax next year, designed to show markets that Tokyo is serious about tackling Japan&apos;s public debt, currently 240% of GDP."], "tags": ["Shinzo Abe", "Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-12T16:36:41Z", "title": "Weak Japanese GDP data highlights flaws in Shinzo Abe's three 'arrows' | Larry Elliott", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/aug/12/weak-japan-gdp-shinzo-abe-abenomics", "article": "The honeymoon is over for Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. The financial markets loved it when Abe announced a three-arrow strategy last year for ending his country&apos;s two decade struggle with deflation and sluggish growth. Share prices soared and the yen fell after the new government pledged large-scale quantitative easing, higher public spending and structural reform in a package dubbed Abenomics. But markets were left distinctly underwhelmed on Monday by Japan&apos;s latest GDP figures, which showed growth at 2.6% in the year to the second quarter of 2013, down from 3.8% in the 12 months ending in March. The rate of expansion was far weaker than expected and scotched the always rather fanciful hopes that Abe had found a magic bullet for Japan&apos;s woes. He hasn&apos;t. Problems have emerged with every bit of the three-quiver policy. Firstly, driving down the value of the yen was supposed to boost the Japanese economy by making life easier for its key export sector. But it has also raised the cost of imports, particularly fuel, at a time when domestic energy production remains hampered by the Fukushima nuclear plant. Dearer energy raises business costs and eats into consumers&apos; real incomes. As some analysts noted, Japan is getting higher inflation as planned, but it is the wrong sort of inflation. A second problem is that doubts are starting to surface about the government&apos;s commitment to structural reform. Japan is an elderly and conservative country where the dynamics of an ageing population make it mightily difficult to raise participation rates in the labour market or reduce subsidies to farmers, even if ministers were prepared to make themselves unpopular. But the biggest immediate problem for Abe is that the weak growth has raised doubts about whether he will go ahead with the increase in consumption tax next year, designed to show markets that Tokyo is serious about tackling Japan&apos;s public debt, currently 240% of GDP. The increase in sales tax from 5% to 8% is chunky and, with a second increase to 10% planned for 2015, clearly has the capacity to derail economic recovery. Japan has history in this respect, with tentative recoveries in the 1990s aborted due to over-hasty tightening of policy. Ideally, the increase in sales tax should take place at a slower rate over a longer period, which is what one of Abe&apos;s advisers suggested on Monday. The question is whether this can be achieved without the government&apos;s credibility being shredded. A final decision will be taken next month: the hesitancy adds to the sense that Abenomics is essentially smoke and mirrors."}, {"sentences": ["The striker, who is on international duty as Uruguay prepare to play a friendly against Japan in Tokyo, has said in El Observador that he will stay at Anfield and may even sign a contract extension."], "tags": ["Luis Su\u00e1rez", "Liverpool", "Arsenal", "Brendan Rodgers", "Premier League", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-14T08:34:57Z", "title": "Luis Su\u00e1rez says he will stay at Liverpool \u2013 reports", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/14/luis-suarez-liverpool", "article": "Luis Su\u00e1rez has apparently told a Uruguayan newspaper that he is staying at Liverpool.

Liverpool have not been informed by Su\u00e1rez or his agent, Pere Guardiola, that he is prepared to remain with the club but having made clear their stance, Anfield officials are hopeful the striker now realises there is no prospect of a transfer in this window. He may seek a new contract containing a more specific release clause, with both Su\u00e1rez and Arsenal under the mistaken impression a bid of over \u00a340m would trigger a sale this summer. Su\u00e1rez has still to offer the apology that Rodgers wants for accusing Liverpool and the manager of broken promises in an interview with the Guardian last week. The striker went public with his frustrations 24 hours after receiving a warm reception from Liverpool fans during an open training session at Anfield, and four days on from a similar response during Steven Gerrard&apos;s testimonial, undermining claims in Uruguay that it is the backing of fans that has prompted a change of heart. Liverpool have registered their interest in the Brazilian midfielder Willian as they attempt to capitalise on the cost-saving measures at Anzhi Makhachkala but have yet to make an offer for the 25-year-old. Willian only joined the Dagestan club in January from Shakhtar Donetsk, for \u00a330m, but is likely to be sold if Anzhi can recoup the cost after owner Suleiman Kerimov slashed their budget from \u00a3116m per season to \u00a332m-\u00a345m. Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool&apos;s owners, are prepared to sanction a marquee signing but, having lost out on both Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Diego Costa this summer, may await encouragement from Anzhi before making an official bid. Costa signed a three-year contract extension at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Wednesday after Liverpool had been led to believe the Brazilian striker was keen on a \u00a321.8m switch to Anfield. &quot;I am very happy with the deal, it is a very special moment,&quot; said the 24-year-old. &quot;I am delighted with this agreement after fighting for a long time to win the respect and affection of the fans, my team-mates and people in the club.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Two Japanese cabinet ministers have visited a controversial war shrine in Tokyo to mark the anniversary of the country&apos;s defeat in the second world war, in a move likely to anger South Korea and China.", "He later visited Chidorigafuchi national cemetery in Tokyo to pay his respects to more than 350,000 unidentified Japanese war dead."], "tags": ["Japan", "Second world war", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-15T06:29:18Z", "title": "Two Japanese ministers visit war shrine", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/15/japanese-ministers-visit-war-shrine", "article": "Two Japanese cabinet ministers have visited a controversial war shrine in Tokyo to mark the anniversary of the country&apos;s defeat in the second world war, in a move likely to anger South Korea and China. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, indicated he would not visit the Yasukuni shrine, which honours Japan&apos;s war dead, including 14 wartime leaders convicted as war criminals. Abe, a nationalist who has voiced regret at not visiting Yasukuni during his previous term as prime minister in 2006-07, sent a ritual offering of a tree branch. He later visited Chidorigafuchi national cemetery in Tokyo to pay his respects to more than 350,000 unidentified Japanese war dead. He is believed to have stopped short of visiting Yasukuni in person to avoid inflaming already strained ties with Beijing and Seoul over territorial disputes and conflicting versions of Japan&apos;s conduct in Asia during the war. &quot;[Abe] wanted to pass along his prayers for the people who died in the war and to apologise for not making a personal visit,&quot; Koichi Hagiuda, a senior official in Abe&apos;s Liberal Democratic party (LDP), told reporters after making the offering on his behalf. &quot;He considered it from various angles and made a general judgment not to come to pray today. He made an offering as Shinzo Abe, the LDP leader.&quot;\u00a0 Despite Abe&apos;s absence, two cabinet ministers paid their respects at the shrine in the morning, with as many as 50 other politicians expected to make the pilgrimage over the course of the day. China summoned Japan&apos;s ambassador for an emergency meeting to lodge &quot;stern representations and express strong opposition and severe condemnation&quot; over the visit. &quot;The issue of the Yasukuni shrine relates to whether or not Japan can correctly recognise and face up to the history of invasion of the Japanese militarists and whether or not they can respect the feelings of the people of China and the other victim nations in Asia,&quot; the foreign ministry said. Japanese conservatives argue that they have the right to honour those enshrined at Yasukuni, including 2.5 million soldiers, sailors and airmen to have died in battle since the second half of the 19th century. Abe had said he would not prevent cabinet ministers from attending the Shinto shrine \u2013 a rallying point for Japanese far-right groups on the war anniversary \u2013 saying it was &quot;natural to pay respects to the spirits [of those] who fought for the people of Japan&quot;. Keiji Furuya, one of two ministers who visited Yasukuni on Thursday, said: &quot;I came as a Japanese citizen to pray here for those who sacrificed their lives. Paying homage to the war dead is a purely domestic matter and it&apos;s not for other countries to criticise us or intervene in these matters.&quot;\u00a0 There have been tensions with China over rival claims to the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea, and with South Korea over Japan&apos;s use of as many as 200,000 Asian sex slaves \u2013 mostly young Korean women \u2013 in military brothels before and during the war. Little progress has been made in Japanese attempts to arrange a summit between Abe and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. South Korea&apos;s president, Park Geun-hye, called on Japan to resolve historical hangovers from its 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula. &quot;I urge Japanese politicians to show brave leadership in healing the wounds of the past, and that&apos;s how Japan could become a partner for a genuine co-operation,&quot; Park said in a speech to mark the anniversary of the end of Japanese rule. Robert Menendez, chairman of the US senate foreign relations committee, welcomed Abe&apos;s decision not to visit Yasukuni, calling it &quot;an expression of looking towards the future and understanding the decision in the context of Japan&apos;s future in the region&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["The film &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; by Yasujiro Ozu captures and sustains this feeling beautifully of any artwork I can think of."], "tags": ["Edinburgh international book festival", "Chris Ware", "Books", "Culture", "Comics and graphic novels"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-15T13:04:00Z", "title": "Live webchat: Chris Ware", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/aug/15/live-webchat-chris-ware-graphic-novelist", "article": "Fresh from his appearance at the Edinburgh international book festival, the comic book writer and artist Chris Ware will be joining us on Monday to answer your questions. Chris is one of the graphic novelists taking part of a special programme of events at the festival this year called Stripped: Comics and Graphic Novels Laid Bare and on Wednesday night took to the stage with Joe Sacco  \u2013 as you can see on our live blog. Back in 2001, Ware won the Guardian&apos;s first book award for Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth. His work has appeared in a number of publications, including the New York Times.     Building Stories by Chris Ware. Photograph: Chris Ware/Jonathan Cape    His most recent book, the acclaimed graphic novel Building Stories, follows the lives of the inhabitants of a building in Chicago: the landlady on the ground floor, the young woman living in the first floor flat and the woman living at the top of the building. The work comes in a large, beautiful box, and inside the story is made up of various leaflets, books and pamphlets. For Sam Leith it&apos;s the latest demonstration of how Ware finds expressive potential in graphic fiction &quot;that you simply couldn&apos;t have anticipated&quot;.  When you read a Chris Ware comic you can be fairly sure that you&apos;ll end up with a migraine from the tiny writing, or suicidal from the worldview, and yet he&apos;s so damn good you do it anyway. It&apos;s impossible to overstate how meticulously his work hangs together: the symmetries on a single page; the motifs that worm through it; the multiple counterpointed stories.  Chris Ware will be online here, from 1pm BST on Monday 19 August. Post your questions now and we&apos;ll see you next week on Monday to join in the conversation. We&apos;ve posted the questions and answers here to make the conversation easier to follow: Chris Ware says: Hi \u2026 so, first, I feel compelled to apologize to everyone who so kindly asked questions; aside from feeling uncomfortable with words only, I sadly don&apos;t tweet, post to Facebook or tumbl, to say nothing of being green to the web chat experience \u2014 and so hope I won&apos;t embarrass myself or the Guardian. I prefer written interviews to speaking because writing gives me the chance to smooth over my inarticulate, bumbling speech, consider my answers and not waste a reader&apos;s time. Anyway \u2026 here goes, and thank you for your very kind words. MikeInfinitum asks: The structure of your pages and panels are often integral to the narrative. Do you plan the page after knowing the story, or do you tailor the story to fit with an idea for page layout? Chris Ware replies: I don&apos;t plan or write ahead of time, having found through painful trial and error than anything I did script ended up dead on arrival. Instead I try to allow the feedback loop of staring at a blank page with few distractions other than my own memories, disappointments and yearnings direct a story and set a tone. I start at the top or in the middle of the page and whatever happens, happens. I keep vague notes but fundamentally I believe it&apos;s very important for a story to find its own structure rather than the other way around \u2014 it&apos;s the central tenet of Louis Sullivan&apos;s architectural theory (his word, not mine) and I&apos;ve found it to be true \u2014 really the only way to find the &quot;shape of life&quot; in an honest, awkward way that feels and hopefully is human. Our minds are already very organized things; the trick, I think, is simply to trust them. AnneFrankenstein asks: How much of your material is drawn (&apos;scuse the pun) from your own life &amp; experiences? A lot of it is so poignent and sad, it often makes me wonder if you&apos;ve had quite a hard life. PS I anticipate there will be a lot of fawning on this thread but I&apos;d just like to say I think you&apos;re wonderful. Chris Ware replies: Thank you so much; I really appreciate your generosity. I&apos;ve lived a very lucky life, not hard at all. Certainly there has been some difficult stuff \u2014 illness, death, disappointment, heartbreak \u2014 but nothing most everyone else hasn&apos;t experienced. The truth is that life is sad, for lack of a better word, but it&apos;s also something else: a sensation we rarely feel because as adults we spend most of out time and effort trying to figure out how to dull and tamp down: it&apos;s sort of a combination of tenderness, empathy, vulnerability and anger. We probably feel this most intensely as children and especially as adolescents, but the sensation is still always there humming underneath everything, and in moments of extreme emotion comes to the fore; these are the times as adults when we feel &quot;life&quot; most deeply. The film &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; by Yasujiro Ozu captures and sustains this feeling beautifully of any artwork I can think of. Firstact says: I don&apos;t want to bum anyone out, though. I just want to highlight this feeling \u2014 to produce a sense of what life feels like more than anything else. Chris Ware replies: Thank you so much; you&apos;re very kind. Can you send me that in an email form every day? MisterBrahms asks: Reading your stuff is pretty depressing. When will you be doing more? Chris Ware replies: Uh, in about an hour and a half, just as soon as I&apos;m done with this.Sorry to depress you; that&apos;s not my aim, genuinely. lewislewis asks: Given that your work often features the potential for detachment and coldness in excessive use of technology, and an obvious warmth towards the more traditional, what was the thinking behind &apos;Touch Sensitive&apos; being Ipad only? I couldn&apos;t read it and it p****d me off! Chris Ware replies: Apologies; as the above person mentions [undeletedscenes], it was designed as a six-page strip and appears in the finished &quot;Building Stories.&quot; The iPad version was an attempt to use the touch sensitive interface as a rather self-conscious poetic device to write about how, in relationships, physical contact can devolve from affection to aggression. (I prefer the print version, myself.) Also, I have no preference for any operating system; it was because it was indeed through McSweeney&apos;s. I think Steve Jobs should be credited with reinventing the universal gesture for &quot;trying to remember something&quot; from looking above one&apos;s head to fumbling in one&apos;s pocket. circling127 asks: What are your favourite non-graphic fictions (novels, I suppose...)? Have you ever been tempted to write anything sans pictures, or are the narratives mostly an excuse to do a lot of drawing? Chris Ware replies: I always think I should carry around a laminated card; favorite writers include but are not limited to Tolstoy, Joyce, Chekhov, Updike, Zadie Smith, Nabokov, Alice Munro, David Foster Wallace, Dave Eggers, Cheever, Dostoevsky, George Saunders, Flannery O&apos;Connor, Willa Cather, etc. etc. etc. I&apos;ve sort of tried writing &quot;words only&quot; but the experience is always like skating on oiled glass; I never know where I am, and I can&apos;t figure out how to stop sliding. There&apos;s something unique and strange about writing with images which compels me to continue. Besides, Nabokov himself noted we thought not only in words, but also in pictures. I like the dumb, flat disposability of comics; they allow for a more direct experience with a reader, if not an admittedly uneconomical one, work-to-reading-time-wise. But that&apos;s my problem, not the reader&apos;s. iomamo asks: 1) Do you still find inspiration from within the world of comics? Are there young comics writers whose work you feel is pushing the boundaries of the medium in the way yours does? 2) After Building Stories, what next? Would you consider a shorter, self-contained graphic novel? Chirs Ware replies: Very much so; there are more great cartoonists working now than ever before, and just in the past year, more genuinely thoughtful and literary \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 graphic novels than in a long time: Miriam Katin, Kim Deitch, Rutu Modan, Ben Katchor, Gary Panter, Seth and Gilbert Hernandez all have new books, and I hear Adrian Tomine&apos;s new comic is great, but I haven&apos;t seen it yet. As for experimental younger artists, I&apos;m amazed by Dash Shaw, if he&apos;s still considered young. The UK&apos;s own NoBrow publishes books which are almost all universally astounding and humbling to me; Jon McNaught&apos;s new book is very quiet and subtle. Then there are all the newest cartoonists that at this point I almost can&apos;t even keep track of, which is great; everyone seems to be making everyone try harder, which is as it should be. Cartooning is a very living language. It&apos;s not dead, unlike what some of my painting teachers were telling me painting was twenty years ago. As for your second question, I&apos;ve been working on another graphic novel for at least as long as &quot;Building Stories&quot; and an serializing it as I finish in my hardcover periodical &quot;The ACME Novelty Library.&quot; The last two chapters are almost stand-alone stories, and I&apos;m hoping this next one will be, too. As I mentioned above, comics are a quick read, but not quick work, sadly. justwilliamsluck asks: First of all: Thank you.Secondly: I find lots to admire in the artwork of a lot of graphic novelists but only occasionally find graphic novels that really justify their place amongst great literature; books whose form is truly the best way to tell that story. What are the graphic works that you really admire and what is it about them that makes them great in your eyes?Thirdly: Thanks again Chris Ware replies: Thank you, as well. And I agree with you. Comics are still in their late adolescence (I think just emerged from it) so the pantheon of genuine literature is small, but it&apos;s there. I&apos;ve edited two anthologies (McSweeney&apos;s and Best American Comics) which force my taste on the reader more than I should be allowed to, but as far as books go I think most about Art Spiegelman&apos;s &quot;Maus&quot; as an example of concentrated effort, intelligence and invention \u2014 and beyond that there are so many I just can&apos;t list them or play favorites. As cartoonists, we&apos;re all still pretty much alive and very sensitive people, and I&apos;d hate to leave anyone out. lewislewis asks: Did you base Jimmy Corrigan&apos;s looks on Piers Morgan? Come on, you can tell us. Chris Ware replies: Honestly, I don&apos;t know Piers Morgan, though I suppose I could google-image-search him. Jimmy Corrigan has my grandfather&apos;s hair, Charlie Brown&apos;s eyes, Tintin&apos;s pants and my self-doubt and that&apos;s about it, I&apos;m afraid. DrPhilipEly asks: Graphic artists (and designers) tend to be inspired by the productive outputs of peers and mentors rather than the personalities behind them. Knowing the trials and tribulations of the person behind the art is as much help to aspiring artists as the work itself. Are you happy to share your own personal perspectives with emerging talent? Or would you prefer to remain private? Chris Ware replies: Well, I&apos;m doing this interview, and I just spent the last three weeks answering mail that went back to 2007, so I do try to not be a jerk when someone asks me for advice or sends me their work, but having my daughter sort of lessened the time I have for such things. I also try to be as honest as I possibly can with anyone who puts themselves through the rigamarole of trying to do this stuff. I was miserable myself for years and I know it&apos;s no fun to learn how to do and there&apos;s very little to encourage one for the solitude and doubt it can engender. The personalities of my peers are certainly an influence, as well; there are mean and self-centered people in every profession just as there are extremely generous ones, and it&apos;s curious and useful to see how the work and the person line up, and how they choose to appear and describe themselves. Aidan Winterburn asks: Don&apos;t you ever hanker after comics&apos; rather illicit, primitivist and disrespectable reputation, the misregistered two colour on newsprint rather than the high production values and the book as fetishistic object? Chris Ware replies: Any cartoonist loves this awkward aspect of his or her craft; it&apos;s almost always what drew us in to becoming cartoonists to being with. We have an enviable relationship with readers/viewers that allows for immediate disposal of our life&apos;s work without regret if a reader loses our trust. More pointedly, I come to prefer clarity over illegilbity, except in regards to storytelling. I spent a couple of years in high school trying to fog my perceptions and found it pretty unhelpful. Matteos asks: Chris I&apos;d love to hear a little about your friendship with Charles Burns and any similarities or differences you see between your work. What (if anything) about his work has influenced yours? For my part he&apos;s the only contemporary cartoonist whose work deserves the same superlatives as your own (though frankly I think he&apos;s the more complete storyteller). Many thanks for hours of great pleasure reading your books. Chris Ware replies: Charles is unquestionably one of the greatest cartoonists who&apos;s ever lived, both technically and humanely. What a number of readers assume is a fascination popular culture in his work is actually an ever-increasing attempt to pin down that unpinnable moment when we shift from being children to being adolescents, and then later when we shift from adolescence to adulthood. He&apos;s also one of the warmest and most generous people I&apos;ve ever met, truly sensitive to people&apos;s insecurities and reluctant to make himself the center of any attention. The model cartoonist father, he&apos;s raised with his wife (a painter, Susan Moore) two of the most well-adjusted and intelligent women I&apos;ve had the pleasure to meet, and they clearly love and admire him. Over the years he&apos;s offered parenting advice to me, both pre- and post-having-children, that&apos;s proved invaluable. There are only a handful of people in the world I feel completely &quot;myself&quot; around, and he&apos;s one of them. That he was one of my artistic heroes in high school and is now one of my best friends is one of the great mysteries of my life, but one I&apos;m certainly grateful for. evolute asks: Will a 21st Acme Novelty Library be coming out anytime soon? Chris Ware replies: I&apos;m working on it right now, I swear. Thank you for asking. I&apos;m sorry. I hope to be done in the next few months. 0hmyme asks: I love your work. It has changed the way i see the world. My first question is pretty much the same as evolute&apos;s, when will you be releasing a new book? This fall? I hope so. Is it going to be to do with Rusty? Also, at the start of ANL 19, regarding Herb Lichtenstein&apos;s &quot;from the mail bag&quot; letter, where can the strip in question be found? All the best as ever, Ian. Chris Ware replies: Thank you for your very kind words. As per above, I&apos;m working on it. I think the strip Herb Lichtenstein mentioned is in the questionable &quot;ACME Novelty Report to Shareholders&quot; published during the second Bush administration in a handful of western languages and now likely remaindered everywhere/available from Amazon. undeletedscenes asks: Hi Chris. Firstly, let me say I&apos;m a huge admirer of your work. I&apos;m an English Literature PhD student, currently researching for my thesis on comics, art, mass markets and modernism. I&apos;m sure you&apos;re aware that Comics Studies is a growing academic discipline, and I wonder if you might share your thoughts on that. I think you&apos;ve indicated in the past that you find it strange that academics would be interested in your work, but you&apos;re one of the most discussed cartoonists in Comics Studies and I&apos;m interested to know how you feel about that? I recently gave a conference paper on your iPad comic, Touch Sensitive, and I wonder if you might consider doing more digital work in the future as I thought Touch Sensitive made excellent use of the medium. You&apos;ve said before that you don&apos;t like charging people for electronic content, but if you could make the content as architecturally spectacular as Building Stories, or as intricate as Jimmy Corrigan, would you put it out on a digital platform? Chris Ware replies: Many thanks for your kind words and interest, and I hope you got an &quot;A.&quot; I mentioned something about this above, but overall I just don&apos;t like the feel of digital comics \u2014 they seem sort of insubstantial to me and there&apos;s something about working with what are ineffable sentiments, ideas and sensations that seems to demand a contradicting sort of form to contain them, though maybe I was in art school for too long. I&apos;ve certainly thought about it, however, and was genuinely excited by the iPad when it was released. The idea of the z axis of comics (i.e. of being able to go &quot;through&quot; a page) which Richard McGuire first figured out in his strip &quot;Here,&quot; ironically, by seeing the windows computer interface, certainly seems like a next frontier, if there is one. I still like things that don&apos;t plug in, however. Beno\u00eet Crucifix asks: Your works, and even more so with Building Stories, engage with the reader in a very particular way: I feel like they are distancing because of the tiny letters and formal complexity, and yet succeed in getting across a great deal of empathy, fostering a strong identification with the characters. How do you see your relationship to your readers? What is your &apos;ideal reader&apos;? How do you want to impact on him/her, and how do you use the comics medium to do so? What about the reader&apos;s role in Building Stories? A related question, but more general: how do you think a reader &apos;inhabits&apos; the comics s/he reads? Many thanks for your comics, all the best! Chris Ware replies: I try not to think of the reader at all beyond trying to make something that&apos;s clear and readable; I have no one type or person in mind, though I might curtail something here or there if it seems like one of my friends might think something was about them. You&apos;ve already noted how I hope to affect the reader \u2014 which is on an empathetic level \u2014 so thank you for that. It sounds very sappy and dumb but really, if it&apos;s possible to encourage a little bit of kindness then I guess I&apos;d be thrilled to think I might&apos;ve somehow done so. Comics indeed allow for a strange sort of &quot;inhabitation&quot; of story which not only presents the illusion that something is happening on the page right before the eyes, but also within the reader&apos;s mind and memory. I&apos;ve said this a gazillion times before, but one almost goes blind while reading prose; reading comics keeps the eyes sort of half-open. YuanMei asks: Congratulations, Chris Ware, for your marvellous art and books.May I ask you what you think about the work of Herg\u00e8, Steinberg, Seth, Tatsumi and Taniguchi? Your work often makes me think it&apos;s done by an Eastern hand... I&apos;m also intrigued by your drawing materials. Do you happen to use Rotring pens by any chance? Which pens do you most work with? Thank you. Chris Ware replies: Thank you very much for your very kind words, as well. I love all the artists you mention, and I&apos;d consider Seth one of my closest friends. There&apos;s a history of appreciating drawing in Japanese art especially that necessary to comics&apos; functioning \u2014 the reading of images, rather than just the looking at them \u2014 that western art seems to have had a real hang up over for, like, centuries. Drawing, to me, reflects the way we think, remember and even see sometimes more than painting or photography. I use a .13 Rotring rapidograph in my daily comic strip diary but I draw my comics with a #2 series 795 Loew-Cornell round watercolor brush and Dr. Martin&apos;s tech black ink on 4-ply Strathmore bristol board. I use a Namiki Falcon SF fountain pen that I&apos;ve sort of filed down a little when I&apos;m drawing in my regular sketchbook. Has anyone else noticed that the paper in those Moleskine journals is actually printed with yellow ink? P.S. I&apos;d add Hokusai to the list. onerodeahorse asks: Do you perceive your work as being political at all, and if so, in what ways? Chris Ware replies: The tremendous time that it takes to draw comics prevents me from doing something that&apos;s right up to the minute, but that doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t occasionally try, more often with the occasional New Yorker cover (like the back to school and Mother&apos;s Day covers from this year.) On the back cover of one of my periodicals during Bush&apos;s last term I did a fake advertisement about cultural imperialism, racism and Guantanamo Bay and figured once Obama was elected it would cease to make sense, but sadly it still appears to be relevant. Additionally, of course, it hasn&apos;t made any difference at all. Joe Sacco is the finest example one could make for politics very visibly and usefully entering our humble profession; he not only focuses on the moral outrage involved in abuses of power, but he puts such an inescapably human face on it \u2014 genuinely trying to inhabit the lives and feelings of the people he interviews \u2014 that I believe his work is a real force for good, and actual change, as well. TheGraduate asks: Hi Chris Firstly, thanks for taking the time to answer our questions. When you first started out, did you experience self doubts, which I assume everyone does at some point, and how did you overcome them? For instance, believing in a story or character you&apos;ve created enough to put it out to a wider audience. Also, who first gave you the encouragement to make a career out of your artwork? Many thanksJes Chris Ware replies: My mother definitely gave me the first encouragement to become an artist, from praising my earliest drawings to signing me up for art classes to encouraging me to go to art school to telling me that she didn&apos;t care what I did with my life as long as I tried to be &quot;the best at it I possibly could,&apos; with the addendum that one should always try to leave a place in a better state than it was when you got there (i.e. the world.) Not that I&apos;m exactly doing that, but they&apos;re good words to live by, I think. And yes, I suffered greatly from self-doubts, debilitatingly so. The only way I overcame them (and I haven&apos;t really; I&apos;ve just learned to live with them) was to keep working and hope, somehow, I got past them. alicelander asks: Chicken and egg question - which comes first, lovely things you can draw to help communicate a feeling, or the feeling itself? do you write your stories out in sentences before committing them to the comic? Also, they&apos;re all just so beautiful and sad, I love your work. thank you. Chris Ware replies: Thank you, as well \u2026 I really appreciate everyone&apos;s kind words. This is difficult to say, but probably the feeling itself; frequently it changes as I work, however, which is why I draw comics \u2014 I genuinely don&apos;t always know what&apos;s going to happen. And no, I don&apos;t script ahead of time; as I mention above, I might keep a few notes but that&apos;s about all. chrispheasey asks: Is writing the really dense, text-heavy sections in the Acme Novelty Library a sort of therapy for having to keep things so sparse and text-light when producing the panels? It&apos;s a little intimidating to turn the page not knowing whether it&apos;s going to be a page of images or a page of 1000s of tiny words (not a complaint). Chris Ware replies: I guess it used to be something of an &quot;expulsion,&quot; but mostly I was trying to contrast two different emotional experiences, that of empathy and hilarity, since I think they spring from different places within one but are genuinely real and important, though as I&apos;ve gotten older I&apos;ve found less the need to do so, as they seem to co-exist within the stories themselves (hopefully) a little more comfortably. chrispheasey asks: Will the Rusty Brown plot line continue in Acme Novelty Library 21? Do you know now how many more editions it will span (including other characters from that world, as the Lint story covered)? Chris Ware replies: It will. The story is rather self-consciously divided into chapters about six different people and how their lives intertwine and affect each other, for better or for worse. Hopefully, I&apos;ll be done before my daughter is applying to college. (She&apos;s eight years old now.) Liv Siddall asks: One more question, do you listen to anything while you draw? Chris Ware replies: I find that any music playing while I&apos;m writing distracts and confuses me; sometimes I&apos;ll actually think I&apos;m encoding the emotions of the music into my pages as I&apos;m working and then later when I read them, the feeling isn&apos;t there at all. Thus, I find silence is imperative for writing, but when I&apos;m inking I can do anything, from listening to recorded books to talking on the phone. Now that I spell this all out, it sounds sort of sad, I guess, but the two different states of mind help me focus, I guess. dressedtodepress asks: I&apos;m probably late, but my favourite thing about your comics is that you take diagrams from other walks of life and have turned them into storytelling forms, family trees that chart events back in time, archtiectural cutaways into buildings and people, medical diagram styles. How did you get into using them in that way? Chris Ware replies: I worked a little while on my undergraduate student newspaper as the graphic designer and had to make info-graphics about local news events, and from that experience I started to see the potential of using such devices to communicate something about relationships between characters and places in my stories; diagrams have a sense of &quot;verb tense&quot; to them that seems almost transcendental, for lack of a less pretentious word. As well, the comic strips of Mark Newgarden in RAW magazine pointed to this sort of reductivist approach, and I studied them carefully. Finally, I&apos;ve already mentioned Richard McGuire, but he pretty much single-handedly created the idea of organizing images on a page diagrammatically. His book &quot;Here&quot; will be released next year and I can guarantee will be a monumental landmark in storytelling, both in its published and electronic forms. conspirateur asks: Hi Chris! I&apos;m a HUGE fan, so first off, thank you. This might be a bit late... I was wondering if you would talk a little about if/how cinema has influenced your work? I&apos;ve always thought that the comics format worked in a similar way to film, emotionally - but, with Building Stories, it seems you&apos;ve found a narrative device that&apos;s inaccessible to film. Do you take inspiration from film and are you optimistic or pessimistic about its future as an artform? Chris Ware replies: As I mentioned above, I love film, but I think comics has its own mechanisms and engines and language that work entirely apart from the idea of a camera; I&apos;ve sort of flogged this idea to death, but I truly believe the comics form sort of froze esthetically in the 1930s/1940s when it began imitating the conceits of moviemaking; before that, newspaper comics especially were wildly inventive, strange and experimental. It wasn&apos;t until the 1960s and the so-called undergrounds with artists like Crumb, Spiegelman, Justin Green and Kim Deitch that things really started to get going again. It seems to me that with the advent of digital cameras things can only get better for film; it&apos;s almost as easy to make a film now as it is to make a comic strip \u2014 maybe even easier. billbuswell asks: Hi Chris. What staggers me is not just the quality of the work but the amount of quality work you produce. What is your working day like in terms of structure? Are there days where you only work on one discipline say colouring or inking? Do you get time to read, watch tv, go to the cinema etc.? GREAT sketchbooks by the way \u2013 very inspiring to see such lovely observational drawing. Are there any plans for a further Acme Datebook? Chris Ware replies: Thank you so much; really. It&apos;s not really that much, though maybe it seems like it is because it&apos;s presented all stacked up. My workday is entirely predicated on the Oak Park school system; i.e. once I get my daughter to school I sit down and try to concentrate as diligently as I can with as few distractions as possible, a situation which the internet does not exactly foment. (I turn off the computer most of the time for this reason.) Once my daughter is home from school we might plan or spend time together before picking up my wife from work (she&apos;s a high school teacher) and then the evening is generally spent getting or going to dinner. I might be able to work again once everyone&apos;s in bed, but frequently I just read. I&apos;m very grateful for this life, and never expected in a million years I&apos;d be so lucky. I&apos;m planning a third volume of the Datebook \u2014 thank you for asking \u2014 but since starting my comic strip diary in 2002 I simply don&apos;t draw in my &quot;regular&quot; sketchbook as much as I used to. But I still do, and hopefully one day a third one will appear, though I don&apos;t think the planet will stop spinning until then. Chris Ware says: Thank you, and thank you so much to everyone, again. I&apos;m afraid I have to stop now, though, as I guess we&apos;ve gone beyond the time limit. My very warmest of wishes and most grateful regards for all your thoughtful questions, and the best of days to everyone, Chris W."}, {"sentences": ["Mike Tolkin&apos;s team finished last, beaten in Los Angeles by Tonga (18-9) and by Fiji (35-10) and Japan (38-20) in Nagoya and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Rugby World Cup", "Canada rugby union team", "USA rugby union team", "Rugby World Cup 2015", "US sports", "Rugby union", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-15T14:30:00Z", "title": "US Eagles seek elusive win in Rugby World Cup qualifier against Canada | Martin Pengelly", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/15/us-eagles-canada-rugby-world-cup", "article": "As the first of two World Cup qualifiers against Canada approaches, American men&apos;s rugby has about it a definite sense of momentum. Unfortunately, that momentum has mostly been in evidence off the field.  With rugby sevens to be played at the 2016 Rio Olympics, talented athletes have been attracted from other sports. Attempts to establish a professional 15s competition continue, if as yet without fruition; New York and San Francisco are sending teams to this weekend&apos;s World Club Sevens, in London; a record crowd watched the Eagles&apos; June Test against Ireland in Houston; and in May a very well connected audience congregated in Philadelphia for the Global Rugby Forum, an ambitious discussion of the future of the American game. That was followed by a step towards the necessary establishment of men&apos;s rugby as a genuine college sport, as NBC announced that it will broadcast the final of the 2014 Varsity Cup. On the field, though, the Eagles have had a challenging time. They began 2013 with a 16-9 defeat by Canada in Edmonton, in the Pacific Nations Cup, which Canada finished as runners-up, to Fiji. Mike Tolkin&apos;s team finished last, beaten in Los Angeles by Tonga (18-9) and by Fiji (35-10) and Japan (38-20) in Nagoya and Tokyo. In the middle of that schedule, an Ireland team missing 10 British and Irish Lions escaped from the BBVA Compass Stadium with a 15-12 win.  In Houston and elsewhere, it was fair to say the Eagles had problems, not least in scoring tries and scrummaging. Nonetheless, their coach remains optimistic. &quot;Despite a disappointing summer,&quot; Tolkin says, &quot;we feel confident in our team. We have been making some adjustments to the way we play, but overall, we feel that we are a good team. Results are always vital in Test rugby; however, we can&apos;t rush through building and developing a program. We need to keep going to work each day and improve each time out.&quot; An improvement on the Eagles&apos; last display with a full-strength team might well be enough for victory over Canada \u2013 it&apos;s worth noting that while the Eagles, with the tough-tackling flanker Samu Manoa leading the way, stayed within three points of the Irish and kept their own line intact, the Canadians conceded six tries to a team that was even further depleted, and lost 40-14.  The US do not, however, have to get the win on Saturday, at Blackbaud Stadium in Charleston. The playoff against Canada is over two games (the second is at BMO Field in Toronto on 24 August), and it will be the winner on aggregate score who will qualify for England 2015. Nor would an aggregate defeat be a disaster \u2013 the loser will go on to another two-legged playoff, against Uruguay. (Even the loser of that will have another life, in a repechage competition with teams from outside the Americas.) But life will be a lot simpler if the Eagles can get past the Canadians.            Reading on mobile? Watch this video here They haven&apos;t done that too often of late \u2013 or indeed ever, Canada having won 36 of 49 meetings since 1977, with one tie \u2013 but there can be no doubt the Eagles have the talent to prevail this time. Against Ireland, for example, Tolkin fielded a back row of Todd Clever (who plays in Japan and has played Super Rugby in South Africa), Scott LaValla (who plays for Stade Fran\u00e7ais in Paris) and Manoa, who has blindsided any number of unsuspecting unfortunates in England with Northampton. Tolkin rested most of his top players for the PNC defeats but apart from the centre Paul Emerick, who thanks to a persistent ankle injury has announced his retirement from the game, they will be back to face the Canadians. Asked if this summer&apos;s tough schedule has benefited his players, particularly those who do not play for clubs at the highest level, Tolkin replies: &quot;Without question. The quality of the opposition improved from November [when the Eagles beat Russia and Romania], and we experienced it for the first time this summer with a lot of young players. After a little time off, the lessons have sunk in and we are all ready to bring a better game out against Canada.&quot;     Luke Hume attacks against Ireland. Photograph: Thomas B Shea/Getty Images    Key to that game \u2013 as to any game of rugby played by any team anywhere in the world \u2013 will be the generalship of the two teams&apos; fly-halves, the quarterbacks of the union game. Tolkin is encouraged by the progress shown so far this year by his pick in the position, the Californian-born, Australian-raised New York Athletic Club prospect Toby L&apos;Estrange. &quot;Toby is a very good play maker and has excellent skills and devotion to our squad and to the game,&quot; Tolkin says. &quot;He would be one of the players who learned a lot from his experience this summer.&quot; When it comes to determining US rugby&apos;s progress on the field, Tolkin, L&apos;Estrange and the more experienced heads around him \u2013 and indeed everyone concerned with the American game \u2013 are about to learn a whole lot more.

Unfortunately, these generally grafted circles onto standard Henry Beck schematic map rules: horizontal and vertical straight lines, and 45 degree diagonals. From the point of view of a circle, there is nothing special about these angles, and the results suffered from having elements that related to each other poorly.  The most effective way to relate concentric circles to straight lines is to use spokes and tangents. Thus was born my &apos;Circles Tube Map&apos;, which immediately went viral on the internet. Many found the concept too alien, but others were mesmerised by its unearthly charm, totally unlike any underground map seen before.     Click here to explore the London Underground map based on concentric circles by Max Roberts     I had intended the circles tube map as a playful exploration rather than an improvement in usability, but the positive response caused me to rethink.  The design lost points for simplicity - its lines twisting and turning with many unavoidable corners - but the payback was a massive gain in coherence - the way in which the elements of a map holistically relate to each other, ideally giving the overall result a clear pattern and shape. This had not occurred to me when I commenced the design, and usability testing will soon follow to investigate this. Any new concept needs extensive testing. Was the London success a one-off, or could good results be achieved for other cities? If so, which ones, and why?  The obvious starting point was cities with famous loops or circles, so that Madrid, Berlin, Paris, Moscow, Tokyo, Washington DC and Chicago all followed.      Berlin Underground map. Design by Dr Max Roberts. Click on the image for the full size    Berlin is the most successful, Paris has a lot of distortion, and Tokyo is strangely beautiful, most unlike the official version. Chicago was interesting because it&apos;s city structure is a classic American grid, and the railways follow this meticulously. Circles and radiating lines conflict with this totally. I completed the design, but would forgive anyone from Chicago who found the distortion upsetting. No map designer can ignore the New York subway forever, one of the oldest and most complex networks in the world. Although the city grid is not as rigid as Chicago, there are no real orbital subway links to emphasise. A circles-and-spokes approach offers no obvious benefit for this city, and without a clear centre defined by orbits, where should the spokes radiate from? I should not even have attempted this map, there are so many others on my list of things to do.     Paris Metro map. Design by Dr Max Roberts. Click on the image for the full size    I used my standard approach for New York: starting from Lower Manhattan and working up to Manhattan Bridge, make all the stations fit, and keep the lines straight, then build south-east: the intertwined lines in the south of Brooklyn define the width and height of the map.  A point of radiation in New York Harbour gave me just enough space to fit everything into Lower Manhattan, a perfect semi-circle from the Manhattan Bridge all the way to Bay Ridge, and left me with enough space to make the rest of the map nice and balanced. DeKalb Avenue is always difficult, and eastern Queens needed some thinking, but that was it, the design almost crystallised in front of me. The New York subway has been forced into an unprecedented level of organisation. It has generated an enormous positive response from New Yorkers, with thousands of internet likes.  There is geographical distortion, and a few awkward spots where the lines cannot decide whether they are orbital or radial and end up zigzagging. Some people may object to its aesthetics, and geographical purists will dislike it in the same way that they distrust all highly schematised designs, but the overall spaciousness and power is harder to dispute.      Tokyo Metro map. Design by Dr Max Roberts. Click on the image for the full size    I&apos;ve always argued that geographical maps and schematic maps have distinct roles to play, each serves a purpose, and so any transport undertaking that refuses to make both available is short-changing its customers.  A good geographical map shows where the network is, a good schematic shows how the elements of a network relate together logically. An uncomfortable hybrid serves neither role effectively. Whatever the usability study outcomes, if a product is attractive and powerful for some people, so that they enjoy looking at it, that is half the battle won for the information designer. Maps that are attractive are more likely to be used, and people are less likely to turn elsewhere for help. In turn, they will acquire more knowledge about the network the more they use a map, creating a virtuous circle of learning. Unfortunately, when it comes to aesthetic considerations, you can&apos;t please all people all the time but in this day an age, catering for individual differences in preference is not difficult. Every person should have the opportunity to choose a design that he or she is most comfortable with. \u2022 Dr Max Roberts is a lecturer in psychology at the University of Essex, where he designs maps and tests them in objective usability studies.

Now Lady Gaga wants to be both", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/18/lady-gaga-artpop-album-avant-garde", "article": "The message is crystal clear: do not buy Lady Gaga&apos;s latest album or download tracks because she is &quot;over&quot; and &quot;no longer relevant&quot;. Many will be happy to obey, but it&apos;s not quite that simple. The clarity of the instruction is undermined by the fact that it&apos;s Gaga herself who is telling her audience to chuck her over in favour of something new. Her promotional trailer for the album Artpop is not the first to deploy reverse psychology in the marketplace, but the flamboyant New York singer could well be the first to bill her campaign as the birth of a new artistic movement. Citing the work of pop artist Andy Warhol, Gaga, 27, is setting out &quot;to alter the human experience with social media&quot; and to &quot;bring art culture into pop in a reverse Warholian expedition&quot;. So what exactly is she asking fans to sign up to? An early clue came last week when Gaga, who has already sold 23m albums, was forced to release Applause, the first single from the album, a week early after it was leaked online. Gaga, who performs at London&apos;s Roundhouse on September 1, quickly put out a &quot;pop music emergency&quot; tweet to her millions of followers before taking to the streets of Manhattan with her face painted to promote the track. Far from a disaster then, since her perverse advertising push for the album was under way, and she is due to sing the song live at the MTV Music Awards next Sunday. This will be her first performance following hip surgery in February, and the first time fans will see her newly reduced body shape. Unusually, the Gaga body has been more in focus than the Gaga wardrobe this summer because of a series of nude photo sessions for the next cover of V Magazine , and work with the avant-garde Serbian artist Marina Abramovic. It&apos;s all part of a concerted association with the art world that is to be clinched next month with the launch of a social media app that seeks &quot;to make connections between music, art, fashion and technology&quot;. True, you could argue these connections are already there, but these will be Gaga&apos;s own connections, fabricated in her bespoke Haus of Gaga workshop. Her team promise to &quot;explode on to the physical and virtual universe&quot; with the album, which will announce a new age, &quot;an age where art drives pop, and the artist once again is in control of the icon&quot;. Cynics may wonder whether the move towards a legitimate artworld platform is simply a strategy to refresh the Gaga brand. And yet the connection with pop art has credibility, not only because of her ironic epigrams about &quot;lying profusely&quot; in interviews, or her preoccupation with fame (her bestselling debut album of 2008 was called The Fame), but because she has picked up on abiding themes in the work of Warhol, the artist who once said: &quot;Making money is art, and working is art, and good business is the best art.&quot; The movement known as pop art began in Britain in the mid-50s, but was taken to the heart of New York&apos;s art scene by artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Warhol, who wanted to steer culture away from its association with elite groups. Irony and kitsch became central elements, as did highlighting the methods by which art was being reproduced for the masses. As a well-heeled Manhattan student, the young Gaga&apos;s thesis was on the art of Damien Hirst and the New York-based photographer Spencer Tunick. This weekend Tunick said that he approved of the singer&apos;s use of her &quot;phenomenal success&quot;. &quot;Any time there is a new perception within the mass culture, there is growth and enlightenment. Whether it&apos;s through museums, mass media and, in Lady Gaga&apos;s case, music, the inclusion of depth and art into a viral expressive mass outlet like pop music is invaluable in the expansion of new ideas. Hats off to Lady Gaga.&quot; Tunick said Gaga&apos;s involvement would &quot;bring a new perception or an experience of the avant garde to a mass audience&quot;: &quot;Any artistic intervention into the masses will only move societies in borderline conservative countries to have more acceptance towards human rights issues, women&apos;s rights and artistic freedom. Art cannot change the world within a bubble. It takes artists like Warhol, Koons and Abramovic to make strong waves of change in conservative societies.&quot; Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller also sees Gaga&apos;s creative ambitions as entirely acceptable, even necessary. &quot;She&apos;s not Warhol. He was a genius who was consistently blank, rather than outrageous. But she is doing exactly what she should be doing as a pop star, looking at everything that has happened in the 20th century and now, in the digital era,&quot; he said. If people are outraged, that is in the pop tradition, he argues: &quot;It&apos;s about being provocative, and a lot of contemporary art is also about pushing boundaries and innovation. You end up remembering those who did it first.&quot; Deller&apos;s art is often inspired by popular music, and his next show, All that is Solid Melts into Air, opening at Manchester Art Gallery in October, looks at working-class musical culture. He admires Gaga, he says, for building a community among her fans, who are known as Little Monsters to her Mother Monster. &quot;She nurtures them rather than just communicates.&quot; Pop music&apos;s links to the avant garde date back to its birth and were solemnised when Yoko Ono married John Lennon. More recently, while the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei has recorded a rock track, Abramovic has worked with Jay-Z. Gaga first talked of working with the performance artist in 2010 and has just made a Kickstarter video to raise funds for a centre for the practice of Abramovic&apos;s patented exercises, designed to train artists for physical endurance. &quot;She is a hardcore student,&quot; she said of Gaga. &quot;I had to blindfold her, and she was in the forest for three hours, eaten by mosquitoes and spiders, scratched by the bushes. It was quite incredible.&quot; Gaga has also worked with the Canadian artist Terence Koh, performing together in Tokyo to an ecstatic, if bewildered, crowd at a cosmetics promotion. &quot;When I&apos;m around Terence I just want to poop out art ideas nonstop,&quot; she has said. Koh sounds less convinced, concluding: &quot;Art is a diamond. The rest is just soft, silk pillows for art to tear apart.&quot; For some, however, it is more than Gaga&apos;s artistic credentials that are in doubt. In 2010 the feminist writer Camille Paglia pilloried the singer for peddling explicit imagery in a meaningless, asexual way. &quot;Can it be that Gaga represents the exhausted end of the sexual revolution?&quot; she asked. Fans swiftly countered that, for them, this is why Gaga is subversive. By highlighting both the artifice and her status as a plastic pop mannequin with the trademark deadpan expression Paglia has called her &quot;flat affect&quot;, the singer is really being more honest. If so, there are echoes of the &quot;deeply superficial&quot; Warhol again. Yet even among those who get the Gaga message, some have issues with the music itself. &quot;Lady Gaga has presented herself as a high-concept pop maverick from moment one,&quot; said Observer music writer Kitty Empire. &quot;She has consistently referenced Bowie and Warhol, and even came complete with a warehouse-cum-atelier of her own, Haus of Gaga. The trouble is, with the exception of her Bad Romance single, which sounded properly alien and exciting, much of Gaga&apos;s musical output has been thoroughly conventional dance-pop. Her new single, Applause, is no exception.&quot; Empire admits that, as a diverting entertainer, Gaga can still deliver. &quot;Her get-ups and pronouncements and cultural nods are roughly 347% more fun, and preposterous, and outr\u00e9, and enjoyable than most other mainstream pop artists. So when Gaga sings, &apos;now art&apos;s in pop culture&apos;s in me&apos;, it&apos;s not entirely posturing.&quot; Artpop is due for release in November"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;m not going to get to enjoy this for much longer this summer,&quot; he shrugs, staring down the barrel of a weeklong Tokyo-LA-New York-London interview schedule, then heaps more besides."], "tags": ["Franz Ferdinand", "Music"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-18T05:03:51Z", "title": "Franz Ferdinand: 'We'd become the opposite of what we wanted to be'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/aug/18/franz-ferdinand-interview", "article": "Last summer&apos;s hit novel Gone Girl opens with a\u00a0scene set in the trendy early noughties magazine circles of Brooklyn. &quot;The party is being thrown by one of Carmen&apos;s good friends who writes about movies\u2026&quot; begins the American author Gillian Flynn, throwing the protagonists into &quot;a whoosh of body heat and writerness\u2026 black-framed glasses and mops of hair\u2026 black wool pea-coats flopped all across the couch.&quot; A German poster for The Getaway covers &quot;one paint-cracked wall&quot;. Franz Ferdinand is &quot;on the stereo&quot;. The song playing is &quot;Take Me Out&quot;. I read this passage out loud to Alex Kapranos, singer with Franz Ferdinand. At first he says nothing, so I explain the subtext; how the group he formed in Glasgow in 2002 embodied a du jour cool. &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah,&quot; he says quickly, frowning, looking pained. We are in deepest, greenest Dumfriesshire, in the conservatory of a large, slightly ramshackle Victorian house the musician bought in 2004 as a bolthole, discussing Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action \u2013 Franz Ferdinand&apos;s fourth album, and their first since 2009. It is a bright energetic record, but one which has been clawed from a slough of despair. Kapranos wasn&apos;t aware of the Gone Girl namecheck, despite the thriller&apos;s bestseller status. Or perhaps it was because of it: Kapranos is an English graduate, one-time divinity student; the sort who references Soviet-era magic realists and Dadaism in his work. Of all the territories in which Franz Ferdinand had immediate soaraway success, the US proved the most burdensome. There are moments he would rather forget, such as the band&apos;s boss at their label in America flying to see them play for the first time in Boston \u2013 via private jet. &quot;And I&apos;m thinking, &apos;What the hell are we getting into here?&apos;&quot; Kapranos recalls, exasperated even now. Having been unable to stay with their UK indie label Domino in the US, the foursome were signed to a major. &quot;[Domino] only had three staff in America and couldn&apos;t physically deal with the amount of records that we were selling,&quot; Kapranos explains.     That was then: the band backstage at the ICA London in 2003. Photograph: Danny Clifford/Hottwire.net/WENN    Corporate music biz America proved to be a\u00a0world of largesse and excess. Things worsened for the band when their label was taken to court, accused of offering bribes to DJs to play the hot new releases by their hot new acts. Franz Ferdinand&apos;s name was read out as part of the prosecution case. &quot;And I was like, &apos;Fucking hell, here we are in court on some payola charge,&quot; Kapranos says. &quot;It was exactly the opposite of what I wanted to be as a band.&quot; He gives a grim nod. &quot;They pushed us in a way that didn&apos;t feel natural. I shouldn&apos;t complain too much \u2013 we sold lots and lots of records. But I think the way it accelerated so quickly was probably quite damaging for us.&quot; In many ways it was the beginning of the end for Franz Ferdinand. I first met the band 10 years ago, when Kapranos, Nick McCarthy (guitar, keyboards), Bob Hardy (bass) and Paul Thomson (drums) were playing Reading Festival&apos;s New Bands tent. They were yet to release a single and had an afternoon slot, immediately after another bunch of hopefuls called Razorlight. They were sensational: a pop band with spikes; a\u00a0rock band with jump-around adrenaline; an indie band with club-friendly synthesiser lines. They were a bit camp. I spoke to them backstage afterwards. &quot;Fantastic crowd today, so full of energy, we were getting so much back off them,&quot; the well-spoken Kapranos beamed in an accent that betrayed both a childhood in Sunderland and an adulthood in Glasgow. When I asked what this brand new band sounded like, the singer shot back: &quot;Music for girls to dance to.&quot; Five months later, &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, their second single, entered the UK charts at No 2. By spring 2004 their debut album had sold a\u00a0hefty 300,000 copies in two months; it would go on to sell 1.1m copies in America alone. That September it won the Mercury Music Prize and in February 2005 Franz Ferdinand took home two Brit Awards, for Best British Group and Best British Rock Act. Their second album, You Could Have It So Much Better, went platinum in the UK, gold in the US. Having watched them graduate from sticky Glasgow squats to festival headline slots, I found myself travelling to interview the band a handful of times, everywhere from Germany to Poland to America to Australia. Three weeks earlier than my visit to Kapranos&apos;s house, I met the rest of the band at McCarthy&apos;s studio in Hackney, the Sausage Factory, a cupboard-sized space in which the guitarist has crammed a junk-shop&apos;s worth of arcane musical kit. McCarthy, born in Blackpool and now aged 38, is first joined by Paul Thomson, 36, this so-called Scottish band&apos;s sole actual Scotsman. They tell me the album \u2013 a\u00a0short, sharp, whipsmart disco-rock record \u2013 was recorded in fits and starts in studios across London, Scotland and Sweden in the past year. Both pronounce themselves pleased with how they made their new album. It has no single producer, but saw friends (including Hot Chip and Bj\u00f6rn Yttling of Peter Bj\u00f6rn &amp; John) occasionally managing the studio controls. It&apos;s a long way from 2009&apos;s Tonight, which sounded clenched and felt tired. According to Thomson, a period &quot;decompressing&quot; was required in the wake of the two years spent touring their third album. &quot;[Afterwards] I\u00a0just came down heavily with depression, I\u00a0think,&quot; says McCarthy. &quot;I just thought, &apos;Eurrgh, can&apos;t play music any more.&apos; Couldn&apos;t stand it. We&apos;d sucked ourselves dry.&quot;           It was, they admit, partly their own fault. Tour America for the fourth time in a year? Of course! Record a song for David Mackenzie&apos;s 2007 film Hallam Foe? No problem. &quot;Perform&quot; (via clever lookalikes) in a Dior ad starring Marion Cotillard? Bien s\u00fbr\u2026 Franz Ferdinand jumped at the bewildering array of opportunities that came their way. It was no surprise. &quot;Before this I had 10 years of doing fuck all!&quot; Thomson chuckles ruefully. Having found success in their mid-to-late 20s (in fact, Kapranos was four years older than he claimed), in new-band terms they were ancient. So they were hungry. &quot;We were making up for lost time,&quot; says the drummer. Hardy, the Bradford-born bass player, 33, remembers thinking this frantic pace was &quot;normal&quot; for new bands. &quot;I\u00a0didn&apos;t,&quot; Kapranos adds with a thin smile. Did the fun go out of it for the frontman? &quot;Undeniably. It went out when I felt I was working to someone else&apos;s schedule or deadline. I&apos;m not naturally the kind of person who works well under those conditions. In fact, my whole adult life before that point, if I&apos;d been in a job where I\u00a0felt I\u00a0was under pressure, I\u00a0would usually just jack in the job. And suddenly I\u00a0couldn&apos;t do that any more. But maybe\u2026&quot; the singer sighs quietly, &quot;Maybe, that&apos;s what we did after the third record.&quot; When I meet Kapranos again in Dumfriesshire the following month I ask him whether he is saying that Franz Ferdinand split up after finishing touring Tonight. He ums and ahs while fiddling with a jar of homemade plum jam. &quot;I\u00a0met up with Bob in Orkney about two years ago,&quot; he finally offered me, describing how they chose the northerly Scottish islands because they were &quot;neutral territory&quot; (neither had been there before). &quot;I wanted to split the band up, because in my head it felt like one of those jobs\u2026 the ones I had to jack in. I didn&apos;t like the routine and the obligations. And whether those obligations lay with my contemporaries, my peers, my record label, the fans, the audiences \u2013 or maybe myself\u2026 I\u00a0felt\u2026&quot; He stutters awkwardly. &quot;It was time to, erm, stop that.&quot; There were various factors at play. The food column he wrote for the Guardian &quot;for fun&quot; during a world tour morphed into a book. It then mutated into something else entirely for the serious-minded fortysomething. &quot;It contributed to creating a\u00a0comic character version of yourself. It happened the other day \u2013 I was doing a phone interview with an Australian newspaper and they began by saying, &apos;I&apos;ve got my mouth full of food this morning and I&apos;m thinking of you, Alex! What you do think of beef jerky?&apos; I&apos;m like, &apos;Oh God, is this it? Is this my life?&apos;&quot; he wails.     Franz Ferdinand photographed for the Observer in Hackney. Photograph: Julian Broad    Kapranos was &quot;incredibly miserable&quot; during the making of Tonight, also for other, personal reasons he won&apos;t discuss. But it seems reasonable to guess that one was the end of his relationship with Eleanor Friedberger, of US brother-sister indie duo the Fiery Furnaces. In Dumfriesshire he politely declines to say anything of his current girlfriend, but later introduces me to a slight, blonde twentysomething with whom he&apos;s about to spend the afternoon dinghying down a local river. Kapranos can be a brilliant, charismatic frontman, a great conversationalist \u2013 he radiates cheerful gratitude that I have made the effort to travel to his remote rural home. &quot;I&apos;m not going to get to enjoy this for much longer this summer,&quot; he shrugs, staring down the barrel of a weeklong Tokyo-LA-New York-London interview schedule, then heaps more besides. But he is also a heavier, more preoccupied presence than the exuberant, eager chap I met a decade ago. Still, the comeback album radiates buzzy confidence. It is certainly the best since their groundbreaking debut, and pre-release noise about it is healthy; their social media stats have recently been boosted to 1.4m Facebook likes. They&apos;ve also gone back to snagging high-profile gigs: in New York last month they streamed a performance of the entire album on the set of David Letterman&apos;s chat show. This summer their labelmates Arctic Monkeys, also returning with a new album, are the only British band generating similar levels of excitement. But Kapranos seems resoundingly relieved by the likelihood that decade-old Franz Ferdinand cannot be the hipsters&apos; new band of choice any more. He is much more energised by rediscovering the founding principles of which he and Hardy reminded themselves during their Orkney crisis summit: Franz Ferdinand should be &quot;odd&quot;, and &quot;quirky&quot;. Success, though, and repetition, and those obligations, had &quot;shaved off&quot; those qualities. &quot;But when we came to making the new album, we decided that oddness was just us!&quot; He beams. &quot;And we should enjoy that: it should be at the heart of our existence if we want to continue.&quot; My interviews were bookended with two concerts: in April, I saw them perform at California&apos;s three-day Coachella festival. They played in a packed tent on the middle evening, before New Order, and it was proper Saturday night fever, the band bristling with grinning exuberance and the crowd responding by dancing wildly. When they segued into a scratchy-guitar version of Donna Summer&apos;s &quot;I Feel Love&quot; it was clear that Daft Punk aren&apos;t the only postmillennial arrivistes making disco-hay in 2013. The mash-up was both wonky and inspired; a piece with both old and new Franz Ferdinand. Three months later, they play a\u00a0secret show in the back room of a tiny pub in Dalston, east London. The show is running late after some shambolic milling about by the band. There are 500-odd fans stuck outside, unable to get in. Kapranos, McCarthy, Hardy and Thomson finally amble through the crowd, then drift onstage. They are all smiles and bashful waves. Clearly, they are following no one&apos;s schedule but their own. Just like the good old days.

The 60-year-old surreptitiously snapped residents in the glass-walled apartments opposite his own in Tribeca, New York, and, without seeking permission from his subjects, exhibited them in a nearby gallery. Using a 500mm lens, he peeked into the lives of others \u2013 like a real-life LB Jeffries from the film Rear Window \u2013 and obliterated the assumed divide between the public and the personal. Unsurprisingly, two of his neighbours sued, having spotted their children among the subjects. Yet a court ruled this month that Svenson&apos;s actions were defensible under the First Amendment&apos;s guarantee of free speech, and that such art needs no consent to be made or sold.  Svenson says the verdict was &quot;a great victory for the rights of all artists&quot; and, although he remains wary of discussing the project, stresses that his motivation was only to observe the nuances of human existence. &quot;I find the unrehearsed, unconscious aspects of life the most beautiful to photograph, as they are most open to interpretation, to a narrative,&quot; he explains. &quot;A dramatic moment has the single power of action, but tiny, linked moments are how we mark time on this earth \u2013 I am much more interested in recording the breath between words than I am the actual words themselves.&quot;     A resident holds a pair of scissors while undertaking an unknown task. Photograph: Arne Svenson (courtesy of Julie Saul Gallery)    Svenson&apos;s images are not as sensational as they first seem, though the recent scandals involving America&apos;s National Security Agency and Britain&apos;s GCHQ have undoubtedly heightened our sensitivity to them. The identities of Svenson&apos;s neighbours, who are rendered with a soft, painterly effect, are obscured, and the choice of framing also leaves a sense of mystery. They are truthful, artistic representations of life which possess a subtle theatricality (a characteristic evident throughout his practice). That the chosen moments are so acutely observed makes them disturbing. Indeed, the mere sensation that we are being looked upon is, as Jean-Paul Sartre concluded, enough to haunt us.  The acclaimed photographer Michael Wolf, some of whose work is of a similar ilk to The Neighbors (especially Window Watching, in which he peeped into towerblock apartments in Hong Kong), acknowledged this when he expressed his own unease at the idea of being photographed if he was unaware: &quot;I&apos;m not sure how comfortable I would feel if I knew someone would come into my room while I was sleeping and take my picture. I think, spontaneously, I wouldn&apos;t feel comfortable,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t photograph anything salacious or demeaning,&quot; is Svenson&apos;s stock retort when pressed on his work&apos;s morality. &quot;I am not photographing the residents as specific, identifiable individuals, but as representations of humankind.&quot; Indeed, his work lacks the explicitness of Merry Alpern&apos;s photographs of prostitutes (Dirty Windows) and the scopophilic drive of Miroslav Tichy&apos;s homespun snaps of female bathers. But it is a selfish practice nonetheless.     A dog stands at the window of an apartment, looking outwards. Photograph: Arne Svenson (courtesy of Julie Saul Gallery)    Not all such photography has artistic intent; the current show at the Photographers&apos; Gallery in London unearths a curious social project, Mass Observation, which began in 1937 with the aim of creating an &quot;anthropology of ourselves&quot;. Using a team of field workers and many modes of surveillance \u2013 undercover photography, eavesdropping and stalking among them \u2013 Mass Observation sought to record and examine the intricacies of British life. Its remit included such bizarre topics as behaviour of people at war memorials, the gestures of motorists, bathroom behaviour and the private lives of midwives.  Humphrey Spender was Mass Observation&apos;s principal photographer and made many of his images covertly in the streets of Bolton and Blackpool. Spender, like Svenson, considered that the honourable intent of the project justified the means. &quot;I believed obsessively that truth would only be revealed when people were not aware of being photographed. I had to be invisible,&quot; he said. The results of those early years of Mass Observation are fascinating and it is the attention to seemingly trivial detail that correlates with Svenson&apos;s work. At times, both found beauty in the banality of everyday life. Occasionally, the urge to pry becomes inverted and the snooper&apos;s behaviour reveals something of their own psyche. Kohei Yoshiyuki was a voyeur of voyeurs who photographed people as they watched couples having sex in Tokyo parks (The Park), while Sophie Calle had herself tailed by a private detective (The Shadow) to scrutinise herself as she scrutinised others (Suite V\u00e9nitienne, Address Book and The Hotel). These surreal and intense encounters suggest the act is as compelling as the action.  Shizuka Yokomizo, meanwhile, made residents complicit in the exploitation of their own privacy by posting notes into strangers&apos; homes inviting them to appear at their front window for her to photograph (Stranger). And it is within the phrasing of Yokomizo&apos;s request that we find a telling detail: &quot;Dear Stranger, I am an artist working on a photographic project which involves people I do not know \u2026 I would like to take a photograph of you ... If you do not want to get involved, please simply draw your curtains to show your refusal. I really hope to see you from the window.&quot; At the heart of peeping is a desire to &apos;see&apos; and to &apos;know&apos; \u2013 a wish to connect with strangers, rather than just an inclination to intrude. In Svenson&apos;s case, the connection was made in a thoughtful yet controversial way."}, {"sentences": ["Nine months after Shinzo Abe&apos;s Liberal Democratic party was elected to power there are widespread rumours that supernatural phenomena are preventing him from moving into his official residence in central Tokyo."], "tags": ["Shinzo Abe", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-19T13:50:17Z", "title": "Japanese prime minister fails to move back into 'haunted' residence", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/japan-prime-minister-official-residence-haunted", "article": "Nine months after Shinzo Abe&apos;s Liberal Democratic party was elected to power there are widespread rumours that supernatural phenomena are preventing him from moving into his official residence in central Tokyo.

While officials deny Abe has a fear of the supernatural \u2013 and there was no discussion of the matter in 2007 when he resigned from office due to ill health \u2013 rumours abound that the official residence is haunted by figures from Japan&apos;s bloody prewar history. In 1932, a group of naval officers assassinated the then prime minister, Tsuyoshi Inukai, at the residence during a failed coup. Four years later, it was the scene of another attempted coup by a radical faction of the imperial Japanese army. Bullet holes and traces of fire damage near the entrance to the mansion property have left physical reminders of the coup attempts. But there have also been frequent reported sightings of men in military uniform in a nearby garden. Several former first ladies have refused to move into the building over fears it was haunted. The building, completed in 1929 in the style of the US architect Frank Lloyd Wright, did not become the prime minister&apos;s official residence until 2005. In May, media speculation about the spirits of Japan&apos;s prewar political instability prompted an opposition MP to ask in parliament if Abe was too frightened to move in. The government said it was &quot;not aware&quot; of the ghost tales although Abe, who said the 11-room property was simply too big for his needs, has since acknowledged hearing speculation about the building&apos;s supernatural guests.

Gillian Sheen was the reigning Olympic champion from 1956, Allan Jay had just won the world foil title in Budapest and because the \u00e9p\u00e9e did not start till a few days after the foil final, Bill Hoskyns, who has died aged 82, was still the reigning champion in the \u00e9p\u00e9e from the previous year. &quot;No other nation could boast three reigning champions at that moment. We were the golden generation, I think you could say,&quot; said Jay. While it was only for those few days that they sat in isolated splendour atop the world, there was substance behind it; for more than a decade, from 1955 to 1965, the British were a serious force in world fencing.     Bill Hoskyns belonged to a golden generation of British fencers    It didn&apos;t feel as if anything was about to change in 1964, when Hoskyns won a silver medal in the individual \u00e9p\u00e9e at the Tokyo Olympics, his finest performance in the Games. Nor a year later, at the world championships in Paris, when Hoskyns won another individual silver medal and shared, with Jay and others, a team silver. But Hoskyns&apos;s medal in Tokyo was the last time a British fencer stood on an Olympic podium; the medals in Paris the last British ones in a world championship. The eldest of four sons of Hal and Lilian (nee Furse), Hoskyns was born in London, into a Somerset landowning family. From Eton, he went to Magdalen College, Oxford, where, between the twin pursuits of fencing and bridge, he mustered a fourth-class degree in agriculture. At Oxford, too, he met Jay, and their fencing careers for the next 20 years ran almost parallel. Before going to Oxford, Hoskyns did national service in the Somerset Yeomanry and later continued as a Territorial to the rank of major. He was a keen private pilot and Jay believes that had Hoskyns been able to make a career choice he would have flown full-time. His part-time missions, carrying fencing teams across Europe, would certainly become the stuff of legend. &quot;I remember stepping on to the plane the first time and the door was like the sort you used to find on a kitchen larder. It was a tiny plane \u2013 I think they used it for crop-spraying when it wasn&apos;t taking us,&quot; Jay recalled. Rather than a pilot, though, Hoskyns became a farmer, tending the orchards at North Perrott in Somerset that his grandfather had laid out. Fencing had to fit in around his obligations towards family, farm and local society. The intermittent training did not slow his seemingly casual ascendancy; at his first world championship, at Rome in 1955, he won a team bronze in the foil. The following year, he missed out narrowly on a medal at the Olympic Games in Melbourne, finishing fourth in the team \u00e9p\u00e9e. In the next eight years, he would add another four world medals, including the \u00e9p\u00e9e gold in 1958, and two Olympic silver medals, one in the team \u00e9p\u00e9e in 1960 to go with his individual silver in 1964. Commonwealth titles came easily; nine in all, with medals in all three weapons, foil, \u00e9p\u00e9e and sabre. In national championships he won nine titles too, a litany of gold. In 1976, he became the first British competitor to have taken part in six Olympics (an achievement since matched by Tessa Sanderson, Mary King and Alison Williamson) and two years later retired \u2013 after a fashion. In 1998, at the World Veterans Championships, he won a bronze medal. Last year, during the London Olympics, the golden generation were reunited at North Perrott: Hoskyns, Jay, who had moved to Somerset in retirement to be near his old friend and adversary, and Sheen (now Donaldson) over from America, together pondering on a different sporting world. A local journalist asked Hoskyns what he had enjoyed about the London Games. &quot;I think it&apos;s been brilliant,&quot; he said. &quot;Except the fencing.&quot; The record he had most wanted to see broken was his own. He is survived by his wife, Georgina, whom he married in 1960, five children, Karina, Jonathan, Sophie, Celia and Dominic, and 10 grandchildren. \u2022 Henry William Furse Hoskyns, fencer and farmer, born 19 March 1931; died 4 August 2013"}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) said it did not know how the water leaked out or where it had leaked to, but it believed that the spillage had not flowed into the Pacific ocean."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan disaster", "Nuclear power", "Nuclear waste", "Japan", "World news", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-20T10:46:28Z", "title": "Fukushima operator reveals leak of 300 tonnes of highly contaminated water", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/fukushima-leak-nuclear-pacific", "article": "     Frantic efforts to contain radioactive leaks at the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been dealt another blow after its operator said about 300 tonnes of highly contaminated water had seeped out of a storage tank at the site. The leak is the worst such incident since the March 2011 meltdown and is separate from the contaminated water leaks, also of about 300 tonnes a day, reported recently. Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) said it did not know how the water leaked out or where it had leaked to, but it believed that the spillage had not flowed into the Pacific ocean. Tepco&apos;s spokesman, Masayuki Ono, said the water had seeped into the ground after breaching a concrete and sandbag barrier around the tank. Workers were pumping out the puddle and removing the remaining water from the tank, he added. Despite efforts to contain the spillage, the leak is already the most severe since the crisis began. News of the leak, which was discovered on Monday morning, comes after Tepco admitted that up to 300 tonnes of highly contaminated water from the site was seeping into the sea every day. Government officials said they could not rule out the possibility that the site had been leaking radioactive matter since the plant suffered a triple meltdown on 11 March 2011. An official from Japan&apos;s nuclear regulation authority said: &quot;We have instructed Tepco to find the source of contaminated water \u2013 from which tank the water is leaking \u2013 and to seal the leakage point. &quot;We have also instructed them to retrieve contaminated soil to avoid a further expansion of toxic water, and to strengthen monitoring of the surrounding environment.&quot; The authority classified the latest leak as a level one incident on the International Atomic Energy Authority&apos;s scale of nuclear and radiological accidents. The level is the second lowest on the scale. The 2011 meltdowns in three of Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s six reactors \u2013 caused when the plant was struck by a powerful tsunami that had been triggered by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off Japan&apos;s north-east coast \u2013 were given the highest severity rating of seven, the same level given to the Chernobyl disaster 25 years earlier. It is the first time Japan&apos;s nuclear regulator has deemed an incident serious enough to warrant an international classification since the country&apos;s triple disaster almost two and a half years ago. Tepco, which faces renewed criticism over its handling of the water leaks, has admitted that water in a puddle that had formed near the steel storage tank was emitting a radiation dose of 100 millisieverts an hour \u2013 five times the annual exposure limit for nuclear plant workers in Japan. Hundreds of tanks have been built at the site to store contaminated water that is being fed into reactor buildings to cool melted fuel rods, as well as underground water running into reactor and turbine basements.Tepco suspects that the water may have leaked through a drain valve connected to a gutter around the tank, which is located about 500 metres from the shore. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, recently suggested he had lost faith in Tepco&apos;s ability to handle the water crisis without government help. The firm&apos;s failure to prevent leaks could frustrate his attempts to relaunch further reactors in Japan. The leaks are also causing concern abroad. On Tuesday, South Korea said it had asked Japanese officials to explain the leaks of contaminated water into the Pacific."}, {"sentences": ["Rio de Janeiro beat Madrid, Tokyo and Chicago to host the 2016 Olympics."], "tags": ["Housing Network", "Policy", "Development", "Housing", "Global development professionals network", "Society Professionals"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-21T07:00:00Z", "title": "Rents in Rio de Janeiro slums soar ahead of the Olympics", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2013/aug/21/rents-rio-janeiro-soared-olympics", "article": "In preparation for the 2014 World Cup and South America&apos;s first Olympic Games in 2016, Rio de Janeiro has attracted large investments \u2013 not only in the games themselves but, perhaps more importantly, in overcoming the massive divides in living standards in the city. Following a series of largely unsuccessful attempts spread over decades, it would seem the various projects driven by the government-led growth acceleration program, as well as police pacification initiatives in which police patrol neighbourhoods they previously avoided to bring down crime rates, may finally be achieving the desired effects. Great news for the city&apos;s residents, who have longed for such a transformation. But there is another side to this story. Rio de Janeiro&apos;s previously no-go neighbourhoods have now evolved into real-estate hotspots, where land beneath favela homes has become a goldmine.     Police pacification forces patrol in Rio de Janeiro. Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty Images    According to the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation, rents in the favelas have increased 6.8% more than rent in the wealthy areas over the past two years. Other news sources point to rocketing prices in these informal communities. In the Complexo Alem\u00e3o, now deemed safer and with greater mobility, rents have tripled and leasehold charges are allegedly the same as in the exclusive shopping areas of the city. One unit in the Vidigal favela \u2013 a slum with a spectacular view of the ocean \u2013 was reportedly on sale for R$700,000 (\u00a3191,000). The largest favela in Brazil, Rocinha, was recently announced to be a recipient of a R$1.6bn (\u00a3437m) infrastructure reform. One domestic cleaner claimed her family was one of 300 households on a broker&apos;s waiting list for a property in the area. With a lack of governance from the start, leaving such markets to their own devices was always going to be problematic. Many investors are now planning to develop multi-story units on narrow tracts of land, with little attention to building or planning regulations. With the majority earning modestly, most residents welcome the reforms. But with no signs of rents coming down, there is little option but to cram into smaller spaces or look for alternative solutions \u2013 of which there are few.

Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/REUTERS    Eviction proceedings At one extreme, there is the classic periphery relocation strategy favoured by local authorities as a means of freeing up land for more profitable purposes. However, as often witnessed in the short history of this programme, most families would rather stay put than move to a dormitory town where infrastructure and local public services are pitiful. The recent decision by mayor Eduardo Paes to halt eviction proceedings against the Vila Aut\u00f3dromo community after nearly three years of intense campaigning demonstrates that favela residents refuse to be moved without a fight. Yet such cases also demonstrate the various conflicts of interest and the fragile landscape that dominates the future of favelas in Rio and the rest of Brazil. The very erratic nature of local governance means fears remain that the funding tap may be turned off at any minute and that the pacification police forces could disappear after the Olympics. Creating infrastructure and improving housing is a start, but preparations for the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics must also integrate the diverse range of community organisations battling for change. Land and building regulations should be made less obscure and policy must be implemented to stem the effects of unsustainable real estate inflation, all the while addressing broader questions over long-term security, health and education.

When Michael Heseltine visited Japan as environment secretary in 1990 he was so impressed with the dynamism he saw in Sapporo, Japan&apos;s fourth-largest city, that he begged cabinet colleagues to introduce the mayoral office into the desiccated British system. It was not until the rule of New Labour, a decade later, that the change happened. Mayors have a lot of sway politically in Japan (Osaka mayor Toru Hashimoto even leads the third-ranked party in parliament), and in some cases turnout for mayoral elections tops that of national polls. As in the US in recent years, voter disillusionment with the performance of national parties amid economic stagnation has seen the emergence of responsive city leaders as significant figures. Across Japan, the picture is the same: each of its 1,719 municipalities (merged in the last decade from 3,229) elect their own mayor every four years, with no term limits. But unlike the UK, Japanese mayors run as independents and party endorsements follow once the campaign formally begins, almost as an informal primary. It&apos;s not unusual to see popular mayors backed by national ruling and opposition parties locally. Being mayor isn&apos;t the be and end all of Japanese local politics. Local assemblies are elected in each municipality to keep the mayor in check and pass local ordinances, as well as populate committees in charge of education, policing and elections. But in essence, the powers vested in the mayor as political and organisational head of the municipality affords them considerable control over the local authority. Local assemblies also ratify the appointment of the vice mayor of each municipality, essentially a service head of the mayor inside the bureaucracy. It&apos;s not unusual for larger cities to request national government to second a civil servant to supply this role. The limited criticism of the relatively stable and settled system of Japanese mayoralties tends to revolve around the belief that assembly members can often act as nothing more than cheerleaders for certain mayors. Relations between mayors and local assemblies have been known to break down however when talent among assembly members is overlooked. While there are no term limits for mayors, the local assembly can force them out through a motion of no-confidence, though the threshold is set deliberately high at three-quarters in favour and with a quorum of two-thirds of members in attendance. The mayor is also protected by the ability to dissolve the assembly themselves after being forced out. Tensions exist elsewhere in the system of Japan&apos;s local autonomy, which is constitutionally protected under the country&apos;s post-war system. Above the municipalities there are 47 prefectures (including the capital of Japan, Tokyo, which is both a city and prefecture as the country&apos;s only metropolis), each with their own directly elected governor and assembly. The system originates from 1888, when the newly unified Japanese state was created. Today, in the metropolitan areas where jurisdictions coincide, there can be some confusion between residents and local leaders. Attempts at creating a Japan of nine (or 11, or 13) regions rather than 47 prefectures stalled before the end of the last Liberal Democratic party-led administration in 2009, but its re-election in 2012 has seen the policy partially revived. Matters are complicated further by the demands from the governing Osaka politicians for their own second city metropolis of a unified city and prefecture, with the emergence of this political movement almost playing a decisive role in the 2012 national elections. The mayoral system does however generate some identifiable policy successes. In Kitakyushu, mayor Kenji Kitahashi&apos;s determined efforts in promoting the city as Asia&apos;s low carbon hub has led to recognition as &quot;green growth model city&quot; by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). His work followed on from his predecessor Koichi Sueyoshi who worked to clear up one of Japan&apos;s most polluted cities. The work of Hamamatsu mayor Yasutomo Suzuki in promoting intercultural cities has been praised by the Council of Europe, and pushed national government to do more to integrate migrant communities. Mayors are also represented in Japan&apos;s partnership structure between national and local government, where policies and legislation can be amended at early consultation stage. The UK&apos;s relatively small band of elected mayors may find some takeaways in those, if not the prospect of sudden death at the hands of a negative council resolution.

The disaster, caused when the tsunami that followed the devastating earthquake in 2011 knocked out backup generators pumping water to cool the fuel rods, has cost more than $200bn (\u00a3128bn) and is now expected to cost billions more. The human cost, so slow is the impact of radiation, won&apos;t be measurable for a generation. It has profoundly shaken confidence in the future of nuclear power, from Taiwan \u2013 where earlier this month MPs resorted to fisticuffs as they debated a referendum on a new nuclear power station \u2013 to Berlin, and it&apos;s changing the landscape of new nuclear here in Britain. Until Fukushima, the risk of catastrophic meltdown of the sort that occurred first at Chernobyl was supposed to be one in 100,000. But Fukushima occurred almost exactly 25 years after Chernobyl and that slashes the estimate to one in 5,000. In addition, the kind of cascade of devastating events that hit Fukushima hadn&apos;t previously been factored into risk probability assessments. Now regulatory authorities all over the world have been forced to consider whether, however unlikely, more than one accident could happen in quick succession, and what the consequences would be. The whole risk and safety assessment framework is being redesigned. Britain and France are almost the only countries in Europe still determined to expand nuclear (and France is reducing dependence) rather than focus on holding down demand for electricity, but costs are soaring. Earlier this year, Centrica pulled out of a deal with the French-owned EDF, blaming in part redesigns forced by Fukushima. The coalition, which had promised no new subsidies to nuclear power in 2010, is now offering \u00a310bn of financial guarantees to make sure the extra capacity comes on stream, and may offer a hidden subsidy in guaranteed electricity prices. Meanwhile, subsidy-hating George Osborne will be watching the fate of Angela Merkel in next month&apos;s federal elections. Only days after Fukushima, the German chancellor reversed her long-held support for nuclear power and, a year after announcing a 10-year extension, she promised to phase it out by 2022. Two years on, the huge expansion of windpower she promised is behind schedule and electricity bills have risen by 20% to pay for the changeover. German industry is feeling the pain too. Voters will judge between the huge costs and potential risks of nuclear, and the still-developing potential of green energy. In 2015, British voters won&apos;t have that choice. \u2022\u00a0This article was amended on 22 August 2013 because the original said Tepco admitted that 3,000 tonnes of highly toxic water had leaked from purpose-built storage tanks.

Nor is there much doubt about who committed the atrocity. The Syrian government acknowledged it had launched a major offensive in the area and they are the only combatant with the capability to use chemical weapons on this scale. Western intelligence officials have calculated it would need an invasion force of 60,000 troops to secure the 12 chemical weapons depots at Bashar al-Assad&apos;s disposal. A lot of sarin, if indeed that was the agent used, is needed to kill that number of people. The sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway killed 13 people. That leaves the question why. In defending their client state from the accusation, Russia called the attack a pre-planned provocation, occurring as it did within only five miles of the hotel where UN inspectors had arrived to investigate previous alleged incidents. There are four possible causes: a Syrian commander acting on his own, which is unlikely; an order from Mr Assad in the knowledge that Mr Obama would not respond; or a decision to up the firepower against the rebels who, despite losses in Qusair or Homs, still control about half of the country. The fourth possible cause is that this was an attack which went wrong, killing many more than intended. The options for response are all bad. France and Turkey are pushing for military action, and Britain will not rule it out \u2013 possibly airstrikes against missile depots and aircraft that Mr Assad would not like to lose. There is no chance that he will allow the UN inspection team to expand the area of their investigation to anything more than three limited sites.

The task of the Syrian government is straightforward \u2013 to play for time, pen the UN inspection team in, and let the physical evidence itself degrade, which is swiftly done in an active combat zone. It is doubtful whether airstrikes would establish deterrence.

But Hayao Miyazaki, the legendary Japanese animator, has managed to anger everyone from doctors to political activists with The Wind Rises (Kaze Tachinu), his fictionalised portrayal of the inventor of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter plane, used to devastating effect by the imperial Japanese navy during the second world war. In making a protagonist of Jiro Horikoshi, whose planes took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor and in kamikaze missions, Miyazaki is being targeted by unlikely political bedfellows at home and abroad. South Korean internet users accused the director \u2013 who won global adoration with the more family-oriented fantasies My Neighbour Totoro and the Oscar-winning Spirited Away \u2013 of lionising the creator of one of the most potent symbols of Japanese militarism, and pointed out that among the workers who assembled more than 10,000 of the state-of the-art fighters were forced labourers from the Korean peninsula. Stung by the criticism, Miyazaki met South Korean reporters based in Tokyo to explain his admiration for Horikoshi. &quot;[He] was someone who resisted demands from the military,&quot; he said, according to the Mainichi Shimbun. &quot;I wonder if he should be liable for anything just because he lived in that period.&quot; Japanese nationalists, meanwhile, took to online forums to denounce Miyazaki, a former trade union official with well-documented leftwing leanings, as a &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;anti-Japanese&quot; for the film&apos;s focus on the futility of war. But they were most angered by an essay Miyazaki had written to coincide with the film&apos;s release in which he condemned Japan&apos;s modern-day drift to the right, including plans by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to revise the country&apos;s pacifist constitution. &quot;It goes without saying that I am against constitutional reform,&quot; Miyazaki wrote in Neppu, Studio Ghibli&apos;s in-house monthly magazine. In a thinly veiled reference to Abe, he went on to accuse Japan&apos;s modern-day politicians of attempting to sanitise the country&apos;s wartime conduct. &quot;I&apos;m taken aback by the lack of knowledge among government and political party leaders on historical facts,&quot; he said. &quot;People who don&apos;t think enough shouldn&apos;t meddle with the constitution.&quot; The Wind Rises, Miyazaki&apos;s first film as director since Ponyo in 2008, marks a departure from the fantasy-led animated films that have brought him critical acclaim and devotees around the world. Aimed at a more adult audience, the film is his tribute to the &quot;extraordinary genius&quot; of Horikoshi, whose plane was widely regarded acclaimed as the most advanced fighter in the world during the first half of the war. In an interview with the Asahi Shimbun, the 72-year-old said he had &quot;very complex feelings&quot; about the war, adding that militarist Japan had acted out of &quot;foolish arrogance.&quot; But the Zero, he added, &quot;represented one of the few things we Japanese could be proud of \u2013 they were a truly formidable presence, and so were the pilots who flew them&quot;. Miyazaki, a warplane enthusiast since childhood, insisted Horikoshi was beyond reproach. &quot;Jiro Horikoshi was the most gifted man of his time in Japan,&quot; he said in a 2011 interview with Cut magazine. &quot;He wasn&apos;t thinking about weapons \u2013 really all he desired was to make exquisite planes.&quot; The Wind Rises should also come with a health warning, according to Japanese doctors who have criticised the director for his frequent portrayals of smoking. In an open letter to Miyazaki&apos;s production company, Studio Ghibli, the Japan Society for Tobacco Control said the gratuitous depictions of smoking gave the impression that the tobacco habit was socially acceptable, even among minors. In Miyazaki&apos;s defence, the film&apos;s many smoking scenes are at least a nod to the social mores of the times. The Wind Rises is set in the 1920s and 30s, before the harmful health effects of tobacco were fully known and when Japanese, among others, were enthusiastic smokers. Despite Miyazaki&apos;s attention to historical detail, the physicians were particularly unhappy about a scene in which the lead character smokes as he holds the hand of his bedridden wife, who is suffering from tuberculosis. &quot;Why did smoking have to be included in a scene where the objective is to depict the couple&apos;s relationship, especially the woman&apos;s state of mind?&quot; the letter said. &quot;There must have been another way to express that.&quot; The Wind Rises attracted 4 million viewers in the first three weeks after its domestic release on 20 July and looks almost certain to become the biggest film of the year in Japan.

Wood wrote a superb critique of the thought-provoking novel: More Than This by Patrick Ness. In this book, teenager Seth Wearing wakes up in a dystopian world \u2013 which he believes to be hell - after drowning in a freezing ocean.  &apos;I have a healthy respect for Patrick Ness and applaud his incredible book; I can definitely say I have spent my time well, and the ending, though I deeply wished it wasn&apos;t so close as I was reading the last four or so chapters, was spectacular and satisfying. So to quote Patrick Ness himself: &quot;Haven&apos;t you ever felt like there has to be more?&quot; Yes. There has to be more of this book.&apos;  Meanwhile continuing themes of mortality, reader ABitCrazy wrote a super review of Sister by Rosamund Lupton! Told as a letter, this novel follows Beatrice&apos;s quest to find out who is responsible for the death of her sister Tess.  &apos;At the very end it&apos;s all about who actually did murder Tess and that gets you hooked! You&apos;re desperate by this time after all the clues, all the things that have made you suspect this person and made you suspect that person, you are finally ready to know who did it! ... I really love Sister! I think if you&apos;re a big fan of mystery and crime fiction books you should definitely 100% read this book! Even if you&apos;re not a fan of those things you should read this book!&apos;  Likewise, another whodunit mystery - Murder on Stage by Cora Harrison \u2013 was discussed this week in a terrific review by one of our young critics Sagey! This book is about a boy called Alfie who, whilst at the theatre, witnesses a man being murdered on stage! Reviewer Sagey however, felt the story lacked suspense.  &apos;I found this book exciting and heart-pumping but at other points the story became quite boring and un-interesting... Overall, it was an exciting cliff-hanger and I did enjoy it at times but I didn&apos;t enjoy it as much as other books I have read in the past. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in murder mystery.&apos;  With similar detective elements, Secret Ninja Spies: Toyko Surprise by Alex Ko was brilliantly reviewed this week by site member Prince Caspian! In a wonderful summary of the plot, Prince Caspian commented   &apos;This book is about some twins called Josh and Jessica who stay with their Granny in Tokyo for the summer, and discover that she is actually a secret Ninja who fights baddies&apos;. &apos;I really enjoyed reading this book, because it&apos;s quite exciting, especially the bits in the museum. It is quite long and complicated though (the longest book I&apos;ve ever read) and doesn&apos;t have that many pictures. Parts of it are quite difficult because of the Japanese words but by the end I was getting used to them. I think it&apos;s suitable for readers of 7 and up, especially boys and tomboys.&apos;  Then, moving on to a detective fantasy theme, Raven Gate from Anthony Horowitz Power of Five series was fantastically reviewed this week by reader Purple Koala! In this novel teenage criminal Matthew Freeman is sent to foster care in a remote village in Yorkshire. Matt, however - &apos;soon realises that something is wrong with his Foster parent, and the whole village&apos;.  &apos;With a secret organization, an unhelpful journalist and a discovery of hidden power, this is a must read. For fans of Alex Rider, this is the book for you. Matt is the new hero, but instead of battling international super villains, it&apos;s devils, demons and witches!&apos;  Finally, reflecting themes of childhood friendship, site member Pheebz wrote a delightful review of Frenemies by Alexa Young. Halley and Avalon are best friends, however when the girls go back to school and develop new friendships, feelings of jealousy begin to cause trouble!  &apos;I really enjoyed this book because it&apos;s all about relationships and how misunderstandings or jealousy of new friends can ruin a wonderful friendship. I think that really &quot;girly&quot; girls will love this book, but I recommend it to everyone!&apos;  And that is it for this week! We really enjoyed reading all your excellent reviews!

Its membership of nearly 30,000 comprises almost half of the yakuza crime syndicate in the Japanese underworld, earning billions of yen through drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud and extortion. But they may have met their match in the shape of a female restaurateur who has launched a lawsuit against the gang in what lawyers are calling a landmark case. The woman, from Nagoya, reportedly under 24-hour police guard, is suing Kenichi Shinoda, the sixth Yamaguchi-gumi kumicho, or godfather, who she says forced her to pay protection money over 12 years between 1998 and 2010. Using an anti-organised crime law revised in 2008, which says heads of organisations can be liable for damage done by its members and affiliate groups, the woman is demanding a refund of \u00a3120,000 in compensation and backdated protection money. She paid the extorted money each month to Yoshitake Matsuyama, head of a criminal group affiliated to the Kodo-kai, itself a subsidiary of the Yamaguchi-gumi. The funds, ranging in value from 30,000-100,000 yen (\u00a3200-\u00a3650), were deemed to be for the protection of the business \u2013 mikajimeryo in Japanese. &quot;In the Nagoya area alone, it is estimated that the Yamaguchi-gumi collects a couple of hundred million yen monthly,&quot; a member of the Aichi prefectural police told the Tokyo Reporter. &quot;Should this end, the Yamaguchi-gumi will take a strong hit.&quot; Matsuyama has already been prosecuted for extortion and the restaurant owner&apos;s lawyer, Kiyotaka Tanaka, said his client&apos;s lawsuit could severely weaken the Yamaguchi-gumi clan. &quot;This woman showed great courage in standing up [to this injustice],&quot; he said. &quot;We would like this trial to become a curtailment for these activities in the future.&quot; The Yamaguchi-gumi, based in the western port city of Kobe, is threatened as never before in its 98-year history, as the law catches up with an increasing number of gang members. Last week 29-year-old Yujiro Kobayashi and three others were detained for a second time over a 1bn yen fraud that 450 people in Tokyo fell victim to. The scam involved phoning a victim and pretending to be a relative in need of money. Investigators say that three of the suspects, including Kobayashi, have denied the latest allegations, while the fourth has refused to comment. Five others arrested in the case were recruited by Kobayashi from Shiritsu University campus. &quot;This is a lucrative job in which you&apos;ll earn at least 10,000 yen a day,&quot; the suspect is alleged to have said. Shinoda, 71, who has spent time in jail for killing a rival with a samurai sword, could soon find himself back in the dock. Rarely photographed, the gang leader broke with the typical black suit and shoes worn by many senior yakuza members when he was pictured leaving jail in 2011 after serving six years for illegal firearms possession, shortly after he took over control of the gang from his predecessor, Yoshinori Watanabe. Dressed in a brown trilby and scarf, leather jacket and sunglasses, the Yamaguchi-gumi&apos;s leader seemed satisfied with his gang&apos;s activities while he was in jail. In 2010 the Kodo-kai gang burned down a hostess club called Infinity, killing several people, in a similar protection arrangement that went bad. The restaurant owner has said that she, too, was threatened with arson when she decided to stop paying. According to yakuza experts, a relative of one of the victims of the 2010 fire may sue, depending on the case&apos;s outcome, and trigger a cascade of lawsuits that the Yamaguchi-gumi would struggle to deal with. Shinoda, who is also known as Shinobu Tsukasa, is keeping up appearances, as the legal paperwork is being prepared, having gone on his annual pilgrimage to the Nagamine Reien cemetery in Kobe earlier this month to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the death of Kazuo Taoka, the gang&apos;s third godfather. Yet he was worried enough about the lawsuit to distribute an eight-page glossy magazine last month to his 27,700 &quot;regular&quot; gang members with a headline that read &quot;Let&apos;s march through these challenges&quot;. Shinoda argued that reform was needed to the gang&apos;s business practices, which he argued were essential to the group&apos;s survival. Japan&apos;s National Police Agency claims the number of Yamaguchi-gumi members has fallen by 3,300 in the last 12 months. Whether their financial position will be broken by their centenary year in 2015 will depend a lot on the outcome of the Nagoya lawsuit."}, {"sentences": ["But hold your heads high, Rio de Janeiro, Paris and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Australia news"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-28T23:04:00Z", "title": "Melbourne, best city in the world?

Winning the &quot;most liveable city&quot; accolade three times in a row may start to feel a little like showing off. We could soon be booed off the stage for just being a little bit too cool for school, a little smug in our bushranger beards and head-to-toe black, drinking our single-origin dry flat-whites on our pristine, plane-tree lined pavements.\u00a0 Well people, as a relatively recent addition to this undeniably great city, I\u2019m here to tell you, yes, Melbourne is wonderfully liveable. But don\u2019t abandon New York, London or even (gulps)\u00a0Sydney just yet. Here is why. Transport. Somehow the fact that we have trams has conned everyone into thinking that we are the pinnacle of public ease when it comes to getting around. If you live within three kilometres of the CBD and only want to travel between 7am and 10pm, then indeed, Melbourne does rock. If, like 90% of the population, your life extends further than the suburbs of Richmond, Fitzroy or St Kilda, then \u2026 not so good. I regularly wait 20 minutes for a train from my still relatively inner city suburb if it\u2019s past\u00a08pm. I could catch the bus I suppose, if I\u2019m there the one time in an hour it leaves for my desired destination. Or there\u2019s always cabs \u2013 no, wait. I can\u2019t catch them any more because of the number of times I\u2019ve complained when they\u2019ve failed to show, not known where they were going, or (and this has happened more than once) slowed to a crawl when hailed, then raced off. Given this hideous transport situation, it\u2019s easier to meet my friend who lives on the other side of town for a weekend away than go to her place for a drink. I am not even joking. Then there\u2019s the coffee. \u201cWhat?&quot; I hear you cry, \u201cMelbourne&apos;s coffee is amazing!\u201d Well, yes it is. It\u2019s the whole wankery around it that pisses me off. I was in a caf\u00e9 the other day and the four people in front of me ordered a type I have literally never heard of. I like to think I know my doppio macchiato from my ristretto, but this creation was clearly known only to deputies of the Melbourne Hip Coffee Club (members: not me). I was so embarrassed by my pedestrian order of a soy flat white that I slunk off with just a gluten-free chia-seed cookie, head hung in shame.\u00a0     An espresso which may or may not have been made by the Melbourne Hip Coffee Club.&nbsp;Photograph: Kai Godehusen/Getty    I may be outing myself for the unsophisticated coffee drinker I clearly am, but I can\u2019t tell my single origin from double or triple, and I still think being a barista should be a job for uni students, not an end-of-career high point. I don\u2019t have time to go into the annoyance of having football (by that I mean AFL, duh \u2013 there\u2019s no other type of football) consistently higher in the news agenda than civil war in far-off places. Or the unbearable screech of the Formula One. Or the fact that Melbourne makes you bleed money through your eyeballs every time you want to do something outside the house.\u00a0 The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s criteria for its most liveable city award include stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure, and on most of these markers, I really can\u2019t fault the city.

Every day, she puts on the shirt McDonald&apos;s provides her with and a pair of work pants of her own and goes to work serving burgers for $7.40 an hour. Clark, 47, is paid less per hour in real terms than the lowest paid US workers were half a century ago, when, on 28 August 1963, hundreds of thousands of citizens flooded into Washington for the historic march for freedom and jobs for black Americans. One of the marchers&apos; demands was a minimum wage raise from $1.25 to $2, reflecting their belief that the wage floor did not enable hardworking men and women to live in dignity. In today&apos;s dollars, that would represent a raise from $8.37 to $13.39, according to a report by the Economic Policy Institute this week, substantially less than the minimum wage of $7.25 today. Clark works between 36 and 40 hours a week to give her daughters, Crystal, 14, and Veronique, 15, and their brother, Andr\u00e9, 16, a decent roof over their heads. But she takes home around $800-$1,000 a month, wages so low the government subsidises her earnings with food stamps. On Thursday, Clark plans to skip her shift at the burger giant for a day to take part in a nationwide protest by US fast-food workers designed to highlight wages that have fallen, in real terms, in the past five decades. Thousands of workers in 50 cities are expected to take part in the one-day demonstration, to demand $15 an hour wages and the right to unionise. It is the fourth time Clark, one of 53,000 fast-food workers in the city, has taken action to protest low wages. Unafraid of being fired for her actions, she says she is &quot;doing what I have to do&quot; to try to lift her and her family out of poverty. &quot;I&apos;m not scared,&quot; said Clark. &quot;This is our right. We&apos;re trying to work on that too, to get unionised.&quot; The workers are supported by a broad coalition of unions, local community organisers and members of the clergy, who have successfully escorted workers threatened with the sack or other discipline for their actions, back into their jobs. The movement to raise the minimum wage has grown since 200 workers in New York staged a one-day strike last November. By July this year it had expanded, with seven other cities including Chicago, Detroit and Washington DC hosting strikes. The fast-food industry has long been the province of low wages, but unions and poverty campaigners point out that it is no longer an entry-level job for teenagers, but has disproportionately replaced many better-paying jobs lost in the recession. It is now one of the fastest-growing job sectors in the US, occupied by many family breadwinners. Women make up two-thirds of workers in the fast-food industry, and the median age of a female worker is 32, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A quarter of fast-food workers are raising children, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research Campaigners argue that, while wages remain low, profits at the big US chains, such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Wendy&apos;s, Domino&apos;s and Papa John&apos;s, are booming, reporting higher revenues and fatter operating margins than before the recession. McDonald&apos;s, which has 1.8 million employees, made $5.46bn in profits in 2012, while Domino&apos;s, with 34,000 employees made $112m the same year. So far, the strikes have yielded few tangible results and critics say that while unemployment stays high and jobs are in high demand, employers have no incentive to increase wages. President Barack Obama is pushing to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 an hour. The last federal raise of the minimum wage was in 2009. But even if Congress were solidly behind him, which they don&apos;t appear to be, the higher figure would still leave the US behind many other industrialised countries. The differences are stark. The US lags behind the UK, where the minimum wage is \u00a36.11 ($9.50) Australia, where it is 15.96 Australian dollars, ($16.91), France, \u20ac9.43($12.68), and Tokyo,$9.10. And while the US&apos;s nearest neighbour, Canada, doesn&apos;t have a minimum wage, the lowest provincial wage in Alberta is $9.73 in US dollars. Although Canada is not part of the US strike for a minimum wage, it also has a fast-food campaign to raise the minimum wage to $14. Armando Zapata, 22, from Ottawa, Canada, works for Tim Horton&apos;s, a fast-food coffee and donut restaurant. It has taken him three years, he said, to find a job that pays what he needs to finally make ends meet, at $11.50 Canadian ($US 10.96) an hour. But he says it is &quot;unimaginable&quot; that US fast-food workers earn as little as $7.25. &quot;Instead of always being stressed about money, I finally got to a stage that I am making ends meet,&quot; said Zapata. &quot;I was struggling to feed myself but it&apos;s unimaginable that someone could feed a family on much less \u2013 $7.25 an hour.&quot; The restaurant where Zapata works is unionised, and as a result it pays a dollar above other non-unionised Tim Horton restaurants. It also pays health benefits. Fast-food workers in Ottawa typically earn $10.25 an hour, the minimum wage, or close to it. Such disparities raise a question: how can fast-food companies pay workers higher wages in some states, districts and countries, yet still make a profit, while arguing that paying higher wages elsewhere will hurt their profits? When the Guardian asked one outlet, McDonald&apos;s, how it could pay workers in Australia $16.91, while paying workers in Detroit $7.40, they sent a statement in reply.  The story promoted by the individuals organizing these events does not provide an accurate picture of what it means to work at McDonald&apos;s. We respect the strong relationship which exists among McDonald&apos;s, our independent operators, and the employees who work in McDonald&apos;s restaurants. Our restaurants remain open, with our dedicated employees providing strong service to our customers.  It went on to say that McDonald&apos;s pays &quot;competitive pay and benefits to all our employees&quot;.  &quot;Our history is full of examples of individuals who worked their first job with McDonald&apos;s and went on to successful careers both within and outside of McDonald&apos;s.&quot; Pastor WJ Rideout the III, of All God&apos;s People church in Detroit, is part of a local coalition of campaigns for a minimum wage of $15, a group that includes the Service Employees International Union as well as D15 and Good Jobs Now. &quot;People can&apos;t survive off $7.25 an hour,&quot; said Rideout. &quot;A gallon of milk is almost $5 today and a loaf of bread is $4. Every thing has gone up significantly but the minimum wage has not. People are crazy to think you can live on minimum wages. Fast-food jobs are no longer starter jobs, they are mom-and-pop jobs, even senior citizens jobs. We call them survivor jobs now, because all people are doing is surviving. I see the hurt and the pain.&quot; Rideout said he expects thousands of Detroit&apos;s 53,000 fast-food workers to come out on strike on Thursday. Asked if he thought the protest would change anything, he said: &quot;President Obama asked for $9 an hour before we did the strikes. A Democratic senator in California [Senator Barbara Boxer[ has now asked for it to be raised to $10. This is happening all across America. We are going to keep pushing until we see a change.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Seoul may not be as well known for food as Bangkok or Tokyo but it has some fantastic dishes."], "tags": ["City breaks", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-29T13:01:00Z", "title": "Do you know your world cities?

Having become the first British woman to win four sprint medals at a world track championship, back in February, the 21-year-old from Abergavenny will achieve another first when she flies to Japan for the three-week keirin season, the richest and most arcane side of cycling, with a culture of its own at the heart of a massive betting industry. British male sprinters such as Ross Edgar and Matt Crampton have ridden the keirin circuit, but it is a first for a British woman. After the retirement of Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, James emerged as British Cycling&apos;s new star back in February, at the world track championships in Minsk, with her four-medal haul including golds in the match sprint and keirin. For an athlete who had missed the previous year&apos;s Olympic Games it was a breakthrough of epic proportions and it meant there was no doubt about Pendleton&apos;s successor as British sprint\u00a0queen. In the next month, as she builds up to the European track championships in Apeldoorn, Holland, and her home World Cup in Manchester, she will compete in three three-day meetings at the Matsudo and Tachikawa velodromes in Tokyo from 12-14 and 21-23 September, and Yokkaichi from 28-30 September, as part of the keirin women&apos;s circuit, which was relaunched last year after a 39-year break as part of a move to broaden the sport&apos;s appeal outside its traditional fanbase of older males. Only two women from outside Japan have been invited. &quot;It&apos;s really exciting. I&apos;m going partly because it will be a great experience, but also because it&apos;s a big training block on outdoor velodromes and a lot of racing,&quot; James says. &quot;I want to get into the Japanese culture, do everything they do, embrace the tradition. It will be great race experience, with nine races, and it will be completely different to doing keirin in Britain, or in the World Cups. I&apos;ve heard that the Japanese girls are always keen to beat the foreigners, so it gets a bit aggressive, a bit physical.&quot; The experience will start with a week at keirin school in which she will be taught the rules of the circuit including how to enter and leave the track and how to set up her bike, culminating in an qualification exam. &quot;The races are over three days. The day before you go in, do media, declare your tactics, hand in phones, laptops and so on so you have no access to the outside world. That&apos;s going to be the hardest side of it \u2013 I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever gone a day without talking to my family.&quot; After Minsk, James took a brief break in Argentina before returning to training. She spent her summer with a close eye on the British &amp; Irish Lions tour of Australia, if a little closer than most due to the key role played in the Lions triumph by her boyfriend, George North, who scored a try in each of the two Test wins. James travelled to watch North play in the second Test in Melbourne \u2013 building in a week of road riding and gym work, naturally \u2013 but was &quot;absolutely gutted&quot; to have been in the air and unable to watch the first and third matches in the series, including the 41-16 victory in the\u00a0decider. &quot;I&apos;m so glad I went, it could be a once in a lifetime opportunity. It was unbelievable walking around the city, seeing how many supporters there were. It gives you goosebumps. It&apos;s so different, what George does. It&apos;s a completely different sport \u2013 rugby fans just love following their teams around the world, where cycling isn&apos;t like that. Only a few supporters get to places like Minsk.&quot; The keirin interlude is just part of a packed season of racing, far more so than would have been the case in the Pendleton-Hoy era when training took precedence over racing. To encourage the leading track cyclists to appear more, the International Cycling Union have made it necessary to qualify for World Cups via smaller meetings at national level. Given that the World Cups are vital to earn slots at the world championships and, down the line, the Olympics, the calendar for all Britain&apos;s track specialists has suddenly expanded. After a shaky beginning at the European under-23 championships in July in Portugal, when she felt she was competing at well below her best form after a spell of illness, James&apos;s fitness improved through events at Hy\u00e8res in France and Cottbus in Germany, where she won the team sprint together with Victoria Williamson. &quot;The new system is quite disruptive because you have to go to the races and with the points to get everyone comes out firing, so it&apos;s tough, but after Hy\u00e8res I had the points I needed,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s very different, now we are racing virtually every weekend, but it&apos;s ideal for your tactics and anyway you always want to go and race, don&apos;t you?&quot; It also means many more opportunities for James to sport the rainbow-striped world champion&apos;s jersey she wears each time she competes in a sprint or keirin. Back in February the joy she clearly displayed at her first senior world titles was heartwarming to behold and the novelty has not yet worn off. &quot;I thought it would sink in, but I haven&apos;t really had time for that yet, because I don&apos;t really look back at what I&apos;ve been doing, I&apos;m always focused on what&apos;s coming up. &quot;So you forget about it, you carry on as normal. It&apos;s strange to put on the jersey when you&apos;re racing. You try to take it when you&apos;re wearing it, I tell myself I had amazing form and became world champion. You try to enjoy those moments, but it&apos;s hard to explain because I&apos;m always looking ahead, focusing on what&apos;s to come \u2013 the World Cups and then the worlds again, when I hope I can retain those titles.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["At the International Olympic Committee&apos;s session in Buenos Aires next weekend, protests and turmoil will seem a world away amid the polite protocol and arcane traditions of the body that will bestow the gift of the 2020 Olympics on Madrid, Istanbul or Tokyo.", "Tokyo, meanwhile, stands somewhere between the two."], "tags": ["International Olympic Committee", "Olympic Games", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-31T20:59:01Z", "title": "Madrid, Istanbul and Tokyo pull out stops in bid to land 2020 Olympics", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/31/madrid-istanbul-tokyo-2020-olympics", "article": "The world may be increasingly unstable, riven by economic woes and political upheaval. Yet still they come. Perhaps not in such great numbers as when the global economy was soaring to new heights, but they come all the same: the world&apos;s great cities and their leaders, lining up in a beauty pageant to secure the event that has become all things to all people \u2013 a panacea that can distract from a country&apos;s woes or underline their ambition on a global scale. At the International Olympic Committee&apos;s session in Buenos Aires next weekend, protests and turmoil will seem a world away amid the polite protocol and arcane traditions of the body that will bestow the gift of the 2020 Olympics on Madrid, Istanbul or Tokyo. The first is still in the grip of economic meltdown, the second made global headlines as the centre of political revolt in Taksim Square and the third has convinced many of the 104 voting IOC members that it can host the Games, but has much work to do persuading them why. The six candidates to replace Jacques Rogge as the IOC president and arguably the most important person in world sport, in a vote that will also be decided in Buenos Aires, have lined up to argue that the costs of bidding for and staging the Olympic Games must come down. Yet there appears no sign of the bidding circus and the media frenzy that surrounds it being reduced in scale. The swisher hotels of the Argentinian capital will this week hum to the sound of fevered speculation and last-minute lobbying as the three cities hone their final presentations before Saturday&apos;s vote. The IOC instigated stringent rules in the wake of the Salt Lake City scandal, which tend to place greater importance on the inspection reports compiled by a team led by the British IOC executive board member Sir Craig Reedie. Yet those same reports leave plenty of room for interpretation and, in 2005 and 2009, it was a late drive by a bid that did not begin as favourite but was able to time a last-ditch lobbying push to make a compelling emotional as well as logistical case that came through to win. In 2005 in Singapore Lord Coe and Tony Blair helped London to victory with their stirring legacy pledges. Four years later in Copenhagen Rio swayed the IOC members with promises of beach volleyball on Copacabana and the bald fact that the Games had never been held in South America. The shortlist may not be as long as in previous years \u2013 ambitious but flawed bids from Doha and Baku were chopped at an earlier stage and Rome bowed out as Italy&apos;s economic woes deepened \u2013 but the competition is as keen as ever. The success of the 2012 London Games was a huge relief for the IOC, as the lavish tributes paid by the various presidential candidates have made clear. Dr CK Wu, the sometimes controversial president of the Association of International Boxing Associations, said London was &quot;probably the most successful Olympic Games in history&quot;, adding: &quot;The public support for the sport was so impressive. You have left a legacy in so many ways.&quot; Sergey Bubka, the International Association of Athletics Federations vice-president who is also standing, said it was &quot;unforgettable&quot;. The Singaporean IOC vice-president Ng Ser Miang called the 2012 edition a &quot;huge success&quot;. The legacy rhetoric has allowed the government and the organisers, on the back of sometimes fairly flimsy figures, to declare that the Olympics were not only a success on their own terms but delivered long-lasting reputational and economic benefits. In some ways London 2012 rebooted the Olympic movement after the money-no-object spectacle of Beijing, making governments around the world gaze longingly at the feelgood fillip it provided to a country suffering economically and the extent to which it effectively rebranded London and the UK. The arguments about whether the \u00a38.7bn in public money spent on the Games represented value for money, and indeed whether the true number was in fact far higher, will go on and on. But in the eyes of those who made the bid promises, it was an unalloyed success. Paradoxically, the idea of hosting major sporting events is in some ways more attractive to governments in difficult times \u2013 providing they can convince an often sceptical public that the outlay on infrastructure is worthwhile \u2013 because they deal in the rare and precious commodities of hope and optimism. &quot;There are many reasons why people want to organise the Games. But there is one common denominator,&quot; says Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, the son of the former IOC president and an IOC member who is a pivotal figure in the Madrid delegation. &quot;It is the utmost party of youth, it is the best phenomenon in the world nowadays that delivers inspiration for the youth. It means good news, it means healthy competition, the youth of the world coming together.&quot; Samaranch&apos;s Madrid bid started as an outsider but has gathered momentum and support in recent months and is now a contender. &quot;All of that represents much more than money, much more than investment, new stadia or new airports. It is a dream. It is such good news in a world that has so little good news to offer.&quot; Madrid offers what it calls &quot;a new vision&quot; for the Olympic movement. By promising to hold the Games largely in existing venues and with clever use of temporary ones, it insists the Spanish capital can deliver them at a fraction of the cost. &quot;That&apos;s the feeling we have, momentum wise,&quot; Samaranch added. &quot;It feels everything is clicking together. We&apos;ve put together a very solid bid and we are very happy. We are proud and confident. When you are bidding, you need many things. But there are two key things: you have to prove what differential you can offer to the Olympic movement and why it is important to you.&quot;. &quot;On the first, we believe that in the world today we can&apos;t afford the vast expense of previous Olympic Games. I don&apos;t think there is anyone now who thinks the Games are about big investment programmes.&quot; Istanbul, by contrast, is more in the Rio mould: an expansive, ambitious vision that promises to unite east and west on the banks of the Bosphorus. It was making real headway until the wall-to-wall live coverage of the Taksim Square protests stopped it in its tracks. Tokyo, meanwhile, stands somewhere between the two. The bookmakers&apos; favourite, it ticks all the boxes in terms of infrastructure and facilities but must convince IOC members it can pack an emotional punch and improve its reputation for dour presentations \u2013 explain the &quot;why&quot; as well as the &quot;how&quot;. There does seem to be a genuine push within the IOC hierarchy to find ways of reducing the costs of the summer Games, even as they search for new events and responsibilities elsewhere to expand their remit. It has become a key debating point in a presidential race that began with the German Thomas Bach as favourite but in which he faces a tough challenge from the 64-year old Singaporean Ng, who has the advantage of representing the view that the IOC should look beyond Europe for its leader for the first time. Wu said: &quot;To reduce the costs is very important. With the economy as it is, who can guarantee that in future cities will be able to afford to hold a Games like this. My proposal is to make 50% of the venues temporary. After the Games, they can be dismantled and shipped to the next Olympic Games to be used.&quot; And yet even while the candidates pursue their austerity manifestos to match the times, the three 2020 bidders will leave no stone unturned and no expense spared in their efforts to secure the self-styled greatest sporting show on earth."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;London 2012 was a brilliant Games,&quot; said Takaya, acting communications director of Tokyo 2020 and part of the team trying to bring the same kind of triumph to Japan.", "&quot;It showed how early, efficient delivery was so important to allow a focus on all those vital extra elements that transform a good Games into a great Games that inspire people around the world.&quot; Next Saturday almost 100 members of the International Olympic Committee will meet in Buenos Aires to decide whether Tokyo will get the chance to follow in London&apos;s footsteps and, perhaps, mark the beginning of another new era: better times for a country that has spent most of the past two decades in the economic doldrums.", "With less than a week to go before IOC officials vote for either Tokyo, Madrid or Istanbul, Japanese officials are confident of winning the race to 2020, notwithstanding renewed concern over radiation leaks at the Fukushima nuclear power plant.", "The bookmakers have made Tokyo the favourite, with Istanbul a distant second.", "If Tokyo&apos;s bid is successful, the Games will centre on the national Olympic stadium, the main venue for Japan&apos;s 1964 Olympics.", "The judo competition will be held at the Nippon Budokan, perhaps best known around the world as the venue for a series of concerts by the Beatles in 1966; the archery and equestrian events will take place on Yumenoshima (which translates as &quot;dream island&quot;), an artificial island built using waste landfill in the 1950s to deal with Tokyo&apos;s rubbish problem.", "Tokyo organisers last week cited a poll showing approval standing at 92%.", "Tokyo&apos;s cause wasn&apos;t helped by Shintaro Ishihara, its ultra-conservative governor at the time, who was viewed by many outside the capital as a divisive figure because of his confrontational stance towards China.", "Tokyo&apos;s is also excellent.", "Tetsuo Ogawa of People Against the Olympics, a pressure group that opposes Tokyo&apos;s bid, is most concerned about the financial cost of the Olympics at a time when poverty levels are rising in Japan.", "&quot;Tokyo plans to spend a lot of money building accommodation for athletes, while it&apos;s preparing to evict homeless people from areas close to Olympic venues, including the main stadium,&quot; he said.", "In an obvious reference to the London 2012 Games, Takeda has repeatedly pointed to Tokyo&apos;s advanced sports and transport infrastructure, and its relative safety.", "The clear message is that an Olympics in\u00a0Tokyo would be trouble-free, and affordable.", "&quot;We believe that Tokyo 2020 will deliver superb, safe Games, which will be a safe pair of hands and be a great legacy for the Olympic movement,&quot; Japan&apos;s Olympic committee president said.", "Aside from drawing on the country&apos;s technological prowess, advanced infrastructure and stable source of funding, Tokyo is promising a &quot;downtown&quot; Games with 85% of the venues located within a five-mile radius of the Olympic village.", "Tokyo&apos;s city leaders have also attempted to allay safety fears following the news last week that highly radioactive water had leaked from a storage tank at the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant.", "In response, Inose pointed out that atmospheric radiation levels in Tokyo are comparable with those in London and New York.", "&quot;The food and water in Tokyo are completely safe,&quot; he said."], "tags": ["Japan", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympic Games", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Sport", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-31T23:04:19Z", "title": "Tokyo inspired by London in bid for Olympic glory", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/tokyo-japan-olympic-games-2020-bid", "article": "During London&apos;s golden Olympic summer, Masa Takaya sat back, watched with admiration and mentally took notes. &quot;London 2012 was a brilliant Games,&quot; said Takaya, acting communications director of Tokyo 2020 and part of the team trying to bring the same kind of triumph to Japan. &quot;It showed how early, efficient delivery was so important to allow a focus on all those vital extra elements that transform a good Games into a great Games that inspire people around the world.&quot; Next Saturday almost 100 members of the International Olympic Committee will meet in Buenos Aires to decide whether Tokyo will get the chance to follow in London&apos;s footsteps and, perhaps, mark the beginning of another new era: better times for a country that has spent most of the past two decades in the economic doldrums.

The bookmakers have made Tokyo the favourite, with Istanbul a distant second. &quot;Our strength lies in our dependability in hosting the Games,&quot; said Tsunekazu Takeda, president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, as the city entered the final, decisive stages of its campaign. The bid committee is keen to emphasise that it has learned from London&apos;s successful bid for the 2012 Games. The Japanese capital has hired the same UK-based agency as London and Rio \u2013 host of the 2016 Games \u2013 to write its speeches and promotional material, and frequently cites the importance of the &quot;Olympic legacy&quot;. If Tokyo&apos;s bid is successful, the Games will centre on the national Olympic stadium, the main venue for Japan&apos;s 1964 Olympics. The site will undergo a $1bn (\u00a3650m) refurbishment by the UK-based architect Zaha Hadid. By the time the Rugby World Cup comes to Japan in 2019, the ageing stadium will be a state-of-the art, 80,000-seat arena, complete with a retractable roof. The judo competition will be held at the Nippon Budokan, perhaps best known around the world as the venue for a series of concerts by the Beatles in 1966; the archery and equestrian events will take place on Yumenoshima (which translates as &quot;dream island&quot;), an artificial island built using waste landfill in the 1950s to deal with Tokyo&apos;s rubbish problem. Some of the football matches will be played in Miyagi, one of the three prefectures in the country&apos;s north-east, whose coastlines were devastated by the March 2011 tsunami. Public support for the bid is rising at home. Tokyo organisers last week cited a poll showing approval standing at 92%. The city&apos;s doomed bid for the 2016 Games fizzled out amid public indifference and accusations of wasteful spending, soon after the global economy was rocked by the Lehman Brothers bank collapse. Tokyo&apos;s cause wasn&apos;t helped by Shintaro Ishihara, its ultra-conservative governor at the time, who was viewed by many outside the capital as a divisive figure because of his confrontational stance towards China. His successor as governor, Naoki Inose, is less controversial, but was forced to apologise this year when he broke the IOC&apos;s rules on criticising rival bids with a culturally insensitive outburst directed at Turkey. &quot;Islamic countries \u2026 the only thing they share in common is Allah and they are fighting with each other,&quot; he said in a newspaper interview during a visit to New York. Inose compounded the gaffe by suggesting that London had secured the 2012 Games because it was &quot;in a developed country whose sense of hospitality is excellent. Tokyo&apos;s is also excellent. But other cities, not so much.&quot; The IOC decided not to take action after Inose issued an apology. Not everyone is an Olympics enthusiast. Tetsuo Ogawa of People Against the Olympics, a pressure group that opposes Tokyo&apos;s bid, is most concerned about the financial cost of the Olympics at a time when poverty levels are rising in Japan. &quot;Tokyo plans to spend a lot of money building accommodation for athletes, while it&apos;s preparing to evict homeless people from areas close to Olympic venues, including the main stadium,&quot; he said. &quot;The city spent a lot of tax money on its failed bid for 2016, and it is wasting it again on what is essentially a gamble.&quot; But the general mood is gung ho. In an obvious reference to the London 2012 Games, Takeda has repeatedly pointed to Tokyo&apos;s advanced sports and transport infrastructure, and its relative safety. While Japan has so far failed to rein in its huge public debt, its economic woes are mild compared with those of Spain. The clear message is that an Olympics in\u00a0Tokyo would be trouble-free, and affordable. &quot;We believe that Tokyo 2020 will deliver superb, safe Games, which will be a safe pair of hands and be a great legacy for the Olympic movement,&quot; Japan&apos;s Olympic committee president said. Aside from drawing on the country&apos;s technological prowess, advanced infrastructure and stable source of funding, Tokyo is promising a &quot;downtown&quot; Games with 85% of the venues located within a five-mile radius of the Olympic village. &quot;The city enjoys the largest GDP of any city in the world,&quot; Takeda said. &quot;It already has a Games fund of $4.5bn in the bank, as well as full government financial guarantees [if there is a shortfall].&quot; With Japan showing early signs of climbing out of its deflationary spiral, Taro Aso, the deputy prime minister, has predicted a 3tn yen windfall from the Olympics, while the country&apos;s beleaguered corporations are expected to benefit from a slew of lucrative contracts in the construction, real estate, retail and service sectors. Tokyo&apos;s city leaders have also attempted to allay safety fears following the news last week that highly radioactive water had leaked from a storage tank at the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japan&apos;s nuclear watchdog raised the severity of the incident from one to three on an international scale for nuclear accidents. In response, Inose pointed out that atmospheric radiation levels in Tokyo are comparable with those in London and New York. &quot;The food and water in Tokyo are completely safe,&quot; he said. &quot;The situation in Fukushima will have no bearing on the vote [in Buenos Aires].&quot; In 1964, Japan had just embarked on a dramatic transformation that would see a defeated, traumatised nation become the world&apos;s second-biggest economy. The Games that summer were a clear signal that Japan had been welcomed into the international community, less\u00a0than 20 years after the end of the Pacific war. Five decades later, buoyed by the example of London 2012, the hope is that the feelgood factor can return."}, {"sentences": ["The plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said radiation near the bottom of the tank measured 1,800 millisieverts an hour \u2013 high enough to kill an exposed person in four hours.", "&quot;We think that contaminated water management by your company has completely fallen apart,&quot; Hiroshi Kishi, chairman of the Japan Fisheries Co-operative, told Tepco&apos;s president, Naomi Hirose, during a meeting in Tokyo last week."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "World news", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-01T09:22:57Z", "title": "Fukushima radiation levels 18 times higher than previously thought", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/01/fukushima-radiation-levels-higher-japan", "article": "Radiation levels 18 times higher than previously reported have been found near a water storage tank at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, causing fresh concern about the safety of the wrecked\u00a0facility. The plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said radiation near the bottom of the tank measured 1,800 millisieverts an hour \u2013 high enough to kill an exposed person in four hours. Tepco said water levels inside the tank had not changed, indicating there had not been a leak. But the company said it had yet to discover the cause of the radiation spike. Last month Tepco said another storage tank \u2013 of the same design as the container causing concern at the weekend \u2013 had leaked 300 tonnes of radioactive water, possibly into the sea. Japan&apos;s nuclear watchdog confirmed last week it had raised the severity of that leak from level 1, an &quot;anomaly&quot;, to level 3, a &quot;serious incident&quot;, on an eight-point scale used by the International Atomic Energy Agency for radiological releases. Earlier, the utility belatedly confirmed reports that a toxic mixture of groundwater and water being used to cool melted fuel lying deep inside the damaged reactors was seeping into the sea at a rate of about 300 tonnes a day. Experts said those leaks, which are separate from the most recent incidents, may have started soon after the plant was struck by a powerful tsunami on 11 March 2011. The tsunami smashed into the plant after Japan&apos;s north-east coast was rocked by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake. The waves killed almost 19,000 people, while the resulting triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi forced 160,000 people to abandon their homes. The high radiation levels announced on Sunday highlighted the dangers facing thousands of workers as they attempt to contain, treat and store water safely, while preventing fuel assemblies damaged in the accident from going back into meltdown. Japan&apos;s nuclear workers are allowed an annual accumulative radiation exposure of 50 millisieverts. Tepco said radiation of 230 millisieverts an hour had been measured at another tank, up from 70\u00a0millisieverts last month. A third storage tank was emitting 70 millisieverts an hour, Tepco said. Radiation near a pipe connecting two other tanks had been measured at 230 millisieverts. Tepco admitted recently that only two workers had initially been assigned to check more than 1,000 storage tanks on the site. Neither of the workers carried dosimeters to measure their exposure to radiation, and some inspections had not been properly recorded. The firm responded to growing criticism of its handling of the water problem by increasing the number of workers patrolling the tanks from the current total of eight to 50. The firm&apos;s inability to safely store contaminated water and prevent more damage to the environment has prompted doubts about its ability to lead the Fukushima Daiichi cleanup. Decommissioning the plant is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars and last around 40 years. Tepco recently set up a committee to focus on the water leaks and said it would seek advice from foreign decommissioning experts. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has said the government will play a bigger role in preventing water contamination. The chairman of the country&apos;s Nuclear Regulation Authority, Shunichi Tanaka, said: &quot;We cannot fully stop contaminated water leaks right away. That&apos;s the reality. The water is still leaking in to the sea, and we should better assess its environmental impact.&quot; Tepco&apos;s handling of the leaks has drawn an angry response from local fishermen, who had to abandon plans to conduct a trial catch at the end of August. Fishermen south of Fukushima Daiichi have not been able to fish commercially since the disaster, while those north of the plant can catch only octopus and whelks. &quot;We think that contaminated water management by your company has completely fallen apart,&quot; Hiroshi Kishi, chairman of the Japan Fisheries Co-operative, told Tepco&apos;s president, Naomi Hirose, during a meeting in Tokyo last week. &quot;This has dealt an immeasurable blow to the future of Japan&apos;s fishing industry, and we are extremely concerned.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Some of the setpieces (most notably the apocalyptic earthquake that leads to the burning of Tokyo) are the equal of anything the director has produced in Spirited Away or My Neighbour Totoro."], "tags": ["Venice film festival 2013", "Film", "Culture", "Venice film festival", "Animation", "World cinema", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-01T12:25:09Z", "title": "The Wind Rises \u2013 Venice 2013: first look review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/01/venice-film-festival-review-wind-rises", "article": "Hayao Miyazaki, the master craftsman of hand-drawn animation, comes bumping into Venice with The Wind Rises, a gorgeous yet ultimately frustrating tribute to the Japanese airplane designer Jiro Horikoshi.

Jiro Horikoshi is the myopic, wide-eyed genius who winds up assisting the rearmament of Germany and goes on to create the phenomenal Mitsubishi Zero fighter jets for the Japanese military. &quot;Who are they going to fight?&quot; he says idly, as though he&apos;s asking about the weather forecast. Jiro, it seems, has no particular interest in promoting the war or preventing the war. He is more concerned with the health of his sickly fiancee; more focused on the wonderful nuts and bolts business of designing his planes. &quot;The dream of aviation is cursed,&quot; a ghostly mentor tells him at one stage. &quot;But what would you choose \u2013 a world with pyramids or one without?&quot; Jiro&apos;s Zero fighters were later built at slave labour camps and were used for kamikaze missions, although the film does not mention this. Jiro, for his part, is painted as an innocent, incurious man who perhaps feels that his responsibilities end when his planes are complete. All of which would be fine \u2013\u00a0a great springboard for a drama about art and its consequences \u2013 were it not for the fact that Miyazaki is so incurious too. The film-maker so clearly admires his subject that he never truly stoops to question his vision or hold his man to account. Naturally the animation is a joy to behold. The film&apos;s crisp colours and commanding lines summon up a ravishing portrait of pre-war Japan with its puffing steam-trains, huddled neighbourhoods and lulling nocturnal tram-rides through town. Some of the setpieces (most notably the apocalyptic earthquake that leads to the burning of Tokyo) are the equal of anything the director has produced in Spirited Away or My Neighbour Totoro. But the film itself is genteel to a fault. It&apos;s too polite, it needs more bite. It lets enigmatic Horikoshi off the hook, bobbing out to the clouds, forever out of reach."}, {"sentences": ["The pictures will leave England for the first time this month when the auctioneers send them on tour to Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow, New York and Los Angeles, before they go on show in London in early December."], "tags": ["Painting", "UK news", "Art and design", "Culture", "Museums"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-01T16:40:27Z", "title": "Dante Gabriel Rossetti painting to be auctioned for first time", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/01/rossetti-painting-auction-sotherbys", "article": "A portrait of a beautiful laundress, which was bought by a soap powder billionaire, is to be sold at auction for the first time in almost a century, and is expected to fetch up to \u00a36m. A Christmas Carol, by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, was once part of the largest collection of English paintings ever assembled by one man \u2013 William Hesketh Lever, first Viscount Leverhulme, who made his fortune from Sunlight Soap. Lever kept the painting all his life, when most of his pictures went to a gallery in the model village created for his factory workers. It will be sold with two more Victorian masterpieces bought by his son: Tuscan Girl, by William Holman Hunt, and A Visit to the Yacht, by James Tissot. The three pictures, to be sold at Sotheby&apos;s, London, in December, are valued at up to \u00a314m. Grant Ford, a 19th-century expert at the auctioneers, said: &quot;I have been here nearly 27 years, and I really think these are the best Victorian pictures we&apos;ve had in that time. To see one Victorian painting of such quality would be remarkable, to get three in together is extraordinary.&quot; In 1917 the Rossetti was bought by Lever, who already owned several drawings by the artist but yearned for an oil painting. The model was Ellen Smith, a laundress whose beauty was spoiled when her face was slashed by an admirer jealous of her success as an artist&apos;s model. She went back to washing clothes for a living. Most of Lever&apos;s enormous collection went to the Lady Lever Gallery, which he created to improve the minds of his factory workers at Port Sunlight beside the Mersey \u2013 where the three pictures have been on loan for the last few years. Lever kept the painting at Thornton Manor, a Victorian mock Tudor mansion which eventually held more than 20,000 art objects, where it hung in the magnificent drawing room He slept under an open-sided canopy on the roof in all weathers, rising at 4.30am to plunge into a bracing cold bath. &quot;He had a great eye and great advisers \u2013 and great wealth, of course,&quot; Ford said. &quot;By rising so early, by 9.30 his business was more or less done and dusted and he could devote the rest of the day to collecting.&quot; Lever&apos;s heirs continued collecting, if on a less epic scale, and added the Holman Hunt of the little girl with her pet dove, painted in Italy and still in its original frame, and the Tissot of lackadaisically elegant figures on a yacht on the Thames, with a terminally bored little girl in the foreground. The pictures will leave England for the first time this month when the auctioneers send them on tour to Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow, New York and Los Angeles, before they go on show in London in early December. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 September to correct the spelling of Sotheby&apos;s in the standfirst."}, {"sentences": ["Abe, who recently suggested that the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), was incapable of overseeing the operation on its own, said the government would soon announce a comprehensive plan to deal with the world&apos;s largest nuclear cleanup.", "&quot;If we decide to discharge water into the ocean, we will use various methods to ensure that radiation is below accepted levels,&quot; Tanaka told reporters in Tokyo.", "Concern is growing that the stream of bad news from Fukushima could threaten Tokyo&apos;s bid to host the 2020 Olympics.", "Japan&apos;s foreign ministry has started posting English-language information online showing that atmospheric radiation levels in Tokyo, 140 miles south of Fukushima Daiichi, are comparable with those in London and New York."], "tags": ["Shinzo Abe", "Fukushima", "World news", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-02T09:04:16Z", "title": "Fukushima: Japan promises swift action on nuclear cleanup", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/02/fukushima-japan-action-nuclear-cleanup", "article": "Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has promised to act quickly to address the buildup of huge quantities of contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Abe, who recently suggested that the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), was incapable of overseeing the operation on its own, said the government would soon announce a comprehensive plan to deal with the world&apos;s largest nuclear cleanup. The prospect of greater state involvement in decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi \u2013 the scene of a triple meltdown after it was hit by a tsunami in March 2011 \u2013 comes amid growing concern that Tepco is ill-equipped to cope with the scale and complexity of the cleanup. Those doubts were fuelled by evidence that the plant is seeping up to 300 tonnes of contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean every day. In a separate incident, a water storage tank was found to have leaked about 300 tonnes of highly toxic water, some of which could have found its way into the sea. At the weekend, radiation near another tank was measured at 1,800 millisieverts an hour \u2013 a level that could kill an unprotected person in just four hours \u2013 and 18 times higher than previously thought. Tepco had initially recorded radiation near the tank at about 100 millisieverts an hour, but admitted that this was because the equipment used could only read measurements up to that level. The latest reading came from a more advanced device capable of reading up to 10,000 millisieverts. The buildup of water at the site is close to becoming unmanageable. Experts say that Tepco will soon be left with no choice but to release the water into the ocean or evaporate it. At present, water is used to cool melted nuclear fuel in three reactor basements, where it becomes contaminated and then mixes with groundwater seeping down from the hills behind the plant. The site&apos;s tanks, basements and pits contain an estimated 338,000 tonnes of tainted water. The chairman of the country&apos;s nuclear regulation authority, Shunichi Tanaka, said on Monday that discharging the water remained an option, but only after it had been treated to bring radiation levels to below regulatory limits. &quot;If we decide to discharge water into the ocean, we will use various methods to ensure that radiation is below accepted levels,&quot; Tanaka told reporters in Tokyo. &quot;We will have to dispose of it eventually, but we are committed to reducing or removing radioactive materials. &quot;There are specific limits that are used worldwide for the discharge of contaminated water. Nuclear power plants do that under normal circumstances \u2013 we&apos;re not asking for an exception to be made in Fukushima&apos;s case.&quot; Tanaka said monitoring of the more than 1,000 water tanks at the site had been &quot;inadequate&quot;. Previously, only two workers were dispatched twice a day to check the tanks, but did not carry personal radiation monitors and failed to keep proper records of their inspections. Tanaka said that a small leak and signs of possible leaks had been spotted at several other storage tanks. Tepco apologised for the &quot;great anxiety and inconvenience&quot; caused by the contaminated water. But the utility took issue with media reports suggesting workers at the site were at risk of being irradiated. Most of the radiation in the most recent incident \u2013 measured at 1,800 millisieverts an hour \u2013 was emitted in the form of beta rays, it said. Beta radiation travels only a short distance and can be blocked by a thin sheet of metal, such as aluminium, it added. &quot;We believe that we can control radiation exposure by the using proper equipment and clothing,&quot; the firm said in an emailed statement. &quot;We will investigate the cause of this issue, taking any appropriate countermeasures immediately, and continue to make every effort to secure the safety of workers.&quot; The government is expected to unveil emergency measures on Tuesday to deal with the water crisis. The plan will include steps to prevent a further buildup of contaminated water, possibly financed by the state, media reports said. Abe has come under pressure from his party&apos;s coalition partner to intervene at Fukushima Daiichi. The toxic water leaks were &quot;very serious&quot;, Kyodo quoted New Komeito&apos;s leader, Natsuo Yamaguchi, as telling Abe at a meeting on Monday. &quot;I want the government to deal with the problem in a comprehensive manner.&quot; The leaks threaten to delay Abe&apos;s plans to restart nuclear reactors, a move he says is necessary to support Japan&apos;s economic recovery and improve Tepco&apos;s tattered finances. Of Japan&apos;s 50 working nuclear reactors, only two are in operation. One of those was to be shut down on Monday evening to undergo routine checks, the other will go offline on 15 September, leaving Japan without atomic energy for only the second time in almost 50 years. Concern is growing that the stream of bad news from Fukushima could threaten Tokyo&apos;s bid to host the 2020 Olympics. The International Olympic Committee will announce the host city \u2013 the two other candidates are Madrid and Istanbul \u2013 in Buenos Aires on Saturday. Japan&apos;s foreign ministry has started posting English-language information online showing that atmospheric radiation levels in Tokyo, 140 miles south of Fukushima Daiichi, are comparable with those in London and New York."}, {"sentences": ["The famed animator was not in Italy for the debut of The Wind Rises, but his retirement was revealed by Studio Ghibli president Koju Hoshino in a deliberately short announcement on Sunday ahead of a full press conference in Tokyo next week."], "tags": ["Hayao Miyazaki", "Animation", "Film", "Venice film festival", "Venice film festival 2013", "Festivals", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-02T09:53:40Z", "title": "Studio Ghibli's Hayao Miyazaki to retire following latest film", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/02/studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-retires", "article": "The Oscar-winning Japanese film-maker Hayao Miyazaki is to retire from directing after the release of his final movie, which premiered in competition at the Venice film festival at the weekend.

The measures come as the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), struggles to prevent leaks into the Pacific Ocean and to find a way to contain and treat the huge volume of water that has accumulated at the site since it was hit by a tsunami in March 2011. Last weekend, workers recorded radiation levels of up to 1,800 millisieverts an hour near one storage tank for the contaminated water. A radiation dose of that size is big enough to kill an unprotected person nearby in about four hours. Tepco said the radiation was emitted in the form of beta rays \u2013 which travel only short distances and can be easily shut out \u2013 and that workers had not been put at risk. The government&apos;s decision to step in is widely seen as a safety appeal just days before the International Olympic Committee chooses between Tokyo, Istanbul and Madrid on which city will host the 2020 Olympics. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the government would take a more active role in the biggest nuclear cleanup in history, amid mounting concern that Tepco is no longer able to cope alone. &quot;The world is watching to see if we can carry out the decommissioning of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, including addressing the contaminated water issues,&quot; Abe reportedly told cabinet ministers. Reports said that about 32bn yen of the 47bn yen in new funding would be spent on constructing a 1.4km-long underground frozen wall around four damaged reactors \u2013 an untested and expensive technique. The wall would prevent groundwater from mixing with coolant water that becomes contaminated after it comes into contact with melted nuclear fuel. A further 15bn yen will be spent on improving technology to remove all radioactive particles \u2013 except tritium \u2013 from the water, or to least reduce them to legally accepted levels. The head of Japan&apos;s nuclear watchdog, Shunichi Tanaka, confirmed on Monday that discharging treated water into the ocean is one option under consideration. Given the large volumes involved, experts say that Tepco will soon run out of storage space and will have no choice than to discharge or evaporate the contaminated water. Last month, Tepco belatedly confirmed reports that coolant water was mixing with groundwater and flowing into the sea at a rate of about 300 tons a day. In a separate incident, the utility, which was effectively nationalised last year when it was saved from collapse with a 1tn yen injection of public funds, said a storage tank had sprung a serious leak. Smaller amounts of tainted water are thought to have breached other tanks and pipes. The new funding was announced days before the International Olympic Committee [IOC] is due to select the host city for the 2020 Olympics. Concern is growing that the water crisis could harm Tokyo&apos;s chances of being chosen ahead of Madrid and Istanbul. But Japanese Olympic officials said the Fukushima crisis should not affect Tokyo&apos;s prospects. &quot;There is no risk from Fukushima,&quot; Tsunekazu Takeda, who is leading the city&apos;s bid, told AFP. &quot;Day-to-day life in Tokyo carries on as normal for its 35 million people. &quot;The air and water quality is safe. Also the data shows that the radiation level is the same as most cities, like Paris, London and New York. Our main focus is to deliver a great and safe Games.&quot; Abe will deliver Japan&apos;s final pitch to the IOC ahead of the decision in Buenos Aires on Saturday evening. The emergency measures announced on Tuesday do not address the wider problem created by the need to constantly cool the damaged reactors and the resulting buildup of contaminated water. In addition, the new funding represents only a tiny potion of the tens of billions of dollars experts estimate it will cost to decommission the plant, an operation that is likely to last at least 40 years. No decision has been taken on who will foot the bill \u2013 the state or Tepco. &quot;This is a matter of public safety, so the country has to take the lead on this issue and respond as quickly as possible. Figuring out who to bill for the costs can come later,&quot; Akira Amari, the economics minister, told reporters. Public criticism of Tepco has intensified in recent months. It initially denied reports of groundwater leaks, and was found to have employed just two workers to conduct twice-daily inspections of more than 1,000 storage tanks containing an estimated 330,000 tons of contaminated water. To compound Tepco&apos;s problems, sources familiar with the situation at the plant say the firm is struggling to hire new workers, as others resign or are forced to leave because they have reached their radiation exposure threshold. Critics of the nuclear industry, even inside the governing Liberal Democratic party, are beginning to ask why no Tepco executives have been held accountable for the latest string of accidents. &quot;Is anyone at Tepco taking responsibility for these mistakes?&quot; Reuters quoted Taro Kono, an LDP deputy secretary general, as saying. &quot;I haven&apos;t heard of anyone stepping down or being fired. Tepco needs to go down and the government needs to take over.&quot; Senior LDP officials have said that liquidating Tepco is not under consideration."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;To do that we are resolutely implementing drastic measures.&quot; Abe, who will make Tokyo&apos;s final pitch in the city&apos;s bid to host the 2020 Olympics at a meeting of the International Olympic Committee in Buenos Aries this weekend, added: &quot;I will be explaining to the IOC that in seven years&apos; time, 2020, it will not be a problem at all.&quot;"], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Environment", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "Nuclear waste", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-04T06:03:00Z", "title": "Fukushima radiation leaks reach deadly new high", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/04/fukushima-radiation-deadly-new-high", "article": "The crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has radiation leaks strong enough to deliver a fatal dose within hours, Japanese authorities have revealed, as the government prepares to step in to help contain leaks of highly toxic water at the site. On Wednesday the country&apos;s nuclear regulation authority said radiation readings near water storage tanks at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have increased to a new high, with emissions above the ground near one group of tanks were as high as 2,200 millisieverts [mSv] per hour \u2013 a rise of 20% from the previous high. Earlier this week the plant&apos;s operator, Tepco, said workers had measured radiation at 1,800 mSv an hour near a storage tank. That was the previous highest reading since Tepco began installing tanks to store huge quantities of contaminated water that have built up at the plant. An unprotected person standing close to the contaminated areas would, within hours, receive a deadly radiation dose. The nuclear regulation authority said the radiation comprised mostly beta rays that could be blocked by aluminium foil, unlike more penetrative gamma rays. Tepco&apos;s admission in August that about 300 tonnes of radioactive groundwater is escaping into the nearby Pacific Ocean every day, and the more recent discovery of leaking storage tanks and pipes, prompted the government to inject more than \u00a3300m to contain the water crisis. The emergency measures, announced on Tuesday, involve building a mile-long impenetrable frozen wall beneath the plant to prevent groundwater from mixing with contaminated coolant water. The coolant becomes tainted after coming into contact with melted uranium fuel deep inside the damaged reactors. Currently about 400 tonnes of groundwater are streaming into the reactor basements from the hills behind the plant each day. The water is pumped out and held in about 1,000 storage tanks. The tanks contain 330,000 tonnes of water with varying levels of toxicity. Officials are conducting a feasibility study into the frozen wall, with completion expected by March 2015. Although the technology isn&apos;t new, the scale of the Fukushima Daiichi project is unprecedented for an atomic facility. The government also wants to speed up the development of a new water treatment system that can remove most radioactive substances from the water. Tepco has already constructed once such facility but it has not been used since equipment was found to have corroded during a trial run.

But the models he had hired failed to show up, and a harsh, hot mistral was blowing, making conditions for painting outdoors unbearable. So he improvised: he took bunches of Proven\u00e7al sunflowers, then at their golden-blooming best, and arranged them in locally made, half-glazed earthenware pots. He started work on Monday morning and by Saturday he had made four sunflower pictures. Two of these are now among the most beloved, celebrated and valuable paintings in the world: they hang in Munich and in the National Gallery, London. Two are lost to public view \u2013 one was destroyed in an American bombing raid on Japan during the second world war, the other vanished into private hands after it was exhibited in Ohio in 1948. Now fresh details have emerged about the lost paintings. The Van Gogh expert Martin Bailey has tracked down a previously unknown 1920s print of Six Sunflowers \u2013 the work that was destroyed \u2013 so that for the first time since the war it can been seen in its original bright, vibrant colours, and with\u00a0a hitherto unseen original frame that Van Gogh painted to complement the colours of the subject. In addition, Bailey has tracked the &quot;missing&quot; painting, charting its progress through private hands after the war to being sold in the 1990s to a &quot;very discreet, private collector&quot; who owns a handful of Van Goghs. Bailey, who publishes his research this week in a new book, The Sunflowers Are Mine, found the 1920s image of Six Sunflowers in a small museum in Japan, tucked away in a portfolio of C\u00e9zanne\u00a0prints. One other, much poorer quality, reproduction exists, lacking the detail of the frame. It is also in much less vibrant colours than the print unearthed by Bailey, which matches the description that Van Gogh wrote of the work in a letter to his brother, Theo. The orange frame \u2013 bright where it follows the sky-blue background of the picture and paler where it meets the lilac of the table on which the flowers sit \u2013 was &quot;a revolutionary idea in 1888 when the work was painted,&quot; said Bailey. &quot;Paintings were normally hung in gilt frames, or for very modern works in white-painted frames \u2026 Van Gogh clearly meant it as an integral part of the\u00a0work.&quot; The painting met its doom on the same day that Hiroshima was destroyed, in a separate bombing attack on Ashiya. Long since removed from Van Gogh&apos;s painted frame, which he had had run up by the local carpenter in Arles, it was framed in elaborate gilt and hung above the sofa of a wealthy collector, Koyata Yamamoto. As fire engulfed the house, the large frame made the picture too heavy to rescue. Bailey has charted the lives of the four sunflower paintings, as well as the three copies Van Gogh made later of two of them, which now hang in museums in Philadelphia, Amsterdam and Tokyo. They began as pictures the artist made to decorate Paul Gauguin&apos;s bedroom, and could not sell, and ended up among the most revered and expensive paintings ever. Bailey believes that a sunflower painting would, if it reached the open market, make &quot;way beyond \u00a3100m&quot;. The National Gallery sold 26,000 postcards of its version last year. The paintings have remarkable histories. During the war Fifteen Sunflowers, the version that hangs in the National Gallery (it actually belongs to the Tate), was sent for safe keeping to Muncaster Castle in Cumbria, high above the old Roman port at Ravenglass. From there it was sent to the Trossachs to receive attention from a German picture conservator who had fled the Nazis. In his farmhouse north of Glasgow, the conservator replaced a gloomy Rembrandt on one wall with the cheerier sunflowers picture. Alongside was &quot;Van Gogh&apos;s Yellow Chair, a wonderful late Turner and Whistler&apos;s Waterloo Bridge, not a bad little collection to brighten up our wartime exile!&quot; he wrote.

So, for example, your Facebook icon displays a little red number badge when you have new Facebook notifications, but you have to actually open up the app and wait awhile for it to call Facebook&apos;s server before the app itself knows what those red numbers referred to and what those notifications are.

HTC revenue collapse analysis: situation hopeless &gt;&gt; BGR Tero Kuittinen:   HTC is sailing towards the autumn back-to-school sales season with broken masts and a big hole under the waterline. To make things worse, the company is going to launch a pricey phablet as its next model. This is precisely the wrong move to make now that we know that the brand has zero high-end appeal. The second devastating setback for HTC is the Microsoft acquisition of Nokia. The buzz in Helsinki this week is that Microsoft is going to implement major price cuts of Lumia models as it prepares to fight for market share in Asia and Europe. Microsoft must cut prices on Lumia models ruthlessly because it will lose the Windows\u00a0platform support of Samsung and HTC now that it is competing directly against them.

In Japan, the row over the plant operator&apos;s handling of the leaks deepened on Friday when the head of the country&apos;s nuclear watchdog issued a stern rebuke to Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) for causing unnecessary alarm overseas by releasing &quot;scientifically unacceptable&quot; information about radiation levels. Seoul&apos;s decision came as Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, prepared to make a final pitch for Tokyo&apos;s bid to host the 2020 Olympics. Tokyo is the bookmakers&apos; favourite but international concern over contamination at Fukushima Daiichi is fuelling speculation that the Japanese capital could lose out to Madrid or Istanbul. The International Olympic Committee will name the host city at a meeting in Buenos Aires on Saturday evening. South Korea said it had imposed a total ban on fish from Fukushima and seven other prefectures in response to growing public fears over the safety of produce from the region. The fisheries vice-minister, Son Jae-hak, told reporters that the ban would stay in place indefinitely, adding that Japanese authorities had failed to provide timely and detailed information about the water leaks. South Korea imported 5,000 tonnes of fish from the affected region last year, including stocks from Aomori in the far north, to Chiba, located east of Tokyo. Despite assurances by Japan that it rigorously tests food for radiation, China has also maintained a ban on dairy, vegetable and seafood imports from several prefectures, including Fukushima, since March 2011. &quot;We have provided the South Korean government with relevant information since the contaminated water leaks,&quot; the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said . &quot;We will continue to ask South Korea to take measures based on scientific facts.&quot; In a statement carried by the Yonhap news agency, South Korea&apos;s fisheries ministry said the ban had been necessary &quot;as the government concluded that it is unclear how the incident in Japan will progress in the future and that the information the Japanese government has provided so far is not enough to predict future developments&quot;. The impact from the recent water leaks was being felt as far away as Buenos Aires, where Japanese officials were besieged by questions about Fukushima ahead of the IOC&apos;s decisive vote. Hiroshi Hase, an MP and former Olympic wrestler, told reporters in the Argentinian capital that contamination from Fukushima was &quot;not even an issue&quot; for the health of people in Tokyo, located 150 miles south of Fukushima Daiichi.     A Tepco employee in protective clothing works around water tanks at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in June. Photograph: Noboru Hashimoto/EPA    With the IOC decision imminent, Shunichi Tanaka, chairman of Japan&apos;s nuclear regulation authority, criticised Tepco for inflating fears around the world by releasing misleading data about the water leaks. Earlier this week, the utility said it had detected measured radiation of 2,200 millisieverts an hour at a hotspot near a water tank. Tanaka said the measurement was misleading, and had prompted alarmist reports in the domestic and international media. &quot;What Tepco is talking about is the level of contamination,&quot; he said, &quot;So to describe it with the unit &apos;millisieverts per hour&apos; is scientifically unacceptable. It&apos;s like describing how much something weighs by using centimetres.&quot; He said Tepco should have used the unit becquerel, which signifies the radioactivity levels in the water itself rather than the potential human exposure levels. &quot;I have come to think they need to be spoon fed,&quot; Tanaka said of Tepco. &quot;It is regrettable that Tepco has caused confusion and fear in the international community by spreading misleading information.&quot; The 2,200-millisievert an hour reading, confirmed by Tepco, is accurate, however. The firm has been at pains to point out that most of the radiation was emitted as beta rays \u2013 as opposed to far more dangerous gamma rays \u2013 which travel only short distances and are easily blocked by protective clothing. Concern has been voiced over the danger posed to the health of nuclear workers. Until recently, only two workers were responsible for checking the water tanks, and devices used to measure radiation have had to be replaced because they could not detect radiation levels of more than 100 millisieverts an hour. The number of workers checking the tanks has since been increased to almost 100, Tepco said. Tanaka said reports that the water leaks represented another catastrophe at the plant had been overblown, adding that the quantity of radiation leaking into the Pacific Ocean would have &quot;no meaningful effect&quot; on the environment.     Officials from the Tokyo 2020 Olympic bid in Buenos Aires. Japan has been accused of providing misleading information over radiation levels so as not to disrupt the city's candidacy. Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images    Criticism of Tepco&apos;s failure to to deal with the buildup of huge quantities of radioactive water at Fukushima Daiichi has intensified since its belated admission last month that the plant was leaching 300 tonnes of contaminated water into the ocean every day. The cleanup operation has been further blighted by leaks from water storage tanks and high levels of radiation. About 1,000 tanks containing a total of 335,000 tonnes of water have been built behind the plant, but efforts to remove dangerous radioactive substances from the water have been held up by technical glitches. Earlier this week, Tanaka offered assurances that the stored water would not be discharged into the sea unless radiation levels had been brought down to legally acceptable levels. Coolant water that is being pumped into the wrecked reactors becomes contaminated when it comes into contact with melted uranium fuel. It then mixes with groundwater flowing in from the hills behind the plant, requiring workers to pump out and store an estimated 400 tonnes of the toxic liquid every day. This week, the Japanese government announced almost 50bn yen (\u00a3320m) in emergency funds to build a frozen underground barrier to prevent groundwater from leaking into the reactor basements, and to develop a reliable water treatment system."}, {"sentences": ["On Saturday night, the 104 International Olympic Committee members will choose between the bookmaker&apos;s favourite Tokyo, the increasingly strongly fancied Madrid, and early frontrunner Istanbul to host the 2020 Games.", "Madrid has had to work hard to escape the shadow of the financial crisis in Spain, while Tokyo has been hobbled at the last by the issue of new leaks of radioactive water from the Fukushima plant.", "Informed speculation in the Hilton lobby suggested the result would be close between Tokyo and Madrid, with the decision likely to come down to a handful of second preference votes.", "Tokyo governor Naoki Inose, the city&apos;s equivalent of Boris Johnson who has proved both asset and liability during the race, promised to inject the note of passion previous Tokyo bids have lacked.", "&quot;The radiation level in Tokyo is no different to London, New York or Paris.&quot; Istanbul, meanwhile, has been beset by a range of issues since events in Taksim Square robbed it of early momentum.", "Madrid has promised to deliver a cut-price Games while Tokyo has emphasised its certainty and safety."], "tags": ["Tokyo Olympic Games 2020", "Olympic Games", "Sport", "Argentina", "Japan", "Spain", "Turkey", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-06T17:55:47Z", "title": "2020 Olympics: the race is on", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/06/2020-olympics-bid-decision", "article": "The five-ringed circus has landed in the heart of the Argentinian capital for the most important meeting of sport&apos;s power brokers in a generation, as prime ministers and princes scrabble to secure the 2020 Olympics. The finest restaurants and hotels of Buenos Aires have been humming with fevered speculation, before four days that will set the course for the Olympic movement over the next 12 years in three key votes. On Saturday night, the 104 International Olympic Committee members will choose between the bookmaker&apos;s favourite Tokyo, the increasingly strongly fancied Madrid, and early frontrunner Istanbul to host the 2020 Games. More than 1,700 accredited media, including 600 from Japan alone, have descended to cover the bunfight. On Sunday they will either readmit wrestling to the 2020 Olympic programme or vote in squash or a joint bid from baseball/softball. Finally, on Tuesday, they will choose a replacement for the long-serving IOC president Jacques Rogge, arguably the most powerful job in world sport. In the space of a few hundred yards, between La Casa Rosada and the Hilton hotel on the banks of the redeveloped docks, Buenos Aires has been transformed from a bustling capital to a militarised zone. All traffic has been banished and airport-style search points installed every few yards. Meanwhile paranoia over the deals being struck and the promises being made stalks the corridors, lobbies and meeting rooms of the city&apos;s finer hotels. All three bidders are saddled by serious issues. Madrid has had to work hard to escape the shadow of the financial crisis in Spain, while Tokyo has been hobbled at the last by the issue of new leaks of radioactive water from the Fukushima plant. Istanbul&apos;s bid has lost momentum since the global spotlight on the Taksim Square protests combined with doping issues and its proximity to Syria stalled progress. Amid a final swirl of press conferences, publicity stunts and preparations for the arrivals of the prime ministers of all three remaining bidding countries, last-minute nerves mix with repeated reminders that the race can still be won or lost in the final hours. Alejandro Blanco, the president of the Madrid 2020 bid, said: &quot;We are optimistic, we are also realistic. The big strength of Madrid&apos;s bid is that we already have 80% of the infrastructure. It&apos;s in line with the current times in societies all over the world.&quot; Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Mariano Rajoy, prime minister of Spain, will fly in from the G20 summit hoping to replicate the positive effect that Tony Blair had on London&apos;s bid in 2005 and the boost that then Brazilian president Lula gave Rio in 2009. But political interventions can backfire. President Barack Obama was humiliated four years ago in Copenhagen when he swooped in to press the case for Chicago, only to see it eliminated in the opening round. Informed speculation in the Hilton lobby suggested the result would be close between Tokyo and Madrid, with the decision likely to come down to a handful of second preference votes. The final presentations, traditionally a weak suit for both in previous failed bids, will be key. The Japanese delegation is hoping the urbane Princess Hisako of Takamado will impress, while Madrid will deploy its own royal asset, Prince Felipe. &quot;I think IOC members will listen to the last minute of the last presentation. Some votes may change depending on what the final presentations say. No one can stop working,&quot; said Blanco. Tokyo governor Naoki Inose, the city&apos;s equivalent of Boris Johnson who has proved both asset and liability during the race, promised to inject the note of passion previous Tokyo bids have lacked. &quot;I feel just like an Olympian. I feel like an athlete before going into an arena,&quot; he said. &quot;We will be hitting the peak during our final presentation.&quot; As ever, factors other than the relative merits of the candidates will come into play. IOC members from European countries hoping to bid for the 2024 Games, for example, are unlikely to back Madrid. With bids from Doha and Baku struck from the shortlist at an early stage and Rome having dropped out due to the financial crisis in Italy, just three cities remain. Rogge has dismissed concerns that that represents a weakening in demand, but there is a sense that all three are collapsing over the line rather than surging through the tape. Inose was again faced with questions about the leaks from the Fukushima plant and a government representative was drafted in to explain recent action. &quot;The government has taken responsibility. The point is that there is so much rumour covering the entire media. That is an issue,&quot; said Inose. &quot;The radiation level in Tokyo is no different to London, New York or Paris.&quot; Istanbul, meanwhile, has been beset by a range of issues since events in Taksim Square robbed it of early momentum. A delegation of teenage sporting ambassadors unveiled to highlight Turkey&apos;s youthful population was instead forced to answer questions on heavy-handed policing. &quot;I&apos;m not sad about the fact that these questions are raised because the Games are organised in something that is not a vacuum,&quot; said Rogge in his final press conference as IOC president. All three bids have learned lessons from London and Rio. A focus on youth and often nebulous &quot;legacy&quot; goals is now de rigueur. But a new concentration on austerity has also come to the fore. Madrid has promised to deliver a cut-price Games while Tokyo has emphasised its certainty and safety. Much of the talk among IOC members, and the six candidates to replace Rogge, is around how to make the Games more affordable. Even Istanbul, which is closest to the expansive vision of Rio, has been downplaying its ambition in the final stages in favour of its low unemployment figures and economic strength. &quot;We have one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in Europe. Turkey&apos;s youth are our strongest motivation, our greatest national resource,&quot; said bid leader Hasan Arat. For many of the IOC members, the main event comes on Tuesday when they will vote for the man who will become the most powerful in world sport. Of the six, the German Thomas Bach has long been considered Rogge&apos;s heir apparent but the Singaporean IOC vice-president, Ng Ser Miang, has mounted a strong challenge and is considered a threat if those who want to see a non-European in the job unite behind him. Rogge, the gnomic but well liked Belgian former Olympic sailor, has steered a steady course for the past dozen years. After rehabilitating the IOC following the Salt Lake City bribes-for-votes scandal, he has mended a debilitating row with the US Olympic Committee, increased the organisation&apos;s cash pile from $90m to $900m, and overseen a sequence of successful Games in Beijing, Vancouver and London. But as Rogge&apos;s tenure comes to a close, there is a nervousness about what is to come among the collection of international sports leaders and minor royalty that make up the IOC membership ahead of greater challenges in Sochi and Rio. In the lobby of the Hilton, there is less bonhomie and backslapping and more awkward smiles and tension as members try to work out whether they are backing the right horse for the presidency. Characteristically, Rogge said he was bowing out &quot;without any nostalgia&quot;. &quot;I did my duty,&quot; he said. &quot;I did what I had to do. If it has benefited the IOC, I&apos;m happy.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo Claimed cost \u00a35.45bn The pitch A safe pair of hands that will deliver &quot;certainty in uncertain times&quot;."], "tags": ["Tokyo Olympic Games 2020", "Olympic Games", "International Olympic Committee", "Japan", "Turkey", "Spain", "Sport", "Asia Pacific", "Europe", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-06T18:28:27Z", "title": "2020 Olympics: the contenders", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/06/2020-olympics-madrid-tokyo-istanbul", "article": "Madrid Claimed cost \u00a32.6bn on staging the Games, \u00a31.6bn on infrastructure investment.

Plays well to the IOC obsession with youth, with nearly 50% of the population aged 25 or less. Cons The media glare on the Taksim Square protests could not have been worse timed, offering the world the opposite vision of Turkey to the one intended by the bid team. Recent doping scandals and the country&apos;s proximity to events in Syria have not helped either.

The intervention from Shinzo Abe helped the Japanese capital defeat Madrid and Istanbul in the race to host the Games after a campaign in which each of the three faced major economic or political challenges. A princess who rarely leaves Japan and a promise to combine fiscal responsibility with a passionate welcome also helped Tokyo win after two previous consecutive bid failures. There was drama when Madrid and Istanbul tied in the first round of voting, forcing a tie break among the 94 voters that ended with a narrow victory for the Turkish city. That left Tokyo&apos;s &quot;safe pair of hands&quot; up against Istanbul&apos;s expansive vision to unite east and west on the banks of the Bosphorus in the final round of voting, with the Japanese bid winning comprehensively by 60 votes to 36. IOC president Jacques Rogge, who will stand down on Tuesday after 12 years, congratulated Tokyo on its &quot;excellent bid&quot; and &quot;comprehensive&quot; victory. The Japanese capital, which last hosted the Games in 1964, had been the favourite to win during a turbulent bidding race in which the chances of the three candidates waxed and waned at various points. &quot;Here in Buenos Aires, we have received many voices of support and felt the passion from people in Japan.

The eruption of joy and tears from the Tokyo team in Buenos Aires, and the hundreds of Japanese media, was in stark contrast to the despair felt on the streets of Madrid and among the Istanbul delegation. Some supporters of the Spanish bid were furious. Tennis player Feliciano Lopez said it was a &quot;disgraceful decision&quot; that showed the IOC had &quot;no regard for fair play and values all other interests above sport&quot;. A combination of its promise to provide a safe harbour in turbulent economic times was considered a vote winner for Tokyo, but it was also able to demonstrate that its Games would be a passionate and fun-filled affair in an emotional final presentation. Previous Tokyo bids had been lauded for their practicality but lacked the warmth that propelled London&apos;s legacy-centric pitch to victory in 2005 and Rio to success in 2009. On both occasions, Tokyo also bid. Going into the last week, Tokyo was the strong favourite but its chances were undermined by ill-timed reports of new leaks at the power plant in Fukushima that was hit by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. On the back foot, the delegation was considered slow to respond, while Madrid seized the momentum through the charm of Crown Prince Felipe and its pitch to hold a low-cost Games in austere times. But Abe dealt with the issue head on and insisted &quot;emphatically and unequivocally&quot; that the radiation leaks had been contained and would pose no health risk. &quot;I ask you read through the headlines and appraise the true situation,&quot; he said. &quot;There have been no health-related problems, nor will there be in the future. I shall take responsibility.&quot; Abe charmed the IOC members with his memories of the opening ceremony of the 1964 Games, seen as a key moment in Japan&apos;s postwar history, and assurances the bid was economically sound. He said afterwards that staging the Games would allow Japan to repay the world for the assistance it gave the country in the wake of the natural disaster. Tokyo&apos;s presentation began with a surprise \u2013 the appearance of Princess Takamado, a Cambridge-educated member of the royal family who rarely leaves the country for reasons of protocol. She was followed by Paralympic long jumper Mami Sato, whose home town was hit by the tsunami, and powerfully described the power of sport to inspire. Sato, who lost her right leg to cancer at 19, described how 200 athletes visited areas affected by the tsunami to visit thousands of children. &quot;What we have seen is the impact of the Olympic values as never before in Japan. And what the country has witnessed is that those precious values \u2013 excellence, friendship and respect \u2013 can be so much more than just words,&quot; she said. Madrid attempted to trump Tokyo&apos;s royal card with one of its own but was narrowly defeated in a shock first round result. Prince Felipe, who competed as a sailor at the 1992 Barcelona Games, repeated the mantra that Madrid&apos;s bid &quot;made sense&quot; because 80% of the venues were already built. All three bidding cities replicated to a greater or lesser extent the model minted by London in Singapore in 2005, combining photogenic sports stars, a delegation of young people and glossy films designed to underscore ambition and certainty. But all faced major issues. Tokyo had to reassure voters in the face of alarming headlines about radioactive leaks, Madrid had to convince that its broken economy would not hobble its plans and Istanbul faced a string of problems including the reaction to the Taksim Square protests and a spate of doping scandals. The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, attempted to convince the IOC members that they should bring the event to &quot;the land of youth in the city of tolerance and peace&quot; for a Games that would &quot;truly embody the human spirit&quot;, but to no avail."}, {"sentences": ["When Tokyo first hosted the Olympics in 1964, it was seen as a coming out party for a country recovering from the ravages of war and reinventing itself as a peaceful economic powerhouse.", "Previous Tokyo bids had been praised for their competence but criticised for lacking passion.", "Tokyo will be the great host of a wonderful party,&quot; said Christel Takigawa, a Japanese television anchor chosen to underline the message that, like London, Tokyo will be able to put on a show in the heart of the city.", "Like London, Tokyo promises a &quot;compact Games&quot;, with 85% of the venues within 8km, and emphasised its transport infrastructure and friendly welcome.", "But far more important than bricks and mortar in securing Tokyo&apos;s victory was the bid team&apos;s ability to prove that the Japanese are passionate about hosting the Games.", "&quot;Last summer, more than 500,000 took to the streets of Tokyo \u2013 on a weekday \u2013 to celebrate with us London 2012 athletes,&quot; he told the IOC delegates.", "Tokyo will deliver an incredible platform for the promotion of the Olympic movement.&quot; Just as London promised an &quot;athlete-centric&quot; Games, with the Olympic Village in easy reach of all the venues, Tokyo promises to take the concept a stage further.", "The Village will be situated in Tokyo Bay, where most of the major venues will be sited.", "Afterwards, Japanese IOC member Tsunekazu Takeda said he hoped the Tokyo vision would appeal to athletes and inspire a passionate groundswell of support from the public, just as London did last summer.", "Tokyo has committed to a guaranteed fund of $4.5bn to build 10 new permanent venues, a promise that had clear appeal given the global economic picture.", "&quot;Tokyo 2020 offers a gateway to the vast, young continent of Asia,&quot; said bid leader Masato Mizuno.", "&quot;Home to more than four billion people,\u00a0including more than one billion young people.&quot; But to succeed, Tokyo had to appeal to the hearts as well as to the heads of the voting IOC members, and prove it could rival the passion on show in London and hoped for in Rio.", "But Tokyo&apos;s persistence \u2013 this was its third consecutive bid \u2013 and willingness to learn from earlier mistakes bodes well for the 2020 Games.", "Like London&apos;s expertly pitched bid in 2005, Tokyo pushed all the right buttons emotionally as well as technically after a race in which all the candidates faltered at one time or another.", "The emotional punch underpinning Tokyo&apos;s campaign was summed up by the Paralympic long jumper Sato, whose hometown was hit by the tsunami, and who powerfully described the power of sport to inspire.", "The Tokyo bid allowed the IOC to have their cake and eat it, choosing a bid that had emotional appeal but was also underscored by financial certainty.", "A clearly delighted Abe, who played a key role in downplaying fears over the radioactive leaks in Fukushima, said: &quot;When I heard the name Tokyo I got really emotional and I got so touched, overwhelmed.", "That joy was greater than when I was elected in my own election.&quot; The challenge for Tokyo now, having won the right to host the Games at the third attempt, will be to transform those plans into reality.", "Dry to the last, the outgoing IOC president Jacques Rogge even permitted himself a rare joke: &quot;Tokyo prevailed on the excellent quality of a very well constructed bid."], "tags": ["Tokyo Olympic Games 2020", "Olympic Games", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-07T22:34:53Z", "title": "Japanese bid's passion earns Tokyo the 2020 Olympic Games", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/07/tokyo-2020-olympic-games", "article": "When Tokyo first hosted the Olympics in 1964, it was seen as a coming out party for a country recovering from the ravages of war and reinventing itself as a peaceful economic powerhouse. Those behind the successful 2020 bid hope their Games will have a similarly transformative effect on the world&apos;s view of their city and help to galvanise a nation recovering from the trauma of the 2011 tsunami. The two will be linked by the $1bn (\u00a30.6bn) revamp of the 1964 National Olympic Stadium under a striking Zaha Hadid design. Previous Tokyo bids had been praised for their competence but criticised for lacking passion. That was not an accusation that could be levelled at them this time, with the urbane Princess Takamodo breaking with royal protocol to travel to Buenos Aires and lobby on behalf of the bid, and Mami Sato \u2013 a Paralympic athlete who saw her hometown devastated by the tsunami \u2013 delivering poise and passion. &quot;We offer dynamism and excitement on one side, and harmony and peace on the other. Tokyo will be the great host of a wonderful party,&quot; said Christel Takigawa, a Japanese television anchor chosen to underline the message that, like London, Tokyo will be able to put on a show in the heart of the city. The buildup to its presentation had been designed to underline the notion that it offered &quot;certainty in uncertain times&quot; and was a &quot;safe pair of hands&quot; for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in light of the potential challenges posed by the winter Games in Sochi and the 2016 Olympics in Rio. The Russians have spent $51bn (\u00a333bn) building a winter resort in the\u00a0warmest part of the country and are facing calls for a boycott over new anti-gay laws, while there is mounting concern among IOC insiders about the amount of work Rio has to do to be ready by 2016. Like London, Tokyo promises a &quot;compact Games&quot;, with 85% of the venues within 8km, and emphasised its transport infrastructure and friendly welcome. The centrepiece of the venue plan is Hadid&apos;s striking new Kasumigaoka National Stadium, the construction of which will begin in 2015 and be ready in time to host the 2019 Rugby World Cup. But far more important than bricks and mortar in securing Tokyo&apos;s victory was the bid team&apos;s ability to prove that the Japanese are passionate about hosting the Games. Public approval ratings were far higher than for previous failed bids and the fencer Yuki Ota pointed to the surge of popular support for Japanese athletes in the wake of the London 2012 Games, which some have linked to the recovery process from the tsunami. &quot;Last summer, more than 500,000 took to the streets of Tokyo \u2013 on a weekday \u2013 to celebrate with us London 2012 athletes,&quot; he told the IOC delegates. &quot;Just look at the pictures and imagine that passion in 2020. Every venue will be filled. Every sport will sparkle. Tokyo will deliver an incredible platform for the promotion of the Olympic movement.&quot; Just as London promised an &quot;athlete-centric&quot; Games, with the Olympic Village in easy reach of all the venues, Tokyo promises to take the concept a stage further. The Village will be situated in Tokyo Bay, where most of the major venues will be sited. It has committed to a guaranteed fund of $4.5bn to build 10 new permanent venues, a promise that had clear appeal given the global economic picture. Afterwards, Japanese IOC member Tsunekazu Takeda said he hoped the Tokyo vision would appeal to athletes and inspire a passionate groundswell of support from the public, just as London did last summer. Tokyo has committed to a guaranteed fund of $4.5bn to build 10 new permanent venues, a promise that had clear appeal given the global economic picture. And, like London, it emphasised its appeal to youth. &quot;Tokyo 2020 offers a gateway to the vast, young continent of Asia,&quot; said bid leader Masato Mizuno. &quot;Home to more than four billion people,\u00a0including more than one billion young people.&quot; But to succeed, Tokyo had to appeal to the hearts as well as to the heads of the voting IOC members, and prove it could rival the passion on show in London and hoped for in Rio. To do so, it dialled down the emphasis on its commercial appeal and technological prowess \u2013 presumably assuming IOC members would already make those associations \u2013 and concentrated on its weak points. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, also made a smart move in emphasising the influence of Japan&apos;s youthful population and promising to establish a global scheme to take the &quot;power of sport&quot; to other countries through a network of young volunteers. The bid even had a &quot;cool ambassador&quot; in the shape of Takigawa, specifically appointed to underline Japan&apos;s cultural appeal and contribution to youth culture. For an Olympic movement constantly looking to new horizons, it may be a novel experience to go back to the future. But Tokyo&apos;s persistence \u2013 this was its third consecutive bid \u2013 and willingness to learn from earlier mistakes bodes well for the 2020 Games. Like London&apos;s expertly pitched bid in 2005, Tokyo pushed all the right buttons emotionally as well as technically after a race in which all the candidates faltered at one time or another. The emotional punch underpinning Tokyo&apos;s campaign was summed up by the Paralympic long jumper Sato, whose hometown was hit by the tsunami, and who powerfully described the power of sport to inspire. Sato, who lost her right leg because of cancer at 19, described how 200 athletes visited areas affected by the tsunami to engage with thousands of children in the area. The Tokyo bid allowed the IOC to have their cake and eat it, choosing a bid that had emotional appeal but was also underscored by financial certainty. A clearly delighted Abe, who played a key role in downplaying fears over the radioactive leaks in Fukushima, said: &quot;When I heard the name Tokyo I got really emotional and I got so touched, overwhelmed. That joy was greater than when I was elected in my own election.&quot; The challenge for Tokyo now, having won the right to host the Games at the third attempt, will be to transform those plans into reality. Dry to the last, the outgoing IOC president Jacques Rogge even permitted himself a rare joke: &quot;Tokyo prevailed on the excellent quality of a very well constructed bid. You have described yourselves as a safe pair of hands. As a surgeon this is something that appeals to me.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The leaders of the victorious Tokyo 2020 bid team said on Saturday night that they hoped to replicate the &quot;passion&quot; and excitement of London 2012 after winning the race to host the Games.", "Tokyo, like London, offers a city already established on the world stage the opportunity to recast itself in the eyes of the world and its own public.", "Previous Tokyo bids have been accused of lacking passion, but an impressive final presentation and survey figures underlined the desire to win the prize at the third consecutive attempt.", "A passionate Olympic Games is something we would like to replicate in the Tokyo in 2020.&quot; The IOC president, Jacques Rogge, who will step down on Tuesday after 12 years in the role, said: &quot;The Games over the last 10 years have put the athletes at the centre of attention and I&apos;m quite sure that is what Tokyo will do as well.&quot; The Madrid and Istanbul delegations both faced tough questions over their doping record.", "&quot;But it is very difficult to assess whether it has played a major role in the decision itself.&quot; He said the appeal of the Tokyo bid to IOC members was clear.", "&quot;Tokyo prevailed on the excellent quality of a very well-constructed bid."], "tags": ["Tokyo Olympic Games 2020", "Olympic Games", "International Olympic Committee", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-07T23:09:47Z", "title": "Tokyo hope to replicate passion of London after winning 2020 Games", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/08/tokyo-2020-olympic-games", "article": "The leaders of the victorious Tokyo 2020 bid team said on Saturday night that they hoped to replicate the &quot;passion&quot; and excitement of London 2012 after winning the race to host the Games.

Spain has had to deal with the fallout from the Dr Fuentes trial and more than 30 Turkish athletes have tested positive in recent months. &quot;It is clear the IOC members pay a lot of attention to the situation in the fight against doping,&quot; said Rogge. &quot;But it is very difficult to assess whether it has played a major role in the decision itself.&quot; He said the appeal of the Tokyo bid to IOC members was clear. &quot;Tokyo prevailed on the excellent quality of a very well-constructed bid.

In the two and a half years since a tsunami on Japan&apos;s north-east coast killed almost 19,000 people and made hundreds of thousands homeless, the recovery effort has been blighted by bureaucratic bungling and a lack of leadership. Some among the 160,000 people who were forced to evacuate after the tsunami triggered a triple meltdown in Fukushima plant said the billions of dollars earmarked for Tokyo 2020 would be better spent on fixing the leaks and decontaminating their irradiated home towns. Repeated official assurances that Tokyo is safe &quot;only serve to show that the situation in Fukushima is serious&quot;, a woman who was evacuated from Fukushima to Tokyo told the Mainichi Shimbun before the vote.     People spell out the words 'thank you' at the Tokyo metropolitan government building. Photograph: Kyodo/Reuters    Last month, the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, admitted that about 300 tonnes of contaminated groundwater were flowing into the Pacific every day. Then, in what some feared could deal a decisive blow to Tokyo&apos;s Olympic prospects, news emerged of more leaks from several tanks used to store contaminated water. The 1964 Tokyo Games, held less than 20 years after Japan&apos;s defeat in the second world war, signalled the country&apos;s emergence from the shadow of militarist misadventure and the start of a period of rapid economic growth. Some have questioned Tokyo&apos;s decision to bid again after unsuccessful attempts for the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, given the size of Japan&apos;s public debt \u2013 now more than twice the size of its $6tn economy. The Tokyo Olympics will use refurbished venues and several new sports arenas. Along with infrastructure projects, the bill has been estimated at just under $8bn (\u00a35.1bn). The city already has $4.5bn in an Olympic reserve fund. Hosting the 2020 Games could produce positive economic effects of more than $40bn and create more than 150,000 jobs, according to SMBC Nikko Securities. Japanese companies will benefit from rising demand in the construction sector, with an expected boom in sales of consumer electronics and other items. The government hopes to attract 8.5 million tourists during the event.     The Japanese delegation celebrates in Buenos Aires after Tokyo won the bid to host the 2020 Olympic Games. Photograph: Xinhua/Landov/Barcroft Media    In response to concern about finances, bid officials promised a compact &quot;downtown Games&quot; with most of the venues located close to the athletes&apos; village. The events will centre on the main Olympic stadium \u2013 a futuristic 80,000-seat arena due for completion in time for the rugby World Cup in 2019. While doubts linger about Japan&apos;s ability to clean up the Fukushima plant, there is no questioning the country&apos;s Olympic pedigree: the Winter Games came to Sapporo in 1972, and to Nagano in 1998. New stadium When the Olympic Games in Tokyo is declared open, the ceremony will take place in a striking stadium designed by British architect Zaha Hadid. The $1bn stadium, which has a retractable roof, has been described as a cross between a giant bicycle helmet and an alien spacecraft and will provide a common link between the London 2012 and Tokyo 2020. While much of\u00a0Tokyo&apos;s bid stressed the certainty and safety of its plans, commissioning Hadid to redesign the Kasumigaoka national stadium was a bold statement, closer in scale of ambition to Beijing&apos;s iconic Bird&apos;s Nest than London&apos;s pared-down design. Hadid, whose signature curves and bold designs adorn a growing range of cities from Beijing to Baku, also designed the undulating \u00a3251m Aquatics Centre for the London Games. The venue, which spiralled in cost due to the ambitious design, incorporated temporary wings on either side that have now been removed. Construction is due to begin in 2015.The original stadium, now almost 50 years old, hosted the 1964 Olympics. &quot;The design is both light and cohesive, seamlessly connecting the stadium&apos;s different elements to create a silhouette that integrates with the city,&quot; Hadid said when she won the commission. The architect was not the only British link to the Tokyo bid. A company founded by consultant Nick Varley, who worked on earlier successful bids for London and Rio, co-ordinated the presentation, speeches and bid literature that were a key component in Tokyo&apos;s success after two previous bid failures.

A German TV documentary last week accused Bach of cheating when he was an Olympic fencer more than 40 years ago by employing a wet glove to fool the electronic scoring system, risking a breach of the IOC&apos;s rules by allowing an influential sheikh to lobby members on his behalf and appearing in Stasi files as part of a scheme to peddle influence when working at Adidas in the 1980s. A spokesman for Bach, who has been an influential figure in IOC circles since the mid-1990s andis strong favourite to succeed Rogge in Tuesday&apos;s vote, said the claims were &quot;nonsense&quot;. Bach said he had &quot;nothing further to add&quot;. The IOC vice president, one of six candidates to replace Rogge and the strong favourite, is believed to have taken legal advice over the claims. The German won a gold medal in 1976 as part of the team foil fencing team but the documentary featured an anonymous former opponent who claimed that Bach cheated as a young sportsman in the early 1970s by using a wet glove to fool the electronic scoring system. &quot;I watched Bach come over and grab a plastic bag that held a new glove. I sat next to it. The glove was also wet. In my opinion the glove had been manipulated,&quot; claimed his accuser. Bach was also close to Horst Dassler, who wielded huge power during the period when Juan Antonio Samaranch was turning the Olympics into the commercial powerhouse it has become. The documentary accused Bach of being involved in paying inducements to sports teams and players to increase the brand&apos;s exposure. While such payments were not illegal at the time, they would have been under legislation brought in by Germany in 2002. Bach is believed to be untroubled by the allegations, which are unlikely to hinder his election chances before Tuesday&apos;s vote but jar sharply with the rhetoric of fair play espoused by all the candidates. The most damaging may be the claims that on the surface appear the most innocuous. Bach&apos;s campaign is being backed by Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah, a member of the Kuwaiti royal family who is an increasingly influential figure in IOC circles. He backed Tokyo&apos;s bid for the 2020 Games and received a hero&apos;s welcome at their victory party on Saturday night and is also believed to have helped wrestling&apos;s bid to retain its Olympic status. In the documentary, he is open about his support for Bach and his intention to rally support for his campaign. The sheikh appears speaking at length about his backing for Bach, support which appears to breach IOC rules preventing members from publicly campaigning for a presidential candidate."}, {"sentences": ["While Tokyo&apos;s team emphasised their clean record in Olympic Games, Spain has been hit by controversy over the Operation Puerto trial and the judge&apos;s subsequent ruling that evidence should be destroyed.", "&quot;Athletes had asked me not to vote for Madrid because of the Puerto situation \u2013 and I asked what would they say to those athletes who were potentially cheated out of success by those anonymous bags and no, I didn&apos;t get a clear answer on that,&quot; said Pengilly, who said the other key issue that needed an answer was Tokyo&apos;s stance on the ongoing fall-out from the Fukushima nuclear disaster.", "He said it was unclear how much impact the doping issues had on the final vote, which Tokyo won emphatically."], "tags": ["Tokyo Olympic Games 2020", "International Olympic Committee", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-08T20:26:00Z", "title": "Adam Pengilly challenges Madrid and Istanbul Olympic bids on drugs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/08/olympic-games-2020-tokyo-madrid-istanbul", "article": "The British International Olympic Committee member who raised the serious doping issues faced by Spain and Turkey during their 2020 bid presentations has said some athletes urged him not to vote for Madrid or Istanbul over the issue. Adam Pengilly, a former skeleton racer who was voted on to the IOC athletes&apos; commission in 2010, asked tough questions of the Madrid and Istanbul delegations following their presentations to the IOC on Saturday. While Tokyo&apos;s team emphasised their clean record in Olympic Games, Spain has been hit by controversy over the Operation Puerto trial and the judge&apos;s subsequent ruling that evidence should be destroyed. Meanwhile more than 30 Turkish athletes have tested positive in recent months as the country attempts to get to grips with the problem. &quot;Athletes had asked me not to vote for Madrid because of the Puerto situation \u2013 and I asked what would they say to those athletes who were potentially cheated out of success by those anonymous bags and no, I didn&apos;t get a clear answer on that,&quot; said Pengilly, who said the other key issue that needed an answer was Tokyo&apos;s stance on the ongoing fall-out from the Fukushima nuclear disaster. He said it was unclear how much impact the doping issues had on the final vote, which Tokyo won emphatically. But the departing IOC president, Jacques Rogge, said afterwards that doping was clearly a factor for some IOC members. Since a new Spanish government came to power 18 months ago it has vowed to get tough on doping but the courtroom decision to destroy the 200 blood bags used as evidence in the Dr Fuentes case has caused fury among clean athletes and frustrated anti-doping authorities. Pengilly said it is important that he raised difficult issues for the sake of the athletes he represents but said it was also important to be mindful of IOC protocol. &quot;There is that potential [to offend] and I am aware I have to be a bit delicate if I upset my fellow members, and we are like a family,&quot; he said. &quot;Then my relationship and influence would be diminished so there is a balance to be had in representing the people who elected me and being honest and frank and getting clear answers when we need them but doing it in a way that&apos;s not going to upset them.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["As wrestling was on Sunday celebrating a reprieve by the International Olympic Committee of a decision to drop it from the programme for the 2020 Games in Tokyo, questions were being asked over the tortuous decision-making process that got them there."], "tags": ["International Olympic Committee", "Wrestling", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-08T20:45:00Z", "title": "Wrestling wriggles out of Olympic headlock and gets back into Games", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/08/olympic-wrestling-ioc-2020-games", "article": "It could well become a pub quiz question in years to come. Which Olympic contest pitted the actor Billy Baldwin against Fidel Castro&apos;s son and ended with a sport that has 3,000 years of Olympic history being dropped only to be reinstated months later? As wrestling was on Sunday celebrating a reprieve by the International Olympic Committee of a decision to drop it from the programme for the 2020 Games in Tokyo, questions were being asked over the tortuous decision-making process that got them there. IOC members voted to save wrestling over a joint bid from baseball and softball for re-admittance to the programme and a spirited pitch from squash. The vote, in which wrestling triumphed with 49 votes to softball/baseball&apos;s 24 and squash&apos;s 22, was the culmination of a 2\u00bd-year saga that was supposed to elect a new sport to the Olympics but ended up preserving the status quo. In February 2011, the IOC unveiled a list of seven sports that wanted to follow in the footsteps of golf and rugby sevens, which had been added to the programme for the 2016 Olympics. Two years later, wrestling was cast from the programme in a shock vote by the IOC executive board but the 104-strong IOC chose to reinstate it after a seven-month drive by the new federation president, Nenad Lalovic, to modernise the arcane rules and make it more attractive to casual fans. &quot;Wrestling is not a new sport but the wrestling we are presenting now is a new wrestling. What we tried to do is update our sport to make it more spectacular, more watchable and understandable,&quot; a triumphant Lalovic said. The original list of sports \u2013 squash, karate, roller sports, the Chinese martial art wushu, wakeboarding, softball/baseball, climbing \u2013 was whittled down to a shortlist of three in St Petersburg this year. At times, it appeared that the only ones benefitting from the seemingly never-ending process were the armies of lobbyists employed to campaign on behalf of the sports. Of those three, only squash would have been genuinely new to the Games. Wrestling had been ever present at all the modern Games but one and baseball/softball survived for five editions before being axed. &quot;The biggest value of this campaign was to modernise our sport and our federation. This crisis gave us the strength to change,&quot; said Lalovic. &quot;This is the most valuable experience for this journey.&quot; Baldwin had earlier joined Lalovic and athletes in the wrestling delegation while Antonio Castro, son of the former Cuba leader Fidel, was part of the pitch to add softball/baseball to the Games. Despite a compelling presentation that emphasised how the sport had been transformed as a spectator experience and underlining its global nature, squash failed for the third time in a row and trailed in last with 22 votes. World Squash Federation president N Ramachandran said the decision was &quot;heartbreaking&quot;. Yet even now the exhausting process may not be over. The new IOC president, due to be elected on Tuesday to replace Jacques Rogge after 12 years, is likely to take a fresh look at the whole sport programme, which could lead to a new opportunity for squash or baseball/softball."}, {"sentences": ["All would have been celebrating as International Olympic Committee members voted to retain its Olympic status for the 2020 Games in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Tokyo Olympic Games 2020", "International Olympic Committee", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-08T20:48:00Z", "title": "Wrestling retains Olympic grip but IOC grapples with flawed process", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/sep/08/wrestling-olympics-ioc-sports-2020", "article": "In Britain, wrestling still tends to conjure images of Big Daddy and belly flops or staged American razzmatazz. But in the rest of the world the Olympic version of the sport is hugely popular, uniting millions in countries as diverse as the US, Russia and Iran. All would have been celebrating as International Olympic Committee members voted to retain its Olympic status for the 2020 Games in Tokyo. But just as loud as the cheers from the victors were the questions from others over a process that has taken two and a half years and cost the campaigning sports a small fortune, only to come full circle. A process that was supposed to end with a new sport earning Olympic status ended with one of those most readily associated with the ancient Games in Olympia having to scrap for its life. The prospect of wrestling losing its status had been described as a &quot;crisis&quot; by the burly Serbian wrestling federation president Nenad Lalovic, who was brought in to radically overhaul the sport&apos;s presentation and governance after the IOC decided in March that it should be cast from its gilded tent. He has used the threat to its Olympic status to force through a host of changes and claimed that the result is almost like adding a new sport to the programme. In February 2011, the IOC executive board shortlisted seven sports for possible addition to the 2020 Games: squash, karate, roller sports, the Chinese martial art wushu, wakeboarding, softball/baseball and climbing. Like motor-boating, cricket, croquet and polo before them, they were chasing the status, income and profile that comes with being an Olympic sport. But when the IOC executive board then made the surprise decision to exclude wrestling from the list of &quot;core sports&quot; in February, it set in motion a chain of events that has left the thorough but sometimes baffling bureaucratic machinery of the IOC open to ridicule. After golf and rugby sevens were added to the programme for the Rio 2016 Olympics, for what were widely regarded as commercial and profile reasons and amid concern over whether a gold medal would represent the pinnacle of those sports, a new system was put in place to constantly review the programme. The idea was to encourage sports to constantly stay on their toes and look for new ways to showcase their appeal to spectators and television viewers, while capping the number of sports and athletes taking part in the Games. An abiding concern of Jacques Rogge&apos;s has been the size of the Games and he has capped the number of athletes at 10,500. In February, taekwondo and modern pentathlon were considered most at risk for the chop. But both sports mounted furious rearguard actions, the latter marshalled by Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, the son of the sometimes controversial former IOC president whose name is still revered in Olympic circles. Meanwhile wrestling, which has appeared in every Games bar one since the modern Olympics began in Athens in 1896 but can appear arcane and baffling to outsiders, was asleep on the job and found itself cast from the programme. As the charismatic Lalovic was celebrating with back slaps and bear hugs after Sunday&apos;s decision, the World Squash Federation president N Ramachandran was attempting to slip through the lobby of the hotel that the IOC has colonised without being seen. Squash&apos;s third consecutive failure was &quot;heartbreaking&quot;, he said, after a huge drive to overhaul the sport to make it more visually appealing, but he held out hope that a reprieve may yet be possible. Incredibly, the ludicrously long-winded process may not yet be over. The new IOC president, due to be selected from a shortlist of six on Tuesday, is expected to look again at the sports programme and could yet add another sport for 2020. &quot;As the only new Olympic sport on today&apos;s shortlist, we believed squash offered something for the future and I still hope that our inclusion may still be possible,&quot; said Ramachandran, who refused to criticise the convoluted process. Softball and baseball will take heart from the fact they ended with two more votes than squash and are also likely to try again for Olympic status. Softball president Don Porter wept on the podium as he described his efforts to get the sport into the Games for the sake of &quot;little boys and girls&quot; around the world. They had hoped that softball&apos;s more global appeal and popularity with both sexes would help counter perceptions that baseball suffers as an Olympic sport from a lack of global appeal. If the process is re-opened, it is likely to line up alongside squash again for another go, such are the rewards that Olympic status brings in terms of commercial income and government funding. The extent of the sports&apos; obsequious desire to be part of the five-ring circus means they dare not raise their voices against the processes that could get them there. But looking again at the convoluted system for bringing new sports into the fold, a fine principle in theory, should be high up the priority list for whoever replaces Rogge this week."}, {"sentences": ["The Olympics is a sporting event, but one of the biggest benefits of Tokyo being picked to host the 2020 Games is that it will introduce millions to what is one of the world&apos;s greatest cities.", "An intensely detailed cityscape, speedy Tokyo offers its greatest rewards to the leisurely, observant walker."], "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Japan holidays", "Asia", "Travel", "Sofia Coppola"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-08T21:36:05Z", "title": "In praise of \u2026 Tokyo | Editorial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/08/tokyo-in-praise-of-editorial", "article": "The Olympics is a sporting event, but one of the biggest benefits of Tokyo being picked to host the 2020 Games is that it will introduce millions to what is one of the world&apos;s greatest cities.

The Nikkei index jumped 2.5% in response to a rise in GDP from 0.6% in the three months to the end of June to a revised 0.9% that put the annualised rate at 3.8%. Analysts said the rocketing economy was testament to the new political regime under prime minister Shinzo Abe, who has given his name to the Abenomics shock treatment his administration has delivered to the economy following his election last year. Since October 2012 the Nikkei has soared from 8,500 to 15,000 before falling back to 13,500. In the last fortnight the index has regained some momentum and begun to head back towards 14,000 again. While the index is still well below the 38,000 it registered in the 1980s boom, and its pre-Lehmans crash peak of 18,100, the stock market rise over the last year is seen as an indication of Abe&apos;s determination to inject some life into the economy and spur growth. The upward revision in the last GDP figures appears to vindicate his policies \u2013 which have included appointing a new central bank governor with a remit to loosen monetary policy and backing from the finance ministry for large scale public infrastructure projects. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said it was clear that the world&apos;s third largest economy is heading in the right direction: &quot;The red carpet was rolled out last week for Japan&apos;s strengthened Q2 GDP figures when the Bank of Japan announced expectations for inflation are improving. &quot;But it is not the only sign of recovery as a result of Shinzo Abe&apos;s initial shock and awe approach. Amid strong indications that exports and fixed asset investments are picking up, public investment is rising and the housing sector looks even more robust.&quot; However, more detailed figures showed that Japan has become reliant on public and business investment when analysts were hoping for a revival in consumer spending. Private consumption was revised down from 0.8% to 0.7% quarter on quarter and consumer confidence slipped slightly. Capital Economics said consumers were cutting back on spending after becoming worried that wages will fail to keep pace with inflation. The latest Economic Watchers Survey offset good news from the manufacturing sector with a fifth consecutive drop in its index of current economic conditions from 52.3 in July to 51.2 in August."}, {"sentences": ["He was given a hero&apos;s welcome at Tokyo&apos;s victory party after his lobbying helped them to win the right to host the 2020 Games and he also backed wrestling&apos;s successful bid to regain its Olympic status."], "tags": ["International Olympic Committee", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-09T20:35:00Z", "title": "Thomas Bach of Germany is favourite to be elected IOC president", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/09/ioc-president-election-thomas-bach", "article": "To most they are grey men in suits but one of the six candidates standing to become the next president of the International Olympic Committee will on Tuesday become the most powerful figure in world sport. The German Thomas Bach, a 59-year-old former Adidas executive who joined the IOC in 1991 and has held a number of influential positions, has spent years preparing his run for the top job and remains the strong favourite to become the ninth president. &quot;After good training and some good test events you can feel confident but on the day of the grand final we&apos;re all starting from the same starting block,&quot; said Bach, a former Olympic fencer. &quot;That&apos;s an athlete&apos;s feeling. This is like preparing for an Olympic final.&quot; But amid a frantic round of last-ditch lobbying and manoeuvring in the meeting rooms of the Hilton Hotel in Buenos Aires where the IOC have been camped for a week, his five opponents were working together to see if he could be stopped. The most credible challengers to Bach, long seen as Jacques Rogge&apos;s heir apparent, are thought to be the Puerto Rican Richard Carrion and the Singaporean IOC vice president, Ng Ser Miang. Carrion has helped the IOC establish a strong financial position and recently signed a record $4.9bn (\u00a33.1bn) deal with NBC for exclusive American TV rights to the Olympic Games to 2020, though Ng is seen as the best option for those who would like a non-European to lead the movement. Their best hope is that the German favourite fails to poll more than 40 votes in the first round of voting among the 102 IOC members present and fails to gain a majority. Their hope is that support would then coalesce round one of the &quot;anyone but Bach&quot; candidates but that is likely to happen only if the vote goes to at least three rounds. The others standing for a job that is low in profile but arguably among the most powerful in not only sport but international affairs are the Swiss lawyer Denis Oswald, the former pole vaulter and IAAF vice-president Sergey Bubka and the international amateur boxing association president, Dr CK Wu. Bach, who has long been building support through a sophisticated lobbying effort and is well backed within the IOC executive board, has Sheikh Ahmad al-Sabah in his corner. The Kuwaiti sheikh is president of the powerful Association of National Olympic Committees that distributes nearly $400m of the IOC&apos;s money to national associations and is considered an increasingly influential figure. He helped Salman al-Khalifa secure the presidency of the Asian Football Confederation and Marius Vizer to the SportAccord leadership, as well as backing Buenos Aires&apos; successful Youth Olympic Games bid. The softly spoken Al-Sabah, accompanied by a retinue of minders, has been a very visible presence in Buenos Aires over recent days. He was given a hero&apos;s welcome at Tokyo&apos;s victory party after his lobbying helped them to win the right to host the 2020 Games and he also backed wrestling&apos;s successful bid to regain its Olympic status. The sheikh has admitted to supporting Bach and lobbying others on his behalf, which is a breach of the strict IOC protocol surrounding the presidential campaign. Bach&apos;s campaign has also been hit by a withering television documentary aired in his native Germany that made a number of allegations about his character and conduct. They included the suggestion that Bach, a gold medallist in the 1976 Games, cheated as a young fencer using a wet glove to disable the scoring system and that he was involved in paying inducements to sports stars when he was an Adidas executive in the 1980s. Bach&apos;s spokesman has called the claims &quot;nonsense&quot;. Various other factors were also at play amid the febrile swirl of rumours in the hotel lobby before the vote, as meetings with members went on behind closed doors. All candidates are standing on broadly similar manifestos that promise to build on the steady foundations established by Rogge. They all promise to reduce the cost of bidding for and hosting the Games, to continue Rogge&apos;s drive to connect with a new generation, to crack down on doping and illegal betting and to play a greater role in sports policy around the world. Lord Coe, in Buenos Aires to deliver London 2012&apos;s final report to the IOC, said that the focus on youth, a favourite trope of all six candidates, was key. &quot;A new president has to really figure out just how we connect with young people,&quot; he said. &quot;Young people, particularly young people under the age of 30, are deeply suspicious of institutions that my generation at worst thought were benign and at best were virtuous and on our side.&quot; Bach said it was important that the IOC did not stand still. &quot;The world is changing. This is not about standing still, this is about not falling behind. Then we lose our relevance. We have to change and can change. This is not a real revolution but adapting to the times.&quot; Rogge, a Belgian former Olympic sailor who has been head of the IOC for 12 years, is widely credited with re-establishing the IOC&apos;s credibility in the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. He also refreshed its image in the wake of the long and often controversial tenure of Juan Antonio Samaranch, whose influence in modernising and commercialising the Games and increasing still casts a long shadow over the movement. He is also credited with putting it on a firm financial footing over a series of successful Games in Beijing, Vancouver and London that have increased its cash reserves ten-fold to $900m. Oswald told Swiss radio on Sunday that he would not be withdrawing his candidature, as some had speculated he might in order to free up the votes of Swiss IOC members for the other four non-Bach candidates. Compatriots of the candidates are not allowed to vote until they are eliminated. Oswald also cast doubts over the favourite&apos;s close links to Sheikh Ahmad. &quot;I want an independent candidate who is not dependant on certain alliances and who uses his position for nothing else than the good of sport,&quot; he said. &quot;The members must make their decision but some don&apos;t like the link between Bach and Kuwait.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Sony announces PS Vita TV microconsole | CVG UK The new Vita 2000 wasn&apos;t Sony&apos;s only announcement from Tokyo:  Sony has announced PlayStation Vita TV, a new device which brings portable gaming and media experiences to TV screens."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Indie games", "Wii", "Xbox", "PlayStation", "PC", "Games consoles", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-10T06:30:07Z", "title": "Press Start: Sony announces Vita TV microconsole and Japanese PS4 release date, and more", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/sep/10/game-links-press-start", "article": "A selection of links, hand-picked by the Guardian games writers.

Ex-Zynga exec John Schappert starts new game startup with investment from Nexon | GamesBeat John Schappert, formerly a high ranking exec at EA and Zynga, has returned to his roots as a game developer by setting up a new studio:  Shiver Entertainment (named after the word for a pack of sharks) will be based in Miami, where Schappert grew up and not far from the game company, Tiburon, that he created many years ago. It is the latest step in a storied career that included the No. 2 jobs at Zynga, Electronic Arts, and Microsoft&apos;s Xbox business. The new company, founded in December, will make free-to-play games for the PC and mobile devices, and that&apos;s why it&apos;s a good fit within the portfolio of Nexon, the Asian game company that pioneered free-to-play. &quot;It was a lot of fun working in the big corporate jobs of the past few years,&quot; Schappert said in an interview with GamesBeat. &quot;But the most fun I had in my career was when I started Tiburon and ran game studios working with some of the best creators in the world making some of the most successful games in the world.&quot;  Videogames in the Amazon | Flickr - Photo Sharing! BioWare co-founder Ray Muzyka left the studio last year and is currently traveling through Ecuador. Recently he met up with the remote Schuar tribe and couldn&apos;t help showing off his gaming devices:  I happened to have my iPad with me with a bunch of games on it, and Leona had her iPhone with some photos from home, so we first told them about snow (which some of them had seen from a distance, on the mountains of the Andes in Ecuador, but very few had seen in person), Canadian winter (which, when we described how cold it gets where we live in the winter in Edmonton, Alberta - and for how many months we have snow on the ground - they asked us if we live on top of a mountain; they also didn&apos;t want to accept that our trees would survive being frozen, even though we showed them photos to prove it!), ice hockey (which seemed to intrigue them - they know about and play soccer/football, but hadn&apos;t heard about hockey before). After that, the indigenous tribespeople and the rest of our group enjoyed playing air hockey together on my iPad, with the local children all taking turns playing until we reluctantly had to call it a night. That evening was a lot of fun :)  Rumours that the tribe later imprisoned him due to the ending of Mass Effect 3 are unconfirmed.

The narrator and central character, Minke, is a gifted 18-year-old Javanese from an aristocratic family who goes to a prestigious Dutch school where he is the only &quot;native&quot; Indonesian. His talent and self-confidence arouse the envy and contempt of his &quot;pure&quot; (European) and &quot;Indo&quot; (Indo-European) classmates. The tale quietly excoriates colonial society, in which Indonesians suffer injustices and humiliations because social standing and rights depend on the amount of European blood in one&apos;s veins. With his refusal to accept his place in a racially stratified society, Minke embodies nascent Indonesian nationalism. He falls in love with the beautiful daughter of an absent Dutch father and an astute, strongwilled native &quot;concubine&quot;. But their hopes for the future run up against Javanese prejudices and unyielding Dutch colonial law. Pramoedya was imprisoned by the Dutch and then by the Indonesian government under Suharto. He spent 14 years in a penal colony on Buru Island, composing and memorising This Earth by repeating it to fellow prisoners after he was denied writing materials. He died in 2006. The Rainbow Troops by Andrea Hirata  Hirata&apos;s autobiographical novel is an endearing and inspirational story of poor ethnic Malay students struggling against considerable odds to get an education. On the island of Belitung, off the Sumatran coast, miner&apos;s son Ikal (Hirata&apos;s alter ego), who is six when the story begins, narrates the tale of his 10 motley classmates, called the Rainbow Troops. At great sacrifice from their parents, they seek the education the law guarantees them and a better future, rather than toiling in the menial jobs they would otherwise end up doing. Their school, Belitung&apos;s poorest, is constantly threatened with closure but its heroic, unpaid teachers keep things going. The small island, &quot;the richest land in Indonesia&quot; because of its huge mineral deposits, is under the shadow of the giant PN mining company. The company extracts great wealth, but it does not trickle down. &quot;We, the natives of Belitung, were like a pack of starving rats in a barn full of rice,&quot; says Ikal. The simple, conversational prose draws the reader in to cheer on the resilient students. Hirata&apos;s debut novel is the result of a promise he made to write a book for his selfless teacher. It is Indonesia&apos;s biggest-selling book (more than 5m copies and counting), and he has written three sequels. In the Time of Madness by Richard Lloyd Parry &quot;This book is about violence, and about being afraid,&quot; says Parry, as he presents a slice of Indonesian history during a turbulent and chaotic time. At the end of the 20th century, Indonesia is emerging from three decades of Suharto&apos;s dictatorship, and pent-up frustrations are being released. &quot;A struggle [is] taking place between something old, murderous and corrupt, and something new.&quot; The book is divided into three sections, chronicling events to which the author is witness: savage ethnic conflict in Borneo; massive student protests in the capital, Jakarta, that bring down Suharto; and bloody violence in East Timor around the referendum on its independence from Indonesia. This deeply personal, sometimes harrowing account of Indonesia&apos;s implosion lacks a central focus, but more than makes up for it in gripping narrative. Parry proves to be a lucid and intelligent guide to navigating the complexities of this vast archipelago with its various languages, ethnicities and religions. And his pungent reportage is of a kind that stays with you long after the headlines have faded. A British journalist, Parry is based in Tokyo but often visited Indonesia to report for the Independent and the Times newspapers."}, {"sentences": ["Wrestling back in Olympics  Good news for Greco-Roman grapple fans, as the International Olympic Committee reversed an earlier decision to drop wrestling from the programme for the 2020 Games, to be held in Tokyo."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2013-09-10T13:02:31Z", "title": "Vettel wins Italian Grand Prix", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/10/guardian-weekly-sport-vettel-world-cup-australia", "article": "Having flirted briefly with the concept of entertainment, Formula One returned to thrill-free normality as Sebastian Vettel cruised to victory over Ferrari&apos;s Fernando Alonso in the Italian Grand Prix.

It&apos;s a question arising from our lead feature this week and one we have discussed at length in the office. You might expect revelations of how US and British secret services have unlocked the encryption used to protect personal data, online transactions and email to be seen as a huge scandal. But almost as bewildering was the wall of silence that greeted the story (a joint investigation by the Guardian, the New York Times and the website ProPublica) in the British media, where reaction to the greater body of NSA/Snowden revelations generally has also been muted. It&apos;s a subject picked up astutely by the Observer columnist Henry Porter in our Comment pages. Why is it, he asks, that we now seem so at ease with a system of near total intrusion that would have horrified every adult 25 years ago? Have those who care most about privacy and freedom been left behind by societies that accept surveillance as part and parcel of the world we live in? A fascinating question, and one I&apos;m sure many of you have strong views on too \u2013 please do share them with us.

Bach had long coveted the presidency, which is awarded for an initial eight-year term, and ran a sophisticated lobbying campaign in which the Kuwaiti Sheikh Ahmad al-Sabah played a controversial role. Bach, a 59-year-old former Adidas executive, who joined the IOC in 1991 and has held a number of influential roles, will replace Jacques Rogge to become the organisation&apos;s ninth president in its 119-year history. Rogge unveiled his successor to a standing ovation from the 102 members present at the IOC&apos;s session here that had already decided Tokyo should host the 2020 Games and wrestling should retain its Olympic status. &quot;This makes me happy. I want to lead the IOC according to my motto \u2013 unity in diversity. I want to be a president for all,&quot; said Bach. &quot;I will do my very best to balance well all the needs of the stakeholders of the Olympic movement. You should know my doors, my ears and my heart are always open to you.&quot; Rogge, considered to have restored the credibility and financial strength of the IOC after the Salt Lake City scandal, is standing down after 12 years at the helm. Bach saw off a late effort by his five rivals \u2013 the Puerto Rican Richard Carrion, the Swiss lawyer Denis Oswald, the international boxing chief Dr Ck Wu, the Singaporean businessman Ng Ser Miang and the former pole vaulter Sergey Bubka \u2013 to work together to stop him. Bach has promised to overhaul the bidding system for the Games and make them cheaper to host. He inherits a financially stable IOC but will immediately face political challenges arising from the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and logistical issues concerning the 2016 Rio Games. Sheikh al-Sabah, considered an increasingly influential figure in IOC circles, admitted to lobbying on Bach&apos;s behalf in a breach of the IOC&apos;s rules. Oswald was then ticked off by the IOC for saying he was concerned about Bach&apos;s links to the Sheikh, who is president of the Association of National Olympic Committees and whose lobbying was seen as a factor in the Tokyo and wrestling decisions. &quot;I want an independent candidate who is not dependant on certain alliances and who uses his position for nothing else than the good of sport,&quot; Oswald said. &quot;The members must make their decision but some don&apos;t like the link between Bach and Kuwait.&quot; The German&apos;s election was ultimately unaffected by a withering documentary aired in his homeland in the run-up to the vote. It accused him of cheating when he was a young fencer by using a wet glove to disable the scoring system, of paying inducements to sports stars when he was an Adidas executive and of being named in Stasi files over an influence-peddling scheme. Bach said the claimswere &quot;nonsense&quot;. &quot;It will not affect me because there is no substance whatsoever,&quot; he said. He denied that the Sheikh had orchestrated his campaign and insisted he had made no promises to anyone. &quot;You can&apos;t win the elections for the IOC president with the support of one person alone,&quot; he said. &quot;The IOC members are very strong personalities and you have to convince them individually. This is what I tried to do in my campaign.&quot; Bach also said he would look again at the number of disciplines in each sport on the Olympic programme, potentially opening up space for new sports. The new president, who won a fencing gold medal in the team foil in 1976 before entering sports marketing and politics, defeated five other candidates in the largest field ever for the role, reflecting the relative scarcity of opportunities to run for the top job and the power it wields. Speaking before the vote, he said he saw the role as being akin to being the conductor of an orchestra. &quot;The role of the IOC president is being the conductor of the worldwide orchestra of the members,&quot; he said. &quot;He is the conductor of a fascinating orchestra with the members who have so many strengths and you have to allow to play the instrument they prefer and get them in harmony.&quot; In the lobby of the Hilton, all the various concentric circles of interested parties \u2013 international sporting federations, lobbyists, journalists and functionaries \u2013 gathered to watch the election on a big screen. In the first round of voting, there was a tie for last place and Wu, the Association of International Boxing Associations president, was eliminated after a run-off against Ng. Bach polled 49 votes in the final round of voting, ahead of Carrion with 29, Ng with six, Oswald with five and Bubka with four. The British IOC vice-president Sir Craig Reedie said the Olympic movement was in safe hands. &quot;The election of Bach gives us certainty. There was a majority early in the process and I think that&apos;s good news. &quot;The new president won&apos;t want to be a mirror image of his predecessor. But he knows more about the organisation of the IOC and the implications for the movement than any of the other candidates, in what was a strong field.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["He was all smiles afterwards after delivering a hat-trick of victories for Tokyo, wrestling and Bach."], "tags": ["International Olympic Committee", "Tokyo Olympic Games 2020", "Olympic Games", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-10T19:46:15Z", "title": "Sheikh Ahmad al-Sabah rattles and rolls in the IOC's corridors of power | Owen Gibson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/sep/10/sheikh-ahmad-al-sabah-ioc", "article": "Outside the Hilton Hotel in Buenos Aires, the colourful life of the Argentinian capital bustles by. Inside, behind security scanners and police cordons the at-times bizarre, sometimes important and occasionally comical business of the International Olympic Committee goes on. And on. But the real action is not taking place in the staid conference room that has been home to the official business of the election of a host city for 2020, a vote on the Olympic programme and the election of a new president. The lobby hums with activity day and night, a swirl of rumour and conjecture with nobody ever saying what they really mean. In the background, a big screen showing highlights of the London Games provides the wallpaper. Other than that, sport isn&apos;t mentioned much amid the dissection of voting patterns, strategic alliances and political issues big and small. In the huge atrium, ringed by airport-style security and colonised for more than a week by the IOC, associates, hangers on and journalists gather to see which of the six men arranged on stage will be elected president. What resembles a cross between a political rally and a high-end conference for widget manufacturers is taking place. IOC members from across the world, including Princess Anne, Sepp Blatter and Frankie Fredericks, grapple with the problems inherent in pressing the right voting button at the right time. Some of the self-importance, which runs to the IOC having its own flag and anthem, is justified. The race to host the Games has become hugely politically attractive, spurring world leaders to flock to tug their forelocks to an international organisation that has become the forum for negotiations that go way beyond sport. One of the first calls of congratulation that Thomas Bach took on becoming president was from Vladimir Putin. But some of the pomposity goes way beyond parody. Everyone wears a colour-coded accreditation, some affording more status than others. IOC members wear a tiny lapel badge of the five gold rings \u2013 a subtle sign of their elevated position in the ultimate private members club. If the default setting for a Fifa election is a mixture of lurid allegations, cartoonish rogues and brazen misbehaviour, the IOC&apos;s is a relentless, low frequency hum of polite chatter, rumour and counter rumour in a Babel of languages. After the reign of Juan Antonio Samaranch and the Salt Lake City scandal that resulted in a cleaning of the stables at the IOC, Jacques Rogge has remade the organisation in his own staid image. That has brought financial stability and a string of impressively organised Olympics but also a deadening hand of endless rules, administration and literature. Compared to previous presidential races, including the one that delivered Rogge to the presidency, this one has been well mannered until the final straight. &quot;He is always standing next to a broken window but no one has ever seen him throw the stone,&quot; one of Bach&apos;s detractors complained. Only suggestions that Bach may have cheated as a young fencer by using a wet glove (which sounds more like a Spinal Tap B-side than an international corruption scandal) and speculation over the role of &quot;the Sheikh&quot; in rallying support for the German as the race entered its final hours provided intrigue. Sheikh Ahmad al-Sabah, a softly spoken man with distinctive curly shoulder length hair who is never knowingly without his bodyguards, is increasingly styled as a kingmaker in IOC circles. He was all smiles afterwards after delivering a hat-trick of victories for Tokyo, wrestling and Bach. Inside the hall paeans to &quot;ethics&quot;, &quot;good governance&quot;, &quot;social and humanitarian responsibilities&quot;, &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;fair play&quot; tumble into a sea of platitudes. Out in the lobby, embattled UCI president Pat McQuaid, embroiled in a bitter election battle of his own to run world cycling amid endless allegations of dirty tricks and corruption, bustles by into the lifts with a face like thunder. Blatter, the great survivor, politely but resolutely fends off queries about the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar only to switch it to winter. And the ceremony in which an uncharacteristically beaming Rogge handed over to Bach was followed immediately by an advert for Olympic partner Visa as emirs, sheikhs, royals and those who have spent their whole lives immersed in the &quot;movement&quot; lined up to congratulate the new president. As a snapshot of modern Olympism (yes, that is a real word) it was hard to beat."}, {"sentences": ["Rural England, what is now Turkey, Kolkata, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Man Booker International prize 2013", "Culture", "Awards and prizes", "Man Booker International prize", "Books"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-11T12:50:00Z", "title": "Heart of the story: mapping the Man Booker prize", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/11/man-booker-prize-2013-map", "article": "Rural England, what is now Turkey, Kolkata, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Tokyo. Not my list of most-want-to-visit places, but the settings for the six titles shortlisted for the 2013 Man Booker prize. Perhaps the only surprise is that London doesn&apos;t feature on the list. After all, 38 of the 267 books either shortlisted or victorious in the 46 years of the Booker prize since 1969 \u2013 including the Lost Booker \u2013 have been set in the capital. Dublin is the next most popular locale, with nine books, followed by Mumbai, with seven (the same number, incidentally, as the whole of Scotland). Literary locations have long fired some peculiar part of our imagination, especially when they are transposed on the world around us. You can trot along to King&apos;s Cross station and gaze upon the sign for Platform 9\u00be from the Harry Potter books. Or visit fair Verona, home of star cross&apos;d lovers, where you can see &quot;Juliet&apos;s house&quot; and even her balcony. (Although its connection with Shakespeare&apos;s Capulets is debatable \u2013 and the balcony is definitely nothing to do with the playwright, having been added in 1936.) Not that authenticity matters \u2013 at least not factual, physical authenticity. What you get by seeing a fictional place given real-world roots is emotional authenticity. Books and places are, after all, two of the greatest stores of emotional memory or ambition in our lives. We remember such-and-such a book from our childhood; we dream of visiting this or that place. It&apos;s no real surprise that we get a kick \u2013 a real, tangible, emotional kick \u2013 out of books and places being brought together. Authenticity, though, was one of the greatest problems we had in creating the Book Globe. Between two of us, we created a list of all the central locations \u2013 the place where the heart of the story lies \u2013 for every book that has ever won the Booker prize or made the shortlist. We then placed those locations on a Google map. Places in books are not the same as places in the real world, and not just because enterprising businessmen have tacked a new balcony onto the side of an old building. David Lodge sums up the dilemma wonderfully well in the foreword to his campus novels, set around the university in the city of Rummidge. &quot;Perhaps I should explain,&quot; writes Lodge, &quot;that Rummidge is an imaginary city \u2026 which occupies, for the purposes of fiction, the space where Birmingham is to be found on maps of the so-called real world.&quot; Lodge writes Rummidge with huge style and colour, his larger-than-life characters taking their place in a richly comic world. His university is a complete universe, and yet the surrounding city is sketched out only in skeleton form. The reader is required to fill in the gaps with their existing, real-life knowledge of Birmingham (or any other large British city, if they haven&apos;t had the pleasure of visiting there). In the imagination, the city of Rummidge acquires a duality, becoming part real-world Birmingham, part Small World Rummidge. Understanding that fictional locations both are and are not what they purport to be is an intrinsic part of finding our place in a novel&apos;s world. It means we can happily accept 38 different versions of London, or accommodate those squeezed-in non-places, the platform 9\u00bes. It allows us to lose ourselves in the worlds created by books while our imaginations wrestle those places back to a real-world counterpart. Ian McEwan captures this two-places-at-once-ness with the utmost precision in an endnote to On Chesil Beach. &quot;Edward and Florence&apos;s hotel,&quot; he writes, &quot;just over a mile south of Abbotsbury, Dorset, occupying an elevated position in a field behind the beach car park \u2013 does not exist.&quot; Yet, while the hotel may not exist, while places may be created \u2013 as Lodge put it \u2013 for &quot;the purposes of fiction&quot;, the ruggedness of that part of the Jurassic coast, the reality of the beach (indeed, of the beach car park) are undeniable. We can wander whichever way we like into a book&apos;s unique world, safe in the knowledge that tied to our imaginations is a string, an emotional connection, that remains attached to the real world. The Book Globe does not pretend to be a work of finessed cartography. We have not skewered each book to its setting; rather, we&apos;ve aligned them with their closest real-world relative, whether village, city, county or country. We think it says something about how we read and respond to places in literature. And the predominance of Commonwealth locations definitely reinforces the old adage, &quot;write about what you know&quot;.

Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah is president of the umbrella group of 205 national Olympic committees and is responsible for distributing nearly $400m (\u00a3253m) of the IOC&apos;s money among them. On the eve of the vote Bach&apos;s Swiss rival for the presidency Denis Oswald publicly criticised his close links with the sheikh, prompting a reprimand from the IOC. After the vote Oswald reiterated that the IOC would have to look again at the role of Sheikh al-Sabah during the campaign. &quot;That is something, in my opinion, we will have to discuss. We knew it was a very difficult race and we did our best,&quot; said Oswald. Al-Sabah had publicly admitted lobbying on Bach&apos;s behalf but the sheikh \u2013 who also played a key role in helping Tokyo win the race for the 2020 Games and wrestling regain its Olympic status \u2013 claimed his part in proceedings had been overplayed. &quot;I am a member. I have only one vote like each other member has his or her one vote. I thank the media for making me a hero. But don&apos;t hear those rumours,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&apos;t diminish the importance of Dr Bach \u2013 he&apos;s an athlete with an Olympic gold medal, he&apos;s an IOC member more senior than me, he has a lot of relationships, he has built his reputation for a long time, he has been in charge of a main part of the movement.&apos; The Kuwaiti, elected as a member of the IOC a year after Bach joined in 1991, beamed as he explained his satisfaction with the hat-trick of results in Buenos Aires. &quot;It was a very difficult week because there were a lot serious bid cities, presidents, other members, sports,&quot; he said. &quot;But it has moved smoothly and the result, I think it was reasonable for a lot of people, showed the solidarity.&quot; With growing concern over the preparations of the Rio 2016 Games, he said the Tokyo vote was positive for the future of the IOC because it needed &quot;more stability&quot;. &quot;Tokyo showed the IOC needed more stability to deliver a good Games,&quot; said the 50-year-old, who is also minister of national security in his homeland. &quot;After the success of London and Beijing, we have to see with Rio. At least we have assured ourselves with a very secure city like Tokyo.&quot; Echoing the thoughts of other IOC members, he said Bach&apos;s majority victory in the second round with 49 votes, 20 ahead of his nearest rival Richard Carri\u00f3n, showed there was &quot;solidity and confidence&quot; behind one man. Al-Sabah said the IOC should &quot;look again&quot; at the rules surrounding lobbying and the strict provisions that surround the three-month campaign to be president. He said things had changed since many of the rules were put in place in the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. &quot;We are now in a new period, with a different generation and leadership, more quiet and stable to discuss more things and fights like doping, illegal betting, partnerships that promote the Olympic ideals, programmes, how to qualify athletes for the games. All those are a duty we have to work for.&quot; There was nothing wrong with campaigning during an election, he said. &quot;In the campaigns there are a lot of rumours we have to respect. But this is the politics of sport. When there is an election, there should be campaigning.&quot; The sheikh also recently helped Salman al-Khalifa secure the presidency of the Asian Football Confederation and Marius Vizer to the SportAccord leadership, as well as backing Buenos Aires&apos; successful Youth Olympic Games bid. But Bach also attempted to play down the role of the sheikh in his lobbying campaign that sealed his long-standing ambition to succeed Jacques Rogge as president for an initial eight-year term. He said that as president of the German National Olympic Committee it was natural that his own constituency would support him. &quot;If you don&apos;t enjoy the support of your own constituency, maybe you have made a mistake as an NOC president. You can&apos;t win the elections for the IOC president with the support of one person alone,&quot; he said. &quot;The IOC members are very strong personalities and you have to convince them individually. This is what I tried to do in my campaign. There are 95 individual voters and they all want to speak with a candidate and want to have a contact with the candidate.&quot;The former Adidas executive, an Olympic gold medallist in 1976 in fencing, insisted he was not beholden to Al-Sabah in any way and made no promises to anyone in return for their vote. He also dismissed a range of allegations aired in a German documentary broadcast the week before the vote, ranging from claims he cheated during his early fencing career to allegations that he paid inducements to sports stars while at Adidas. &quot;What has been brought up there is nonsense. It will not affect me because there is no substance whatsoever,&apos; he said. As well as the Sochi and Rio Games, Bach said his immediate priorities would be reviewing the Olympic programme and continuing the fight against doping and match fixing. John Coates, the Australian Olympic Committee president who became an IOC vice-president on Tuesday, said there was a &quot;huge concern&quot; over the progress in Rio. &quot;There is a little over two years to go and there is still so much work to be done,&quot; said Coates. &quot;We are all concerned. It is not impossible but they desperately need a more concerted effort with some of the infrastructure projects and venues.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Our favourites from last week&apos;s blog            1) Tokyo 1964 Olympic memories: in black and white (with very excitable commentary) and in glorious technicolour."], "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-12T08:00:02Z", "title": "Classic YouTube | Flipbook Messi, Tokyo's last Olympics and farewell to Alan Hansen", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/sep/12/classic-youtube-best-sports-clips", "article": "     1) Serbia v Croatia, played last friday, was not a fixture that needed any additional zest.

Here are a few highlights from this week. The article of the week 1) Ferguson&apos;s Formula     Sir Alex Ferguson. Photograph: Mike Egerton/EMPICS Sport/PA    No one covers Sir Alex Ferguson better than the man himself. Anita Elberse, a Harvard Business School professor who spent hours interviewing Ferguson for this 5,000-word article about his leadership techniques, does not come close to matching Ferguson&apos;s own words.  Elberse sets out Ferguson&apos;s style in eight &quot;leadership lessons&quot;, which are as full of management jargon as you would expect. None of the facts or anecdotes are new, but a drop of wisdom emerges from every word Ferguson says. When he&apos;s on good form, no one can touch Ferguson as an interviewee. Manchester United fans will have to hope that David Moyes is a subscriber to the Harvard Business Review. Other stories we like 2) Why would anyone want to host the Olympics?     Supporters of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics bid. Photograph: Shizuo Kambayashi/AP    They cost up to $40bn, don&apos;t bring in that many tourists and can leave cities with needless infrastructure and white elephant stadiums. So why were Madrid, Tokyo and Istanbul so keen to host the Olympics? Tokyo were knocked back for 2016; Madrid have now failed to win the 2012, 2016 and 2020 Games; and Istanbul have been rejected a total of five times. Why do they not just give up, asks the Economist.  Olympic host cities have no clear record of turning huge profits, fixing their ailing economies or inspiring generations to take up sports, but every four years the same politicians throw their hats into the five rings as they know that voters love the idea of bringing the Olympics to their city. At the end of the London Games, 80% of the population said the expense had been worth it. Each of the three cities that bid for the 2020 had support of over 70%. It might not be smart policy, but it&apos;s smart politics. The Olympics may not bring long-term prosperity, but they give politicians a short-term boost \u2013 and politicians are never known to turn down votes.  3) The eagle that delivered hope Four and a half years ago an earthquake struck in the central Italian town of L&apos;Aquila. The town changed forever that night: 309 people died, 1,600 were injured and 65,000 lost their homes. The town is still recovering and so is their football club, as Paul Grech reports so elegantly for In Bed With Maradona.  Football will never repair the damage done to L&apos;Aquila, but the game has a special and powerful place in this community: &quot;Confronted by such human tragedies, it is impossible not to think of how ridiculous it is to waste so much time and energy worrying about the fate of a football team; it is impossible not to come to the conclusion that in the end football isn&apos;t a matter of life and death no matter what we say or how we try to dress it up. Yet it is also in such moments that sport&apos;s most beautiful of characteristics, that power to unite and help in the healing process, shines brightest.&quot; 4) Boxing is dead? Again? Boxing can&apos;t win. If Floyd Mayweather beats Canelo Alvarez on Saturday night in the biggest fight of the year, people will say there is no one left to face the champion: goodnight boxing. If Mayweather loses, the same people will say the sport&apos;s last star has left the stage: goodnight boxing.  No matter which way the fight goes, prepare to read the pre-cooked eulogies for the old sport that died and gave up the ghost to UFC. Boxing has always provided rich pickings for the pessimist, but as Mark E Ortega points out in The Ring, reports of boxing&apos;s demise have been greatly exaggerated. Mayweather will take home $42m for his night&apos;s work, which will be watched by 2.5m fans on pay-per-view.  The fight game is no longer the centre of the sporting universe, but this bout could be the start of a renaissance: &quot;People that follow boxing understand it is more of a niche sport than a mainstream one these days. But signs of late point to it slowly climbing out of that categorisation.&quot; 5) Everyone&apos;s a liar during the transfer window Sid Lowe looks back on the transfer window for ESPN and asks a simple question: why do we criticise players who are not loyal to their clubs, but forgive clubs for being disloyal to their players?  We tend to think of clubs as abstract entities, but really they are flawed institutions ran by owners who are as selfish and irrational as their footballers: &quot;Clubs are quick to insist that it is not their fault the player is leaving. Propaganda plays a part. PR, if you prefer. Stories are denied because they are false; they are also denied because they are inconvenient. Players, agents and journalists stand accused of lying; clubs, meanwhile, rarely do. But sometimes it is clubs who have the greatest interest in ensuring that a certain &apos;line&apos; comes out.&quot; Next time you launch into a diatribe about Luis Su\u00e1rez, Wayne Rooney or Gareth Bale, consider that perspective.  6) I know but I don&apos;t know Sometimes it feels like there is nothing more to be said about football. The topic is written about so much, by so many people on so many websites, newspapers and social media accounts that every statement becomes dead and cliched by the time it is uttered. But every now and again, something comes along that feels fresh and funny and new.  Here is Fredorrarci writing for The Classical about the transfer window, the most overwritten subject of all \u2013 and it&apos;s superb: &quot;You can tell who the Arsenal fans are this week. They&apos;re the ones who have shaved each eyebrow into an umlaut, all the better to adorn their dreamy gazing upon Germany&apos;s World Cup qualifier against Austria. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has finally ditched the limp, gotten into Kobayashi&apos;s car and spent big on a bona fide ace, Mesut Ozil. Ozil has damn near become a hero before he&apos;s even traveled to London. The airspace above the moon is dense with Gooners, while Real Madrid supporters have been left confused and irritable, even more so than normal.&quot; 7) The last great American prizefighter Tim Keown spent some time in Floyd Mayweather&apos;s world for ESPN Magazine. Here is a single sentence of his 4,000-word profile: &quot;He has, in the past 20 minutes, spent close to a quarter of a million dollars on earrings and a necklace for his 13-year-old daughter, Iyanna, and he has sent some of his people out to buy so many chicken strips and fries that the place smells like a vat of burning oil, and at this moment he is haggling with the jewelers over a $3.5m watch as a member of his security detail \u2013 the one summoned into action by the lyrical command &apos;Jethro \u2013 sanitizer!&apos; \u2013 is pouring so much Purell on his hands that it cascades through his fingers and creates a puddle on the white marble floor.&quot;  Mayweather is not a normal man. He is not a normal athlete, and not even a normal superstar. He is ridiculous: as repellent as he is absorbing; a man who keeps his $123m fortune in a single bank account and can box with his eyes closed. As Keown puts it: &quot;He is a man who can do whatever he wants whenever he wants with just about whomever he wants.&quot; Mayweather is a performance artist and this article captures some of that ghastly and beguiling art. 8) My poster boys What is it about cricket that draws in the best sportswriters? To the outsider the game looks like a bunch of men standing around for a week doing very little between their lunch and tea breaks; but to the insider there is a whole world of nuance, nostalgia and numbers. Emma John captures the essence of fandom in all its peculiarity and joy in this piece for Cricinfo. She takes us to the lost corners of her parents&apos; attic and lets the action begin.  &quot;&apos;Oh god,&apos; my sister groaned. &apos;Is that what I think it is?&apos; We slit the tape and opened it up on the floor. Dozens of sheets of coloured card spilled out, each covered in cuttings from the sports pages and photographs cut out of magazines. Neatly arranged and mounted, the newsprint had been laminated with the fastidious care of a Blue-Peter-watching Girl Guide. Little dry balls of Blu-tack, some with flakes of white paint and wallpaper still clinging to them, dotted their obverse sides. &apos;Oh, it&apos;s your cricket posters!&apos; said mum. &apos;You used to sit up in your room for hours making those!&apos; she sighed nostalgically. &apos;You were such an industrious teenager.&apos;&apos;She was such a nerd,&quot; snorted my sister.&apos;From the floor, Angus Fraser looked up at me with a typically hangdog expression. He seemed resigned, as if spending the last 15 years wedged in between two pieces of cardboard, in a forgotten corner of a mouldering basement, was no less than he&apos;d expected. Above him was a banner headline: &apos;England lose again.&apos;&quot; The headlines have changed, but the fans&apos; stories remain the same. 9) Trapped by fear of failure So long Giovanni Trapattoni, former manager of the Republic of Ireland. Ken Early of the Irish Times will not be sad to see him go. Trapattoni&apos;s results were not the problem \u2013 no reasonable Irish fans expects the team to qualify for every tournament. The problem with Trapattoni was that he set his sights so low. He was so busy trying to avoid mistakes that he forgot to inspire his players to create something beautiful, or at least watchable.  10) Tankers need good drivers Greg Dyke, the new bigwig at the FA, has two objectives for the England team. He wants to &quot;at least&quot; reach the semi-finals of Euro 2020 and win the World Cup in 2022. The man can dream, but he&apos;s not so good on strategy, argues Phil Blundell in the Anfield Wrap.  Perhaps Dyke should set about trying to achieve the achievable: &quot;This semi-finals goal is something the England team have done once in history, and that was by means of a penalty shootout at home to Spain. Read that back again, England have won ONE knockout game in the history of the European Championships. On penalties. In a tournament they hosted.&quot; Not only is Dyke setting the wrong goals, says Blundell, but he is also applying faulty logic. The Premier League may be dominated by foreign players, but the England squads of recent years have fared better than the sides of the 1970s, which failed to qualify for international tournaments. The very best English players are benefiting from lining up against Robin van Persie and Sergio Ag\u00fcero; the national team does not struggle because its players are poor, but because the country is not developing enough managers to coach them properly at international level: &quot;Get some coaches who know their arse from their elbow, can compete tactically and are capable of winning these tournaments.&quot; Blundell makes another point that is often lost in football analysis: &quot;The best set of players doesn&apos;t always win. Italy won the 2006 World Cup with Marco Materazzi in their central defence. Kleberson was a big part of the Brazil 2002 squad. St\u00e9phane Guivarc&apos;h was France&apos;s lone forward in 1998. All sides had fluent footballing plans, were well organised, and had the mentality of a winning team. Greece won more european championship knockout matches in 2004 than England ever have.&quot; If Dyke wants to pick up the World Cup in 2022, he needs a better plan.

The cartoon, which appeared on Wednesday in the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchain\u00e9, shows two sumo wrestlers \u2013 each with an extra arm or leg \u2013 with the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in the background. At the edge of the panel, a TV announcer dressed in a hazardous materials suit says: &quot;Marvellous! Thanks to Fukushima, sumo is now an Olympic sport.&quot; A second image features two people in protective clothing conducting radiation tests by the side of a pool, along with the caption: &quot;There is already a pool in Fukushima for the Olympics.&quot; The International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded the 2020 Games to Tokyo last weekend, despite growing concerns about the safety of the Fukushima plant. In the runup to the IOC vote, reports emerged of leaks of highly contaminated water from storage tanks at the plant. In a separate incident last month, the facility&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, admitted that about 300 tonnes of radioactive groundwater a day was flowing into the Pacific. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, offered personal assurances to IOC officials that the Fukushima plant was under control and that radiation leaks posed no threat to Tokyo. The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said a formal complaint would be lodged with the French embassy in Tokyo, adding that the cartoon hurt the victims of the triple disaster that struck Japan&apos;s north-east coast on 11 March 2011. &quot;It is inappropriate and gives the wrong impression about the issue of contaminated water at Fukushima Daiichi,&quot; Suga said. &quot;It is extremely regrettable.&quot; Japan&apos;s foreign ministry has been ordered to step up efforts to provide timely and accurate information about the situation in Fukushima, amid criticism from South Korea and China that it has been slow to share details about the water leaks. This is not the first time that France \u2013 where nuclear is the primary source of energy \u2013 has offended Japanese sensibilities over Fukushima. Last October the broadcaster France 2 apologised after it screened a composite picture of the Japanese goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima with four arms. A presenter attributed Kawashima&apos;s impressive performance in Japan&apos;s shock 1-0 defeat of France in a friendly to the &quot;Fukushima effect&quot;. In 2011 Kawashima was targeted for abuse while playing for the Belgian club Lierse SK in a league fixture, when opposition fans chanted &quot;Kawashima, Fukushima&quot;. The referee temporarily halted play after protests from Kawashima, who was reportedly in tears after the match."}, {"sentences": ["Other initiatives are more complex and all-encompassing \u2013 Tokyo won the finance and economic development prize at the awards for introducing the world&apos;s first city-based carbon trading programme, which since its introduction in 2010 has cut the Japanese capital&apos;s emissions by 7m tonnes by focusing on emissions from buildings."], "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability", "Scaling up", "Climate change", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-12T12:09:00Z", "title": "Cities bypass slow government to lead the way on climate change", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/cities-bypass-government-climate-change", "article": "Efforts by national governments to tackle climate change and other sustainability challenges have been mixed at best over the past 20 years, but there is one level of government that has embraced the challenge with gusto \u2013 and success. &quot;National governments have largely failed to act, while cities embody the spirit of innovation we need. When it comes to climate change, cities are where the most exciting progress is being made,&quot; said Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, speaking by videolink to the City Climate Leadership Awards in London this month. He added pointedly that, &quot;mayors do not have the luxury of just talking about problems. They have to deliver results.&quot; Partly, this is a matter of necessity \u2013 more than half the world&apos;s people live in cities, they consume two-thirds of the world&apos;s energy and generate 70% of carbon emissions. &quot;If we want to win the war against climate change, it has to be won in cities,&quot; said Roland Busch, head of Cities and Infrastructure at Siemens, sponsors of the awards. Many of the world&apos;s megacities are situated on the coast and their vulnerability to sea level rise and the effects of extreme weather events has been highlighted in recent years by disasters such as Superstorm Sandy, which devastated New York last year and Hurricane Katrina, which had a similar effect on New Orleans. But it&apos;s not just rising seas \u2013 each city has its own challenges, from the wildfires that threatened Melbourne in 2009 to the floods that deluged Bangkok in 2011, severely disrupting the entire Thai economy, to the choking smog that afflicts Beijing, New Delhi and Los Angeles. But equally, the world&apos;s urban areas are where the opportunities lie \u2013 they generate more than 70% of global GDP and cities are growing faster than other parts of the economy. &quot;If you want to provide infrastructure for people in the most cost-efficient and effective way, you do it in cities,&quot; said Busch. Perhaps the fact that people in urban environments are &quot;squished together&quot; makes them more accepting of the need to take action, said Matthew Pencharz, an adviser on energy and environment to London&apos;s mayor Boris Johnson. While national politicians&apos; pronouncements can sometimes seem too vague for people to get to grips with, &quot;mayors have found a way to take action that is accountable to the population and brings them visible, tangible benefits that improve their quality of life.&quot; Mayors have a lot of the right power, argues Rohit Aggarwala, special adviser to the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and former director of planning and sustainability in New York. &quot;The politics align well and, in addition, many of the interest groups that are most opposed to climate action are simply not as prominent in cities.&quot; The consultants McKinsey argue in a new report entitled How to make a city great, &quot;that leaders who make important strides in improving their cities do three things really well: They achieve smart growth. They do more with less. And they win support for change.&quot;     Bogota transport Photograph: Alcadia Mayor de Bogota    These improvements do not need to cost a lot of money if they are imaginative enough \u2013 McKinsey reports that the former mayor of Bogot\u00e1, Antanas Mockus, &quot;famously hired 420 mimes to make fun of traffic violators: this entertaining public ridicule reduced traffic fatalities by more than 50%.&quot; Robert Doyle, Lord Mayor of Melbourne, explained how his city has a plan to double the number of trees in the city by planting an extra 30,000 saplings, which he said would cut temperatures in the centre by 4\u00b0C, as well as making the city more liveable and sustainable. Other initiatives are more complex and all-encompassing \u2013 Tokyo won the finance and economic development prize at the awards for introducing the world&apos;s first city-based carbon trading programme, which since its introduction in 2010 has cut the Japanese capital&apos;s emissions by 7m tonnes by focusing on emissions from buildings.     Sinagore transport Photograph: Land Transport Authority of Singapore    Meanwhile, Singapore&apos;s Intelligent Transport System, which incorporates a range of smart transportation technologies and allow the city state to enjoy one of the lowest congestion rates of a city its size anywhere in the world, was awarded the Intelligent Infrastructure Prize. The old days, when the various aspects of city life were tackled separately, are gone, according to Busch. &quot;A city is like a human organism \u2013 everything has to work together. A comprehensive view of infrastructure, disregarding silos, is the key to the future development of cities.&quot; And while every city is different, they can learn a lot from each other about what works best \u2013 and they are prepared to do so, in a way that national governments do not seem to be. That is why Boris Johnson, opening the awards, said that whoever won the awards, &quot;you can be sure that we in London will shamelessly nick your ideas&quot;. One of the lessons cities have learned is the importance of measuring their impacts. &quot;If you know where to start, then you know where to go,&quot; said Busch. One example of this is the decidedly chilly city of Oslo in Norway, which discovered that along with heating in the winter, cooling buildings in summer was a significant source of emissions. &quot;We were surprised,&quot; said mayor Stian Berger R\u00f8sland, &quot;but it enabled us to look at using seawater for both heating and cooling.&quot; By refusing to wait for action from national governments and international bodies, cities are leading the way in addressing the risks posed by climate change, said Bloomberg. &quot;Using innovative local approaches, cities are having an impact on climate change globally.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

At an age when a lot of artists sink into comforting nostalgia \u2013 making albums that wilfully evoke the albums that made them famous in the first place \u2013 Costello seems instead to have embarked on a quest to find new partners to spark his muse: from Burt Bacharach to Allen Toussaint to Swedish mezzo-soprano Annie Sofie von Otter to octogenarian jazz pianist Marian McPartland. As for the Roots, there&apos;s a reason one online biography of their drummer/producer Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; Thompson opens with the adjective &quot;ubiquitous&quot;. It sometimes seems like the only way an artist with a even passing interest in vintage soul can guarantee their album won&apos;t feature a guest appearance from him is by turning all the lights in the studio off, lying on the floor and pretending to be out when he turns up, perhaps after piling furniture against the door as an extra precaution. In the last few years alone, he&apos;s appeared on records by John Mayer, John Legend, Betty Wright, Al Green, Joss Stone, Duffy, Amy Winehouse, Dido, Corinne Bailey Rae, Joe Jackson, Al Jarreau, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott and Mark Ronson. Nevertheless, a certain sense of trepidation surrounds Wise Up Ghost and Other Songs, which arrives in a sleeve that mimics the jackets of old City Lights poetry editions \u2013 most famously home to Allen Ginsberg&apos;s Howl \u2013 presumably to underscore Costello&apos;s lyrical approach: like the cover, it&apos;s rooted in writing from the past, re-editing and juxtaposing lines from old songs. Perhaps it has something to do with the last major cross-generic collaboration unleashed on the world, Lou Reed and Metallica&apos;s Lulu, an album that provides a fairly definitive answer to the question you suspect artists from differing ends of the musical spectrum ask when they decide to work together: &quot;Well, what&apos;s the worst that can happen?&quot; Perhaps it&apos;s down to creeping disquiet about a middle-aged white rocker teaming up with a band whose background lies in hip-hop, never the most edifying form for middle-aged white rockers to dabble in. Costello, though, has a lot of what the police would term &quot;previous&quot; when it comes to working in black musical genres: the New Orleans blues of his album with Toussaint, The River in Reverse, the taut, Motown-inspired miniatures of 1980&apos;s Get Happy!, the reggae rhythms that frequently underpinned his early work with the Attractions.      Curiously, it&apos;s the latter that Wise Up Ghost most regularly evokes. Although Costello offers a fairly restrained vocal performance here, never unleashing his patent contemptuous sneer \u2013 the one that sounds like his eyes are bulging out of his head with incredulous disgust \u2013 his is still an enormously distinctive voice, which means building the right scenery around it is a tough call. The sound the Roots settle on is sparse, Thompson&apos;s rolling, syncopated funk patterns offset by stabbing guitar and organ, sudden bursts of brass and a host of Jamaican-influenced sounds. Instruments suddenly swoop in and out of the mix, as on a dub album. Opener Walk Us Uptown features a stately skanking bassline; Wake Me Up strikingly counterpoints a vocal so close-miked you keep checking your ears for flecks of spittle with a guitar coated in disorientating echo. That Costello&apos;s lyrical approach automatically invites comparison with the past is occasionally the album&apos;s undoing. Stick Out Your Tongue is a languid retooling of 1983&apos;s Pills and Soap, perhaps the most cryptic of his livid Thatcher-era state of the nation addresses: it&apos;s hard to get around the\u00a0fact that the new version doesn&apos;t have the same menacing drama as the original, which is unfortunate, given that the overall message of the song appears to\u00a0be that nothing has really changed in\u00a0the intervening 30 years. But more often it works to considerable effect. The album&apos;s sound is frugal and full of space, but doesn&apos;t feel airy so\u00a0much as eerie. There&apos;s a queasy, drugged feeling about the music on Wake Up Ghost that fits both the fragmentary lyrics and at least one of their themes. Costello has always been good at conjuring up a\u00a0sense of imminent apocalypse \u2013 from 1986&apos;s Tokyo Storm Warning to The River in Reverse&apos;s Broken Promise Land \u2013 but here the chaos appears to happening at\u00a0a remove from the songs&apos; narrator. Costello frequently sounds like a man experiencing the unreal sensation of watching tumultuous events unfold on TV, aware that however distantly they&apos;re happening, they&apos;ll ultimately directly affect him. &quot;Just because I\u00a0don&apos;t speak the language doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m blind to the threat,&quot; he sings on Tripwire, to a Southern soul backing drifting languorously along behind a\u00a0layer of distortion, &quot;But I thought there was more to forgiveness than we conveniently forget.&quot; The title track is\u00a0more densely packed with sound \u2013 woozy, spiralling orchestral samples, guitars feeding back \u2013 but the effect is\u00a0the same, dreamlike and troubled, heightened by the way Costello sings in a kind of torpid murmur. He might sound half-asleep, but, for a man who\u00a0announced five years ago that he\u00a0couldn&apos;t really be bothered making any\u00a0more albums, Elvis Costello seems\u00a0as animated as ever."}, {"sentences": ["Sometimes the marriage of sentiment and sound is more obvious \u2013 a cod-Japanese twang opens (I Miss the)\u00a0Tokyo Skyline, and there&apos;s an ominous rattle beneath 3 Ways to See Despair \u2013 but it doesn&apos;t undermine the thoughtfulness of their\u00a0restraint."], "tags": ["Manic Street Preachers", "Culture", "Music", "Pop and rock"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-12T21:00:01Z", "title": "Manic Street Preachers: Rewind the Film \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/12/manic-street-preachers-rewind-review", "article": "Eleven albums in, the Manic Street Preachers have discovered subtlety.

This is the 23rd year of the awards \u2013 a spoof of the even more prestigious Nobel prizes, which will be announced next month. The 10 prizes, organised by the humour magazine Annals of Improbable Research and awarded at Harvard University, honour achievements that &quot;first make people laugh, and then make them think&quot;. The joint astronomy and biology prize went to Eric Warrant&apos;s team at the University of Lund for their discovery that dung beetles navigate using the stars. The researchers had been studying the beetles&apos; ability to roll their balls of dung in straight lines by using the moon as a guide \u2013 they use the pattern of polarised light around the moon as a kind of celestial compass.  &quot;One night, however, the night was moonless yet we noticed the beetles could still orient in straight lines,&quot; said Warrant. &quot;At first we were shocked and worried that our previous experiments using the moon were wrong. But then looking up we saw the broad stripe of light that is the Milky Way and realised they might be using this as a compass cue. This, it turns out, was the case.&quot;Warrant said other nocturnal navigators such as birds and moths may also use the Milky Way as a compass.  And there&apos;s a potential practical use too, he added. &quot;The principles we are uncovering in dung beetle navigation may be useful in the design of autonomous vehicles and robots, although this is likely to be few years off.&quot; Masanori Niimi, of Teikyo University in Tokyo, won the medicine prize for his finding that mice given heart transplants survived longer when they listened to particular music. Whereas mice normally survived an average of seven days, those that listened to Verdi&apos;s opera La Traviata survived 27 days. Those listening to the Irish singer Enya survived 11 days. Brad Bushman, of Ohio State University, won the psychology prize for confirming the familiar sense of feeling more attractive when you&apos;ve had a few too many drinks.  In his study, participants had to make a speech about how attractive, original and funny they were, which was rated by independent judges.  Those who were drunk when they made the speech (and even those who thought they were drunk) gave themselves more positive self-evaluations. But the ratings from independent judges showed this was unrelated to actual performance. &quot;Drunk people might think they are more attractive, but they actually are not,&quot; said Bushman. &quot;This false belief may get drunk people into trouble, for example if they come on too strong to a potential romantic partner because they think they are irresistible.&quot; The probability prize was awarded to animal scientists at Scotland&apos;s Rural College for making two related discoveries. &quot;First, that the longer a cow has been lying down, the more likely that cow will soon stand up,&quot; read their citation. &quot;And second, that once a cow stands up, you cannot easily predict how soon that cow will lie down again.&quot; Bert Tolkamp said he and his colleagues were running several research programmes aimed at improving animal health and welfare. In their award-winning research, they fitted sensors on cows&apos; legs that recorded how long the animals spent standing up or lying down. The physics prize went to a study looking at how weak gravity would have to be on a planet for someone to be able to run across a lake of liquid water without sinking. Alberto Minetti, of the University of Milan, and Yuri Ivanenko, of the Italian Research Hospital, suspended volunteers above a wading pool to simulate their weights on different planets under different gravity fields, and asked them to walk on water. Their results showed people could probably walk across ponds of liquid water on the moon but probably not on Mars.  Minetti said: &quot;A serious implication is to stimulate thinking about the discrepancy between the (relatively fast) timing of space exploration and the long-lasting evolution that would be required to adapt actual living beings to locomote in different gravity environments.&quot; The Ig Nobels were handed out by Nobel prizewinners, including the physics laureates Roy Glauber, Frank Wilczek and Sheldon Glashow. Marc Abrahams, editor of the Annals of Improbable Research and founder of the Ig Nobel awards, was due to end the ceremony with the traditional goodbye: &quot;If you didn&apos;t win an Ig Nobel prize tonight \u2013 and especially if you did \u2013 better luck next year.&quot; WINNERS 2013 Medicine Masateru Uchiyama, Xiangyuan Jin, Qi Zhang, Toshihito Hirai, Atsushi Amano, Hisashi Bashuda and Masanori Niimi, for assessing the effect of listening to opera, on heart transplant patients who are mice. &quot;Auditory stimulation of opera music induced prolongation of murine cardiac allograft survival and maintained generation of regulatory CD4+CD25+ cells,&quot; Masateru Uchiyama, Xiangyuan Jin, Qi Zhang, Toshihito Hirai, Atsushi Amano, Hisashi Bashuda and Masanori Niimi, Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery, vol. 7, no. 26, epub.

When I first started playing guitar, I was really into Jimi Hendrix.&quot; He admits that he first heard Hendrix as a teenager on the soundtrack to Steven Seagal&apos;s Under Siege. &quot;But at some point you just want to figure out doing your own thing.&quot; Often, people play him music they think he might like.

He gained some initial notoriety when he arrived in London from New Zealand in 2006 with his band Connan And The Mockasins, the name deriving from his talent for making moccasins out of dirt bike tyres and sheepskin. He was courted by a number of labels, and released some music through EMI offshoot Regal. Although they were tempting him with money, they were also trying to tell him what to do, where to record and who to have as his producer, and that didn&apos;t sit right. &quot;To be honest, most of the stuff that gets pushed out there, the indie stuff, it&apos;s just really terrible,&quot; he says. &quot;I feel embarrassed to be a musician. The majority \u2026 I just can&apos;t handle it.&quot; This might make him sound like some swaggering tool of a frontman, though he is quick to qualify: &quot;But it&apos;s not that I think I&apos;m better.&quot;     Connan's hotel room sesh.

It was really beautiful. She definitely has some interesting stories from her life, but most of all she&apos;s just a really nice person.&quot; He&apos;s about to follow up Forever Dolphin Love with a new album called Caramel, this one having been made on purpose. &quot;I wanted to make something simple. Something nice and relaxed. I liked the name, and the album just came up around that.

The serious economic offences unit, known as the Hawks, sent letters to the Nelson Mandela Foundation, Nelson Mandela Children&apos;s Fund and Mandela Trust demanding financial records including bank statements of family members, trustees and employees. The letter relates to allegations of fraud and forgery made several years ago by Mandela against Ismail Ayob, his once-trusted friend and personal lawyer, South Africa&apos;s Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper reported. It was also sent to the directors of companies set up to manage royalties from the sale of Mandela-related artworks. Investigators initially wanted to raid the charities&apos; headquarters but were blocked by senior police management because of the embarrassment it would cause, the paper added. But it quoted a police source saying that a raid of &quot;offices, houses and business premises&quot; was still on the cards if financial records were not handed over, &quot;whether this will create a furore or not&quot;. Mandela, 95, is at home in Houghton, Johannesburg, in a critical and sometimes unstable condition after spending 12 weeks in hospital. The nearby foundation is the flagship organisation representing South Africa&apos;s first black president: it retains his archive, preserves his office as he left it and regularly hosts events in his name, including next week&apos;s launch of the trailer for the biopic Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. Captain Paul Ramaloko, a spokesman for the Hawks, said on Friday: &quot;We have an investigation under way. It&apos;s not our policy to comment on it.&quot; He declined to confirm whether police raids had been discussed. Sello Hatang, the chief executive of the foundation, said he was also unaware of any planned raids but confirmed receipt of a letter regarding an investigation into Ayob, which he passed on to Mandela&apos;s lawyer, Bally Chuene. He added: &quot;The matter has nothing to do with us \u2013 that&apos;s why we passed it on. It&apos;s not for me to express how I feel because it has nothing to do with us, our work, our conduct and how we execute our duties.&quot; The Nelson Mandela Children&apos;s Fund also acknowledged receipt of the police letter. A spokesman, Oupa Ngwenya, said: &quot;The feeling is always you are open to public scrutiny as an organisation. Any wrongdoing will be pointed out and dealt with.&quot; The saga would be &quot;distressing&quot; for Mandela \u2013 whose clan name is Madiba \u2013 if he knew about it, Ngwenya admitted. &quot;But Madiba would always say no one is beyond correction or the spotlight. He would not say anyone is beyond suspicion. We too should understand we are open to scrutiny.&quot; A source close to Mandela said the police had made a mistake in targeting the foundation and children&apos;s fund, since the key was Ayob and his alleged failure from 2003 to channel about 15m rand in royalties from sales of Mandela&apos;s drawings into the Mandela Trust. Ayob was later removed from the trust after a bitter legal battle. The trust is now at the centre of another court case pitting two of Mandela&apos;s daughters, Makaziwe and Zenani, against fellow trustees including Chuene, the former government minister Tokyo Sexwale and the veteran lawyer George Bizos.

But on his 1991 debut, Sonic the Hedgehog seemed unstoppable. Bristling with high-energy verbs \u2013 spin, roll, streak and ricochet \u2013 Sega&apos;s video game mascot-in-waiting made his rival Super Mario&apos;s clutch of moves seem sedentary by comparison. Leave MegaDrive Sonic unprompted on screen and, after a few seconds, he turns to glare out of the screen, tapping an irritable foot as if you&apos;re wasting his time, keeping him from his mission. Spinning at 200 fierce rotations per minute, Sonic was immediately a source of renewed vigour and direction for Sega, a company whose first decade in the video game industry had been characterised by mediocrity. Indeed, at the time of Sonic&apos;s debut, Sega&apos;s rival Nintendo laid claim to 92% of the video game market share. At the time Takashi Iizuka was a student at the Tokyo Denki university, studying electrical engineering. Iizuka&apos;s peers began to apply for jobs at Sony, Hitachi and the other Japanese electronics giants to where the university&apos;s orderly graduates traditionally progressed. &quot;When I was a kid I wanted to become a manga artist,&quot; he says. &quot;At university I learned to put those dreams aside. My parents encouraged me to look at more realistic options. Everyone was expected to go on to work for an electronics maker. It was almost a set path. But in my final year I decided to revisit those dreams and to focus on what I really wanted to do: create something fun and enjoyable.&quot; That summer Iizuka played Sonic the Hedgehog. &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe the game and the technology on which it ran. It was a marvel,&quot; he says. Iizuka applied to Sega, much to his parents&apos; chagrin (&quot;Sega wasn&apos;t well known at the time. It took a while for my family to come around&quot;) and, in 1992 joined the company and the character, that would come to define his life. Until the launch of Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega&apos;s approach to making video games was to develop cheap and quickly. Mark Cerny, the architect of Sony&apos;s forthcoming PlayStation 4, worked for Sega in Japan at the time, a company he joined after working for Atari. He recalls: &quot;Moving from Atari to Sega was like night and day. At Atari it was all about creativity, if the concept wasn&apos;t 100% original you weren&apos;t allowed to make it. Non-original ideas were thrown out. But Sega was about shovelling the titles out of the door.&quot; Most of Sega&apos;s titles at the time were built within a strict three-month deadline, with a single programmer and one artist. &quot;They made 40 games in this way,&quot; says Cerny. &quot;But by my judgment only two were really worth playing. Sega didn&apos;t get out of that philosophy till Sonic the Hedgehog, where the president decided to put three people on the project for 10 months. They ended up having five people for 13 months. It was Sega&apos;s first million seller.&quot; Sonic the Hedgehog was designed by one of Sega&apos;s artists, Masato Oshima, who worked to a specific brief to come up with an appealing mascot character. &quot;At the time I had never been outside Japan,&quot; he says, &quot;so the experience of moving to America in my first working year was entirely daunting.&quot; And while the first game was a system-selling success for Sega, it was still unclear whether Sega had, in their restless hedgehog, a mascot of Super Mario&apos;s power and appeal. &quot;We had no concept that the character and series would become what it is today,&quot; says lizuka. &quot;For me it was one of those crucial chances we take in life; one of the ones that change everything.&quot; Sonic the Hedgehog 2 vastly outsold its predecessor and Iizuka continued to shadow Naka in America, working on two more sequels. But in 1995 the pair returned to Japan to begin work on a new game for Sega&apos;s 32-bit system, the Saturn. Iizuka was promoted to lead designer and, while Nights into Dreams shared visual similarities with the Sonic titles, it was a dreamy relative, Sonic through a glass darkly. &quot;It was the first time I&apos;d worked on a new IP that wasn&apos;t Sonic,&quot; says Iizuka. &quot;We knew we wanted to create a game that was based on flying, not running, but there were immense challenges doing so within the confines of a so-called &apos;platform game&apos;. How do you make a platform game without any platforms? We went back and forth for the longest time trying to get the design right.&quot; During these years Yuji Naka led the so-called Sonic Team through a string of inventive hits, from Burning Rangers to Phantasy Star Online. But, contrary to perception, Sonic Team itself doesn&apos;t exist. &quot;There was never a set team as such,&quot; explains Iizuka. &quot;Whatever group of people was working on one of Naka&apos;s games at the time were referred to as the Sonic Team. But Naka had a keen idea of what Sonic Team&apos;s games should stand for.&quot; Naka left Sega in 2006 and stewardship for Sonic Team passed to lizuka. What is the Sonic team essence for Iizuka, the quiddity of Naka&apos;s approach to game design and execution? &quot;One of the most important lessons that Naka taught me was the importance of game feel,&quot; he says. &quot;What a video game feels like in the hands is essential. That was there from the very beginning, and still is a core value today. Also, Naka was adamant that we should never be making copies of other games. He would always strive to create new things. That has stuck with me and become my goal.&quot; Iizuka has another chance to prove his adherence to Naka&apos;s rules with the launch of Sonic Lost World on Nintendo&apos;s Wii U next month. &quot;For me it&apos;s a rethink of all that a platform game is and can be,&quot; says lizuka. &quot;One of the main things with Sonic games is speed: we wanted to make this more a controllable game, where that speed can be harnessed in a more effective way than perhaps in the past. It&apos;s a case of trying to marry the speed of the earlier Sonic games with the action of the more recent ones. It&apos;s difficult to keep the classic Sonic feel. But we&apos;ve kept the way that he moves, and that sense of speed.&quot; One key challenge for the Sonic the Hedgehog series in moving from the 2D graphics of the 16-bit era to contemporary 3D is the increase in costs associated with a character who can fly through scenery quicker than most. &quot;It&apos;s true that, when you feature a speed-based character you require far longer levels,&quot; says lizuka. That immediately means the production is longer and development is more costly. Crafting background details keeps the costs up. We&apos;ve tried to keep it to a manageable level while keeping the feel and fidelity of the game world. It&apos;s a balancing act, but one that we continue to improve at.&quot; However, lizuka rejects the idea that Sonic has significantly changed over the past 22 years. He says: &quot;The surroundings have changed. The supporting characters and enemies have changed. But Sonic himself retains the same character as he did in the beginning. I&apos;ve lived with Sonic ever since then. He&apos;s been a part of my life. He keeps me young.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The night before his rain-soaked world title victory in Tokyo Hunt infamously added considerably to that total in the course of a party with 33 British Airways stewardesses in his hotel room."], "tags": ["Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-14T21:00:01Z", "title": "Times have changed since the era of James Hunt's seventies romp | Tim Adams", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/sep/14/james-hunt-times-changed", "article": "When asked by an earnest interviewer in the pit lane during his world championship year what it was exactly that gave him his edge over his rivals, James Hunt thought for a second, and then that unstoppable grin spread across his face: &quot;Bigger balls,&quot; he suggested. That theory is revisited in Rush, Ron Howard&apos;s film about the rivalry between Hunt and Niki Lauda that climaxed during the long, hot summer of 1976. In terms of physical courage no sportsman has ever matched Lauda, who got back into his car six weeks after 70% burns and the last rites, but even so it is clear who is the alpha male of the relationship. Watching Chris Hemsworth in the role of Hunt is to return, for better and worse, to that weirdly hedonistic sporting interregnum of the mid-1970s, when Formula One looked like a fantasised escape from the three-day week. As Hunt asks in the film: &quot;What is the point of winning trophies if you can&apos;t have fun?&quot; Hunt pursued that philosophy to its bitter end. His training regime, as one team principal observed, was essentially confined to &quot;champagne and Marlboros and shagging&quot;, though he pursued all three with some energetic determination. Rival biographers have gravely tried to extrapolate the number of women Hunt slept with in the years he was racing, (his &quot;conquests&quot; as the sexual politics of the time had it); the accepted figure comes in at about 5,000. The night before his rain-soaked world title victory in Tokyo Hunt infamously added considerably to that total in the course of a party with 33 British Airways stewardesses in his hotel room. Brut&apos;s own Barry Sheene, Hunt&apos;s partner in crime, who had lately made the perfect fragrant 1970s union with Stephanie McLean, star of the Old Spice adverts, came along for the ride. Both men became world champions that year. Judged by the standards of today&apos;s sportstars, whose waywardness tends to be confined to wonky tattoos and shopping faux pas, Hunt&apos;s behaviour looks wildly extreme. One of the curious things about those years, however, was that Hunt was just an exaggerated version of what any football team, for example, boasted: the individual doing his best to live the George Best lifestyle. (I supported Aston Villa, and despite the fact that we laboured in the second and third division, there were a good few playboy-pretenders, not least Ian &quot;Chico&quot; Hamilton, whose Monte Carlo aspirations didn&apos;t in reality extend much beyond owning a boutique in the precinct up the road.) As Rush unfolds, a nostalgia-fest that becomes a morality play, it becomes increasingly hard to imagine how our &quot;celebrity culture&quot;, policed by red tops and the bloggers, would have coped when faced with a libertine sportsman of Hunt&apos;s stamina. You suspect \u2013 as with Tiger Woods and his grim catalogue of infidelities \u2013 he would have been destroyed on front page and back before he had even got to the starting grid. Times have certainly changed. I\u00a0once sat on a private jet to Lisbon with Cristiano Ronaldo, asking him questions about his life in Manchester. What did he do with his time away from the training ground? I wondered. He smiled. It was pretty hard for him to go out, he suggested, so mostly he played video games with his brother and his cousin at home. The saddest thing about that line was not only that it was all the most extravagant showman in world football was prepared to give away, but I also tended to believe him. It would be foolish to mourn the passing of that live fast, die young mentality, particularly as it came true in Hunt&apos;s case (he ended up penniless, depressed, a drunk and dead at 46) but it is hard not to feel a tinge of regret for an attitude to sport that has all but disappeared: the idea that even in its life-and-death high seriousness, it was never to be taken wholly seriously. It was another thing that you played at. Every era projects its own values on to its sporting heroes. In contrast to Hunt&apos;s cheerful 70s romp our champions are asked to carry themselves like budding corporate leaders, managing their money and their profile painstakingly, getting plenty of vegetables and sleep, role models of focus and dedication, never tweeting a word out of turn. There are a couple of difficulties with those demands that Rush reminds you of. The first is that by requiring that all sportsmen live up to ascetic standards off the field of play by expecting adrenaline-charged 22-year-old multimillionaires to behave with courtesy and caution at all times, you might just risk denying a few of the more unconventional their freedom on it. Humility is a wonderful quality, but you doubt Hunt would have become world champion without a certain arrogance, a desire to prove himself, in all arenas, the most glamorous male. The other problem is this: the more we want sport to look like work, and for success to be measured by money, then the less appeal it has as an escape from real life. There has been a lot of talk, as ever, in the past few days of the England football team playing with fear, of being joyless. Since even the most experienced players appear cowed by reputation-anxious clubs and corporate sponsors into a kind of glum repression, is it any wonder they play is if their every move is being scrutinised? One joy of great sport lies in the appeal of taking huge risks on the biggest stages because you can. It is, in any case, hard to imagine James Hunt and Barry Sheene muttering bleakly to camera about the overriding importance of &quot;getting the job done&quot; as Steven Gerrard and the rest of the England players intoned to script the other night.

The game is Toybox and the object is to uncover a toy trumpet that Lall\u00e9e has just moved from a box to iCub&apos;s right. For a human three-year-old such a game is child&apos;s play, but until now it has been beyond the scope of most machined intelligences. Not for iCub however. &quot;I will put box on the right,&quot; says iCub, making sure it has understood Lall\u00e9e&apos;s instructions. &quot;You will put the toy on the left. I will put the box on the middle.&quot; Staring intently at the box, iCub reaches out with its left hand, grasps the box and moves it to the centre of the table, uncovering the trumpet in the process. Next, instead of telling iCub to pick up the trumpet, Lall\u00e9e gestures with his finger, indicating different positions on the table where he has moved it. Much like a real child interacting with its parent, iCub&apos;s eyes swivel from side to side, its luminous pink eyebrows and mouth glowing with excitement. &quot;You have moved the trumpet. Found it. You have moved the trumpet. Found it.&quot; &quot;Game over,&quot; says Lall\u00e9e abruptly. iCub tilts its head towards Lall\u00e9e, fixing him with its large black eyes. If you did not know better you would think iCub was disappointed. &quot;Check on my internal state. That was pretty fun. We keep playing this game.&quot; Part of the Chris project \u2013 short for Co-operative Human Robot Interactive Systems \u2013 iCub is at the vanguard of a new generation of social robots that is fast changing perceptions of what human-robot interactions will look like in the future. For iCub isn&apos;t just any old robot. Measuring 93cm, it is a fully fledged humanoid &quot;child&quot; robot equipped with sophisticated motor skills and sense abilities, including vision, sound, touch, balance and proprioception \u2013 the ability to sense the position of its arms and body in space. These facilities enable iCub to crawl on all fours, grasp and manipulate balls and other objects and turn its head so as to follow gestures or direct its gaze. Unlike conventional robots familiar from assembly lines, iCub isn&apos;t programmed to perform a specific set of actions or tasks. Instead it acquires skills naturally by using its body to explore the world and gather data about its relation to objects and people in that world, much as a two-year-old learns by interacting with his or her environment. Through its ability to direct its gaze, grasp and manipulate objects, and &quot;read&quot; gestures as it co-operates with human tutors on shared tasks like the Toybox game, iCub can learn words and skills and develop co-operative strategies. There are even indications that, given time and practice, iCub may be able to develop more sophisticated cognitive skills, such as the ability to imagine the mental states of others [as explained in the box on the Sally Anne task , below]. &quot;We&apos;ve got used to seeing robots in the factory but in the 21st century robots will increasingly be living among us,&quot; says Dominey, whose work in Lyon is jointly funded by Inserm, the French national medical research agency, and CNRS, France&apos;s national scientific research foundation. &quot;These robots must be able to take our perspective and co-operate with us and, if our plans change, they must be able to adjust their behaviour accordingly. Most important of all, they must be safe.&quot; These days you can hardly open a newspaper or switch on the TV without being confronted with the latest robotic advance. From self-steering vacuum-cleaning robots such as Roomba (\u00a3379.95 from John Lewis) to cyborg-style robot suits (such as HAL) and the cruise control in your BMW, suddenly robots are everywhere, invading our offices and homes and, it seems, making increasing demands on our emotional lives. Take Paro, a plush toy version of a baby harp seal. Paro does little more than coo and wag its head and tail, yet more than 1,000 have been sold since its creation in 2003, making it one of the most popular therapeutic robots. And where Paro leads, other &quot;socibots&quot; are sure to follow. For \u00a355,000, Engineered Arts, a company based in Cornwall, will supply you with Robothespian, a life-sized interactive humanoid that comes with an interactive touch-screen that can play greetings, sing songs and converse in several languages.     Simon the Robot poses for a photo shoot at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta, Georgia. Photograph: Daniel Borris/New York Times/Redux/eyevine    Then there&apos;s Simon, an upper-torso humanoid robot with a &quot;socially expressive&quot; head. Developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology, Simon can grasp and release objects, clean up a workspace and swivel its eyes so as to interact with humans in ways that feel emotionally and socially authentic. In tests, using only his cameras as a guide, Simon could tell with close to 80% accuracy whether someone was paying attention or ignoring him. Now, in a development straight out of a Ridley Scott film, the Japanese have sent the first talking humanoid robot into outerspace. A joint project between Tokyo University and the carmaker Toyota, Kirobo \u2013 from the Japanese words for &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;robot&quot; \u2013 is designed to provide companionship for astronaut Koichi Wakata when he journeys to the International Space Station this year. These developments make some people uneasy. Ever since Isaac Asimov published I, Robot in 1950, writers and philosophers have been warning us about the dangers of becoming over-reliant on robots. At the same time, as populations age and it becomes increasingly expensive to provide 24/7 care to the elderly, scientists and commercial companies are convinced that large rewards await the first team that succeeds in engineering a fully autonomous humanoid. &quot;Assisted living is going to be a big industry, and whoever cracks the technology first will be able to export it to everyone else,&quot; says Chris Melhuish, director of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL), the largest academic centre for multidisciplinary robotics research in the UK. &quot;If we don&apos;t invest in social robotics there&apos;s a risk we will be left behind.&quot; Housed in a vast, hangar-like building on the edge of Bristol, the BRL, a joint venture between Bristol University and the University of the West of England, is one of more than 20 labs participating in the European Chris consortium. Inside, researchers from around the world tinker with circuit boards and wires alongside robotic arms and ghostly looking androids draped in plastic sheets. There are robots that can manipulate packages and read food labels; plastic heads that gurn and gurgle when you sit in front of them; and tiny &quot;swarm&quot; robots that can combine spontaneously to solve tasks. BRL even has a robot called Bert 2 that can help someone assemble a four-legged table simply by interpreting gestures and responding to verbal commands. It has yet to master an Ikea flat pack, however. &quot;At the moment it&apos;s pretty weak what we can do, but these are the first steps in the right direction,&quot; says Melhuish. &quot;Human-robot co-operation is not an impossible dream.&quot; To understand how iCub may be bringing that dream a step closer, it is necessary to know something of the history of social robotics and how iCub represents a significant methodological and technological advance. In the past it was thought that the solution to more lifelike robots lay in ever more complex algorithms and codes. The problem is that it is not easy to write a computer code to enable a robot to distinguish a cup from a saucer, or walk around an obstruction, or any of the other myriad daily tasks humans take for granted. But what if, through sophisticated motors and gears, robots could be given the equivalent of muscles? And what if they could also be given touch-sensitive fingers and other sensory equipment that would allow them to explore the world and process information via their bodies? This was the &quot;embodied intelligence&quot; approach pioneered at Massachusetts Institute of Technology&apos;s computational science and artificial intelligence laboratory in the 1990s by Rodney Brooks, a roboticist and entrepreneur who went on to found the company Rethink Robotics. Brooks&apos;s first effort was a stationary robot named Cog with arms that spanned 6.5ft when extended. Brooks gave Cog motors and oscillators so that it could grasp and weigh objects, and microphones for ears. It also had basic speech recognition software and an artificial voicebox. Equipped with only these basic facilities, Cog learnt to manipulate a cube and a Slinky toy through repetitive interactions with students. Cog could also find and name objects it had never seen before. But perhaps the most interesting development was how people responded to it: although Cog had no face, and a lens where his eyeballs should have been, students treated it as if it were human. Yet Cog was completely lacking in social skills. That began to change with the next robot to emerge from Brooks&apos;s lab: Kismet. Designed by Brooks&apos;s graduate student Cynthia Breazeal, now director of the personal robots group at MIT, Kismet was primed with the same basic motivations as a six-month-old child, with built-in drives for stimulation, social interaction and periodic rest. Breazeal also endowed Kismet with abilities such as being able to look for a brightly coloured ball or recognise a person&apos;s face, plus a repertoire of facial expressions that changed according to whether Kismet&apos;s drives for arousal or rest were being met, and that simulated human moods such as happiness and boredom. Kismet was a revelation. Even though it consisted of only a hinged metal head with cartoonish &quot;stuck-on&quot; red lips and eyebrows for expressing emotions, its repertoire was so socially appropriate that people were drawn to play with it, and got the sense that Kismet was reciprocating their emotions. As Breazeal&apos;s work on Kismet was coming to an end, a young Italian roboticist, Giorgio Metta, arrived at Brooks&apos;s lab to work on his PhD. Metta&apos;s focus was not so much on software as mechanics \u2013 improving Cog&apos;s ability to manipulate objects and interact with humans on simple shared tasks. By 2004 he had finished his PhD and gained enough experience to propose a more ambitious project: building a humanoid robot with a much greater range of motion, using open-source design, allowing other roboticists to bolt on their own engineering and software applications. The proposal caught the eye of the European Union&apos;s cognition unit, which agreed to fund the project to the tune of \u20ac8.5m \u2013 and iCub was born.     iCub has sophisticated motor skills, including the ability to grasp and manipulate object. It acquires skills naturally by using its body to explore the world and gather data, much as a two-year-old learns by interacting with his or her environment. Photograph: Massimo Brega/The Lighthouse/Vis/Visuals Unlimited/Corbis    Since then, 25 iCubs have been rolled out to collaborating centres across Europe, the US and Japan via the RobotCub platform. Some, such as Dominey&apos;s facility in Lyon, are focusing on iCub&apos;s ability to interact with humans on shared tasks through language and action; others are more interested in teaching iCub to manipulate objects and acquire new motor skills. What unites these approaches is the insight that human intelligence develops through interactions with objects in the environment and is shaped profoundly by interactions with other human beings. By 18 months, for instance, a toddler can already understand the gesture to pick up a pen. Young children also seem to be primed to explore their environment and interact and co-operate with their carers long before they acquire language. These social and exploratory drives are built into iCub&apos;s operating system. Then, it&apos;s simply a matter of interacting with iCub and letting its body guide it. &quot;In the past if you wanted to teach a robot to recognise an object it was very difficult to write a program to that effect,&quot; says Metta, who is based at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa. &quot;It was a matter of trial and error. Now, with iCub, you can be the teacher and say, &apos;OK, let&apos;s play with this object or do this task together&apos; in a more or less natural way.&quot; For instance, simply through repetitive play, Metta&apos;s team have taught iCub to distinguish a stuffed toy octopus from a purple car, despite iCub never having seen the objects before. By grasping iCub&apos;s arm and rotating it in a certain way, they can also teach iCub new gestures. These are then recorded in its autobiographical memory, meaning that next time it can make the gesture without being prompted. Similarly, through interacting with its human tutor, iCub can be taught new words and concepts \u2013 such as that &quot;left&quot; corresponds to the position east on the table in Toybox. At the same time, by confronting us with questions about what it means to be human, iCub, and robotic systems like it, are fast becoming testbeds for theories about the development of similar cognitive functions in humans. &quot;Until now, robots have been little more than fancy machines,&quot; says Dominey. &quot;What makes iCub so exciting is that it allows us to test our theories about the evolution of social cognition and then feed this knowledge back into the design of ever more intelligent machines.&quot; Dominey&apos;s next goal as part of the Experimental Functional Android Assistant project is to build on the Toybox and Sally Anne studies to see if iCub can be taught to read more complex mental states and develop higher cognitive functions. &quot;The really new thing would be if we could give iCub a sense of self so it could reflect on itself as an agent acting on the world. Then we would have the beginning of some true notion of intention and agency.&quot; Metta, meanwhile, has developed a touch-sensitive skin to enhance iCub&apos;s ability to gauge when it is getting too close to an object and is in danger of hitting it \u2013 a prerequisite for persuading people that it is safe to interact with robots at close quarters. With safety in mind, Melhuish and his team are also experimenting with softer, more lightweight materials, in the hope of building a robot with lower body mass. But what if robots really did become capable of reading our intentions and interacting with us safely? They are being touted as the solution to social isolation and the rising costs of health care, but would we really be prepared to invite them into our homes to look after our parents? To get an idea of how living with a robot might work in practice, before leaving BRL I asked one of Melhuish&apos;s assistants to show me round an assisted living space patrolled by a robot nicknamed Molly. Compared to iCub, Molly \u2013 which looks like an upright vacuum cleaner with a bowling ball for a head and comes equipped with a touchscreen display and webcam \u2013 is a bit disappointing. Molly, which is part of the Kompai range manufactured by the French company Robosoft, does not walk or crawl. Instead it trundles about on training wheels. However, it is capable of a surprising range of tasks, including monitoring your vital signs and navigating to whatever position in the room you happen to be. It&apos;s display also comes with a range of interactive games and tools for testing memory and recall. All this data can be recorded and stored for later study by healthcare professionals. Molly can also transmit images and sound in real time, allowing family members to check on their loved ones remotely. I had only 10 minutes with Molly but was surprised at how quickly I got used to her jerky movements and electronic voicebox. And although she could hardly be mistaken for a real person, I soon found myself talking to her as if she were. According to Dan Davies, whose job it is to take Molly into nursing homes in the Bristol area as part of a Europe-wide study into the viability of assisted living with robots, my reaction is fairly typical. &quot;Everywhere we have taken Molly the response has been great,&quot; he says. &quot;Even nursing staff have been reassured, saying it would be very useful to have a record of how active someone has been when they are not around to monitor them.&quot; Of course, this is a long way from the scenario painted in films such as Robot and Frank, in which a robot is sent to care for an ageing jewel thief (Frank Langella) only to become his companion and partner in crime. And it is even further from the robotic futures imagined by Dominey and Metta. But isn&apos;t that a good thing? After all, wouldn&apos;t it be a little dehumanising, a little sad even, if robots were to become a substitute for family and friends? Not necessarily, says Dominey. &quot;If the alternative is to be in a depersonalised institution, it&apos;s probably better for people to stay autonomously in their home with a robot. We already interact with televisions, iPads and iPhones \u2013 all sorts of machines \u2013 and we don&apos;t consider them dehumanising. Robots are no different.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["A 16th century Japanese screen decorated with drawings of kimonos, seen in a museum, gave Scott the starting point for bandage-tight dresses delicately embroidered with cherry blossom, a Tokyo-inspired take on Le Smoking, with a kimono-wrapped jacket fastened with an obi-style belt, and bento box red tailoring with the origami folds at the collarbone which Roland Mouret has long since used to flattering effect."], "tags": ["London fashion week spring/summer 2014", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Fashion weeks", "London fashion week", "Mick Jagger", "Mulberry", "Cara Delevingne", "L'Wren Scott"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-15T18:51:59Z", "title": "L'Wren Scott eludes Jagger's shadow and Mulberry designer says farewell", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/sep/15/lwren-scott-mick-jagger-mulberry-designer-farewell", "article": "When fashion designer L&apos;Wren Scott moved her catwalk show from New York to London earlier this year, she had one significant concern: &quot;I was worried that in London I would be judged for who I know, rather than what I do. In New York, I am known for fashion.&quot; Scott, a designer with a two-decade backstory as one of the most powerful red-carpet stylists in Hollywood, is still better known in the UK as Mick Jagger&apos;s girlfriend. But London&apos;s high stock of cultural capital persuaded her the time was right for a show here. &quot;People all over the world pay a lot of attention to what happens in London,&quot; she said. &quot;Last year with the Olympics, the Jubilee, every great art show being here, it just felt more than ever like the epicentre \u2013 and as a creative person, that&apos;s where you want to be.&quot; On Sunday at London fashion week the formidable Scott, who stands 6&apos;3&quot; in her handmade brogues, showed for the second season that her clothes are quite capable of stealing the limelight from the diminutive rock star seated next to Anna Wintour.

Photograph: REX/Richard Young    Staging a show at London fashion week, traditionally squeezed between New York and Milan, still has &quot;practical challenges&quot;, said Scott. &quot;You don&apos;t know which models will be in town until they walk through the door for casting, and I find that hard because I&apos;m not naturally a last minute person. I like to be organised.&quot; Scott has an alpha female aura which succeeds in infusing the clothes, drawing like-minded women to them: in the US, Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey are regular L&apos;Wren Scott wearers. Scott will not, however, be drawn on names of potential high-profile British ambassadors. &quot;I love seeing women looking great in my clothes. I don&apos;t care who they are. I don&apos;t quantify people by celebrity,&quot; she said. While Scott was amplifying her voice in the British fashion chorus, another female designer was saying her farewells as Emma Hill, the designer at the helm of Mulberry for the past six years, presented her final collection.     Mulberry designer Emma Hill's farewell fashion week. Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/REUTERS    It was Hill who brought Mulberry, previously an accessories brand, onto the catwalk schedule, a move which transformed the brand&apos;s image and profile. However, after the appointment last year of Herm\u00e8s&apos;s Bruno Guillon as Mulberry&apos;s CEO, there were rumours that Guillon&apos;s ambition to create a fully-fledged luxury brand clashed with the image of down-to-earth, approachable glamour which Hill created. In June, it was announced that Hill would be stepping down by mutual consent. &quot;Mulberry&apos;s essence is its inherent Britishness,&quot; said Hill yesterday, summing up her tenure. &quot;Not as a pastiche but as a real and fundamental part of the brand. Mulberry pioneered the desire for &quot;Le Style Anglais&quot; in the 1970s and that celebration of beautiful, practical things is still a big part of the collection.&quot; The quintessentially British tradition of afternoon tea \u2013 a ritual which, with its crustless sandwiches and miniature cakes, is decorative as well as practical \u2013 set the scene for Hill&apos;s final show, with miniature Wedgwood tea cups sent as invitations and tiers of scones and crumpets flanking the entrance.

My screen-dad Jim Robinson had to pick me up off the ground. That was back in 1985. In those days, Australian soaps didn&apos;t have a great record for longevity: no one expected Neighbours to last more than six months. I was in the original cast \u2013 before Kylie, Jason, Madge and Harold.Most of the very first episode was a night shoot for Danny&apos;s nightmare scene involving the entire cast, so we were shooting in water at 2am every night, really cold. Danny&apos;s nightmare was about Shane who was a high-diver. Danny was always worried Shane would dive into the water and smack his head and die. So there was a sequence of us all in the street maniacally laughing at Danny, with smoke and mirrors and all that happening.That was January 1985. It changed In those days, a soap had to make it in Australia first. There was no going straight to international markets. Neighbours initially aired on Channel 7, but it didn&apos;t take off. Then, after seven months, it was axed. But two months later, Channel 10 decided it might have legs, took it by the horns, did some promotional stunts \u2013 and it took off. The show&apos;s original lineup was the Robinsons \u2013 Jim, Julie, Paul, Scott, Lucy and Helen Daniels, the grandmother. Plus the Ramsays \u2013 Madge, Maria, Shane and Danny. Other than that, it was just Des and Daphne Clarke. It wasn&apos;t for a year or so that characters like Scott, Charlene and Harold Bishop came on board. It became a phenomenon in the UK, of course. It was vibrant: young, good-looking people with sunshine and bright colours and golden beaches. Around Christmastime the UK&apos;s so bleak, so to have this show when Christmas is hot summer and beaches and BBQs, so the sunshine and goodlooking people and happy attitudes appealed. That&apos;s exactly why the show didn&apos;t work in the US. The network tried to sell it in places like California, and they said &apos;What do we need a show like that for?&apos; Neighbours and Home &amp; Away appealed in much the same way, though Home &amp; Away is a lot more dramatic \u2013 they got away with far edgier stories because their time-slot was half an hour later. Censorship on Neighbours has always been heavy. We&apos;re not allowed to show a gun being pointed, and blood is vetoed; the most violence you can have is someone throwing a punch. And there&apos;s a lot of language that can&apos;t be used. When the show started, we weren&apos;t even allowed to say the word toilet \u2013 not at all. So in Neighbours, nobody goes to the toilet. It&apos;s been great being the show&apos;s badass, but for a while, my character got too evil, too moustache-twirling. He was high and mighty and incredibly wealthy because of his hotel chain, Lassiter&apos;s. According to the show, there are five-star Lassiter&apos;s all over the world: in New York, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo \u2013 and Erinsborough. That always amazed me. It also stunned me that he was a multimillionaire yet lived at 22 Ramsay Street. When his villainous ways got too big for the show, the producers thought: &quot;We have to get rid of him \u2013 or give him a brain tumour that&apos;s been festering.&quot; Once it was removed, he was a squeaky-clean nice guy and of course fans hated him. We slowly had to build him back up to his bad old self. We muck up an awful lot during filming. Me and Alan Fletcher, who plays Karl Kennedy, are incredibly naughty children on set. We all play pranks. And we&apos;re a bunch of potty-mouths. Our studio does cost 100 dollars a minute to run, so we can&apos;t muck up to the point that it holds things up \u2013 if we did, the domino effect would be astronomical. Joy Chambers, actor Reg Grundy first met Reg Watson in 1971, when the latter was making the British TV show Crossroads. Later, the two Regs came up with an idea while they were out sailing. They had noticed that there was very little communication between grownups and teenagers, and talked about how this phenomenon had been going on for centuries. Then Reg Watson said: &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be good to do a serial about a street where people actually did communicate with their kids?&quot; Reg Grundy [Chambers&apos; husband since 1971] immediately saw it could be a hit \u2013 with the right family. That was the Robinsons, a widower and his two sons. In an early episode, Scott, one of the sons, asks his gran if she had sex before marriage \u2013 and remember, this is TV in 1985. She eventually tells him she had. That was how Neighbours set itself apart. Also, few soaps had had a female character as ruthless as Rosemary Daniels, the tough businesswoman I\u00a0played. She was the one who found Jim Robinson when he died of a heart attack. That was the funniest scene ever: I still don&apos;t know why the director wanted me to scream his name like that! Alan Dale, who played Jim, wasn&apos;t happy on the show, but he was a good actor who&apos;s now doing very well. It&apos;s the same with Kylie. She learned all about the business on Neighbours \u2013 she has a lot to thank Neighbours for.

The report did not assign blame for the attack but the US, Britain and France said the details on the sarin, the rockets used and their trajectories all proved that Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime was responsible. However, Russia argued that the western powers had &quot;jumped to conclusions&quot; and said claims of rebel use against their own supporters to provoke foreign intervention &quot;should not be shrugged off&quot;. There was also sharp disagreement about what kind of UN resolution was needed to implement the agreement struck by the US and Russia on Saturday in Geneva on dismantling the Assad regime&apos;s chemical weapons programme. The differences \u2013 on whether an initial resolution should include the threat of punitive measures for Syrian non-compliance \u2013 were a reminder that the Geneva agreement could still unravel before it is put into force. Presenting the report, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said: &quot;This is the most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988. The international community has pledged to prevent any such horror from recurring, yet it has happened again.&quot; However, Ban did not say who was responsible for the attack, noting that was not in the mandate of the UN investigation. &quot;It is for others to pursue this matter further to determine responsibility. We will all have our own thoughts on this,&quot; the secretary general said. Presenting their arguments afterwards, western diplomats said the head of the UN investigation team, \u00c5ke Sellstr\u00f6m, a Swedish scientist, had observed that the quality of the sarin used in the attack on western and eastern Ghouta suburbs on 21 August was higher than that used in the 1995 terror attack on the Tokyo underground or Saddam Hussein&apos;s attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja. Sellstr\u00f6m also said the rockets used were professionally made. His report said they were fired from the north-west, and western officials said the details of the trajectories confirmed that they came from an area held by government troops. &quot;All of that confirms in our view there is no remaining doubt that it was the regime that used the chemical weapons. It confirms that the regime was responsible,&quot; Mark Lyall Grant, the British envoy to the UN, said. His American counterpart, Samantha Power, singled out evidence in the UN report on the calibre of rocket used, saying that in &quot;thousands of videos&quot; from the Syrian conflict there was no indication that the rebels had such weapons. Nor was there any evidence that the rebels possessed sarin, she added. &quot;The technical details of the report make clear that only the regime could have carried out this chemical weapons attack,&quot; Power said. The French ambassador, Gerard Araud, echoed her conclusions. However, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, complained: &quot;Some colleagues jumped to conclusions when they said the attack was by government forces. We have not even had a chance to look at the report. We have just had a quick glance. The allegations that it was the opposition cannot be simply shrugged off.&quot; The Sellstr\u00f6m report noted the kind of rockets used and pointed out that they had been fired from the north-west in the early hours when the air was moving downwards, maximising casualties. &quot;Chemical weapons use in such meteorological conditions maximises their potential impact as the heavy gas can stay close to the ground and penetrate into lower levels of buildings and constructions where many people were seeking shelter,&quot; it said. The report said that one of the rockets analysed was an M14 rocket, which had been fired by a multiple rocket launcher. The second was a 330mm rocket. Peter Bouckaert, a weapons specialist at Human Rights Watch, said: &quot;The rocket systems identified by the UN as used in the attack \u2013 truck-launched 330mm rockets with around 50 to 60 litres of sarin, as well as 140mm Soviet-produced rockets carrying a smaller sarin-filled warhead \u2013 are both known to be in the arsenal of the Syrian armed forces. They have never been seen in rebel hands.&quot; The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is expected to meet in the coming days to endorse the Geneva agreement on the disarming of Syria&apos;s chemical weapons stockpile."}, {"sentences": ["/ Follow on Twitter     Clear and Refeshing music blog Photograph: Clear and Refreshing    Clear and Refreshing&quot;Clear And Refreshing is a Tokyo-based blog focusing on indie/underground music and unpicking the sounds and culture of pop in Japan.&quot; Visit Clear and Refreshing / Follow on Twitter     Far From Moscow Photograph: Far From Moscow    Far from Moscow&quot;Far from Moscow is a music portal based at the University of California, Los Angeles; currently it contains articles, audio and video relating to 2,000-plus artists from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.&quot; Visit Far From Moscow / Follow on Twitter     SeoulBeats Photograph: SeoulBeats    Seoulbeats&quot;Based in New York City, Seoulbeats was founded in 2008 to provide the international K-pop fan community a place to discuss and analyze the latest from the K-pop world.&quot; Visit Seoulbeats / Follow on Twitter     Mada Masr Photograph: Mada Masr    Maha ElNabawi @ Mada Masr&quot;Maha ElNabawi is an Egyptian cultural journalist and writer based in Cairo."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-17T15:12:00Z", "title": "New music from around the world \u2013 bringing you the hottest new tracks from all corners of the globe", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/sep/17/new-music-around-world-series", "article": "As part of the Guardian&apos;s efforts to bring you the best new music, today we&apos;re launching a series that sees us partner with some of the best writers and bloggers covering vibrant local scenes around the globe.

On the morning of 21 August, as the air above Damascus cooled, rockets filled with the nerve agent sarin fell on rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital and left scores of men, women and children dead or injured. UN inspectors had been in the country for three days, on a mission to investigate allegations of earlier atrocities. They quickly changed tack. They brokered a temporary ceasefire with the regime and the rebels and made straight for Ghouta. Video reports from the area showed hospital staff overwhelmed and desperate. Never before had UN inspectors worked under such pressure and in the midst of a war zone. The small team, headed by the Swedish chemical weapons expert \u00c5ke Sellstr\u00f6m, was threatened with harm. Their convoy was shot at. But their 41-page report was completed in record time. Sarin was that breed of accident that scientists come to regret. Its inventors worked on insecticides made from organophosphate compounds at the notorious IG Farben chemical company in Nazi Germany. In 1938, they hit on substance 146, a formula that caused massive disruption to the nervous system. The chemical name was isopropyl methylfluorophosphate, but the company renamed it sarin to honour the chemists behind the discovery \u2013 Schrader, Ambros, Ritter and Van der Linde \u2013 according to Benjamin Garrett&apos;s 2009 book The A\u00a0to\u00a0Z of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Warfare. The chemical they created had the grim distinction of being many times more lethal than cyanide. Substance 146 is not hard to make, but it is hard to make without killing yourself. There are more than a dozen recipes that lead to sarin, but all require technical knowhow, proper lab equipment and a serious regard for safety procedures. One major component is isopropanol, more commonly known as rubbing alcohol. Another is made by mixing methylphosphonyl dichloride with hydrogen or sodium fluoride. But methylphosphonyl dichloride is not easy to come by. Under the Chemical Weapons Convention it is listed as a schedule 1 substance, making it one of the most restricted chemicals in existence. Last year, the US and other countries stepped up efforts to block sales to Syria of chemicals that might be used to make sarin. But the country had already amassed substantial stocks of the precursors needed to make the agent. This month, it emerged that Britain had approved export licences to Syria for the sale of more than four tonnes of sodium fluoride between 2004 and 2010, though business secretary Vince Cable said there was no\u00a0evidence they had been used in the Syrian weapons programme. The exports came on top of sales approved last year for sodium and potassium fluoride under licences that were later revoked on the grounds that they could be used in the manufacture of weapons. Though referred to as a nerve gas, sarin is a liquid at temperatures below 150C. To maximise its potential as a weapon, the substance is usually dispersed from a canister, rocket or missile in a cloud of droplets that are fine enough to be inhaled into the lungs. Inevitably, some evaporates into gas, much as spilt water turns into vapour. The chemical enters the body through the eyes and skin too. Sarin has no smell or\u00a0taste and is colourless, so the first people may know of its use is when victims start to fall. Sarin takes such a dreadful toll on the body by interfering with a specific but crucial aspect of the nervous system. It blocks an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase, with devastating consequences. Nerves that usually switch on and off to control muscle movements can no longer be switched off. Instead, they fire constantly. There are mild effects: the eyes become irritated, the vision blurred; people&apos;s pupils shrink, they drool and vomit. Then there are the lethal effects. Breathing becomes laboured, shallow, erratic. Unable to control their muscles, victims have convulsions. The lungs secrete fluids and when people try to breathe, foam comes from their mouths, often tinged pink with blood. A lethal dose can be just a few drops and can kill in one to 10 minutes. If people survive the first 20 minutes of a sarin attack, they are likely to live. Soon after sarin was invented, the recipe for the agent was passed to the German army, which set about manufacturing stocks of the weapon. The agent was loaded into shells, but never used on Allied forces in the second world war. At Nuremberg in 1948, one of the inventors, Otto Ambros, was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to eight years in prison. He was released after four years, and whisked off to the US where he worked as a consultant on that country&apos;s own chemical weapons programme. In military circles, sarin came to be known by a secret name: GB. A unique document from 1952, one year after Ambros arrived in the US, describes the gruesome effects of sarin poisoning after an unfortunate military accident. On the morning of 7 November 1952, a jet aircraft sped towards Dugway Proving Ground in Tooele, Utah. The sky was clear and the wind was a gentle breeze of 3-4mph. Each of the plane&apos;s wing tanks were filled with 100 gallons of sarin. The plan was for the plane to spray the sarin over a target site, but because of a malfunction, each tank still contained 90 gallons of sarin when they were jettisoned in an isolated area of the site at 8.29am. The tanks fell from 2,000ft on to the salt crust of the open desert and burst open as they struck the ground. The sarin, dyed red to help gauge how far it had dispersed, was spread over 38,000 sq ft. An inspection crew was sent out in an ambulance to investigate the site where the tanks had landed. Half an hour before arriving, they all donned gas masks. All except one 32-year-old man. He promptly climbed out of the ambulance and walked towards a crater made by one of the falling tanks. Within 10 seconds, he turned, clutched his chest and made quickly back to the ambulance. He called for his gas mask and stumbled. According to the report: &quot;As he staggered, one arm extended and flexed in a jerky manner. He collapsed upon reaching the ambulance.&quot; Medics swiftly administered a deep injection of atropine into the man&apos;s thigh. This is the standard antidote for sarin, and it works by blocking the agent&apos;s effects on nerves. As he breathed, he made screeching sounds and low-pitched gargles. He had rapid, violent convulsions for a minute, his legs and spine extending, his arms flung above his head. He then fell into a flaccid paralysis and stared straight ahead. Two minutes later he made only the occasional gulp for air. Soon his pupils were pinpoints. &quot;No arterial pulse could be detected by the aid man,&quot; the\u00a0report says.     RAF engineer Ronald Maddison, who died as a result of tests using sarin at Porton Down in 1953. Photograph: PA    The details of the exposure continue, recorded in minute, excruciating detail. Miraculously, the man survived after being hooked up to an &quot;iron lung&quot; resuscitator at a hospital. Nearly three hours after the accident, the report notes: &quot;The patient appeared alert and oriented although he complained of severe malaise.&quot; The man held the unenviable title of the most severe sarin casualty of the time. The US was not the only country to experiment with sarin in the cold war years. The USSR produced the agent for chemical warfare. And Britain took an interest too. A year after the incident at Dugway, a 20-year-old RAF engineer called Ronald Maddison took part in an experiment at Porton Down, the UK&apos;s chemical warfare facility in Wiltshire. At 10.17am on 6 May, Porton scientists dripped liquid sarin on to the arms of Maddison and five others who, for the scientists&apos; safety, were held in a sealed gas chamber. Maddison fell ill and slumped over the table. He was taken to the on-site hospital but died at 11am. In 2004, more than 50 years later, an inquest found that the Ministry of Defence had unlawfully killed Maddison after one of the longest cover-ups in cold war history. Accidents and unethical experiments gave only a glimpse of the horrors that scientists had made possible with the invention of sarin. In the hands of a nation&apos;s military, sarin and other agents were a means to kill swiftly such large numbers of people that the figures are quoted as rounded hundreds, even thousands. Saddam Hussein&apos;s bombardment of Halabja in northern Iraq lasted two days in 1988 and killed 5,000 people. The attack against the Kurdish people was recognised as an act of genocide by the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal in 2010. It was the largest chemical weapons attack against civilians in history. In 1993, 162 countries signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, which outlawed the manufacture and stockpiling of chemical weapons. Gradually, nations began to destroy their stocks, itself a complex and dangerous task. Engineers came up with some blunt but effective ways of dealing with the problem. One is to strap explosives to rockets, shells or canisters filled with chemical agents and blow them up in an armoured blast chamber. Another is to burn the munitions in an armoured kiln. Stores of chemicals held in barrels are incinerated or &quot;neutralised&quot; by mixing them with other chemicals. Sophisticated facilities use airtight vessels and process their waste, but they are a luxury. In Iraq in the 1990s, chemical agents were mixed with petrol and burned in a furnace built from bricks in a trench in the desert.     The emergency service tend to victims of the Aum Shinrikyo sarin attack on Tokyo's subway in 1995. Photograph: Rex Features    The convention did not put the raw chemicals for sarin out of reach. Two years later, in 1995, the Aum Shinrikyo sect punctured bags of homemade sarin in the Tokyo subway. Though only a dozen people were killed, more than 5,500 sought medical help, the vast majority being the &quot;worried well&quot; who feared they had been exposed. The psychological impact did not end with the attack. Kenichiro Taneda, a doctor at St Luke&apos;s International Hospital in Tokyo, recalled the awful realisation that he would have to wheel a young woman who had died in the emergency department past a large crowd to reach the hospital mortuary. So as not to cause more worry he &quot;transferred her by keeping an oxygen mask on her face and covering her body with a blanket&quot;. Physicians who treated the victims of the Tokyo attack ran extensive tests to look for signs of sarin in blood, urine and other medical samples. The tests, and others developed by the military, have become standards for chemical weapons inspectors looking for evidence that sarin has been used. Sarin itself reacts easily with water and so it breaks down when it meets rain, moisture in the air or sweat. The agent&apos;s fragility in water led hospital staff in Syria to uses hoses to drench rooms where they received victims after chemical attacks. For the same reason, sarin does not hang around for long in the environment, or in people. Laboratories can test for the substance, but more often will find breakdown products. The first substance sarin degrades into is isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA), which is generally regarded as proof positive for sarin. But IMPA itself breaks down, into methylphosphonic acid (MPA). Finding MPA in blood or urine is not a smoking gun for sarin: it can come from other organophosphates. Knowing which one matters. The UN inspectors found concrete evidence that sarin was used with lethal effect in Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August. The team plans to go back soon, to visit Khan al-Assal, Sheik Maqsood and Saraqueb, before submitting a final report. That will end another grim chapter in the story of sarin, and open a new one focused on destroying the weapon. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 September 2013. The original stated that just a single drop of sarin can kill. This has been corrected."}, {"sentences": ["Off BTS Nana, Soi Arab (soi means &quot;lane&quot;) bubbles over with sheesha cafes, sandal shops and Arabic restaurants; Soi 12 is home to Sukhumvit Plaza&apos;s tasty Koreatown; and BTS Phrom Phong takes you to the Japanese enclave and the finest Japanese food outside Tokyo."], "tags": ["Bangkok holidays", "Thailand holidays", "Asia", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-18T14:07:00Z", "title": "Bangkok in three days: holiday itinerary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/sep/18/bangkok-in-three-days-holiday-itinerary", "article": "Where to stay For old town charm, check into canalside B&amp;B The Asadang (+66 8 5180 7100, B&amp;B from \u00a366); in Chinatown, Shanghai Mansion (+66 2221 2121, B&amp;B from \u00a350) has a courtyard dripping with coloured lanterns and nightly Thai jazz; while in hip Thong Lor, Salil Hotels (doubles from \u00a335) is handy for getting anywhere on Sukhumvit Road.

Abe&apos;s brief visit to the stricken plant on Thursday \u2013 his second since he became prime minister last December \u2013 comes weeks after he reassured the world that the situation at the facility was under control, amid reports that large quantities of contaminated water were seeping into the Pacific ocean. Abe&apos;s reassurances are thought to have helped Tokyo&apos;s successful bid to host the 2020 Olympics, but were later challenged by a senior official at the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco]. On Thursday, Abe and his entourage, dressed in protective suits, masks and helmets, heard Tepco officials explain how they planned to prevent additional leaks from tanks that have been hastily built to store water that becomes contaminated after it comes into contact with melted nuclear fuel in damaged reactor basements. He also visited a water decontamination facility and a chemical dam being built along the coastline to contain leaks of groundwater into the Pacific ocean. The visit was designed to calm fears at home and overseas about safety at the plant, amid rising doubts about Tepco&apos;s ability to conduct the cleanup operation alone. This week it emerged that US experts had urged Japanese authorities to take immediate steps to prevent groundwater contamination two years ago, but their advice been ignored. Tepco reportedly lobbied against the proposed construction of a barrier \u2013 a measure that will now be taken with government funding \u2013 because it feared the high cost would spook investors and push the firm closer to insolvency. Charles Casto, a representative of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said discussions about a barrier had begun within weeks of the meltdown. &quot;It was obvious to us that there was great deal of groundwater intrusion into the plant, and we shared that with the Japanese government,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;At the time, they didn&apos;t believe there was a significant amount of groundwater getting into the plant.&quot; Abe told some of the thousands of workers at the plant that the government would continue to support the utility during a long potentially hazardous decommissioning operation that is expected to last four decades. &quot;The future of Japan is on your shoulders,&quot; he said during a visit to the plant&apos;s command centre. &quot;The government will step forward and take concrete measures. I am counting on you to do your best.&quot; Later, he said he had told Tepco officials, including the firm&apos;s president, Naomi Hirose, to decommission reactors 5 and 6, which were not in operation when the plant was wrecked by a powerful earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011. Hirose said Tepco, which is hoping to restart some nuclear reactors to help repair its tattered finances, would make a decision on the two reactors by the end of the year. Reactors 1 to 4 have already been earmarked for decommissioning. Abe stood by his recent claim, made before members of the International Olympic Committee in Buenos Aires earlier this month, that contaminated water had been prevented from flowing beyond the plant&apos;s harbour, and that the water crisis was under control. &quot;One of the main purposes of this visit was to see the situation for myself, having made those remarks on how the contaminated water is being been handled,&quot; he said, adding that the government believed the water issue would be resolved by the time the Games are held in 2020. &quot;As I stated in Buenos Aires, I am convinced that the contaminated water leaks have been confined to an area of 0.3 sq km within the cove next to the plant. \u00a0 &quot;In light of that, I will work hard to counter rumours questioning the safety of the Fukushima plant.&quot; Earlier this week, however, Kazuhiko Yamashita, a senior Tepco official, said the water leaks were not under control. &quot;Predictable risks are under control, but what cannot be predicted is happening,&quot; Japanese media quoted Yamashita as telling opposition MPs. &quot;We believe that the current conditions show that [the radioactive water problem] is not under control.&quot; Abe, accompanied by Tepco officials, was shown a water treatment facility that can remove radioactive materials from contaminated water. The equipment failed during an earlier a trial run and is now under repair. The plant&apos;s manager, Akira Ono, said it would be tested again later this year. Abe later inspected a water tank that last month leaked 300 tonnes of water, sending radiation levels in the immediate vicinity soaring. Ono said 90 Tepco workers were patrolling the plant&apos;s 1,000 water tanks four times a day, adding that gauges would soon be installed to monitor water levels in the tanks. Tepco hopes to replace suspect tanks with more reliable welded versions by the end of the year, he added."}, {"sentences": ["Every day I followed it on television and I travelled to Ghent, the city where it happened.&quot;     Black, white and pink metallic bustier, \u00a31,600, Dior Photograph: Joanna van Mulder for the Guardian    As soon as he could he started a personal art collection \u2013 which includes an eclectic mix of contemporary artists such as Sterling Ruby (who designed the interior of Simons&apos; Tokyo store in 2008), sculptor Olafur Eliasson and George Condo \u2013 and he has worked as a consultant for the Cigrang Freres art collection in Belgium."], "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style", "Christian Dior"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-19T13:00:00Z", "title": "Raf Simons: 'I don't have to be the avant-garde kid now'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/sep/19/raf-simons-christian-dior", "article": "It is quite wrong to say I&apos;m a minimalist,&quot; declares Raf Simons, a designer who has been routinely, reverently, described as a minimalist since he delivered his first collection 18 years ago. &quot;I have shown work in my own brand [menswear label Raf Simons] that has been completely not minimal. When I worked at Jil Sander, the heritage of that brand was actually purist. Jil was such a purist she even threw away her own archive.&quot; He pauses to look part impressed, part alarmed by this rigour. &quot;My\u00a0point is, you get stamped all the time: conceptual designer, minimal designer\u2026 but I don&apos;t have to be the avant-garde kid now: I&apos;m not 25, I&apos;m 45.&quot; For a man who has always striven to make his work modern rather than conforming to any particular -ism or -ist, it must be frustrating to be defined by his past. Even if it is a past full of clothes that have been adored by critics and that have had a wide enough impact to affect the way people have dressed, filtering down to the high street in the form of tight suits in the past decade and neon flashes in the present. Though his work at the Raf Simons label, started in his native Belgium in 1995, and as creative director of Jil Sander menswear and womenswear from 2005-2012, played with prescriptive ideas, it wasn&apos;t driven by them.

Something he&apos;s shown in every collection since he became creative director for the house of Christian Dior in April 2012. His new role is one of the most influential in fashion: Dior, the jewel in the crown of LVMH, the world&apos;s largest luxury conglomerate owned by French businessman Bernard Arnault, is one of the few truly global fashion brands. It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a\u00a0job for a\u00a0minimalist. &quot;For me, it&apos;s more interesting to think of what I will not be,&quot; he says. &quot;I will never be theatrical, that I know. Kick me out when I&apos;m theatrical \u2013 I think it&apos;s disgusting. The only thing I haven&apos;t been called is a less heavyweight word. Like nature, or flower, or playful, which is very much in me.&quot;     Denim wool suit jacket, \u00a31,900, trousers, \u00a31,150, and pumps, \u00a3610, all by Dior. Photograph: Joanna van Mulder for the Guardian    He doesn&apos;t look very playful as he says this. Rather\u00a0formidable, in fact, sitting cross-legged and straight-backed in his dogtooth check jacket and slim black trousers, stark against the white panelled backdrop of a salon at Dior&apos;s avenue Montaigne HQ in Paris. He says what he loves is\u00a0dialogue. It is a debate about clothes and the lives of those\u00a0who wear them that he has championed throughout\u00a0his career. He launched his menswear label after working with Walter van Beirendonck, one of the original &quot;Antwerp Six&quot; \u2013 a group of avant-garde Belgian designers whose radical vision influenced fashion in the 1980s. Simons had originally trained in industrial design, but used to sneak away from his work placement at a factory, where he was meant to be designing crates to hold 24 beers, to work for Van Beirendonck. When he launched Raf Simons he used models cast from Antwerp&apos;s streets. He&apos;d run a minibus of these kids along with any family members who wanted to go along for the ride to his Paris show on a fashion awayday. He talked to the boys about their lives and their opinions on his clothes. &quot;These kids, they didn&apos;t care. If one in 40 said [your design] is shit, you thought: he has no taste. If 20 said it, you think: maybe this isn&apos;t what this generation is interested in.&quot; Now he applies the same courteous interest to women buying luxury ready-to-wear from Dior, one of the top houses in the international fashion market. They may be unlikely to tell him his clothes are shit, but these women are just as opinionated as his Belgian kids and he wants to hear what they think. &quot;For me, I work in tune,&quot; he explains. &quot;I love the active/reactive thing. Fashion is a melting pot. I\u00a0need to have a direct dialogue with women, with colleagues, with people,&quot; he explains. &quot;You sniff it up, you hear it, one thing brings you to another. You learn and read from reactions. Because of the size and history of the house of Dior, there&apos;s dialogue all the time, which is fascinating. It&apos;s\u00a0interesting to have dialogue with the world.&quot;     Red wool coat, \u00a33,500, cashmere sweater, \u00a3650, and silk skirt, \u00a31,600, all by Dior. Photograph: Joanna van Mulder for the Guardian    It seems to be working. He&apos;s produced seven collections of modern tailoring, shimmering ballerina skirts and colourful, sexy bustiers; clothes that investigate and innovate the tropes of couture and the feminine ideal that form the legacy of Christian Dior. Clothes that are playful and clever and very wearable. They have also been financially successful \u2013 the brand&apos;s global sales rose 17% in 2012. Though Dior&apos;s original house vision was simple, updating it for today&apos;s increasingly complicated fashion market is no small feat. Simons&apos; approach has been inspired. His last\u00a0two shows \u2013 resort 2014 and couture autumn/winter 2013 \u2013 were bigger and more\u00a0varied than these collections typically are. The\u00a0pieces he presented moved significantly away from the traditions of\u00a0Dior. At resort, the lace and the flowers\u00a0were mixed with zips\u00a0and a sporty feel; at\u00a0couture \u2013 a fundamentally European artform \u2013 African, Asian and American motifs were given equal space on the catwalk. It&apos;s a smart proposition for how a fashion house equally stabilised and held down by the weight of its history can move forward. The focus on couture is particularly interesting. Sales have risen 24% during Simons&apos; time at Dior, and\u00a0though it seems like an archaic artform to most of us \u2013 fashion&apos;s &quot;dusty sister&quot;, as Simons puts it \u2013 he&apos;s fascinated by it. &quot;I\u00a0think choice is a big luxury these days. I want to offer possibility and direction. In couture, when look number one to number 45 is very much about one thing, it&apos;s controlling. It&apos;s not how young people see the world.&quot;     Black and white wool coat, \u00a34,300 by Dior. Photograph: Joanna van Mulder for the Guardian    Though he&apos;s open to new ideas and ways\u00a0of looking at the world, there is one thing Simons has as a constant. The influence of art. This love is at the fore in all his work at Dior \u2013 in the Andy Warhol illustrations that pepper his autumn/winter 2013 collection and the surrealist designs that shape his knitwear \u2013 but it is also apparent throughout his career. His last Raf Simons show was set in the Paris outpost of the Gagosian. The art references during the Jil Sander years ranged from the pop of Yves Klein blue in his 2008 spring/summer collection to the more obscure influence of ceramicist Pol Chambost in 2009. &quot;I need art,&quot; says\u00a0Simons. &quot;I cannot live without it. Ce n&apos;est pas possible. It&apos;s like air.&quot; Art shaped his worldview long before he knew fashion existed. Simons was raised in the tiny village of Neerpelt in the Belgian province of Limburg, &quot;between farms and disconnected from culture&quot;, by his parents Jacques Simons, an army night watchman, and Alda Beckers, a cleaner. He went to a &quot;very dusty&quot; school run by priests and focused on mathematics and Latin. &quot;I was well bored, but I\u00a0took it seriously because my parents said once, when I was 15, &apos;You&apos;d better take it seriously or you might end up doing the things we do.&apos; I always remembered it. So I would sit on a bench doing Latin, thinking, &apos;Shit!&apos; &quot;All I had for culture was a record store and a television. My dad was a sports person, and when you&apos;re brought up on football then, bah, you look for something else. One summer [1986] an important Belgian art curator, Jan Hoet, did an ongoing project called Chambres d&apos;Amis [in which works of art were hung in private homes]. I was intrigued by it. Every day I followed it on television and I travelled to Ghent, the city where it happened.&quot;     Black, white and pink metallic bustier, \u00a31,600, Dior Photograph: Joanna van Mulder for the Guardian    As soon as he could he started a personal art collection \u2013 which includes an eclectic mix of contemporary artists such as Sterling Ruby (who designed the interior of Simons&apos; Tokyo store in 2008), sculptor Olafur Eliasson and George Condo \u2013 and he has worked as a consultant for the Cigrang Freres art collection in Belgium. He thinks that one day he&apos;ll\u00a0move into the art world professionally. &quot;It&apos;s a very beautiful environment.

In a business renowned for neuroticism and bitchiness, Simons has a reputation for being one of the nicest men in fashion \u2013 a man who personally makes sure that journalists at his shows are given the access they need and answers every question with grave respect. Even the one \u2013 which still makes me cringe \u2013 that I asked him about the weather after the resort 2014 show held in May. His driver, who shuttles him between France and Belgium, is given food to take home by Simons&apos; mother when he drops the designer in his homeland. &quot;Well I&apos;m not always sunshine,&quot; he says. &quot;I\u00a0can be a meanie. But I don&apos;t want to hurt people because I know how it feels to be treated badly.&quot; He thinks his attitude is down to how and where he grew up. &quot;I don&apos;t know about hierarchy. I think it&apos;s a psychological thing. But then why should I behave differently to the cleaning lady in the house to Mr\u00a0Arnault [who owns it]?

The reigning Wimbledon champion still wants to play in the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in Greenwich in November but that is unlikely. He has already wiped out his Asian schedule and his medium-term aim is to recover from treatment to be in shape for his annual winter training block in Miami during December. If his recovery goes to plan, he hopes to be fully fit for Melbourne. &quot;Next week Andy is set to undergo minor back surgery in an effort to clear up a long-standing back problem,&quot; a statement from Murray&apos;s team said on Thursday. &quot;He will definitely miss tournaments in Bangkok, Tokyo and Shanghai. The problem flared up during the Italian Open this year when Andy was forced to retire and he sought advice from a range of specialists. After recently playing on hard courts and clay Andy once again sought medical advice about solving the issue once and for all. The aim is to be fully fit for the new season.&quot; A Murray insider described his chances of playing in Greenwich as &quot;touch and go&quot;. Although the surgery will be &quot;non-invasive&quot;, according to a source, it would seem inadvisable to risk aggravating the injury. The Scot, who has been troubled with persistent back pain since the season-ending tournament final in 2011, decided in the past few days that stitch-and-mend treatment is proving detrimental, even though he has won the US Open and Wimbledon titles since. He said in a tweet on Thursday night that he would be &quot;back stronger&quot; and also wrote: &quot;Thanks so much for all the nice messages today... Will let everyone know how it goes.&quot; He was struck down midway through the Rome Open this summer and pulled out of the French Open, a wise choice given his storming performance at Wimbledon, where he beat the world No1, Novak Djokovic, in three sets in the final. However, Murray&apos;s form fell away a little after Wimbledon, in Montreal and Cincinnati, and he lost to a resurgent Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows, where he had gone with high hopes of retaining the US Open title. Murray handled the physical pressure of leading Great Britain&apos;s Davis Cup tie against Croatia last weekend, winning both his singles and partnering Colin Fleming to take the doubles in a 4-1 triumph that put the team back in the elite world group for the first time since 2008. He later declared his commitment to remain in the squad for Great Britain&apos;s opening away match against the United States, straight after the Australian Open. It is clear that Murray and his coach Ivan Lendl look at the Melbourne tournament as the priority now. The option was to manage the injury with pain killers but it became increasingly obvious that strategy would have to be revised once his mobility in big matches made him vulnerable, most obvious in his loss to Wawrinka. The specialist physio Mark Bender accompanied him in New York, in the absence of the recently departed Andy Ireland, but he was not able to play with the fluency he showed earlier in the summer. It is thought the struggle of coming through three matches on the demanding clay of Umag last weekend convinced him he should seek a more radical and lasting solution. He was buoyed by the experience of lifting Great Britain back to the top of world team tennis, but the effort clearly took its toll. The nature of Murray&apos;s injury remains a minor mystery. He has refused in the past to confirm if it is disc-related, and, if it were, he might have to contemplate an extended absence from the game, much the same as Rafael Nadal did when he took seven months out to ease the long-term pain in his knees. It is thought Nadal&apos;s spectacular comeback, which he crowned with victory in the US Open final over Djokovic, convinced Murray to opt for a more drastic solution to his problem. There is no guarantee of surgical success with such an injury but Murray was tiring of the constant reliance on pain killers to get through tough matches. Although he has long insisted it is not a priority for him to reach the No1 world ranking, that quest will take a serious hit as he withdraws from key tournaments over the next two months. It is a brave call by Murray, but a judicious one. It is pointless playing on in pain that can only exacerbate the underlying complaint and, if he returns strong and fitter in January, he will be able to launch a more convincing assault on the major titles in 2014. He is still only 26 and has plenty of time to rebuild. Were he to carry on playing, he could only continue to store up trouble for the future. The increased physicality of the modern game has stretched all players to their limits and the new challenge for those in the top 10, who regularly go deeper in tournaments, is to managed those demands on their bodies."}, {"sentences": ["Multiple specialists have noted that Kennedy&apos;s celebrity would be welcomed in Japan as a sign that Tokyo is an important US ally."], "tags": ["US politics", "US Congress", "US Senate", "US news", "World news", "Japan", "US foreign policy", "Barack Obama"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-19T18:15:36Z", "title": "Caroline Kennedy ready for Japan after smooth ride at confirmation hearing", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/19/caroline-kennedy-japan-confirmation-ambassador", "article": "No serious opposition to the appointment of Caroline Kennedy to be the next ambassador to Japan cropped up after her nomination was announced in July \u2013 and none attended her Senate confirmation hearing Thursday either. Kennedy, daughter of the former president and niece of the late Senate lion, presented a studious and earnest face to a panel of senators whose own features were impressed with deeply collegial smiles. She took questions about the trans-Pacific partnership, the Senkaku islands, and the US base on Okinawa. She answered knowledgeably, if briefly. Many senators offered their congratulations on the post that will be hers after a pro forma vote. &quot;Ms Kennedy has proven herself extraordinarily qualified for the position,&quot; New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand said in an introductory statement. &quot;She has dedicated much of her life to charitable and educational service.&quot; Nominees to ambassadorships fall into two baskets: career civil servants and political picks named by the president to recoup a favor or often many favors. About 30% of appointees, Kennedy among them, fall into the latter category. But Kennedy&apos;s qualifications for the Japanese ambassadorship go beyond the fact that she helped persuade her late uncle, senator Ted Kennedy, to back then-senator Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary race, or the fact that she stood by the president in 2012. Kennedy has demonstrated a commitment to public-spirited causes, notably the improvement of New York schools. She has management experience running large foundations and she knows how Washington works. She&apos;s good at parties. Multiple specialists have noted that Kennedy&apos;s celebrity would be welcomed in Japan as a sign that Tokyo is an important US ally. Critics have pointed to Kennedy&apos;s lack of foreign policy or regional experience. But as ambassador she would not be directing the US response if a Japanese boat sinks in the East China Sea (that&apos;s what Pacom is for). The role is diplomatic. And the confidence that she has the president&apos;s ear \u2013 not the case with many career foreign officers \u2013 could make her more effective in negotiating sensitive issues such as local resentment of the US base on Okinawa. If confirmed, Kennedy will be the first woman to hold the ambassadorship. Her forerunners include former vice president Walter Mondale, former Senate majority leader Mike Mansfeld and former House speaker Tom Foley. &quot;I know that Ted is very proud today to have you here to continue a longstanding tradition of family service to this nation,&quot; senator John McCain told Kennedy, referring to the late senator from Massachusetts.  &quot;We look forward to visiting with you in Japan in the near future at the taxpayers&apos; expense.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["It is not uncommon for patrons to get somewhat misty-eyed while describing the Tokyo Abura Soba, a decadent yet vegetarian bowl of hot ramen noodles, chilli paste, pickled cabbage, nori, and fresh egg yolk that are mixed together into what I can only describe as Japanese carbonara."], "tags": ["Travel", "Top 10s", "Maine holidays", "United States holidays", "North and Central America holidays", "Restaurants", "Food and drink", "Road trips", "American food and drink"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-20T23:09:00Z", "title": "Top 10 restaurants, cafes and diners in Maine", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/sep/21/top-10-maine-restaurants-diners-new-england-us", "article": "Miyake, Portland Impeccable sushi is a really a thing of splendour, and it can take a lifetime, or longer, to master the preparation, even with access to the best-quality fish.

The tune of Changes comes from What A Friend We Have In Jesus, which inspired a disrespectful song favoured by British soldiers in the trenches of Flanders and can also be heard in a country instrumental from Nashville. Music always resists the linear, and linear is broadcasting&apos;s preferred mode of dealing with history; a point underlined in a recording of field researcher John Lomax asking Muddy Waters if he remembers composing a particular blues. &quot;I made it on the eighth of October in 1938,&quot; Muddy answers through the deadest of pans.

Cole knows how to talk about music \u2013 &quot;In Bach you hear the fullness of life, the dance of God&quot; \u2013 but he&apos;s also got a colloquial gear. When told that Bach had an &quot;incident&quot; with a woman in an organ loft he says, &quot;We&apos;ve all been there.&quot; In case you miss the programme I should pass on the old vicar&apos;s joke that the difference between an organist and a terrorist is you can reason with a terrorist.

The first \u2013 white with silver wheels \u2013 crashes through in reverse, while the second \u2013 a black car with a woman at the wheel \u2013 drives head on. The white car pauses briefly as a man in a black bodysuit and balaclava jumps out before the driver hits the gas again. You have to imagine the screeching of tyres as they speed on through the public atrium and reverse the car into the door of the Graff jewellery store. The man in black runs into the shop and another joins him; both are carrying revolvers in one hand and small pickaxes in the other, and have pouches attached to their bodies. The store attendants run for their lives and the men calmly, systematically, start to break through display cases. At each one they seem to smash the glass and grab the jewels in one smooth move. You assume they have done this before. While the security footage resembles a\u00a0movie, really it&apos;s just a typical night&apos;s work for the Pink Panthers \u2013 the most successful diamond-thieving gang in history. At the last count they had committed 341 armed robberies and aggravated thefts around the world, with an estimated value of stolen goods of \u00a4330m. Their exploits have become the stuff of legend, with jobs ranging from London to Tokyo, Geneva to Singapore. The gang, a\u00a0loosely affiliated network of an estimated 200 to 220 people, pull off jobs with precision and style, dressing as golfers for one job, Hawaiian tourists for another, workmen for one more. They can escape by speedboat, scooter or bicycle depending on the location, and take full advantage of soft borders and false documents. They know that as long as they get back home \u2013 to various Balkan countries \u2013 they will be safe, protected by either corrupt or hopeless officials. The Dubai robbery was stunning for the amount they stole ($3.4m), the time it took (in 170 seconds they had left the store, jumped back in their cars and left the building), and the precision of their planning. The gang only drives Audis \u2013 you can&apos;t do a robbery driving a car you don&apos;t know; it&apos;s too risky. But Audi was a make virtually unknown in the Middle East in 2007 and getaway cars have to be found and stolen just hours before a robbery. The S8 is the brand&apos;s flagship high-performing car: so rare was the model in Dubai that one of the cars was stolen in the neighbouring emirate of Abu Dhabi and driven across the border. The thieves reverse-rammed the car so the airbag wouldn&apos;t open on impact and so that the car was in the perfect position to drive away. They planned the timing of the heist (9pm) at the end of the rush hour, knowing that when they fled down the highway the lanes in the opposite direction \u2013 from where the police would come \u2013 would be jammed. They drove to a deserted, unlit patch of land between two mansions \u2013 just minutes away from the royal palace \u2013 and set fire to the two cars. In a now completely unknown third car, they drove calmly into the night with their multimillion-dollar booty. So who are the Pink Panthers? I have been trying to answer that question for three years, since I first arrived in Belgrade to shoot a documentary on them. Armed with two phone numbers, I travelled down to Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, to try to track them down. My contact had arranged various introductions, and I was told to go alone and with no mobile phone to a deserted war memorial on the outskirts of town. It was a good spot for a meeting: private, discreet, hidden by trees. As I waited, I realised it was also a good spot for a drug deal, a heist or a murder, which was when I got nervous. A beaten-up blue Peugeot estate pulled up alongside me. &quot;Please excuse my car,&quot; said a man in perfect English. &quot;We like to travel quietly down here.&quot; This was Novak, a tall man in his 50s wearing white trousers, a pink polo shirt and a gold tooth. I got into the car and we drove to a local bar. He explained he was an alarms and electrics specialist for the Pink Panthers. He&apos;d been looking forward to meeting me, he said; he loved journalism \u2013 he had been a local fixer for newspaper hacks during the wars of the 1990s. He smuggled reporters in, got them false documents and researched their stories. It was the perfect training ground for his current work: strategic thinking, adrenalin, cash, danger. And also, according to Novak, a moral high ground. There are &quot;no victims to what we do&quot;, Novak told me. &quot;We scare people but we do not hurt them. We only take expensive things from rich people.&quot; It&apos;s the mythology the Pink Panthers try to promote, and he has a point: despite the fact that they terrify the life out of people working in the shop, until last year no one had been seriously injured in a Pink Panthers robbery.     Daylight robbers: (from left) suspects in the Dubai robbery Dusko Poznan, Bojana Mitic and Milan Ljepoja.  Photograph: Observer    My meeting with NOVAK opens doors. A few weeks later I meet Mike at a bar on the coast in the height of summer: he is darkly tanned, in navy shorts and boat shoes. Apart from the scars on his arms, he would walk the Croisette well. He, too, is wearing a pink polo shirt. We joke: it&apos;s the equivalent of a carnation on a\u00a0blind date. &quot;I don&apos;t have a badge that says Pink Panther on it,&quot; he chuckles. &quot;It&apos;s nothing to do with us, this name. But I do like those films\u2026 Everyone in the Balkans knows The Pink Panther.&quot; It was the Daily Mail which named the gang after Peter Sellers&apos;s famous Inspector Clouseau film, after two thieves pulled off the largest jewel heist in British history at Graff, the Bond Street jewellers, in 2003. Within days Scotland Yard had identified a Montenegrin man living in Bayswater. When they raided his London flat they found, among other things, a\u00a0blue diamond ring worth $750,000 in a tub of face cream. Mike is a safe-cracker. He learned his trade while apprenticed as a teenager to a Kosovan criminal in Italy. &quot;Mechanical, numerical, digital ones \u2013 I can crack them all. Digital safes are the easiest: you just dust them and see the fingerprints and you know everything. Numerical ones are the hardest: you have to have very good hearing and a very good memory.&quot; Mike is also very paranoid. This, he tells me, is &quot;a hazard of the job&quot;. He pops Valium like aspirin. The mainstream concept of a\u00a0&quot;mafia&quot; is entirely informed by what we know of the Italian families \u2013 a strict hierarchy, a top dog, initiation ceremonies, and a lot of murder. The Pink Panthers are very different. &quot;We are a network of teams working together,&quot; Mike tells me. &quot;As soon as I got involved I\u00a0became part of the network.&quot; The structure is likened by Interpol to al-Qaeda \u2013 the ultimate contemporary crime gang \u2013 in that it is a\u00a0series of cells that come and go overnight, working independently. They share methods, they share contacts and they share origins, but it is to everyone&apos;s advantage that links are thin. &quot;There is an inner circle,&quot; explains Mike, &quot;who have been doing this a long time, and we call each other family, but there are guys who don&apos;t know who their bosses or associates are. You have to be with them a long time dealing with the bigger jobs. You get tips from your supervisor \u2013 but there is also a wider chain of people. You don&apos;t know where you stand in the hierarchy because you never meet the &apos;boss&apos;. There is no &apos;Big Boss&apos;.Everyone has their specific job to do, so we all depend on each other.&quot; You can&apos;t visit the Balkans without recent history looming large. Many, many people are still furious or bitter or heartbroken, scarred by the vicious, terrible wars. Buildings in Belgrade are still bombed out. Factories lie empty, crumbling as poverty-stricken townsfolk remember the golden days of Yugoslavia. The people who aren&apos;t angry are the ones\u00a0who either got away or made money from that period. The Panthers did both. Mike was a classic example. A boy and teenager under Tito, he grew up in a communist dream: enough to eat, a great education, an excellent athlete and proud of his glorious nation. But after the death of Tito in 1980 Yugoslavia began to fall. Republics began to compete, and a very nasty nationalism became the political weapon of choice. &quot;I was ethnically Albanian, but living in Serbia,&quot; says Mike. &quot;The hatred became visible. Just pure hatred. Everything was cracking open.&quot;     To catch a thief: filmmaker Havana Marking in the CCTV room at the Wafi Mall in Dubai. Photograph: Observer    As Yugoslavia collapsed around them, the fate of the nation became apparent: conflict, militias and a total criminalisation of the state. It was the 1992 UN sanctions against Yugoslavia that really determined the fate of the Pink Panthers. Entire industries in Serbia collapsed, creating a generation of people either forced or willing to take part in criminal activities. Once you have to smuggle food, soap or diesel to make life possible, what&apos;s to stop you smuggling arms, drugs and people to make life profitable? It paved the way for the hugely powerful international heroin, sex and gun gangs that still trade today: the small and mostly localised smuggling routes over the mountains, across lakes and between bays became international pathways. A few years later, diamonds joined the routes. I asked people I met in the region what they thought of the gang. And while almost everyone acknowledged that stealing was wrong, the statement was usually followed by a glint in the eye and a sentiment along the lines of: &quot;You have to admit they are good at it.&quot; One man in a marketplace became passionate: &quot;If I was the government, I would encourage the Panthers to go and hit all the foreign jewellers, under one condition: that they bring the booty home!&quot; He saw the robberies as revenge for the Nato bombings and UN sanctions of Serbia in the 1990s \u2013 &quot;England, America, France, Japan\u2026 they ruined this country.&quot; I had asked Mike about women in the gang. They are usually hardly mentioned in\u00a0the reports of the robberies. I had been told by Interpol officers in Belgrade that they were mere eye candy, irrelevant to the actual job. On\u00a0the contrary, Mike said. &quot;Women in the\u00a0Panthers have to be exceptional. We have\u00a0high requirements of them because they have the leading roles, but you can only have one in each gang. She has to be intelligent. She\u00a0has to be beautiful. And she has to love money very much\u2026&quot; And so Mike introduces me to Lela, a past associate and friend of his. She is extremely pretty, in her 40s and dressed in black from head to toe, with a lot of leather and fur. &quot;Not anyone can do this job,&quot; says Lela. &quot;You must be born to do it. The guys do the majority of the job, but they need a\u00a0woman on their team. Without a woman nothing could be done.&quot; Lela&apos;s job was to scout the target shops before a job. She would enter in the guise of a\u00a0customer and furtively examine everything she could. On leaving, she would meet with an artist who would sketch the plan of the shop \u2013 down to the nearest centimetre. &quot;If I made a\u00a0mistake, they would be doomed.&quot; The surveillance could take months, not to mention a lot of money. &quot;She had to be dressed in the most expensive clothes and elegant jewellery,&quot; says Mike. &quot;She had to have her own chauffeur. She had to be like Madonna!&quot; It also required frequent &quot;transformations&quot; for her multiple identities: &quot;Hairdressers would come to my house,&quot; recalls Lela. &quot;I&apos;d be sometimes blonde, sometimes brunette, redhead.&quot; Sounds glamorous, I say. &quot;No,&quot; she shoots back, &quot;I hated it! I felt like I would lose my identity. Like a doll who was experimented on.&quot; Maybe it&apos;s because she&apos;s been unable to tell her friends and family about her work, but our conversation is beginning to feel like a therapy session. She tells me that she later had a nervous breakdown. For Mike and his team, once they have stolen the diamonds, their job is done. The selling and carrying of diamonds is too risky: you have to pass them immediately to a prearranged contact, who will take them across borders to buyers, often in Antwerp. They know who in advance will buy what and for how much. The Pink Panthers receive around 15% of the value, the courier 5%. Then there&apos;s the fence, the man who disguises the diamond, &quot;legalises&quot; it and resells it back into the market. Mr Green, a Bosnian Serb, is a very small man, with none of the swagger of the previous crooks I have met. He is fed up with the Panthers getting the glory. &quot;They just do the street work,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Without people like me they&apos;d be nothing.&quot; He estimates that he receives 30-40% of the diamond&apos;s market value. Mr Green tells me that he grew up a peasant woodcutter and joined the JSO, an elite Serb paramilitary unit. Led by Arkan, a notorious henchman of Slobodan Milosevic, the militia was feared across the region. He shows me his maroon beret with pride and I start to feel uncomfortable. &quot;I wasn&apos;t on the frontline,&quot; he says, &quot;I was more in the background.&quot; This does not mean a back-office job. He was, he explains, &quot;responsible for the liquidations of the terrorists&quot;. He seems unrepentant about his murderous past. He is the most frightening man I have met. Everyone who was in the special forces has &quot;business contacts&quot;, he explains. Those contacts stretched to West Africa, the home of many diamond mines, and to Antwerp, where Mr Green later set up a diamond business. His team re-cut the diamonds and create new certificates of origin, stating that each stolen diamond was mined in Sierra Leone recently. The diamond is usually untraceable. The Kimberley Process Certification System was set up in an attempt to stop the blood diamond trade. &quot;In the end it just made it easier for us: we simply forge those certificates of origin and create a &apos;new&apos; diamond.&quot; The diamonds of very high value will usually make it back into the legal trade &quot;on the hands of brides&quot;, he tells me, but the smaller ones have become the currency of the global black market. &quot;You can have a pocketful of diamonds and buy a boatful of cocaine. Now any cash payment over \u00a415,000 has to be traced electronically \u2013 but who controls diamonds? No one.&quot; Mr Green is right about one thing: the Panthers do get the press. They drive like stunt men. Their robberies resemble movies. But they also get the heat, leaving the big money and the wider criminal networks untouched. The Pink Panthers&apos; crime spree in its current guise of hit and runs took off in 2000, then taking full advantage of the new systems in the diamond trade. And while they could exploit the soft borders of Europe and their own countries&apos; corruption, the Panthers seemed untouchable for a while. It was only when various European police forces, notably in Monaco, Switzerland and France, connected that the Panthers were first thwarted. In 2007 Interpol created the Pink Panther Working Group. For the first time global police forces were able to share and spread their information. The spectacular Dubai robbery of 2007 was one of their first successful cases. The Wafi Mall heist would have been perfect, but for one mistake: when they burned the getaway cars someone forgot to open a\u00a0window. No oxygen means the fire can&apos;t rage as it should and so Dubai police managed to retrieve a good deal of DNA evidence. With the help of Interpol the DNA was traced to Dusko Poznan, a 30-year-old Bosnian and Milan Lepoja, from Montenegro. Both were wanted for heists in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In 2008 Poznan was caught after a car crash in Monaco, and Ljepoja after a dramatic police chase on the borders of France and Switzerland. Both are now serving sentences in Liechtenstein and awaiting trial for the Wafi Mall heist. The woman who drove the second car is still at large. The unusual level of cooperation from the police forces, which has coincided with a\u00a0political period of cooperation from the Balkans itself, has begun to have an impact. Since 2007, 189 Panthers have been arrested \u2013 59 were caught last year. With Montenegro and Serbia keen to join the EU, it&apos;s no longer safe back home. &quot;It&apos;s much more dangerous,&quot; says Mike. &quot;The police know all the tricks. We live much quieter lives now.&quot; Mike and Lela have both retired. When I went to find Novak again, he had been arrested. And as the more experienced thieves cut their losses and return to the quiet life, police have identified a new generation of thieves taking over. They have none of precision or care associated with the older Panthers. Detective Inspector Jan Glassey of the Swiss Police Intelligence showed me CCTV from a\u00a0recent robbery in Geneva. The thieves enter with much more violence, they don&apos;t have bags, they drop things, they panic and leave their gun on a table. &quot;It is then that accidents happen,&quot; explains Glassey. &quot;That is much more worrying for us.&quot; Indeed the Pink Panthers have now had their first shooting: a policeman was wounded during a chase in Greece last year. Two men and a woman had been surveilling the jewellery store they planned to rob, but the wigs they were wearing aroused the suspicion of a\u00a0police patrol, who stopped them for questioning. They fled the scene, shooting and injuring an officer, and all three were later caught (although the female accomplice \u2013 who turned out to be a former national basketball player \u2013 managed to break out of prison and is still on the run). You wonder what Mike and Lela would make of it \u2013 getting found out because your wigs aren&apos;t convincing enough. The fact that the thieves were not even caught on the job, but a mere recce, suggests that standards are slipping. But as long as Mr Green and his associates are able to pass stolen diamonds off as new, there will remain a currency in demand throughout the criminal world. And somehow, somewhere, people will be trying to get their hands on them.

The Department of Agriculture, which looks after quarantine matters, told Guardian Australia the snake had been identified as a Mandarin rat snake commonly found in Asia. It had been euthanised &quot;as exotic reptiles of this kind can harbour pests and diseases not present in Australia&quot;, a spokeswoman said. She praised the Qantas staff for their actions. &quot;This find demonstrates the important collaborative efforts of Department of Agriculture and airport staff in identifying and containing serious biosecurity risks.&quot; As to whether it was the only serpent on board, Qantas didn&apos;t take any chances. &quot;They used another aircraft to operate that service and the existing B747 will be fumigated before re-entering service,&quot; the Qantas spokeswoman said. She said she believed passengers had been made aware of the reason their flight was delayed. It&apos;s the second time this year a snake has been found on a Qantas flight.

GTA V Disappearing Vehicles Being Investigated by Rockstar | IGN Has this happened to you?  Rockstar is aware of issues Grand Theft Auto V players have encountered with customized cars disappearing from their garages and is investigating the issue, according to a support page on its website. Some players who have customized a vehicle and stored it in a garage have found that vehicle is missing after completing a mission. Rockstar has not yet developed a fix for the problem, but in an update on the issue&apos;s support page, Rockstar did offer up some information that can help players to avoid running into any problems with disappearing cars.

Xbox One: &quot;Our long term vision hasn&apos;t changed at all&quot; | GamesIndustry International Here&apos;s Xbox exec Phil Harrison confirming what Phil Spencer told me last month \u2013 that the manufacturer hasn&apos;t changed its central philosophy of a hyper-connected console with a digital future:  Our long term vision hasn&apos;t changed at all. We haven&apos;t diluted our long term vision, which is all of the benefits of a connected ecosystem and what that means for all of the stakeholders - us, developer, publisher and crucially, the player. None of that has changed. What we recognised was when you put a disc slot in the front of a machine certain expectations come with that disc slot. We had to adapt some of our policies and it was best that we did those before we launched, which we&apos;ve done.   He also mentions that you shouldn&apos;t expect many indie titles on the console this year:  I don&apos;t think we&apos;re going to see things at launch. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s realistic to see a developer get the programme and build a game and get it into the market on November 22.

Greyish white, it straddles the boundary between the yellow line of the road and the Tarmac. Really, it looks nothing like spit \u2013 but now it&apos;s famous spit. Possibly even celebrated spit.

Along with another man, Zilvinus Vitkas, Thomas last week became the first person to be successfully prosecuted by a council in England for spitting in public, when Thames magistrates court endorsed Waltham Forest council&apos;s view that spitting was a sub-genre of litter. But is spit litter, and is it even a health hazard? To Ross Coomber, professor of sociology at Plymouth University, spit is a many-faceted thing. He is conducting an international spitting survey and spent the summer travelling in Mumbai, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai, comparing the public spitting habits of different nations. He found that &quot;the three most significant spitting nations are India, South Korea and China&quot;. (For would-be students of spit, the spitting in Mumbai was mainly connected to the chewing of betel nut, in South Korea it was closely linked to smoking, and in China to a distaste for swallowing.) In comparison, he says, spitting in the UK is not as prevalent as people tend to believe. &quot;What we are seeing is an exaggerated response to a moderate problem.&quot; For Coomber, attitudes to spitting are based upon &quot;an argument about morality, about what people would prefer to see&quot;. He says that links between &quot;spitting on the ground and public health [are] almost unevidenced&quot;. John Middleton, vice-president of the Faculty of Public Health, would not go that far. &quot;The actual risk to other people in the current circumstances may be very small but it does represent something unnecessary and unpleasant. There are reasons for believing that there is a low level of risk to public health [in terms of] communicable viruses and bacteria \u2013 respiratory viruses, colds.&quot; He cites the possibility of someone treading on spit and then taking their shoes off later; or someone putting spit-addled shoes on the bus seat, and another passenger putting their hand on the seat. Middleton worries that he &quot;wouldn&apos;t want to overstate the health consequences&quot;. Perhaps Coomber is right: this is scarcely about health at all. Waltham Forest council appears to concur: on its website it describes spitting as &quot;antisocial and dirty&quot;, &quot;disgusting and unacceptable&quot;, but there is no mention of health risks. Coomber, who used to spit in public as a teenager in south-east London, says he &quot;doesn&apos;t like&quot; spitting, but points out that, historically, Britain is a nation of spitters. &quot;There are reports of people spitting in parliament right up to the end of the 19th century. I like to remind people that we were still building pubs in the 1930s with spitting troughs at the bottom of the bar.&quot; Punks gobbed at bands on stage. Sports stars spit: cricketers too. People spit when they are cycling or running. Some might practise what Coomber calls &quot;socially responsive spitting&quot; \u2013 spitting when no one is there to see it. Perhaps public spitting is a more ingrained part of British culture than people like to admit.

Tourists can expect to pay more than \u00a390 for a three-course meal for two even in far-flung parts of Australia such as Darwin, said the Post Office, compared with less than \u00a330 in Bali. A steep fall in the value of the South African rand has made holidays in Cape Town among the cheapest for those seeking winter sun. Sterling has risen 20% against the rand since last year, sending South Africa six places up the league table of 32 long-haul destinations to take runner-up spot. While a bottle of local lager would set you back an average of \u00a34.26 in Auckland, New Zealand, it costs \u00a31.33 in Cape Town.     Table Photograph: Table    Other cheap destinations include Vietnam and Thailand, but the figures reveal that price variations are not just about the local level of economic development. For example, prices in Tokyo, once the world&apos;s most expensive city, are below those of Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and even Costa Rica, the Post Office found. A basket of holiday goods \u2013 from suntan cream to insect repellent, plus food and drink, would cost \u00a3106.08 in Tamarindo, Costa Rica, compared with \u00a3103.58 in Tokyo. Meanwhile, prices in US locations such as San Francisco and Washington DC are below those of Rio de Janeiro and Beijing. Sri Lanka, which was the cheapest long-haul destination in 2012, has experienced a surge in prices making it more expensive than Thailand. The mighty Australian dollar which, despite a 10% setback, remains one of the world&apos;s strongest currencies, has made holidays in there almost prohibitively expensive. The Post Office found that a small chocolate bar (Mars Snickers) would cost \u00a31.81 in Darwin but only 48p in Orlando, Florida. A bottle of Coca-Cola is \u00a32.66 in Auckland but only \u00a31.27 in New York. Overall, the recent recovery of sterling against most major currencies has made winter sun holidays on average better value than last year, with prices down in sterling terms in half of the destinations surveyed. Jamaica saw the biggest prices falls, of around a third since 2012. &quot;After a summer when sterling bought less holiday cash for trips to Europe, winter sun tourists can look forward to seeing their pounds stretch further in many of the most popular long-haul destinations,&quot; said Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money."}, {"sentences": ["In a sense, the very title of the Tokyo Game Show might be construed as a misnomer.", "Xbox One is go: visitors get hands-on experience at the Tokyo Game Show.", "Proving that, pummelled by the noise of dozens of franchises all competing to offer variations on themes well-trodden that could, no doubt, be heard back in Tokyo itself, sometimes there really is something to be said for staying on the margins."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Culture", "Sony", "Microsoft"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-28T23:05:16Z", "title": "Tokyo Game Show 2013 \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/29/tokyo-game-show-2013-review", "article": "In a sense, the very title of the Tokyo Game Show might be construed as a misnomer. The conference actually takes place in the cavernous halls of Chiba&apos;s Makuhari Messe convention centre, more than an hour&apos;s travelling time from the neon and skyscrapers of Japan&apos;s capital. But this year, with Sony and Microsoft going head to head, it seems apt that the city that attracted no less than Godzilla&apos;s attention should, in name at least, host two gaming behemoths before their new consoles launch in November. Sony, at its home fixture, chose to make the most of the event and the record number of more than a quarter of a million people who attended. An intriguing opening was the demonstration of the new PlayStation app, which will go live in November. Designed to operate on Android or iOS devices, it will allow players to connect by sharing invitations and content but also act as a second screen, similar to the Wii U tablet or Xbox SmartGlass, not only to enhance the play on the console but also to access different forms of gameplay. It looked like fun, but, as always, how it is developed will be crucial. Hardware rumours about the PlayStation 4 were also cleared up, with confirmation that the PS4 camera, which will not ship with the device (keeping the price down), will allow voice and gesture controls to be used. How it will work in gaming terms seems yet to be determined. Sharing game footage through HDMI will also be made available in the future, which will be popular with gamers who post action online, but for the throngs of otaku (geeks) and costumed players it was the new software that proved irresistible.     Dead Rising 3: looking enjoyable in co-op mode.    The decision to allow an inexpensive upgrade to purchasers of the PS3 versions of Assassin&apos;s Creed IV: Black Flag, Battlefield 4, Call of Duty: Ghosts and Watch Dogs (all drawing crowds at the show stand) for the next-gen iterations will doubtless be popular and contribute to the 5m PS4s the company expects to sell by the end of the financial year. More intriguing was the company&apos;s reiteration of its dedication to indie developers, visualised in the press conference by a large pixelated heart. It was ably demonstrated in a hands-on with Hohokum (out 2014), a non-linear visual feast, at once relaxing and playful, that draws the player in with its explorative gameplay. Sony is convinced that indie titles can sell consoles and certainly it should be admired for trying. Hohokum is unlikely to attract headlines but is as pleasing an alternative to staring down the sights of an assault rifle as might be imagined. Elsewhere of interest to UK gamers was the unveiling of the new slimline PS Vita, a lighter upgrade (release in Britain to be confirmed) and the PS Vita TV (currently to be released in Japan only). This phone-size device runs Vita, PSP and PS1 games via a DualShock controller on a TV, but will also stream PS4 or Vita games to a different TV on a home network. Microsoft&apos;s show was more low key, although its display offering Japanese fans hands-on experience of many next-gen titles for the first time did good business. With the Xbox One suffering from changes in philosophy earlier in the year, the focus here was firmly on software, and outside the already announced big-hitters such as Fifa 14 and Call of Duty there was new gameplay on show for Crimson Dragon, which appears to be ticking all the right boxes for fans of on-rails dragon shooters, and also for Dead Rising 3, the latter looking particularly riotous and enjoyable in co-op mode.     Xbox One is go: visitors get hands-on experience at the Tokyo Game Show. Photograph: Yoshikazu Tsuno/ AFP/ Getty Images    While both were impressive, what caught many attendees&apos; attention was Dark Dreams Don&apos;t Die (or D4), an episodic adventure game exclusive to the Xbox One from Hidetaka Suehiro, (popularly known as Swery65) who made Deadly Premonition. Here was the innovation and experimentation the new generation deserves. Controlled by Kinect (although also playable via a controller) using a point-and-click and voice-activation method, this is a stylistically unique, bizarre game and although unlikely to crack the mainstream, it suggested a willingness to take these consoles somewhere new. Proving that, pummelled by the noise of dozens of franchises all competing to offer variations on themes well-trodden that could, no doubt, be heard back in Tokyo itself, sometimes there really is something to be said for staying on the margins. Best in show Deep Down (PS4) Hugely atmospheric dungeon-based action adventure. There&apos;s hacking and slashing and some poking too if the demo level was anything to go by, but most importantly it looks fabulous, genuinely next-gen and will be free to play on release. Hohokum (PS4) Why guide a curious snake creature to release a little character who then rides its tail while endeavouring to collect a pine cone-like item? So the character can be deposited and turn the pine cone into a kite, of course. All of which with no instruction or purpose. Glorious. Space Qube (App) This simple space shooter allows you to design your own vehicle through manipulation of a simple pixel grid, so anything at all can be the spacecraft \u2013 and they can then be 3D-printed into a hard copy, too. Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII (PS3, Xbox 360) An open and explorable world coupled to a more action-based battle system and some outstanding new costumes for protagonist Lightning look like a winning combination in this third and final entry in the Final Fantasy XIII canon. Dead Rising 3 (Xbox One) Much bludgeoning but little wit resulted in a less than enthusiastic response for the zombie-basher earlier in the year, but closer inspection reveals the inventive humour and consequently the game&apos;s playability has risen from the dead before launch."}, {"sentences": ["Reports last month by Credit Suisse in Tokyo said it expects subscriber growth to continue next year, given the continuing rise in global smartphone sales.", "Line&apos;s Japan revenue per subscriber is higher than Facebook&apos;s in North America.&quot; Friends and colleagues Mai Saito, Maki Shoji and Yoko Katsuki are typical among Tokyo&apos;s young professionals who all use Line to communicate."], "tags": ["Smartphones", "Apps", "Skype", "Facebook", "Social media", "World news", "UK news", "Asia Pacific", "Japan", "Spain", "Rafael Nadal", "Games", "Mobile", "Telecommunications industry", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-28T23:26:00Z", "title": "Free calls app Line plays it cute to challenge Skype", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/29/line-voip-smartphone-apps-skype-challenge", "article": "  Here come Cony and Brown, to a phone near you. Line, the Japanese messaging and voice over internet protocol (VoIP) app, which has grown almost three times faster than Facebook did following its creation, is planning to knock Skype off its perch at the top of the smartphone\u00a0communications market, using a bear and a rabbit to seduce European consumers.     Line has stickers and mobile games that feature cute animal characters.     Best known for its stickers featuring cartoon characters, including Brown the bear and Cony the rabbit, Line has already conquered Asia, with 50 million users signing up in the 12 months following its launch in 2011. Facebook took three years to get 58 million. The characters can be used to decorate messages, in addition to the usual emojis and emoticons. Some are free, but thousands of other &quot;premium&quot; sets, such as Disney or Pixar characters, can be added for \u00a31.49 each. The company, now with 230 million users, recently added football clubs FC Barcelona and Real Madrid and tennis world number two Rafael Nadal to its growing list of official accounts. Users can follow updates and interact with the sports stars in real time during &quot;on-air mode&quot;, when the accounts can read and respond to messages. During this month&apos;s US Open, Nadal sent messages and pictures with Line updating friends on his progress to becoming champion. &quot;Getting out the hotel to Flushing Meadows \u2026 waiting for no rain in order to play!&quot; he said in the first week. A few victories later, his account sent a picture of Nadal being interviewed on TV and said: &quot;Press conference after pass semi-finals! Waiting for Monday&apos;s match!&quot; After winning the tournament, Nadal sent a message thanking Line for all its support and used the opportunity to celebrate the win by offering friends his new stickers. It is no surprise that Spain now has more than 10 million Line users. Launched as a basic messenger to guarantee easy interaction, Line has gradually added more functions, including a Facebook-style timeline, to distinguish itself from rival communications apps, and has successfully branched into the games market. Its camera app, with &quot;beauty&quot; editing functions to smooth appearances, already has 50 million downloads and last week the company added a video feature, enabling users to take up to 10-second clips. Reports last month by Credit Suisse in Tokyo said it expects subscriber growth to continue next year, given the continuing rise in global smartphone sales. Analyst Taewon Kim said: &quot;It all began in Japan, but in recent quarters Line has been breaking ground in multiple overseas markets, with many of its apps posting well within the top 10 gross rankings. Line&apos;s Japan revenue per subscriber is higher than Facebook&apos;s in North America.&quot; Friends and colleagues Mai Saito, Maki Shoji and Yoko Katsuki are typical among Tokyo&apos;s young professionals who all use Line to communicate. &quot;The best thing is that it&apos;s free,&quot; said Maki. &quot;Then you can see if the person you have sent a message to has read it \u2013 so your husband can&apos;t pretend he hasn&apos;t! It&apos;s easy to use, and you can make group chats as well where you message several friends and one person replying is seen by everyone. I nearly always use it to phone people now rather than my network provider, because the connection is so good.&quot; Yoko said: &quot;Some of the stickers are very comical \u2013 characters tearing their hair out or hugging each other, dancing, anything really \u2013 so it&apos;s a great way to express your emotions better than just text.&quot; On the firm&apos;s entry into the mobile gaming market, analyst Kim said: &quot;In markets where Line has been a popular or dominant messenger, Line character games have proved to be top-grossing games as well.&quot; The app, available on all major mobile platforms, including iOS, Android and Windows Phone, racked up 5 million users in India just three weeks after it launched in July. In a country with 180\u00a0million smartphone users, the potential for significant growth is huge. Whether &quot;cute&quot; translates into sizeable market share in the UK and US, however, is something Mark Zuckerberg and others will be keeping a close eye on."}, {"sentences": ["In April of 2000, Lucie Blackman was a blonde 21-year-old from Kent who suddenly disappeared into an unmarked door within the labyrinth of Tokyo&apos;s &quot;hostess&quot; bar culture."], "tags": ["True crime", "Books", "Culture", "Carl Bernstein", "Truman Capote"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-02T16:36:44Z", "title": "Charles Graeber's top 10 true crime books", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/02/charles-graeber-top-10-true-crime-books", "article": "The most prolific serial killer in American history refused to speak with anybody. Then he started talking to me. Eight years later, the result is The Good Nurse, a book which, as a work of non-fiction with murder involved, is shelved in the genre of true crime. Which isn&apos;t, strictly speaking, a compliment. You&apos;ll find no section in your bookseller for true history, or true memoir or true politics (though perhaps you should). Only crime gets treated like a criminal. It&apos;s as if the unethical subject matter has rubbed off on the writer and the writing. Some of that reputation is deserved. Many &quot;true crime&quot; offerings are pulpy quickies with a tabloid heart and tabloid brains \u2013 human tragedy served as porno McNuggets. (Actually, that description fails. I&apos;d like porno McNuggets, they sound yummy. But these books turn out the opposite \u2013 stale and flat as cardboard, and, frankly, &quot;untrue&quot;.) Happily, hidden among this genre are a heap of fulfilling standouts. The term given to books like these is &quot;literary true crime&quot;. It&apos;s the triple-modified backhanded compliment and the term still seems a bit overwrought. Try introducing your lover as a &quot;lovely, devout and a reformed prostitute&quot; and you&apos;ll understand. Whatever the genre title, this section marks the sweetspot of highbrow and low, truth and art, and among the thugs of the genre you&apos;ll find master craftspeople holding dirt but wielding the same literary toolkit available to the investigative journalist, the novelist and the poet, creating dirty and deep page-turners with the pacing of a thriller and a setting in the dirtiest of all worlds: the real one. Narrowing them down to a &quot;top 10&quot; is impossible, but here are some of the best. 1. Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith, by Jon Krakauer Krakauer is a master journalist and a storyteller who is unfettered by and unafraid of the true crime mantle. Here, he transcends the genre with a story of Mormon brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insisted God gave them commands (commandments?) to kill. Krakauer pries open the golden doors to one of the newest and fastest-growing religions to set the stage for the non-fiction drama. 2. All the President&apos;s Men, by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward Is it too much to ask that a book not only provide a riveting read, but also inform a nation, and change the world? Answer: no. This one took down a presidency. The details are fascinating to journalists and normal people alike, the pacing is surprisingly engaging, and the result is a gumshoe news procedural with a rather happy ending, and a true crime book which became true history. 3. Columbine, by Dave Cullen Like most folk, I thought I knew what happened during the Columbine, Colorado &quot;trenchcoat mafia&quot; school shooting in on 20 April, 1999. Dave Cullen proved me wrong. He spent a decade pulling out fresh sources and details about the lives of teen murderers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, then artfully pieced them into a ticking narrative which culminates in a moment-by-moment account of the massacre itself. You&apos;ll be ducking under your desk as you read. 4. Blood and Money, by Thomas Thompson Noir classics such as The Thin Man or The Maltese Falcon are famous partly for the menagerie of bizarre and desperate characters encountered along the way to solving a crime. Investigative journalist and author Thompson finds the same in real-life Texas, as he digs into the 1969 murder of an oil heiress and Houston socialite. Truth here is far stranger than fiction. 5. The Executioner&apos;s Song, by Norman Mailer A literary epic about real crime. In terms of scope and ambition and ego, not to mention length, it&apos;s hard to top Mailer&apos;s doorstopper about the life, crimes and execution of a Utah murderous drifter named Gary Gilmore. But who cares about the dirtbag - the meat of this book comes from Mailer&apos;s partnership with a Hollywood player, which gave him access to the meta-story, as agents and middlemen shamelessly jockey to secure rights to Gilmore&apos;s story and execution. It&apos;s too good, if too long, and hey, it won the Pulitzer. 6. The Stranger Beside Me: Ted Bundy, the Shocking Inside Story, by Anne Rule Before Rule became one of the best known American true crime writers, she had a day job working side by side at a suicide hotline centre with Ted Bundy \u2013 who she knew as a handsome, charismatic friend, and who the world would later know as a brutal serial killer. Unsettling and personal stuff. 7. Homicide: a year on the Killing Streets, by David Simon Simon took a hiatus from his job as a Baltimore newspaper reporter to embed with homicide detectives in one of the most dangerous cities in the US, and then a few more to masterfully weave the stories together from all sides \u2013 players and the played, cops and baddies and innocents. Aside from providing grist for anyone attempting to understand the hard truths of life in an American warzone, this one of the most readable books here, particularly if you&apos;ve ever lost a month bingeing on The Wire \u2013 a series based largely on this book. 8. Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders, by Vincent Bugliosi with Curt Gentry You can&apos;t deny the all-time bestseller of the genre, or the detail-driven dive into the world of Charles Manson and his addled cult known as &quot;the family&quot;, written by a prosecutor of the Tate-LaBianca murders with access to all the grim details, partnered with a solid historical writer in Gentry. 9. In Cold Blood, by Truman Capote This classic cannot be denied, even if sullied by recent questions about Capote&apos;s liberties with the facts and his poor treatment of his former friend and researcher, Harper Lee. Capote revelled in shattering notions of what a crime book could be, and the first to raise it to the novelistic level. His dissection of a 1959 home invasion and murder in rural Kansas is as much a drill down on disparate lives and family secrets as it is of the brutal crime itself, and his exclusive access to one of the young murderers is both sympathetic and damning. 10. People Who Eat Darkness: the Fate of Lucie Blackman, by Richard Lloyd Parry A recent read, and a favourite. In April of 2000, Lucie Blackman was a blonde 21-year-old from Kent who suddenly disappeared into an unmarked door within the labyrinth of Tokyo&apos;s &quot;hostess&quot; bar culture. Parry is an award-winning UK foreign correspondent who spent an obsessed decade down the rabbithole of a curious story which got curiouser with each dirty turn. Take on a few chapters and get drawn into the rabbithole yourself. It won&apos;t take you 10 years, I promise."}, {"sentences": ["Edward&apos;s liberated intel has shown the world that this Faustian bargain of my-private-data-in-exchange-for-free-stuff has in fact already created a global monster that is now surfacing like an angry Godzilla from Tokyo Bay."], "tags": ["Media & Tech Network"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-03T15:35:26Z", "title": "Why advertisers should back a global Digital Bill of Rights", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/oct/03/advertisers-digital-bill-of-rights", "article": "I believe big data is becoming the driving force in our global economy and will drive a new kind of war. Advertisers need it to target consumers. Governments and law enforcement agencies need it to keep us safe and secure, so they say. Internet platforms and technology companies, or the &quot;siren servers&quot; as Jaron Lanier aptly calls them in his latest book, need it to maintain their pivotal roles in our digital lives and to continue nurturing us with all those amazing free services, apps and platforms that we can&apos;t seem to do without any longer. Consumers: Faustian deals no more?In the mind of most digital consumers that crave a constant flow of cool new offerings that must by default be free, &quot;paying with data&quot; and therefore invariably becoming the content or the product, themselves, has become the new normal \u2013 until now. What looked like a somewhat reasonable deal (&quot;I use you and you use me&quot;) is now starting to look like a fool&apos;s paradise: our boundless love and giddy admiration of Gmail, Google Docs and Search or the Android OS, for example, has in fact been quietly converted into fodder for &quot;collect it all&quot; Captain Kirk wannabes that crave information superiority under the disguise of national security. The recent revelations by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden are becoming more mind-boggling by the minute; often reading like quotes from a Cory Doctorow science fiction novel. Edward&apos;s liberated intel has shown the world that this Faustian bargain of my-private-data-in-exchange-for-free-stuff has in fact already created a global monster that is now surfacing like an angry Godzilla from Tokyo Bay. We have sold our data and we have become the content ie the product, ourselves \u2013 and now we have no control over any of it. Take it or leave it, shut up or put up. Pick privacy or security. Love it or leave it. Epicentre USA: breach of trust on a global scaleAs Harvard&apos;s Yochai Benkler has aptly pointed out in a brilliant Guardian guest post, the NSA has already single-handedly declared a new kind of war on the internet as we know it, but all the while, our hyper-networked digital lives are now so heavily banking on the assumption that the basic trust, permission and control mechanisms are working. Events like this are shaking those beliefs to the core. Data is the new oil, trust is the new currency \u2013 and when trust is broken, business breaks, quickly, as well. The question is, then \u2013 who needs oil when there are no cars or aeroplanes to run on it? Imagine being disconnected by and from the consumer: the end of cookies will be the least of itImagine a scenario where a significant chunk of the soon-to-be four billion internet users start to question the default Faustian bargain of &quot;my private data in return for your connectivity, your cool platforms and amazing technologies&quot;. This could spell the end for any meaningful and standardised tracking methodologies, with users no longer eagerly broadcasting their locations and MAC addresses on their mobile devices, as well as the likely rejection of NFC/RFID technologies or any kind of digital money, no matter how enticing an eager purveyor would make it. Imagine brands wanting to advertise to billions of upwardly-mobile and ready-to-buy users (aka consumers) but not having permission to know enough about who they really are, what they think and how to reach them efficiently. Imagine brands and advertisers being locked out of reaching consumers because they don&apos;t trust the media they may employ to reach us; and by extension they mistrust them. Imagine consumers wanting to be &quot;off the grid&quot; and off-the-radar because being on the grid is like walking naked down Madison Avenue. You don&apos;t think this will happen? One fifth of the world&apos;s desktop internet users apparently already use ad-blocking software with their browsers. Mozilla wants to make &quot;do not track&quot; the default setting in Firefox, and many savvy users are now considering even more dramatic action to cloak themselves and escape from the global data hoovering and hyper-marketing that seems to have become a default mindset in many countries. Jeff Jarvis is correct when he says that we need Big Tech to defend us against Big Brother; but what if Big Brother is married to Big Tech? The consumers reaction is easily predicted: if my mere participation in this new and shiny SoLoMo (social-local-mobile) universe renders me subject to rampant mass surveillance and perpetual digital nakedness, if it turns me into a meticulously profiled yet unwitting target for hyper-marketing while methodically addicting me to all the cool things that these new gadgets and software apps can now do for me, then... please count me out. This is not the game I signed up for a few years ago; enough is enough. I recently migrated all my email and online document-sharing from Gmail (which is an unbelievably great product, of course, and really quite irreplaceable) and Google to my own servers, here in Switzerland, myself, exactly because I can no longer trust that US-based providers will \u2013 and can \u2013 &quot;do the right thing&quot;). Advertisers: rebuild trust or get locked outIf advertisers, marketers and brands, wielding their $650bn advertising war-chest, don&apos;t just want to be pawns in the big data wars, they will need to be a lot more pro-active and act with conviction now. Protecting trust is protecting the ecosystem that you rely on. It is time for brands and advertisers to face the music: if trust breaks, so does business, so before you can even get close to selling anything to anyone you must make sure that this dawning digital ecosystem is actually functioning for all of us. It&apos;s time to stop the focus on building better mouse-traps; of mimicking the oil companies in their ruthless quest for domination and immediate profit. Enter the Digital Bill of RightsAs a first step I think advertisers should get behind a global &quot;Digital Bill of Rights&quot; (see what Mashable has already produced here), a bill which must clearly be user-centric not provider centric, and which needs to lay down the law on who can mine, refine and sell what data, when and how, globally. For example, such a bill could regulate what data can be captured on mobile devices and apps, under which exact circumstances, and how long it would be available to whom. It could also specify what data-miners would need to offer in return for being being &quot;paid with data&quot;. Advertisers and marketers need to drive this process now, before it becomes a mission impossible because trust is lost. Such a &quot;digital bill of rights&quot; may also catalyse a new approach by governments around the globe, one that no longer merely sanctions the exploitation of our natural data resources just like it allowed the pillaging of our natural energy resources for the benefit of so very few. Clearly, we need to take the internet back, as Bruce Schneier points out, and we need brands and advertisers to join us. We need Google and Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft et al to urgently start acting on our behalf, and unequivocally defend us against unwarranted surveillance, hyper-targeting, meta-marketing and blatant digital-addiction schemes. At the same time \u2013 and this is crucial \u2013 we need brands and advertisers to return the digital controls back to us, and to focus on creating trusted relationships instead of building big-data mouse-traps that profit from the governments&apos; abuse of our digital footprints and breadcrumbs.

The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami followed by nuclear crisis at Fukushima threatened the country&apos;s industrial capacity, its economic status and the safety of millions of its people. However, the decision to award the 2020 Olympics to Tokyo has lent a polish to the country&apos;s steady recovery. The International Olympic Committee approved Tokyo as a safe, economically viable host with a vision for a successful event. As the world&apos;s third largest economy and a global research and development champion, Japan&apos;s importance as a trade partner can&apos;t be underestimated. More than 450 British companies already have a presence in the country, and new opportunities will undoubtedly present themselves as the decade unfolds. British exporters to Japan, in fields as diverse as advanced manufacturing and food and beverages, will benefit from this country&apos;s solid reputation as a producer of quality goods. But they will also find that the surest way to build a bridge to a new partner is to speak to them in a language they not only understand but feel most comfortable with. In Japan this is particularly relevant. Fluent English speakers are few and far between, and a 2011 Reuters report noted that in a survey of white-collar workers, only 9% claimed to be able to communicate in English. Reaching out to new markets involves unpicking the locks of language and culture. Every accent and nuance shapes the message and either adds value to the brand or subtracts from it. Where a professional translator will be bicultural as well as bilingual, the amateur (or worse, the machine) will not only fail to open the door but may add enough bolts and padlocks to keep it closed forever. Linguistic traps are everywhere. While Japan itself is preparing for an exciting future, the Japanese language has no future tense. The present tense is used to describe future action, and when people speak of watching a TV programme or walking a dog they could be referring to the activity of the moment, something they do each day or something they plan for an unspecified point in the future. A skilled translator will be able to gauge precise meaning from context, just as he or she will be alert to subtle variations in style and culture. Hosting the Olympics may be a once in a lifetime event but on almost any weekend Tokyo and Osaka will be hosts to high-profile trade exhibitions, and the countless UK delegates in attendance will lean heavily on translation and interpreting services. Communicate poorly and you can look very foolish with clients. Communicate well and your entire business can be transformed. The energy sector offers a useful snapshot of the opportunities available in Japan. Prior to March 2011, nuclear reactors generated 30% of all the country&apos;s power, but with all 50 of its operational reactors lying idle after Fukushima, a re-evaluation was inevitable. While no one should gloat over another country&apos;s energy crisis, British companies that can help it deal with the problem should not feel guilty about turning an honest profit from the exercise. Japan is making a virtue of this economic necessity. Environmentally friendly initiatives have opened trade opportunities in renewable energy, with goals of 20% of all power from renewable sources being set. Wind, biomass and solar PV services are increasingly popular, with demand growing for smart grid and smart metering technology. Prime minister Shinzo Abe&apos;s government has heavily incentivised the generation of renewable power, and Hokkaido has become home to a string of solar energy projects. Helping clients to rebuild a brand in a new language is a challenge we relish, but for a country to rebuild itself from the rubble is something to be particularly admired. This decade may have begun with disaster but the next will launch with Japan hosting the greatest show on earth. We wish it well.

For every punter who left clutching a ticket two more seemed to join the back of the line. It was, as it turned out, a futile exercise. Orfevre and Kizuna, who had drawn an estimated 6,000 Japanese racegoers to Paris, one for every mile between Tokyo and Paris, ran well in defeat but could finish only second and fourth respectively. The punters&apos; money stayed in France. But a fair percentage of it would have stayed behind in any case because, while the man in the betting booth would not have had time to ponder the irony, many of the bets he was struggling to process were not being placed in the expectation of being cashed. There was no lack of confidence behind Orfevre and Kizuna and their supporters had travelled not just in hope but with a realistic expectation that at last there would be a first victory for Japan in the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe. The Japanese fans wanted to be there to see it and to back the winner. But what many did not want, or need, was to pick up the money afterwards. The winning slips, if such they proved to be, would not be mere souvenirs but artefacts too, a sign that those who placed the bets were not just there for a horse race on a pleasant afternoon in the Bois de Boulogne but to witness a moment of history too. It was the same in 2006, when the great Japanese champion Deep Impact could finish only third with the weight of a nation&apos;s expectation on his back. That afternoon there were estimates of between 10,000 and 15,000 visiting fans from Japan and, though Orfevre and Kizuna did not have quite the same pulling power, the enthusiasm and excitement were just as compelling. Longchamp itself played its part on an afternoon when three cultures came together in Paris: west, east and the middle east, via the meeting&apos;s sponsor, Qatar. As well as the betting windows with Japanese-speaking staff, there were bilingual guides roaming the main enclosure, and many signs in Japanese too. On the front of Paris-Turf, the French equivalent of the Racing Post, Orfevre and Christophe Soumillon were exploding like a firework from the Arc de Triomphe itself. As Orfevre went to post he was a 6-5 chance on the PMU, the tote system which monopolises French betting, yet he could be backed at 5-2 with British bookmakers. After the disappointment of last year, when a first Japanese success in the race was snatched away in the dying strides, the sense of imminent history increased as each of the 17 runners went into the stalls. It was not to be. Orfevre let no one down but nor did he ever threaten to achieve anything more than his second-place finish, while Kizuna too came up short in one of the best Arc fields to assemble for many years. &quot;He was feeling very well and I was confident,&quot; Soumillon said. &quot;We had a good run. I would have preferred to sit fifth or sixth with a stronger pace but I don&apos;t think Treve was beatable today.&quot; Orfevre and Kizuna are just the latest names on a list of gallant Japanese-trained failures at Longchamp on the first weekend in October. The near-misses began in 1999, when El Condor Pasa led from the start until well inside the final furlong before the outstanding Montjeu somehow summoned the energy to launch a winning run on desperate ground. Deep Impact finished third behind Rail Link seven years later, though he was later disqualified after he failed a drugs test, believed to be the result of a nasal spray. Four years after that, in 2010, Nakayama Festa was just a head behind Workforce, that year&apos;s Derby winner. Orfevre&apos;s sudden capitulation with the race at his mercy 12 months ago was surely as close as Japan will ever get to winning an Arc without actually doing so. It is possible that Orfevre will return to Longchamp once again in 2014, when he will be six years old. He is trained by Yasutoshi Ikee, whose father Yasuo was responsible for Deep Impact, and he at least will need little invitation to try his luck for a third time. Kizuna, meanwhile, showed enough in defeat in Sunday&apos;s race to suggest that he would not need to find much improvement to stand a chance in a less competitive field. Yet both may have had, and missed, their chance, Orfevre more painfully than Kizuna. Somewhere in Japan, however, there may even now be a two-year-old or a yearling colt who will one day fly halfway round the world with several thousand racing fans and deliver the result which they crave. When it happens, as it surely will, the delight will be felt most deeply of all by those travelling Japanese fans who were there for the disappointments too. It will be a pleasure, too, to leave their betting money behind in Paris, if it means that they can head home with an uncashed ticket for the winner to prove that they were there."}, {"sentences": ["Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines (JAL), said the A350 fleet would allow the company to take advantage of &quot;new business opportunities after slots at airports in Tokyo are increased&quot;."], "tags": ["Airbus", "Airline industry", "Business", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-07T09:25:00Z", "title": "Airbus and Japan Airlines agree first ever deal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/07/airbus-order-japan-airlines", "article": "The Aircraft maker Airbus has secured its first ever order from Japan Airlines for around $9.5bn (\u00a35.9bn).

It is a significant win for Airbus and the A350, which is designed to be more fuel efficient. The aircraft is a direct competitor of Boeing&apos;s Dreamliner, which has been bit by safety and technical issues this year. Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines (JAL), said the A350 fleet would allow the company to take advantage of &quot;new business opportunities after slots at airports in Tokyo are increased&quot;. The new JAL Airbus fleet is scheduled to be operational from 2019, gradually replacing its ageing fleet over a six-year period. Of the 31 aircraft ordered, 18 will be A350-900s, which typically offer three classes of seating and carry more than 300 passengers. The remaining 13 will be A350-1000s, which seat 350 passengers on longer flights. Fabrice Bregier, the Airbus president and chief executive, said the order marked a &quot;new chapter&quot; for the aircraft maker in Japan. Airbus has now received orders for more than 750 A350s from 38 customers worldwide and it is hoped that the first of the new aircraft will be ready for commercial service in the second half of 2014. News of the order was also welcomed by the British company Rolls-Royce, which will supply its Trent engine for all 31 aircraft. In a separate announcement Rolls said it had won two contracts, with a combined value of up to $496m, to support T56 engines on US government aircraft.

The contract, awarded by the Defence Logistics Agency, will support around 1,000 C-130, P-3 and C-2 aircraft in service with the US Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and Customs and Border Control as well as international fleets. Rolls was also handed a contract worth up to $90m by the US Navy, involving engine repairs for E-2 Hawkeye aircraft, which are powered by two T56-A-427 engines.

Take a look at clause nine of our Terms and Conditions:  &quot;The Competition shortlist will be debated on theguardian.com/books in the following weeks, accompanied by a series of studiously balanced and fair articles about the shortlisted books.&quot;  This year that&apos;s worked rather well, hasn&apos;t it? There&apos;s been lots of intelligent conversation about books. Lots of intelligent books too. It&apos;s been rather splendid. I&apos;ve expressed my opinions on the books. (Liked five, really liked at least three, loved one. Was definitely not in the target market for the other.) Better still, you&apos;ve expressed your opinions. (Fairly similar, all in all.) Now all we have to do is pick a winner and award the mug. So how do we do that? Let me explain. First of all we have to have a vote:  &quot;The winner will be chosen via a public vote from readers who have submitted reader reviews of their chosen titles in combination with a panel of readers to be selected by a process outlined below. Readers may vote for only one title at this stage \u2013 as before changes of mind will be governed by clause four on indecision.&quot;  I&apos;ll get on to the panel in a minute. For now, the important thing to know is that you vote for one book. Just one.  &quot;A vote in support of one book at shortlist stage does not rule out a subsequent valid vote in support of a different book to win the Competition. Reader reviews may be written at any time before a vote is cast. Voters must include a link to a reader review of one of the shortlisted books and the word &quot;vote&quot; in their comment on the associated article. Votes received after midnight on October 13 will not be counted.&quot;  Okay. I&apos;m going to bend the rules here. Linking to the reviews was a a little troublesome last time around.

Now for the all new and even more exciting bit. After a spot of soul-searching last year we decided to change how we picked a winner. Take a look at clause 10:  &quot;Three readers will be selected by the Guardian to form a panel of judges from those readers who have made substantial contributions to the discussion of the shortlisted books. The process by which these readers are chosen is left studiously vague and is at the Guardian&apos;s discretion. These judges undertake to read at least three of the six-book shortlist before the final judging meeting.&quot;  That mysterious process has now been completed, and I can tell you that the judges are: Simon Savidge, Victoria James and Simon Moore. They&apos;ve read and commented on every book in the competition so far and their contributions to the debate have been invaluable. They&apos;re also a mighty impressive bunch. Simon Savidge (aka SavidgeReader) is a journalist and blogs about books at Savidge Reads. He is also co-founder of The Green Carnation Prize and several book-based podcasts. Victoria James (aka VictoriaJames) has four degrees in English Literature. Realising a fifth might be excessive she got a job first as a journalist in Tokyo, and now as a TV producer in London. She&apos;s trying to finish writing her first novel, about Vikings, so sincerely hopes that she can take what she&apos;s going to be dishing out. And Simon Moore (aka Simon92) is a writer and researcher based in Newcastle upon Tyne. They&apos;re going to do their judging right after the votes are counted, as per clause 11:  &quot;A judging meeting will be organised online on the morning of 14 October 2013. The winner of the public vote will be allotted one vote at this meeting. The reader judges and Sam Jordison will each have one vote and will come to a decision on the overall winner in a live online event.

The plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said several tonnes of radioactive water had spilled from a treatment facility after one of the workers mistakenly removed a pipe. The workers, who were wearing protective clothing and masks, came into contact with the water and were being checked for any external and internal contamination, a Tepco spokesman said. The accident occurred on Wednesday morning as 11 workers were about to remove salt from hundreds of tonnes of water that had already been cleansed of almost all of its radioactive caesium content at another treatment facility. Other radioactive materials still present in the water were measured in August at 37 million becquerels per litre, the utility said, adding that the radiation was in beta form, which is less penetrative than more serious gamma rays. The substances present in the water include strontium-90, which has a half-life of almost 29 years. &quot;All of the water is kept inside a barrier [to prevent the spread of contamination],&quot; Tepco said in a press release. The leak lasted almost an hour, during which about 10 tonnes of toxic water is thought to have escaped, but did not reach the nearby Pacific ocean, Tepco said. Tepco is facing mounting criticism of its handling of the Fukushima Daiichi cleanup amid a series of problems blamed on human error and poor management. On Monday, the power supply to pumps that inject coolant water into damaged reactors was accidentally cut, although a backup system kicked in immediately. Last week, Tepco said 430 litres of contaminated water had seeped out of storage tanks and probably ended up in the Pacific. Almost 6,000 workers at Fukushima Daiichi are struggling to contain the huge buildup of toxic water at the site. Earlier this year Tepco belatedly admitted that groundwater flowing down from the hills behind the plant was mixing with radioactive water from the reactor basements and flowing into the sea at the rate of about 300 tonnes a day. Several of the hastily built 1,000 water storage tanks on the site have sprung leaks. One recent leak warranted a level 3 \u2013 or serious incident \u2013 rating on an international scale of radiological events. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 October 2013 to clarify that other radioactive materials still present in the water were measured at 37 million becquerels per litre."}, {"sentences": ["Whether it&apos;s Tokyo or San Francisco, New York or Barcelona, each will have commonly recognised associations."], "tags": ["Media & Tech Network"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-09T09:42:00Z", "title": "Is London's Olympic glow fading? | Peter Knapp", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/oct/09/london-olympic-glow-fading", "article": "Officially or unofficially, all the big cities in the world have their own brand. Whether it&apos;s Tokyo or San Francisco, New York or Barcelona, each will have commonly recognised associations. And London is no different. But is the image that the capital communicates to the rest of the world a proper representation of its true spirit? When I travel abroad, I&apos;m often puzzled by the inconsistent message the city gives off. Too often those associations seem frozen in the last century and not reflective of the cutting edge, creative and brave city that its residents would recognise. And yet for a few short weeks in the late summer of 2012, the world did get a glimpse of the real London - and an image Londoners could finally recognise. I am of course talking about the Olympic Games. London 2012 presented itself with an impressive confidence and managed to avoid the shadow of Beijing by not copying or being intimidated by scale or spend. Instead the games advanced us as a free thinking, innovative and diverse city full of intelligent and creative attitude. Quite simply, the games distilled what London is all about and expressed it to a massive global audience. And it wasn&apos;t just the rest of the world that saw London in a different light. Even Londoners were taken by surprise by what was achieved and the strong sense of identity and pride it inspired. However, one year on and as that brilliant halo starts to slip, are we doing enough to take advantage of the image it created? And is there a danger that London&apos;s associations are drifting once again towards the tired clich\u00e9s of &quot;ye olde London&quot;? The capital&apos;s brand is too important to be left to chance, and that&apos;s why it&apos;s time for a debate on how we can build on the creative energy of the Olympics. What the city needs now is a coherent brand image \u2013 one that can communicate associations that represent all its diverse elements. London should have one body with consistent oversight and planning for the brand. It will need a clear vision of what defines the capital \u2013 something London has lacked \u2013 and there will need to be consistency across the various bodies promoting the city. In the same way a corporation protects its most valuable brands, London should enforce rules that allow it to do the same. The capital has an enviable list of iconic buildings, world heritage sites and globally recognisable brands. But London too often treats them like a pimp, with black cabs and red London buses blitzed with advertising. We&apos;ve even seen arguments mooted for branding tube stations. Can you imagine catching the tube at Virgin Circus or perhaps Google Street? And what about the values and qualities that should represent London? As part of this debate, we commissioned a YouGov poll asking Londoners the same question. The top five qualities that Londoners identified were: diverse, creative, proud, resilient and tolerant \u2013 qualities that were perfectly encapsulated in Danny Boyle&apos;s brilliant opening ceremony. Creativity would be one of my top choices, too, and that&apos;s why I&apos;m arguing for the city&apos;s creative industry to have a much greater voice over the image that&apos;s projected. After all, London is home to leading architectural icons, cutting edge fashion, the centre of the world&apos;s best communications industry, film, music, high art and digital technology, creative trends and world heritage sites. We&apos;ve seen London become the world&apos;s financial capital, so why can&apos;t it be positioned as the world&apos;s creative nexus too? We need to be brave and show that the capital is about more than just the royal family and banking. The greatest achievement of the Olympics was that it successfully created an image that all Londoners could be proud of. It&apos;s now time to develop a brand that can do the same.

Video games came later. As a child, Masuda was an &quot;outdoors&quot; type. He grew up in Osaka, Japan, but spent most of his time outside, on his bicycle, catching insects. &quot;I was almost never at home,&quot; he says. It&apos;s a similar picture of childhood to that of his Game Freak founding partner, Satoshi Tajiri, who was also obsessed with catching insects in his youth (Tajiri would explore the fields near his home on the outskirts of Tokyo in search of mini-beasts, carefully studying each one that he caught, before cataloguing it in a notepad bought for him by his parents).

I also started dabbling in programming at that time.&quot; This unusual concoction of interests made it difficult for Masuda to find his professional place. After college he worked as a programmer at a computer software firm for 12 months, but this only held a small part of his interest. Around that time, Tajiri (a man who once spent so much money on the arcade game Space Invaders that the owner gave him a cabinet to take home) had become something of a spokesperson for video games in the Japanese national media, defending arcades against a distrusting older generation. Tajiri, who originally wanted to become an entomologist as a way to formalise his fascination with insects, was a moderately successfully writer on video games. In 1982, he had launched a video game magazine called Game Freak with his friend Ken Sugimori, the artist who would eventually draw the Pok\u00e9mon. Tajiri and Masuda had a mutual friend and, when he introduced the pair, they became close friends. Writing about games inspired Tajiri to explore making them, and he bought and dismantled Nintendo&apos;s Famicom games machine to see if he could work out how to develop for it. When Masuda met Tajiri, he&apos;d already started developing his first game, an action adventure called Mendel&apos;s Palace. Tajiri, trusting Masuda, invited his new friend to write the soundtrack to the game. &quot;Every day after work we&apos;d meet up to work on the music, often through the night,&quot; he says. &quot;When we finished the game, we decided we should probably set up an actual company. That&apos;s how Game Freak started.&quot;     Pokemon 2 Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Associated Press    Toughing it out When Nintendo released its Game Boy system, Taijiri imagined digital insects walking along the link cable that could be used to connect two systems. He took the idea to Nintendo who, impressed at his previous game development efforts, offered him a contract. Masuda and Tajiri&apos;s shared interest in electronics and insects inspired the initial Pok\u00e9mon game&apos;s design, but while Tajiri was placed under the tutelage of Nintendo&apos;s master designer Shigeru Miyamoto, development was difficult. In the six years it took to finish the game, Game Freak nearly went bankrupt on multiple occasions. Five staff quit when the bosses admitted the severity of Game Freak&apos;s financial situation. &quot;It was a difficult time but I never thought about giving up, or throwing it all away,&quot; says Masuda, who describes himself as the more practical and logical counterweight to the emotionally driven Tajiri. &quot;You know, when we started work on the game our motivation was never to make money. We just wanted to make the games we were interested in.&quot; While the pair missed a number of staff pay cheques, Tajiri would take on writing jobs on the side to help pay the staff. Even so, it was a gruelling time. &quot;We were at the office the entire time,&quot; says Masuda. I remember thinking how dumb it was for me to be renting an apartment because I spent so little time there. I was always at the office. We lived in that place.&quot; Between 1990 and 1996, Masuda worked on a number of smaller games alongside Pok\u00e9mon to help keep the company afloat. By the time Pok\u00e9mon was ready for release (in two editions, Red and Blue, each with Pok\u00e9mon unique to the version), the Game Boy was nearing the end of its life cycle. Indeed, the handheld was so outdated by this point, that no magazines would cover the game, and, initially, no toy manufacturer would consider marketing spin-off toys. But, as with so many of Nintendo&apos;s greatest successes, sales continued at a consistent rate, building over a period of months as word of mouth spread. When Tajiri leaked the fact that he had hidden a secret 151st Pok\u00e9mon in the game, Mew, a character one could only acquire through trading, the rumours streaked across playgrounds and sales doubled.     Pokemon 3 Photograph: Toshifumi Kitamura/EPA    The sky&apos;s the limit As Pok\u00e9mon began to sell in significant numbers Nintendo decided to commission an animated television series and, almost overnight, the game turned into a phenomenon. Children would be introduced to the franchise through cartoons, before progressing to trading cards when they were a little older, before, finally, arriving at the video games, which are deep enough to attract not only the young, but also the young at heart, for whom the keen thrill of exploration and collection remains. For Masuda, the game&apos;s ongoing, seemingly limitless appeal is down to the game design itself. &quot;I think the appeal of the characters and the joy of raising creatures, as well as the competitive aspect in the battling, are all key factors in the game&apos;s success,&quot; he says. &quot;But ultimately the core focus on gameplay is what the franchise is built upon.&quot; Each core Pok\u00e9mon game casts the player in the role of a young trainer (in the early Japanese versions of the game, the protagonist is called Satoshi), setting out from his parent&apos;s house on an adventure. Despite the team&apos;s focus on gameplay, the storyline is also a serious consideration, not least because of the vast and impressionable audience. &quot;Morality in the story is one of the core things I think about when making these games,&quot; says Masuda. &quot;I think anyone who has the capacity to play the game will inherently be in a privileged position; they are above a certain level of poverty to even own video games. This means they might be in a more favourable position to change the world when they grow up. In Pok\u00e9mon, we present an idealistic world. That is there deliberately, in the hope that it inspires our players to be positive influence on their own world.&quot; After all these years working on iteration after iteration, Masuda&apos;s enthusiasm for the series has not dimmed. &quot;Usually whenever we near the end of a project I feel like I&apos;ve done all I can,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m out of ideas and I think: &apos;this could be my last game&apos;. But when the game is released and I start to see how people play, I find new ideas for game features and challenges. It&apos;s a cycle: running out of energy towards the end of a project, resting and recuperating and then feeling energised to get back into a new game.&quot; In this sense, Masuda and Tajiri&apos;s work is never done. Their great accomplishment is in celebrating the joy of discovery, of offering children, many of whom were born into urban environments, the opportunity to experience the thrill of finding and cataloguing creatures and sharing their experiences with their peers. The visual simplicity belies the game&apos;s overarching complexity, whereby a strong Pok\u00e9mon team consists of tens of thousands of thoughtful decisions, each unique to the player. At this point, however, the series&apos; slogan appears to have been inverted. Now Masuda and Tajiri&apos;s directive is aimed outwards, from the designers towards the players as, heart by heart, mind by mind and sale by sale, Pok\u00e9mon works to catch us all.\u2022 Pokemon X&amp;Y is released on Nintendo 3DS on Saturday"}, {"sentences": ["High Five Tokyo (Tokyo) 4."], "tags": ["Travel", "Bars and clubs", "London holidays"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-11T10:35:36Z", "title": "Talking point: are these the best bars in the world?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/oct/11/50-best-bars-in-the-world", "article": "The World&apos;s 50 Best Bars awards ceremony took place in London on Thursday night and four out of the top 10 are in London.

Speedway doesn&apos;t feature on the mainstream channels these days, which is quite a change from how things were 50 years ago. A look at the history of the BBC&apos;s sports personality of the year award shows that in 1964 and 1966, the runner-up \u2013 behind first Mary Rand, who had won gold, silver and bronze medals at the Tokyo Olympics, and then Bobby Moore, who captained England to victory in the World Cup \u2013 was Barry Briggs, the world speedway champion in both those years. Briggs was one of three riders from Christchurch \u2013 the others were Ronnie Moore and Ivan Mauger \u2013 who left New Zealand to become multiple world title winners in the 25-year span between 1954 and 1979. As products of the Antipodes, they were following a tradition of which Woffinden, born in Scunthorpe but raised in Western Australia, is also a part. Speedway seems to have come to Britain thanks to a businessman named Lionel Wills, who witnessed the sport at\u00a0first hand during a visit to Sydney and returned home determined to share\u00a0his\u00a0discovery. Two Australian riders featured in the first meeting held in Britain, at High Beech in Epping Forest in 1928, and a full team arrived to race at the new Crystal Palace track a few weeks later. Mechanical problems cost them victory in a match against a British team, who were cheered on by a large crowd. The seeds of the sport&apos;s popularity had been sown, and soon cinder-covered oval tracks were being created around the country, often sharing a stadium with other sports, from Stamford Bridge to Celtic Park. Tens of thousands flocked to watch the daredevils sliding through the turns on their brakeless, single-geared, methanol-burning machines; the sport boomed quickly, shrank a little in the Depression, prospered again in the late 30s and enjoyed a long period of post-war prosperity. There are about 30 stadiums in the UK today, but the general picture has been one of slow decline. After several years of regular coverage, Sky Sports got fed up with poor ratings and dropped speedway altogether at the end of last season, leaving the sport to endure a tense few months before Eurosport picked up the baton. Its adherents, however, are the sort unlikely to have their affections swayed by fashion. It is their authenticity that attracted someone like Jeff Scott, whose words and photographs have documented the sport in Britain in a series of books from Showered in Shale in 2006 through Shifting Shale, Shale Britannia, Quantum of Shale, Shale Trek, Bouquet of Shale and last year&apos;s 26 Shades of Shale, all finding an audience through his own Methanol Press imprint. &quot;Speedway is the antithesis to most of the contemporary public spaces \u2013 places like modern shopping malls, cinemas, airports or football grounds \u2013 that dominate so many of our daily experiences,&quot; Scott writes in the preface to Shale Britannia. &quot;It still resists the relentless drive to consumerism, aspiration and ambition in a world where we&apos;re continually sold comfortable, convenient and deliberate\u00a0lies.&quot; Woffinden, born in North Lincolnshire 23 years ago, has a story to tell that goes beyond the tattoos, the black discs in his earlobes and the backwards-facing baseball cap. His father, a former rider, put him on a motocross bike at the age of six and then took the family to Perth, where Tai spent his childhood and adolescence. Spotting a speedway bike in a garage, he persuaded his father to let him sell his little motocross bike and buy a 125cc machine that gave him his first outings on shale. When the Perth stadium closed, his dad and other boys&apos; parents created a new track. Eventually he graduated to a 350cc machine, showing so much talent that his parents decided to sell up and move the family back to England, to give him a chance on the European circuit. Resources were so scarce that they lived in a caravan for three years while Tai established himself. At 16 he began his career with Scunthorpe Scorpions in the Conference League before signing a long-term contract with Wolverhampton Wolves. Sent on loan to gain experience with Rye House Rockets in the Premier League and Poole Pirates as an Elite League reserve, in 2009 he took his place with the Wolves, with whom he has spent the past five seasons in the top flight. In 2010 his father succumbed to cancer, soon after the diagnosis of a condition that chemotherapy failed to arrest. They were best friends, he says, as much as father and son, and it affected him badly. &quot;There are still days now when I sit in my bedroom and cry,&quot; he told Eurosport&apos;s Andy Jaye earlier this season. A few weeks after his bereavement he was racing for the first time in the grand prix series, contested by 15 riders throughout the season, in which points are awarded for the world title. He finished 14th. &quot;I wasn&apos;t ready,&quot; he says. At the end of a dismal season he sat down with a sports psychologist and announced that he felt like packing it in. The psychologist told him to analyse the situation and write down a list of the pros and cons. When he saw that there were more reasons to carry on than to give up, he made his decision. Each year one rider gets a wild card entry for the grand prix series, which started this year in Auckland in March and finished in Torun, in Poland, last weekend. The 2013 wild card went to Woffinden. He won only one round of the 12-meeting series, in Prague in May, against a field stuffed with former world champions in Nicki Pedersen, Chris Holder, Greg Hancock and Tomasz Gollob, but steady points scoring, including two second places and two thirds, took him to the brink of the title. After he finished the job in front of 15,500 spectators in Torun&apos;s spectacular Rose Motoarena, the crowd waiting to congratulate him included Britain&apos;s last champion, Mark Loram. And, of course, his mother. &quot;My parents gave up everything for me,&quot; he has said, thinking back to life in the caravan park in Scunthorpe, where they don&apos;t produce many world champions and the local council is currently trying to decide on the best way to commemorate his triumph."}, {"sentences": ["The Iranian master&apos;s second cinematic field trip, after the considerably more lovable Certified Copy, this Tokyo-set puzzle piece builds a promising head of erotic and intellectual steam between a university-going call girl, her jealous boyfriend and an elderly professorial client, but its truncated ending still strikes a sourly prankish note."], "tags": ["DVD and video reviews", "Film", "Culture", "Liberace", "Michael Douglas", "Matt Damon", "Abbas Kiarostami"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-12T23:04:02Z", "title": "Guy Lodge's DVDs and downloads", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/13/guy-lodge-dvds-candelabra-mubi", "article": "In Europe, Steven Soderbergh&apos;s Behind the Candelabra (Entertainment One, 15) premiered in the rarefied glow of the Cannes film festival.

According to the &apos;summary report&apos;:  &quot;The rates for spontaneous abortion, stillbirths and congenital birth defects found in the study are consistent with or even lower than international estimates. The study provides no clear evidence to suggest an unusually high rate of congenital birth defects in Iraq.&quot;   Jaffar Hussain, WHO&apos;s Head of Mission in Iraq, said that the report is based on survey techniques that are &quot;renowned worldwide&quot; and that the study was peer reviewed &quot;extensively&quot; by international experts.  Backtrack But the conclusions contrasted dramatically from previous statements about the research findings from Iraqi Ministry of Health (MOH) officials involved in the study. Earlier this year, BBC News spoke to MOH researchers who confirmed the joint report would furnish &quot;damning evidence&quot; that rates of birth defects are higher in areas experiencing heavy fighting in the 2003 war. In an early press release, WHO similarly acknowledged &quot;existing MOH statistics showing high number of CBD cases&quot; in the &quot;high risk&quot; areas selected for study.  The publication of this &apos;summary document&apos; on the World Health Organisation&apos;s website has raised questions from independent experts and former United Nations and WHO officials, who question the validity of its findings and its anonymous authorship. They highlight the existence of abundant research demonstrating not only significant rates of congenital birth defects in many areas of Iraq, but also a plausible link to the impact of depleted uranium. For years, medical doctors in Iraq have reported &quot;a high level of birth defects.&quot; Other peer-reviewed studies have documented a dramatic increase in infant mortality, cancer and leukaemia in the aftermath of US military bombardment. In Fallujah, doctors are witnessing a &quot;massive unprecedented number&quot; of heart defects, and an increase in the number of nervous system defects. Analysis of pre-2003 data compared to now showed that &quot;the rate of congenital heart defects was 95 per 1,000 births - 13 times the rate found in Europe.&quot; The purpose of the WHO study was to probe the data further, but some say the project is deeply flawed. Politicised science Dr. Keith Bavistock of the Department of Environmental Science, University of Eastern Finland, is a retired 13-year WHO expert on radiation and health. He told me that the new &apos;summary document&apos; was at best &quot;disappointing.&quot; He condemned the decision from &quot;the very outset to preclude the possibility of looking at the extent to which the increase of birth defects is linked to the use of depleted uranium&quot;, and further slammed the document&apos;s lack of scientific credibility.  &quot;This document is not of scientific quality. It wouldn&apos;t pass peer review in one of the worst journals. One of the biggest methodological problems, among many, is that the document does not even attempt to look at existing medical records in Iraqi hospitals - these are proper clinical records which document the diagnoses of the relevant cases being actually discovered by Iraqi doctors. These medics collecting clinical records are reporting higher birth defects than the study acknowledges. Instead, the document focuses on interviews with mothers as a basis for diagnosis, many of whom are traumatised in this environment, their memories unreliable, and are not qualified to make diagnosis.&quot;  I asked Dr. Baverstock if, given the document&apos;s avoidance of analysing the key evidence - clinical records compiled by Iraqi medics - there was reason to believe the research findings were compromised under political pressure. He said:   &quot;The way this document has been produced is extremely suspicious. There are question marks about the role of the US and UK, who have a conflict of interest in this sort of study due to compensation issues that might arise from findings determining a link between higher birth defects and DU. I can say that the US and UK have been very reluctant to disclose the locations of DU deployment, which might throw further light on this correlation.&quot;  If so, it would not be the first time the WHO had reportedly quashed research on DU potentially embarrassing for the Allies. In 2001, Baverstock was on the editorial board for a WHO research project clearing the US and UK of responsibility for environmental health hazards involved in DU deployment. His detailed editorial recommendations accounting for new research proving uranium&apos;s nature as as a genotoxin (capable of changing DNA) were ignored and overruled:  &quot;My editorial changes were suppressed, even though some of the research was from Department of Defense studies looking at subjects who had ingested DU from friendly fire, clearly proving that DU was genutoxic.&quot;   Baverstock then co-authored his own scientific paper on the subject arguing for plausibility of the link between DU and high rates of birth defects in Iraq, but said that WHO blocked publication of the study &quot;because they didn&apos;t like its conclusions.&quot;  &quot;The extent to which scientific principles are being bent to fit politically convenient conclusions is alarming&quot;, said Baverstock. Environmental contamination from the Iraq War Other independent experts have also weighed in criticising the WHO study. The British medical journal, The Lancet, reports that despite the study&apos;s claims, a &quot;scientific standard of peer review... may not have been fully achieved.&quot; One scientist named as a peer-reviewer for the project, Simon Cousens, professor of epidemiology and statistics at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), told The Lancet that he &quot;attended a relatively brief meeting of around one and a half hours, so just gave some comments on an early presentation of the results. I wouldn&apos;t classify that as thorough peer review.&quot; Just how distant the new WHO-sponsored study is from the last decade&apos;s scientific literature is clear from a new report released earlier this year by a Tokyo-based NGO, Human Rights Now (HRN), which conducted a review of the existing literature as well as a fact-finding mission to Fallujah. The HRN report investigated recorded birth defects at a major hospital in Fallujah for the year 2012, confirmed first hand birth defect incidences over a one-month period in 2013, and interviewed doctors and parents of children born with birth defects. The report concluded there was:  &quot;... an extraordinary situation of congenital birth defects in both nature and quantity. The investigation demonstrated a significant rise of these health consequences in the period following the war... An overview of scientific literature relating to the effects of uranium and heavy metals associated with munitions used in the 2003 Iraq War and occupation, together with potential exposure pathways, strongly suggest that environmental contamination resulting from combat during the Iraq War may be playing a significant role in the observed rate of birth defects.&quot;  The report criticised both the UN and the WHO for approaches that are &quot;insufficient to meet the needs of the issues within their mandate.&quot; Definitive evidence According to Hans von Sponeck, former UN assistant secretary general and UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, the gap between previous claims made by MOH researchers about the study, and the new &apos;summary document&apos;, justified public scepticism. &quot;The brevity of this report is unacceptable&quot;, he told me:   &quot;Everybody was expecting a proper, professional scientific paper, with properly scrutinised and checkable empirical data. Although I would be guarded about jumping to conclusions, WHO cannot be surprised if people ask questions about whether the body is giving into bilateral political pressures.&quot;  Von Sponeck said that US political pressure on WHO had scuppered previous investigations into the impact of DU on Iraq:   &quot;I served in Baghdad and was confronted with the reality of the environmental impact of DU. In 2001, I saw in Geneva how a WHO mission to conduct on-spot assessments in Basra and southern Iraq, where depleted uranium had led to devastating environmental health problems, was aborted under US political pressure.&quot;   I asked him if such political pressure on the UN body could explain the unscientific nature of the latest report. &quot;It would not be surprising if such US pressure has continued&quot;, he said:   &quot;There is definitive evidence of an alarming rise in birth defects, leukaemia, cancer and other carcinogenic diseases in Iraq after the war. Looking at the stark difference between previous descriptions of the WHO study&apos;s findings and this new report, it seems that someone, somewhere clumsily decided that they would not release these damning findings, but instead obscure them.&quot;  The International Coalition to Ban Depleted Uranium (ICBUW) has called for WHO to release the project&apos;s data-set so that it can be subjected to independent, transparent analysis. The UN body continues to ignore these calls and defend the integrity of the research.

The 16-year-old Paralympian, Sophie Hahn, who produced one of the performances of the International Paralympic Committee&apos;s athletics world championships by winning gold in the women&apos;s T38 100m final, is also expected to be funded for the first time. However, more British athletes than in previous years are likely to be stripped of their lottery cash after UK Sport toughened up its world class performance programme (WCPP), which determines which athletes receive funding. Those expected to miss out include the 34-year-old sprinter Christian Malcolm, who has twice won a world championship bronze in the men&apos;s 100m relay, distance runner Jo Pavey, 40, and world indoor triple jumper Yamile Aldama, 41. Until now, athletes regarded as potential Olympic or Paralympic finalists in Rio have received &quot;podium&quot; funding, worth up to \u00a327,737 to a potential medallist and \u00a320,804 to a world-level finalist. Now, however, the emphasis is emphatically on winning medals: only those considered good enough to be on the podium at Rio 2016 will receive such funding from UK Sport. The rules have also been toughened up for up-and-coming athletes. Those chosen for &quot;podium potential&quot; funding must satisfy the selectors that they could win a medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, rather than merely reach a final. As UK Sport&apos;s directive states: &quot;British Athletics must be able to demonstrate that any athlete granted membership of the Olympic WCPP \u2026 is a potential 2016 or 2020 Olympic Games medallist.&quot; UKA&apos;s performance director Neil Black is known to be comfortable with UK Sport&apos;s tougher stance. Earlier this year he told the Guardian: &quot;We are creating a system that really contributes towards improved athletes&apos; performances. We want more people in the sport, more people setting personal bests, more people winning medals.&quot; Inevitably that will mean fewer athletes receiving podium funding. However the overall number is not expected to alter drastically given that several members of the women&apos;s 4x100m squad are likely to be funded for the first time. If the news is confirmed, it would be some turnaround for the British quartet of Dina Asher-Smith, Ashleigh Nelson, Annabelle Lewis and Hayley Jones. The women&apos;s 4x100m team did not even qualify for London 2012 because they were not ranked in the world&apos;s top 16 \u2013 now they will get the funding needed to support themselves in the run up to the Rio OlympicsGames. Few would deny they deserve it. Earlier this year the squad&apos;s coach, Rana Reider, revealed that he was shocked by the lack of enthusiasm among some of the country&apos;s best women&apos;s 100m runners. &quot;We had a relay meeting in Loughborough with all the ladies. We invited 40 some people but only 20 showed up. It surprised me a lot,&quot; he said. &quot;When you call coaches and call individuals and say you &apos;can come in for three days, we&apos;ll pay for your hotel and we&apos;ll feed you, you&apos;ll have access to some of the best sports science in the world&apos; and they can&apos;t make it, it&apos;s disappointing.&quot; Those who came and made the squad have since been rewarded with a bronze medal in Moscow \u2013 and now, it seems, funding for 2014."}, {"sentences": ["Now, to compete, he&apos;s had to quit Tokyo for Silicon Valley.", "&quot;Tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but it&apos;s still an island.", "&quot;We have every sort of technology in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Wearable technology", "Technology", "Google Glass"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-14T08:00:00Z", "title": "Takahito Iguchi: the visionary who sees beyond Google Glass", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/14/takahito-iguchi-google-glass-telepathy-one", "article": "The problem with Google Glasses, says Takahito Iguchi, is that they&apos;re not cool. He has a point. There&apos;s already a website dedicated to sightings of &quot;Glassholes&quot; \u2013 people wearing them looking either ridiculous or smug or, more often, both. And, while Sergey Brin manages a hint of Robert Downey Jnr as Iron Man, it possibly wasn&apos;t Google&apos;s smartest move to release the first 10,000 pairs to software developers rather than, say, supermodels or Scarlett Johansson.Search Google images and one of the first hits is a picture of a large, naked ginger man wearing them in the shower. And it&apos;s this that Iguchi, a Japanese entrepreneur, hopes may be Google&apos;s Achilles heel. He is launching a competitor that is a bit more stylised. A bit more Blade Runner. A bit more Japanese. Iguchi&apos;s augmented reality glasses, which aren&apos;t really glasses so much as a single piece of metal with a camera and a micro-projector, are called Telepathy One and, after unveiling them at South by South West in Austin, Texas, earlier this year, they have attracted $5m of venture capital. Like Glass, Telepathy One is due to launch next year. It&apos;s a stripped down, simplified version of Google Glass. Whereas Glass is, he says, &quot;an egotistical device&quot; with a range of uses \u2013 you can surf the net, read emails, take photographs, do unspecified things with as yet unspecified apps, Telepathy will be &quot;more of a communication device&quot;. Connected via Bluetooth to your phone, it will focus on real-time visual and audio sharing. You&apos;ll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on Facebook or send them as an email. Or see and speak to a floating video image of a friend. &quot;It will help bring you close to your friends and family. We are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities,&quot; says Iguchi, who has worked in the Japanese tech industry for 20 years, most recently developing a location-based phone app called Sekai camera. Of course, not everyone wants to get closer to the man in the futuristic headset, I point out. Iguchi shakes his head. &quot;I&apos;m a visionary. I have a dream that people will understand other people. When I go to London, I am a stranger. Sometimes I feel fear. But I believe that everyone wants to be understood and to understand each other. And with this device, you can know more information about people before you even speak to them.&quot; It&apos;s possibly not everybody&apos;s dream that they will be filmed and streamed on to someone else&apos;s website before they&apos;ve even said hello, but such is the hype surrounding Google Glass that, before launch, it has spawned half a dozen or so competitors. From Meta Space Glasses that have the retro sci-fi styling of RoboCop to GlassUp , which look like the kind of protective eyewear you got to wear with a lab coat in GCSE chemistry, to the Recon Jet, which seems to have taken the sensible approach of targeting the sorts of people inclined to spend a lot of money on flashy tech gear and who already have a track record of wearing ridiculous outfits: cyclists and other athletes. The Recon, too, has attracted $5m in venture capital and is already available at $599. There are rumours of Microsoft Glass, Olympus smartglasses and even an Apple iGlass (a journalist on a tech website combed through thousands of US patents and found one that Apple had filed for a &quot;head-mounted display apparatus for a user&quot; but then noted that &quot;Apple has a patent for just about everything&quot;). But then &quot;wearable technology&quot; is one of those buzzwords that tech people love, that are endlessly written about, and hyped, but haven&apos;t made the big breakthrough. It seems unlikely that Vibease, &quot;the world&apos;s first wearable smart vibrator&quot;, unveiled in San Francisco this month, will change that. It can be controlled by you or your partner or, you know, some random hacker, via smartphone, bringing the prospect of &quot;long distance intimacy closer&quot;.     Google co-founder Sergey Brin demonstrates a Google Glass headset. Photograph: Seth Wenig/AP    Compared to the likes of Google, of course, Telepathy is a minnow. Not that this seems to daunt Takahito Iguchi. In his shared office space in San Francisco \u2013 a cool, converted warehouse in the heart of startup land, filled with twentysomethings \u2013 he quotes Sun Tzu&apos;s The Art of War and points out that even tiny armies can sometimes beat mighty forces. When he was growing up, Japanese technology ruled the world: the Sony Walkman was the iPhone of its day. Now, to compete, he&apos;s had to quit Tokyo for Silicon Valley. &quot;Tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but it&apos;s still an island. It&apos;s isolated. There is not any way to expand. Whereas in Silicon Valley everyone is from everywhere. It&apos;s where you come to connect globally.&quot; The hardware will be made in Japan, while he is putting together a team of software engineers in the US to develop its applications. On the day I meet him, he&apos;s being shadowed by a news crew from Japan who are interested in the new wave of Japanese entrepreneurs being forced to leave their homeland. &quot;We are losing our confidence,&quot; the correspondent, Takashi Yanagisawa, tells me. &quot;And we need to find a way to regain our power. Iguchi is kind of like the new frontier. We hope he might be a new solution.&quot; Building the prototype of Telepathy One was easy, Iguchi says. &quot;We have every sort of technology in Tokyo. It is presenting it to the world that is the challenge.&quot; The leading manufacturers are lining up to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just struggle to sell it. &quot;There needs to be a story to the product. Like Apple did with the iPod \u2013 1,000 songs in your pocket. And the way they positioned themselves against Microsoft and IBM, it was like the story of David and Goliath. And Steve Jobs was inspired by Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, and he inspired me, so maybe it will come in a circle.&quot; Maybe. He certainly has the confidence of Jobs, although with a thick Japanese accent he sometimes struggles to make himself understood, a fact that may have contributed to Telepathy One&apos;s conception. When he went to London to present the headset at the prestigious Founders Forum, he stayed in an Airbnb. &quot;He [the house owner] was not my friend but I talked with him for three hours, and now he is my friend. That is how long it takes to understand each other, to share our feelings, and background, and career. Maybe Telepathy makes that shorter. If you are getting info from the crowd and social networks, that will happen more easily. And this man is involved in getting investment from UK to Africa, and he was very excited about Telepathy. That it would be a way of educating people about Africa, of showing them other people&apos;s point of view.&quot; This is Iguchi&apos;s fondest hope. That seeing somebody else&apos;s literal point of view will help you to see their metaphorical point of view. As a student, he explains, he studied philosophy by day and taught himself how to code by night. &quot;And one day I opened the door of my apartment and I suddenly realised that everything is code. That was my enlightenment. Everything is coded and is shareable between humans. And everything can be encoded and decoded. And if code is exchangeable between humans, that will end all war against each other.&quot; What philosophy were you reading at the time, I ask. &quot;Nietzsche.&quot; Ah: So Telepathy glasses are a way of becoming Superman?     Recon Jet smart glasses.    &quot;That is my dream. That everyone can understand each other. Each other&apos;s moods, ideas, everything.&quot; In this, perhaps, Iguchi is an heir to early computer pioneers such as Douglas Engelbart who believed that computers could augment human intellect. That they would one day enhance our humanity. Or, you know, enable us to look a little bit like Iron Man."}, {"sentences": ["Some of his work was part of a collection in a big Tokyo gallery, including some of his recent collaborations with Warhol."], "tags": ["Jean-Michel Basquiat", "Street art", "Art and design", "Art", "Massive Attack", "Music", "Hip-hop", "Dance music"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-14T15:25:21Z", "title": "Jean-Michel Basquiat: the street-art inspiration for Massive Attack", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/oct/14/jean-michel-basquiat-street-art-massive-attack", "article": "This year marked 25 years since Jean-Michel Basquiat died of a heroin overdose at the age of 27. He was an Afro-Puerto Rican kid from Brooklyn who dropped out of school at 15 and ran away from home. He slept on park benches in 70s New York, starting out as a street artist tagging as &quot;Samo&quot; and went on to become, for me, the greatest artist of his generation and one of my biggest influences. Basquiat was one of the first to bring graffiti into the mainstream. The rise \u2013 and commodification \u2013 of modern street art would not have happened without him. For better or worse, he kicked the art world into paying attention. I first discovered him through an unlikely source \u2013 the music of the Clash. They introduced me, as a young punk, to reggae and dub music. In 1981, tracks such as Radio Clash and The Magnificent Seven also put me on to rap and funk. This new direction was influenced by hip-hop acts such as the Sugarhill Gang and Grandmaster Flash. When the Clash&apos;s Combat Rock was released in 1982, it\u00a0featured Overpowered by Funk, a collaboration with a prolific NY graffiti artist called Futura 2000 on vocals, who later namechecked Basquiat in his records. That was the year I started buying electro 12in records and met Nellee Hopper and Miles Johnson through Grant Marshall, who worked in Revolver Records, Bristol. We all shared the same interests in scratching, mixing, breakdancing and graffiti art; the Wild Bunch \u2013 our pre-Massive Attack soundsystem days \u2013 was born. It was the New York scene that got me hooked on hip-hop and alternative electro. By 1980, Basquiat, Futura 2000 and Fab 5 Freddy had co-curated the graffiti-related art show Beyond Words at the Mudd club, which contained their own work along with Rammellzee, Keith Haring and others. That same year, Basquiat had become friends with Andy Warhol and his work was gaining serious recognition. He created epic, powerful works such as The History of Black People and The Dutch Settlers.     Del Naja, AKA 3D of Massive Attack: 'His influence was always there on us.' Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    In Bristol, we flocked to see the seminal hip-hop film Wild Style at the Stokes Croft art centre. In those days, pre-internet and before the mass exposure of hip-hop, you had to dig deep to find tunes and graffiti art. It made everything you did find all the more precious. There would be a little bit on the radio, a magazine, then a tantalising snippet on video maybe. And the name Basquiat kept popping up. New York \u2013 like Kingston, Jamaica, before it \u2013 began to shape and influence the subculture of Bristol and London. Before then, British youth culture in the 80s had been tribal and divided. Hip-hop changed that. It broke down class and race divisions in a way punk and the ska movement had tried and failed to do. The Wild Bunch spent three years putting on warehouse parties and underground jams, using graffiti art to spread the word. The parties attracted a cross-section of the young population: middle class and working class, black and white. Going to Japan with the Wild Bunch in 1986 presented an unexpected opportunity to see Basquiat paintings. Some of his work was part of a collection in a big Tokyo gallery, including some of his recent collaborations with Warhol. The work had a huge impact on me. I had seen primitivism in art before, but Basquiat stopped me dead. He painted in a raw and confrontational way that was beautiful and effortless; he abused the canvas with chaotic composition and intense primary colours. It wasn&apos;t just his imagery but the juxtaposed cultural references: media saturation, brand communication, power, poverty, African history, colonialisation and exploitation. Everything was labelled for consumers and the words seemed part manifesto and part hit list. It was a slap in the face. Soon after we returned from Japan, the Wild Bunch split up and I knew I had to do something new with art and music. I had been painting for three years, and been arrested a couple of times, so the game was up for me with graffiti, because the police knew who I was. But the graffiti scene itself had become a bit predictable and uninteresting; the Subway Art book was almost like a manual for American-style graffiti art. It gave major exposure, but suddenly everyone was literally on the same page. Everyone was tagging and it had become more a fashion thing than a meaningful art form in which you went out at night and took risks to spread a message. We formed Massive Attack in 1988 and the influence of Basquiat was always there. He made the possibilities seem limitless. His style was not something you could copy, although you could try to steal a bit. I started to paint with brushes instead of aerosols, to work with more spontaneity and boldness. Basquiat&apos;s Warhol collaboration reopened my eyes to pop art and I moved away from graffiti as calligraphy, to see if I could paint in a more symbolic way. I\u00a0started to use stencils as a method of printing Margaret Thatcher and Mike Tyson, and other media icons of the time. The repetition of cultural and industrial motifs determined the way I\u00a0created record sleeves for the band.     Del Naja's artworks on show at the Lazarides gallery in London in May 2013. Photograph: Dave M Benett/Getty Images    Basquiat&apos;s influence still filters into the visuals that I create for the Massive Attack live shows, using abstract sloganeering, social and political data mining. Back then, watching Basquiat cross over into the gallery world, the high art crowd, was fascinating. The graffiti artists would question the authenticity of his stuff \u2013 when the notion of selling out still mattered \u2013 while the art world questioned his right to be there. As an artist, he was completely intriguing, but as a person he must have been having a major identity crisis. His commercial power was inevitable as his talent transcended his street-art origins. There was always a fight about authenticity and the idea that graffiti was transient, that it belonged on the street and should never cross over to the galleries. That was never going to last because people always want a piece of something that is exotic and a piece of a world that they are not a part of. The New York scene in the 80s didn&apos;t initially translate to the first wave of graffiti artists in the UK and Europe, but in the\u00a0past 15 years it has taken off. When something has a visual identity that is so strong and has so many great ways of conveying the politics and social issues with humour and surrealism, it does well. Basquiat&apos;s ability to sell art for big bucks while he was alive in a very white art scene was amazing because that world can seem closed. In 2012, for the second year running, Basquiat was the most coveted contemporary artist at auction, with \u00a368m in overall sales. Jay Z and Kanye both namecheck him on their most recent albums, and lyrics boast of pieces that they own. Basquiat&apos;s life was sadly too short. He changed my way of painting and thinking about art and I&apos;d like to believe that\u00a0his style and vision inspired the reactionary urban art movement of this generation. The question over whether street art should remain a public art form became moot for me: I never had enough money to buy a Basquiat work. But the success of Soul II Soul means that Nellee Hooper has a wicked Basquiat collection hanging on his studio walls. When we recorded Protection together, I got to gaze at them every day. That was truly inspiring. The Vinyl Factory will publish 3D and the art of Massive Attack on 28 October. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2013.

Phillips Idowu, the 2009 world triple jump champion, was the highest-profile athlete to be dropped from the World Class Performance Programme but Lisa Dobriskey and Jenny Meadows, who won 1500m silver and 800m bronze respectively at the 2009 world championships, as well as Andy Turner, the 2011 world 110m hurdles bronze medallist, also lost their funding. Others who missed out included the 34-year-old sprinter Christian Malcolm, who has twice won a world championship bronze in the men&apos;s 100m relay and the world indoor triple jumper Yamile Aldama, 41. Those decisions were largely expected but few thought that the pole vaulter Steve Lewis, who finished joint-fifth at London 2012 and at 27 is close to his prime, would lose his funding after one disappointing season in 2013. Neil Black, the performance director of UK Athletics, insisted the decision was justified. &quot;It&apos;s the same process for everyone. You look at history behind the athlete&apos;s performance and their circumstances, and you look into the future and what it will take to win medals,&quot; he said. &quot;Steve&apos;s general level of performance is just below the medal zone.&quot; Black admitted it had been difficult to tell athletes their fates but said that public money had to be concentrated on likely medal winners. &quot;Making good decisions isn&apos;t easy,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s been tough. You can picture how challenging and upsetting those conversations were. You can picture the stunned reaction followed by the thoughts and reactions subsequent to that. There was every spectrum of emotion. But this is about a business: public money invested in a programme based on winning medals in the future.&quot; Asked whether his decisions might be regarded as ending the careers of some athletes, Black conceded it was possible. &quot;I&apos;m aware that it could look like that,&quot; he said, &quot;but the most important thing is we focus on who is going to win medals in Rio and ultimately in Tokyo in 2020.&quot; Central to UK Athletics&apos; decision-making was a new and tougher edict from UK Sport. Previously athletes had to be regarded as potential Olympic finalists to be funded; now they must be considered a medal prospect at Rio 2016 to be on the &quot;podium programme&quot;, or in Tokyo 2020 to be on the &quot;podium potential&quot; programme for developing athletes. Neither Meadows, pictured \u2013 who missed most of the past two seasons with injuries \u2013 nor Dobriskey and Turner, 32, who both suffered injury-plagued seasons, is currently at that level. Black also had a message for the 34-year-old Idowu, who took a break and missed out on the world championships in Moscow in August. &quot;The ball is in his court,&quot; Black said. &quot;At this point he is clearly uncertain about his own future but we regularly pass messages to each other. I can&apos;t tell or speak on behalf of Phillips.&quot; The big winners on Monday were Great Britain&apos;s 4x100m women&apos;s relay squad of Dina Asher-Smith, Hayley Jones, Annabelle Lewis, Ashleigh Nelson and Anyika Onuora, who are rewarded for their unexpected bronze medal at the world championships by receiving funding for 2014. Sophie Hahn, the 16-year-old Paralympian who produced one of the performances of the International Paralympic Committee&apos;s athletics world championships by winning gold in the women&apos;s T38 100m, was also funded for the first time. Shelly Woods, who won a silver and bronze at the Beijing Paralympics but missed out on the podium at London 2012, took to Twitter after finding out that she had not been funded. &quot;Very disappointed to hear @BritAthletics have decided not to fund me on the @uk_sport world class performance programme,&quot; she tweeted. &quot;\u00a3nothappy&quot;. Black revealed that Jessica Ennis-Hill&apos;s recovery from heel and ankle injuries that derailed her 2012 season is on track. &quot;We regularly text and I get weekly communications from her coach Toni Minichiello,&quot; he said. &quot;Things are going well. Everything is on plan. But it&apos;s vital not to rush it. Having made the brave decision to withdraw from Moscow \u2013 which I think was the right thing to do \u2013 tissues need to be remade and remodelled but I have every confidence that Jess will be back in the future and she will be determined to win more medals and achieve more personal bests.&quot;

These days, however, the Arias no longer provoke quite such reaction. The ceremony is no longer a key event on the Channel 10 schedule \u2013 this year it will be screened on digital station GO! On December 1 \u2013 and record companies no longer spend the sort of advertising dollars that make magazines keen to invent stories about the renaissance of Australian music. Commercial radio, meanwhile, seems perfectly content to assume that new local talent is developed entirely by The Voice. This month we had the Air awards \u2013 or, to give them their full name, the Carlton Dry Independent Music awards \u2013 the alternative Arias where the argument about what constitutes \u201cindependent\u201d in a world where a good advertising sync is more valuable than a major record label deal grows ever more heated.\u00a0 The big winner was Flume, nom de rock of Sydney bedroom electronica producer Harley Streten, who won three of his five nominations. That was hardly a shock: Flume scored four places in this year\u2019s Hottest 100 on Triple J and his self-titled album topped the Aria charts and has already gone platinum. Equally unsurprising is that Flume is the most nominated artist in this year\u2019s Aria awards. He\u2019s up for eight categories, including album of the year, best male artist and breakthrough artist: Release. If you\u2019re betting on a win, Flume for album of the year seems like a reasonable wager \u2013 although it&apos;s likely he&apos;ll take male artist and breakthrough as well. Close behind are Perth collective Tame Impala, in the running for album of the year with Lonerism \u2013 which I&apos;d argue they certainly deserve \u2013 as well as best group. Despite their many nominations, they\u2019re probably dark horses in just about every category. Fellow Perthians Birds of Tokyo pretty much have best rock album sewn up for March Fires and are also in the running for best group and album of the year. They\u2019re tied with the most nominated \u201cheritage act\u201d: Aria hall of famer Nick Cave has taken six nods for last year\u2019s Bad Seeds album Push the Sky Away, which is also up for album of the year, and will almost certainly win in the frustratingly difficult-to-define adult contemporary abum category. The field is far more open in best female artist without a clean-sweeping Delta, Missy or Kylie to take out the field. Sarah Blasko seems like a solid bet though, although Missy Higgins has also been nominated in the category. It&apos;s probably not Samantha Jade&apos;s year but then neither is 2014 likely to be, since that\u2019s when Lorde\u2019s going to take out every category there is \u2013 assuming, of course, that she gets the honorary Australian title that we assign to New Zealanders when they break big internationally. Isn&apos;t that right, Kimbra? Wouldn&apos;t you say, Ladyhawke? Other safe-ish bets are Kasey Chambers and Shane Nicholson for best country album, Guy Sebastian for best pop album, the Cat Empire for best blues and roots and Bliss n Eso for best urban \u2013 in genre categories, name recognition is as important as the quality of work. How does the 2013 Aria list compare with previous years? A couple of heavily nominated newcomers are set to dominate their categories, a few recognisable names who should have won big last year (good luck with the best rock album nomination, Rubens), and some familiar names you\u2019ve missed for a while (David Bridie, congrats on the best original soundtrack nod). Plus, of course, some weird omissions worth arguing over, like the comparative lack of nominations for the Drones this year despite I See Seaweed being amazing. And a reminder that the last year\u2019s seen some amazingly Australian good music. So: much like every other year, really."}, {"sentences": ["Rocket from the Tombs was Crocus Behemoth&apos;s band before he founded Pere Ubu (a clue, before you even get to the text which explains this, is in the tracklist of their album The World&apos;s Only Dumb-Metal, Mind\u2011Death Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll Band, which\u00a0includes &quot;30 Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;, a\u00a0song familiar to me from Pere Ubu&apos;s repertoire)."], "tags": ["Music", "Books", "Culture", "Julian Cope"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-15T10:00:02Z", "title": "Copendium: An Expedition into the Rock'n'Roll Underworld by Julian Cope \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/copendium-rocknroll-underworld-julian-cope-review", "article": "I like to fancy I know a little bit about the more obscure corners of the rock world. Did I not, after all, spend 20\u00a0years listening to John Peel? Did I not sneer at and spurn the mainstream? I am now chastened. I know nothing. Or at least, nothing compared to Julian Cope, erstwhile frontman of the Teardrop Explodes, now writer, unofficial warden of the ancient sites of\u00a0Britain, and, by his own admission, spaced-out freak. (And by my own earnest assertion, under-appreciated national treasure.) Here is a book of umpteen reviews by Cope of umpteen bands, a book so\u00a0thick that its spine alone can accommodate not only the book&apos;s title and author, Faber&apos;s logo and a drawing of the Cerne Abbas giant waving an electric guitar, but three quotes from reviews of the book itself (from Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream, Roddy Doyle and Q magazine). Of these umpteen bands, I\u00a0had heard of about 11. I thought it was 12 at first, but I was confusing Rocket from the Tombs with\u00a0Rocket from the Crypt. However, dig deeper and you notice connections. Rocket from the Tombs was Crocus Behemoth&apos;s band before he founded Pere Ubu (a clue, before you even get to the text which explains this, is in the tracklist of their album The World&apos;s Only Dumb-Metal, Mind\u2011Death Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll Band, which\u00a0includes &quot;30 Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;, a\u00a0song familiar to me from Pere Ubu&apos;s repertoire). Crocus Behemoth was, of course, once the stage name of David Thomas, and he\u00a0and the rest of Pere Ubu, formed in 1975, performed at Shepherd&apos;s Bush Hall a\u00a0few months ago. Do\u00a0keep up. The reason you want to read that is \u2013 apart, of course, from the idea you might learn something \u2013 because of Cope&apos;s prose. As far as I know, both the Oxford Style Guide and Faber&apos;s in-house manual do not explicitly rule out spelling &quot;was&quot; &quot;wuz&quot;, but they don&apos;t rule it in, either. Cope uses that spelling when mentioning the band the\u00a0Pretty Things, who, as Cope puts it, &quot;wuz Born Never Arsed a full decade too early&quot;. (In other words, they were punks avant la lettre, and he&apos;s right.) The book is almost all written in an unapologetic, Lester Bangs mid-to-late stoned NME style, and it&apos;s no accident that the late-hippy adjective &quot;righteous&quot; not only comes up frequently, but is\u00a0the first word of the book after its\u00a0introduction. Sentences are long,\u00a0quirky but controlled \u2013 and hugely\u00a0informative. It is, in short, a\u00a0celebration of the music Cope is himself celebrating: loud, irreverent, verging on the apparently mindless, but actually possessed of\u00a0an\u00a0underlying tight control and intelligence. In other words, just right. My long research on YouTube has proved that he is not actually making these bands up, and has educated me in the byways and forgotten moments of rock history. Henry Flynt and the Insurrections, for instance, which consisted of Flynt and a friend on drums, made in 1966 the most rudimentary sound conceivable, his\u00a0song &quot;Uncle Sam Do&quot; being both Fluxus-inspired exercise in audience alienation (it makes the Fugs sound like the Wombles) and protest song, the power of whose protest may have been vitiated by Flynt&apos;s refusal to release it beyond a tiny coterie until 2004. Even now, the YouTube recording of that song has fewer than 500 views; and, as\u00a0Cope says, &quot;the difference between Henry Flynt and most other conceptual artists of his time is that the more you play &quot;I Don&apos;t Wanna&quot;, the more you need to hear it.&quot; The book is arranged chronologically, and near the beginning there is a\u00a0touching story of Cope&apos;s early exposure\u00a0to Tom Lehrer \u2013 his mother encouraging the metre-high Cope to\u00a0learn his songs about necrophilia, incest and drug-dealing word-perfect and sing them to astonished house guests as a twisted party trick. Perhaps\u00a0this sowed the seeds of his appreciation of bands who didn&apos;t give a\u00a0flying one, and the very fact that this book is so enthusiastic about bands who didn&apos;t care is a beautiful, enriching irony.

Isabel Choat  Twin Stars Diner, Moscow     Photograph: Reuters TV / Reuters/Reuters    It&apos;s hard to stand out in a city that loves extreme dining, whether it involves vines and amphorae, (Tiflis, the Russian word for the Georgian capital, Tbilisi), moving trams (Annushka), live goats (Shinok), or waterfalls (Blue Elephant) \u2013 but Alexei Khodorkovsky has managed to find a new niche, with the opening of his twin-themed restaurant. At the Twin Stars diner in Moscow, all the staff \u2013 from waiters to bartenders and even the chefs \u2013 are identically-dressed twins. The creepy concept is inspired by a 1964 Soviet film in which a girl winds up in an alternate reality and confronts her twin. Khodorkovsky says it&apos;s been hard to find suitably qualifed twins but the concept is paying off - the 24-hour restaurant is a hit with locals who don&apos;t seem bothered about the issue of whether or not to tip twice.  If Twin Stars represents the new Russia with its modern, funky design, the Expedicia is more traditional Russia - appealing, one imagines, to chest-beating Putin types with a love of the outdoors. In the pricey, survival-themed Expeditsia (&quot;expedition&quot;) restaurant you eat between an orange helicopter parked in the pine trees and a stuffed polar bear scratching itself by a stream. Guests can sprawl on the roof garden lawn or be beaten with birch twigs in the Siberian banya. Ingredients such as wild duck, fresh berries and mountain honey are flown in from the far north and east of Russia, and delicacies include elk in aspic, smoked venison, sea urchin and sturgeon, served with vodka, sea buckthorn juice or Baikal mineral water.

And so it is with Carton King, a restaurant whose owner was so depressed by the preponderance of plastic in modern life he built an eatery which, instead, promotes the virtues of corrugated cardboard. From the chairs to the plates and even the walls \u2013 the whole place is bedecked in the brown stuff.

So the only surprise about Taipei&apos;s Barbie restaurant is that it took so long for someone to come up with the idea.

Bangkok&apos;s Royal Dragon is monumental. The colossal seafood place sprawls across 8.35 acres, has 1,000 staff, and requires 540 costumed waiters on roller skates to serve some 5,000 customers. And while it boasts the largest collection of live seafood tanks and 1,000 pan-Asian dishes, diners don&apos;t come for the food. It&apos;s all about the spectacle: traditional Thai and Chinese music, dance and martial arts shows, and waiters walking on water and &quot;flying&quot; through the air on zip-wires. Watch what you order if you choose live seafood (it is priced by weight and can be expensive), so there are no surprises \u2013 other than the waiters falling from the sky, that is. The dim sum buffet and set menus are the best value. Service can be slow despite the wheels and wires, making the experience best done with a group of (well-lubricated) friends.royal-dragon.comLara Dunston The Heart Attack Grill, Las Vegas, US     Photograph: Alamy    We all know Americans love big portions. The Heart Attack Grill in Vegas (where else?) celebrates the fact with gusto by serving obscenely huge burgers with sides of fries deep-fried in lard. Diners are given hospital style gowns before tucking into the likes of a quadruple bypass burger, a towering heart attack on a plate made with four beef patties and 20 slices of bacon, served by waitresses dressed as nurses who will help you out of the restaurant in a wheel chair if necessary. If you are prepared to gamble with your health, the Heart Attack Grill is certainly a meal to remember. \u2022 heartattackgrill.com IC Draculas and Witches in Britches, Melbourne, Australia     Witches in Britches, Melbourne    Two longstanding Melbourne schlock horror-themed theatre restaurants owe their recent resurgence in popularity to the Twilight phenomenon, the current obsession with vampires, witches and werewolves, and the burlesque craze. Claiming to have served three million people in 30 years, Draculas offers a camp, vaudevillian-style cabaret during a three-course dinner that begins with drinks in the Graveyard cocktail lounge and a ghost-train ride.\u00a0 Located in the Wicked Castle, the 40-year old Witches in Britches offers a kitschy interactive show rooted in contemporary pop culture (it helps to have some knowledge of Aussie television) and a five-course meal that starts with pumpkin soup with &quot;herbs picked from the old hag&apos;s garden&quot;, ladled from a cauldron. \u2022 draculas.com.au, witchesinbritches.com.au  LD Onkel Taa, Italian Tyrol     Karl Platino, owner-chef of Onkel Taa    Hidden away in a tiny village of the Italian Tyrol, Onkel Taa is a gourmet restaurant serving traditional Mitteleuropa cuisine, but it is also the fantasy world of the owner-chef, Karl Platino. He is known in Italy as &quot;Il Re delle Lumache&quot;, the Snail King, because not only does he serve a dozen dishes featuring snails, he also breeds these molluscs in the jungle-like gardens surrounding the restaurant. And this is only one of Onkel Taa&apos;s passions: the decor of the cosy wood-panelled osteria is filled with his weird and wonderful collections \u2013 everything from corkscrews to snail shaped fossils; and a whole museum is dedicated to the Habsurg Empire and Emperor Franz Josef in particular, whom, coincidentally, the chef closely resembles. And if you want to see something really special, ask to go upstairs from the dining room, where Signor Platino has over a thousand incredible antique wooden doors stashed away.\u2022 bad-egart.comJohn Brunton Soldatenkaffee, Bandung, Indoneisa          And the award for most tastless restaurant goes to ... the Soldatenkaffee in Bandung, Indonesia.

It is matter of fact, with the intention of exploring Hitler &amp; the NAZIS as pop culture. The authors of the WEB are not NAZIS or neo-NAZIS, we are Indonesian with no political affiliations&quot;. The furore caused by Soldatenkaffee didn&apos;t put off another owner opening the equally offensive Hitler Fried Chicken in Bangkok, a bizarre take on KFC, with an image of Hitler replacing that of Colonel Sanders. The runner-up prize for most tasteless restaurant goes to Bunga Bunga in Battersea, London. It&apos;s hard to fathom anyone wanting to eat in a restaurant themed around a slimy, criminal fraudster famed for his liaisons with underaged prostitutes, but here it is, the shameless Bunga Bunga, which draws crowds of young Chelsea types with its all-you-can-drink prosecco and bellini parties.

I am counting on you.&quot; Abe&apos;s exhortation, delivered during a recent visit to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, was only heard by a small group of men inside the plant&apos;s emergency control room. But it was directed at almost 6,000 more: the technicians and engineers, truck drivers and builders who, almost three years after the plant suffered a triple meltdown, remain on the frontline of the world&apos;s most dangerous industrial cleanup. Yet as the scale of the challenge has become clearer with every new accident and radiation leak, the men working inside the plant are suffering from plummeting morale, health problems and anxiety about the future, according to insiders interviewed by the Guardian. Even now, at the start of a decommissioning operation that is expected to last 40 years, the plant faces a shortage of workers qualified to manage the dangerous work that lies ahead. The hazards faced by the nearly 900 employees of Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] and about 5,000 workers hired by a network of contractors and sub-contractors were underlined this month when six men were doused with contaminated water at a desalination facility. The men, who were wearing protective clothing, suffered no ill health effects in the incident, according to Tepco, but their brush with danger was a sign that the cleanup is entering its most precarious stage since the meltdown in March 2011. Commenting on the leak, the head of Japan&apos;s nuclear regulator, Shunichi Tanaka, told reporters: &quot;Mistakes are often linked to morale. People usually don&apos;t make silly, careless mistakes when they&apos;re motivated and working in a positive environment. The lack of it, I think, may be related to the recent problems.&quot;     Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, wearing a red helmet, during a tour of the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Photograph: AP    The radiation spill was the latest in a string of serious water and radiation leaks, which have raised fears over the workers&apos; state of mind \u2013 and Tepco&apos;s ability to continue the cleanup alone. According to sources with knowledge of the plant and health professionals who make regular visits, the slew of bad news is sapping morale and causing concern, as the public and international community increase pressure on Japan to show demonstrable progress in cleaning up the world&apos;s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. &quot;Very little has changed at Fukushima Daiichi in the past six months,&quot; said Jun Shigemura, a lecturer in the psychiatry department at the National Defence Medical College who heads of a team of psychologists that counsels Fukushima plant workers. &quot;Tepco is doing its best to improve matters, but you can see that the situation is severe.&quot; Shigemura is most concerned about the 70% of Tepco workers at Fukushima Daiichi who were also forced to evacuate their homes by the meltdown. They have yet to come to terms with that loss and many live away from their families in makeshift accommodation near the plant. &quot;They were traumatised by the tsunami and the reactor explosions and had no idea how much they had been irradiated,&quot; Shigemura said. &quot;That was the acute effect but now they are suffering from the chronic effects, such as depression, loss of motivation and issues with alcohol.&quot; Their anxiety is compounded by uncertainty over the future of their embattled employer. Tepco is coming under mounting pressure to resolve the worsening water crisis at Fukushima Daiichi, which recently prompted the government to step in with half a billion dollars (\u00a3312m) to help contain the build-up of toxic water. Its ability to stem the water leaks by the time Tokyo hosts the Olympics in 2020 \u2013 as promised by Abe \u2013 could be hampered by a looming labour shortage. As Tepco was reducing costs and attempting to calm public anger over its handling of the crisis, it imposed a 20% pay cut for all employees in 2011. From a total workforce of 37,000, 1,286 people left the firm, between April 2011 and June this year. The firm did not hire any employees in fiscal 2012 and 2013. The utility plans to take on 331 employees next April, according to Mayumi Yoshida, a Tepco spokeswoman. &quot;[The employment] system will change so it will be easier for talented employees to gain promotion and for unproductive employees to be demoted,&quot; she said. But there is little the firm can do about the departure of experienced workers, forced to leave after reaching their radiation exposure limit. Tepco documents show that between March 2011 and July this year, 138 employees reached the 100-millisievert [mSv] threshold; another 331 had been exposed to between 75 mSv and 100 mSv, meaning their days at the plant are numbered. Those nearing their dose limit have reportedly been moved to other sites, or asked to take time off, so they can return to work at Fukushima Daiichi at a later date. Some workers have left because of exhaustion and stress, while others have decided to find work closer to their displaced wives and children. &quot;They are less motivated and are worried about continuing to work for a firm that might not exist in a decade from now,&quot; Shigemura said.     Tepco employees wait for a bus at J Village, a  football training complex now serving as an operation base for those battling Japan's nuclear disaster. Photograph: Reuters    Workers who have stayed on do so in the knowledge that they risk damaging their health through prolonged exposure to radiation and in accidents of the kind that occurred this week. Earlier this year, Tepco said that 1,973 workers, including those employed by contractors and subcontractors, had estimated thyroid radiation doses in excess of 100 mSv, the level at which many physicians agree the risk of developing cancer begins to rise. &quot;These workers may show a tiny increased risk of cancer over their lifetimes,&quot; said Gerry Thomas, professor of molecular pathology at Imperial College, London University. &quot;One hundred millisieverts is the dose we use as a cut-off to say we can see a significant effect on the cancer rate in very large epidemiology studies. The numbers have to be large because the individual increase is minuscule.&quot; But she added: &quot;I would be far more worried about these workers smoking or feeling under stress due to the fear of what radiation might do to them. That is much more likely to have an effect on any person&apos;s health.&quot; While Thomas and other experts have cautioned against reaching hasty conclusions about a possible rise in thyroid cancer among Fukushima Daiichi workers, there is little doubt that their punishing work schedule, performed under the international spotlight, is taking a toll on their health. &quot;I&apos;m particularly worried about depression and alcoholism,&quot; said Takeshi Tanigawa, a professor in the department of public health at Ehime University in western Japan. &quot;I&apos;ve seen high levels of physical distress and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.&quot; Many of the casual labourers employed by subcontractors live in cheap accommodation in places such as Yumoto, a hot-spring resort south of the exclusion zone around the plant. The number of workers has declined in the past year amid complaints from hoteliers and inn-keepers about drink-fuelled fights. These days, more seem to prefer the bars and commercial sex establishments of nearby Onahama port. A 42-year-old contract worker, who asked not be named, confirmed that alcohol abuse had become a problem among workers. &quot;Lots of men I know drink heavily in the evening and come to work with the shakes the next day. I know of several who worked with hangovers during the summer and collapsed with heatstroke.&quot; &quot;There isn&apos;t much communication between workers. People want to look after number one. Newcomers are looked down on by their colleagues and some don&apos;t really know how to do their jobs.&quot; Another worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had seen hungover colleagues collapse with heatstroke just minutes after beginning work.

Photograph: Yuriko Nakao/Reuters    In the long term, Tepco and its partner companies will struggle to find enough people with specialist knowledge to see decommissioning through to the end, according to Yukiteru Naka, a retired engineer with General Electric who helped build some of Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s reactors. &quot;There aren&apos;t enough trained people at Fukushima Daiichi even now,&quot; he said. &quot;For Tepco, money is the top priority \u2013 nuclear technology and safety come second and third. That&apos;s why the accident happened. The management insists on keeping the company going. They think about shareholders, bank lenders and the government, but not the people of Fukushima.&quot; Naka, who runs a firm in Iwaki, just south of Fukushima Daiichi, that provides technical assistance to Tepco, said the lack of expertise afflicts the utility and general contractors with a pivotal role in the cleanup. &quot;Most of their employees have no experience of working in conditions like these, and all the time their exposure to radiation is increasing,&quot; he said. &quot;I suggested to Tepco that it bring in retired workers who said they were willing to help, but the management refused.&quot; Faced with labour shortages and a string of accidents, Tepco has in recent weeks come under pressure to accept more specialist help from overseas. At the start of this month, Shinzo Abe, told an international science conference in Kyoto: &quot;My country needs your knowledge and expertise.&quot; But this apparent spirit of openness is unlikely to turn the decommissioning operation into a genuinely international effort, said Ian Fairlie, a London-based independent consultant on radioactivity in the environment. &quot;Japanese officials ask for help, but Tepco and the government are not in the business of saying: &apos;This is serious, please come and help us,&apos;&quot; he said. Tepco&apos;s unshakable belief in its ability to complete the decommissioning operation rules out any meaningful co-operation, even with Japanese government officials. &quot;Tepco has always wanted to do its own thing,&quot; said Akihiro Yoshikawa, a Tepco employee of 14 years who recently left the company. &quot;It doesn&apos;t want the government stepping in and telling it what to do; it just wants the government&apos;s money.&quot; Yoshikawa said the spirit of resilience his former colleagues had displayed in the aftermath of the accident had turned to despondency amid mounting criticism at home and abroad, forcing younger workers to leave and older ones to take early retirement. &quot;They felt like they were being bullied, even though they were putting their lives at risk,&quot; he said. &quot;Tepco is spending its money on fixing the technical problems, but it also needs people to carry out that work. I&apos;m very worried about the labour shortage. If they don&apos;t do something about it soon, the employment system at Fukushima Daiichi will collapse first, not the plant.&quot; For the thousands of non-Tepco employees hired across Japan to perform backbreaking, dangerous work for contractors and subcontractors, the lure of earning decent money in return for working close to lethal levels of radiation has proved an illusion. Once money for accommodation has been subtracted from their wages, labourers are typically left with a few thousand yen at the end of each day. In some cases, smaller companies withhold danger money, which can amount to more than half of a worker&apos;s daily wage because, they say, they need the extra cash to keep their business afloat. The poor pay has forced growing numbers of men to quit and take up jobs decontaminating the area around the plant, for which they can earn similar momey but with much less exposure to radiation. &quot;The real work at Fukushima Daiichi is being done by the general contractors, with the smaller companies picking up the crumbs,&quot; Yoshikawa said. &quot;They outbid each other for contracts and so end up with less money to pay their workers. They have no choice but to hire cheap labour.&quot; Conditions for Tepco workers living in J Village \u2013 a football training complex just south of Fukushima Daiichi \u2013 have only recently improved. For two years after the disaster, those living in prefabricated units at J Village had to walk hundreds of metres to use communal toilets at night. Tepco belatedly installed private toilets earlier this year after the firm&apos;s incoming president, Naomi Hirose, heeded health experts&apos; warnings that the lack of facilities was compromising employees&apos; health. &quot;The managers at Tepco headquarters have little idea of how their Fukushima Daiichi employees live,&quot; said Tanigawa, the public health professor. &quot;The company&apos;s management is focused on the compensation problem and doesn&apos;t want to be accused of only looking after its own when there are still evacuees who haven&apos;t been compensated.&quot; But as concern grows over Tepco&apos;s ability to address the myriad technical challenges facing Fukushima Daiichi \u2013 starting next month with the removal of 1,300 spent fuel assemblies from the top of reactor No 4 \u2013 the unfolding human crisis is being largely ignored. There is still no full-time mental health counselling available at the plant, said Shigemura, whose team visits about once a month to talk to workers and administer pharmacological treatments. &quot;That amazes me,&quot; he said. &quot;Tepco workers worry about their health, but also about whether Tepco will take care of them if they fall ill in the future. They put their lives and their health on the line, but in the years to come, they wonder if they will just be discarded.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["He started his career in the British Diplomatic Service, working as First Secretary in the British Embassy, Tokyo and the Second Secretary in the British Embassy, Helsinki, Finland."], "tags": ["Activate Singapore", "Media & Tech Network"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-15T16:08:00Z", "title": "Activate Singapore speakers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2013/oct/15/activate-singapore-speakers-lead", "article": "If you&apos;d like to nominate an individual or organisation, email robin.hough@theguardian.com  Confirmed speakers include: Arun Bansal, president, South East Asia and Oceania, Ericsson     s    Joining Ericsson in 1995, Arun has been heading Ericsson&apos;s Southeast Asia and Oceania region since 2010.

You're not trying hard enough", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/16/jay-rayner-dont-like-tripe", "article": "When I was growing up we had a rule in our house which explains quite a lot: we couldn&apos;t say we didn&apos;t like something unless we&apos;d tried it at least once. While this was generally a rallying cry for life \u2013 my mother would probably have agreed with Sir Thomas Beecham that everything was worth a go, bar Morris dancing and incest \u2013 in childhood it mostly pertained to the dinner table. And so I was the one who would taunt his primary school friends with stories of slurping raw oysters, while they recoiled. I still try to keep to this rule. For example I once ate salt-fermented sea cucumber in a very serious Tokyo restaurant. It tasted as you might imagine licking the slime off a fish that has been left to fester in a warm room for three days might taste; it had the tang of bilge and entrail. I decided I had ticked it off the list; I didn&apos;t ever have to do that again. Indeed, immediately afterwards, given the choice, I&apos;d have strapped on the ankle bells and joined in with the Morris dancers rather than repeat the fermented sea-cucumber thing. However, a new survey has made me question my behaviour. According to the website Ask Jeeves, nearly 30% of people in Britain have tried tripe once and will never do so again. As a man who cares far too much about his lunch this strikes me as a Very Real Tragedy. I know I&apos;m meant to applaud the 30% and respect their decision, while rolling my eyes at the others. But I don&apos;t respect the ones who gave it a go. I simply don&apos;t think they were trying hard enough. Tripe is lovely. Admittedly, you have to have it cooked by someone who knows what they&apos;re doing; someone like the great cookery writer Simon Hopkinson who once brought me a Tupperware box of his tripe stew as a thank you for being taken on a review. It had a deep, dark sticky quality as of the very best dishes made from the forgotten bits of animals. Yes, there was a hint of the farmyard and there was an echo of death. But that&apos;s a good thing; some of the greatest of foods are like that. The refuseniks need to try tripe again. And again. And again. Until they finally get the point of it. For once can never be enough. I&apos;m not going to be dictatorial about this. There has to be a cut-off point. But I do think at least half a dozen attempts are in order, which is what I chalked up with the bitter thump of the campari, gin and vermouth-based negroni. And even then I admitted my dislike for negronis was a personal failing. It&apos;s the same with tripe. You can say you don&apos;t like it, but you really have to have made the effort. Twenty-five per cent of respondents said they had tried both Marmite and whisky once and would never again let it past their lips; 16% had made the solitary effort with octopus. Really! Octopus! I despair. Sometimes it&apos;s simply about leaving a healthy gap between attempts. As we age our tastes change. Long into my 20s I hated salted anchovies and goat&apos;s cheese. I came back to them again and again. Now I love them. Because that&apos;s the only proper way to attack the global larder: with conviction. Of course, I do recognise what this means. I understand what I have to do, and it doesn&apos;t involve Morris dancers. Anybody got some salt-fermented sea cucumber?"}, {"sentences": ["Izu Oshima, an island south of Tokyo was worst hit, suffering landslides and flooding.", "During the height of the storm, more than 500 flights at Tokyo&apos;s Haneda and Narita airports were cancelled, and thousands of schools closed."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Natural disasters and extreme weather"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-16T12:30:01Z", "title": "Typhoon Wipha hits Japan: share your experiences", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/16/-typhoon-wipha-japan-experiences", "article": "TyphoonWipha has killed 17 people so far and more than 50 are missing.

But we want to turn away from that now. We&apos;re going to pass and play in a way that we think we can win things.&quot; Colin Gordon is delivering his speech to the 12 members of England&apos;s powerchair football squad. A former professional footballer who went on to become a high-profile agent, Gordon holds the Uefa A licence and is head coach of Sporting Club Albion, one of 12 Premiership powerchair teams in England. He was appointed England&apos;s head coach this summer, when the national team came under the auspices of the FA for the first time \u2013 a landmark moment for one of the fastest-growing disabled sports in this country. Formed in 2005, the Wheelchair Football Association (WFA) has 24 clubs competing nationally across its Premiership and Championship divisions, with four regional leagues below. There are 850 players in England taking part in a mixed-gender sport that is pushing for inclusion at the Paralympics in Tokyo in 2020. That structure and the increased level of interest, together with England&apos;s efforts at the World Cup in Paris two years ago, when they lost to USA in the final, convinced the FA it was time to take full control of the national powerchair team and provide the financial support and facilities that promise to make a huge difference. &quot;I met with the WFA eight years ago,&quot; Jeff Davis, the FA&apos;s national disability development manager, says. &quot;The first thing they said to me was: &apos;Can we have an England team?&apos; We had a small number of players and clubs. &quot;I said: &apos;What you need to do is build your base, because how can we truly say that the players we&apos;ve got in the England select team are the best powerchair players?&apos; &quot;Well, that&apos;s what they&apos;ve done. And they deserve, because of the participation figures, to ensure we give them that opportunity to play as England. Before, they were having to raise all their own money [and play under the WFA]. The FA really wants to provide football for all players, not just for people who are mainstream and can run around, but also for these guys who have undoubtedly got fantastic skill, dedication and commitment.&quot; Their talent and passion was evident during the inaugural England training camp at the national football centre in Burton this month. Using modified powerchairs, with attachments on the front and rear that act as feet, the players moved a 13-inch football about with remarkable control and accuracy. They generate the power to pass or shoot by spinning the chair and sweeping the ball in one fluid movement, which requires technique, timing and coordination. &quot;If you were to jump into the chair, you would be all over the place,&quot; Adam Crowle, the team logistics manager, says, smiling. For powerchair users with a severe physical impairment, such as muscular dystrophy or cerebral palsy, this is one of the few team sports they can play, because it is more about skill than physical exertion. The matches, which are 20 minutes each way, take place on an indoor pitch the size of a regulation basketball court. There are four players on each side and the goal is six metres wide. &quot;It&apos;s quite a tactical game. I&apos;d say it has got a bit of a link to American football,&quot; says Chris Gordon, Colin&apos;s 22-year-old son, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy. &quot;A lot of goals are scored from set-plays \u2013 obviously the teams get used to certain things, so it&apos;s all about creating that play that&apos;s a bit different.&quot; The FA&apos;s support of the national team will enable staff and players to focus completely on those tactics rather than worrying about fundraising. A modified powerchair costs \u00a35,000 and, inevitably, parts need replacing from time to time. Also, every player has a full-time carer (normally a parent), which means the cost of travel and accommodation across the duration of a training camp or an international tournament can be extremely expensive. Those stresses have now been removed, which is a huge shift, so much so that some of the England players&apos; parents felt uncomfortable when asked to submit mileage claims to the FA. Davis hopes that the facilities at St George&apos;s Park along with the expertise of the staff \u2013 Colin Gordon, Crowle and Steve Pearson, the assistant coach (all of whom are voluntary), had the services of a doctor, physiotherapist, powerchair technician and sports analyst during the three-day training camp \u2013 will give the team &quot;those marginal gains to enable them to be the best&quot; come the next World Cup in 2015. It is a fascinating challenge for the man tasked with delivering that success. &quot;I think what you&apos;ve got to appreciate is that the majority of people who&apos;ve coached football play football. We haven&apos;t sat in those chairs and played,&quot; Colin Gordon says. &quot;In fact, I would challenge any top coach \u2013 I might try and get Steve McClaren down here and one or two others \u2013 to come and watch and then go and have an effect on that group of players. It&apos;s very challenging. &quot;But we&apos;ve all been around wheelchairs through family circumstances and situations, we know what players can do individually and what the chairs can do mechanically. What we don&apos;t know yet is how far we can open up the players&apos; minds, to try and release them to play in a more open and attacking way.&quot; For the England players, the new setup provided a glimpse into an exciting future, with the highlight for many being the moment they were given the same training kit that Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney wear. In the case of Jon Bolding, a 25-year-old Londoner who has a rare condition called central core myopathy, which causes leg muscles to develop at a slower rate than normal, the three lions on his chest served as a reminder of how far powerchair football has come in England. &quot;I&apos;ve been pretty much involved with the sport from the start, back in the days when we used to cut a car tyre in half for a bumper and attach it with string across the front of a NHS chair that went about 2mph. So to be involved from that point to now is massive,&quot; Bolding says, smiling. &quot;Throughout the years we&apos;ve been an unofficial England team, where we&apos;ve never worn the shirt. It was nice to be associated with England but deep down you knew it was not &apos;the England team&apos;. So to be here and get given the kit is amazing. This is the best place you could ever be.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["An almost solitary but sparkling example of these principles at work is in the Vertu store in Ginza, Tokyo."], "tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Retail industry", "Business", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Technology", "Burberry", "Apple"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-17T14:15:18Z", "title": "Angela Ahrendts to Apple: what can technology learn from fashion?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/oct/17/angela-ahrendts-apple-burberry-technology-fashion", "article": "With Apple apparently losing its mojo since the death of Steve Jobs, the appointment of Angela Ahrendts seems like an inspired move. The Burberry chief executive turned around a business that was more associated with football hooligans than high fashion, and while Apple might not need such a dramatic turnaround, as a brand famed for product invention, the need for retail innovation is ever present. Part of Burberry&apos;s success can obviously be attributed to Christopher Bailey and his vision and creativity \u2013 we can all remember the Kate Moss swimsuit ad that almost single-handedly propelled the brand back into the luxury fashion stratosphere. However, it was Ahrendts&apos; innovative approach that has truly transformed the business. Relaunching the online store and reinventing the physical store has reaped huge rewards for Burberry, while the acceleration of the retail portfolio with bold moves into untapped markets has been impressive. What particularly interests me about this move is the true opportunity that lies in the convergence of high technology and high fashion. Who wants to wear Google glasses when you can wear Gucci? Or HP when you can have Hermes? Ahrendts&apos; appointment would seem a natural fit for a brand that could well lead the way in wearable technology \u2013 probably likely to be the single most influential trend over the next couple of years, and a category that is about to explode. Or to quote Richard Stoppard, global head of retail strategy at Nokia: &quot;The convergence of beauty of design and pack-leading technology is at the core of Nokia and continues to drive the mobile category. As key players begin to explore wearable technology, it is clear that recruiting visionary leaders who understand the fusion of design, fashion and technology such as Ahrendts will drive true benefits.&quot; So what will this mean more broadly for the consumer electronics category? Fashion has always been about aspiration and lifestyle, and the world of consumer electronics has produced some almost magical products. So why has the consumer electronics category behaved more like the kitchen appliances category? Perhaps we&apos;ll start to see the long overdue demise of the &quot;techs and specs&quot; approach to a more &quot;desires and dreams&quot; vernacular? After all, the price of the average laptop far exceeds the price of your average pair of shoes. Fashion brands have always created stores that allow shoppers to dream \u2013 in fact, many are cathedrals to the brand, every detail considered, every material interrogated and every vista choreographed. An almost solitary but sparkling example of these principles at work is in the Vertu store in Ginza, Tokyo. The environment was created from the beauty and craft of the devices outwards. The brand stands for the elegance of the extraordinary and the environment is tailored to reflect that ethos. Shopping is now an event and a social experience \u2013 it&apos;s the difference between &quot;doing&quot; the shopping and &quot;going&quot; shopping. One is a chore that has to be endured (and more often than not online) and the other is entertainment. Consumer electronics have generally failed spectacularly to deliver anything close to entertainment \u2013 ironic considering the product they are selling. The old view that shoppers can touch and feel in-store and will therefore purchase is simply not enough. Fashion brands know how to create that &quot;must have now&quot; moment. Take the Mulberry store on Bond Street. Sure, you can buy a bag online (and probably cheaper) but when you cross the threshold of the store you enter the Mulberry world. It is a monument to British craft \u2013 the dry stone wall doesn&apos;t just add texture to the environment; it adds texture to the experience. It doesn&apos;t even have to be the luxury end of fashion that consumer electronics can learn from. What if Topshop did consumer electronics? Masterclasses from the coolest tech geeks; an audio department that feels like a nightclub; and a TV lounge where shoppers can hang out with friends and choose a movie, all served up with popcorn and ice cream. Fashion brands have always strived to match the dream of their brand with the reality of the physical environment. In contrast, the magic of technology and how it is retailed always seems to fall short of our expectations. After all, the physical store is still the greatest opportunity a brand has to wow you with its thinking, its story and its products.

Hua Chunying, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, told reporters in Beijing the ministry had issued a &quot;solemn protest&quot; and &quot;strong condemnation&quot; of the pilgrimage to Yasukuni shrine, which honours 2.5 million Japanese war dead, including several class-A war criminals. The visit, made during the shrine&apos;s autumn festival, was &quot;a blatant attempt to whitewash Japanese militarism&apos;s history of aggression and to challenge the outcomes of the second world war and the postwar international order&quot;, Hua said. &quot;China is resolutely opposed to that.&quot; Friday&apos;s visit comes days after the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, indicated he would not visit the site this year in an apparent attempt to ease tensions with China and South Korea. He instead sent a ritual offering of a sacred tree branch earlier this week. Tokyo and Beijing are embroiled in a dispute over ownership of the Senkakus \u2013 known as the Diaoyu in China \u2013 a group of islets in the East China Sea. The territorial row deepened after Japan bought three of the five islets from their private owners just over a year ago. Relations between Japan and South Korea have been overshadowed by a dispute over sovereignty of the Takeshima islands, known by South Koreans as Dokdo, and conflicting views on Japan&apos;s used of Korean sex slaves before and during the second world war. Japan&apos;s internal affairs minister, Yoshitaka Shindo, said he had visited Yasukuni on Friday in a private capacity to remember his grandfather, who died in the battle for Iwo Jima. &quot;I visited in a private capacity to pay homage to those who died in the war and to pray for peace,&quot; Shindo said. &quot;I don&apos;t think it will develop into a diplomatic issue.&quot; Other visitors included the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Katsunobu Kato, who said it was &quot;only natural to pray for the repose of the souls of people who have given their precious lives for the nation&quot;. China and South Korea view Yasukuni as a potent symbol of Japanese militarism, and visits there by politicians as evidence that Japan has yet to atone for atrocities it committed in Asia during the first half of the 20th century. South Korea voiced regret over Abe&apos;s offering. &quot;Our government cannot help but express deep concerns and regret over [his] offering to Yasukuni shrine, which glorifies its past wars of aggression and honours war criminals,&quot; a foreign ministry spokesman said in Seoul. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman stopped short of mentioning Abe directly, saying: &quot;We again ask Japan to seriously contemplate its history of aggression, and to sincerely respect the feelings of China and other victimised countries.&quot; Abe has said he regretted not visiting Yasukuni during his previous term as prime minister from 2006-07, although he went last year while in opposition. No serving Japanese leader has paid his respects at Yasukuni since Junichiro Koizumi in 2006.

Souleyman is now in exile, his native Syria wracked by civil war. &quot;All I want is for it to stop and for everyone to go back to their normal lives,&quot; he says. &quot;When I see hungry people, or dead people, it saddens me. Sometimes I no longer feel like singing.&quot; Souleyman is talking to the Guardian from Turkey, where he&apos;s living reluctantly after his home town, Ras al-Ayn, became uninhabitable following battles between Kurdish separatists, the Syrian army and rebel forces. One trip from Beirut to Turkey through Syria necessitated him dodging bandits and corpse-laden taxis; bombs exploded around him and machine-gun fire filled the air as he dashed to make a flight to an American gig. This should be a triumphant time for Souleyman. He&apos;s about to release his most high-profile album, having gone from local pop star to world music curio to sharing a label with the Arctic Monkeys, leaving a trail of bounding dancers in his wake. His music thumps with an incessant 4/4 rhythm set against syncopated cymbals and digital simulacra of traditional Syrian instruments, with Souleyman himself hollering plaintive entreaties to women who have captured his heart. It&apos;s like a speedy Arab take on dancehall, heated by the same friction between beats and shifting melody that once made acid house so powerful. &quot;I have a good voice, and am interested in music; every person wishes that he was famous and has money and connections and can go visit other countries, and meet people,&quot; he says. &quot;So this was my dream.&quot;            Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Souleyman is a Sunni Arab, but the melting pot of north-eastern Syria feeds into his music, which riffs on a variety of traditional styles. &quot;My music is from the community I come from \u2013 the Kurdish, the Ashuris, the Arabic, they&apos;re all in this community. Even Turkish because it&apos;s so near, it&apos;s just across the border. And even Iraqi.&quot; He and his band started out using traditional instrumentation but switched on to synths and drum machines, the freedom from the physical effort of such fast drumming helping to catalyse their rampant style. &quot;It used to be slow, but when the keyboard came into this music, every year we made it faster, until we reached what we have now,&quot; he says. It&apos;s a style of music that&apos;s built for live performance. &quot;The fast music is a kind of sport, it makes you move \u2013 it&apos;s like any sport where you jump or run. And it&apos;s the same for the audience as well, they tend to dance even more to the fast music.&quot; Keyboardist Rizan Sa&apos;id&apos;s synth lines imitate reedy woodwind at anaerobic intensity, while Souleyman delivers lyrics written by him or by poet collaborators. Even in translation, the mournful lyricism spools out beautifully: &quot;You&apos;re like a high hill that every time I climb I count my steps&quot;, &quot;My small heart is struggling because of your love&quot;. One poet, Hassan Hamadi, even feeds him fresh lines live as Souleyman performs. &quot;This guy is really talented; within seconds he writes a paragraph ready to sing, during a concert,&quot; says Souleyman. In essence this is roughneck folk music \u2013 an update of a style called dabke, a dance based around constant stomping on the ground \u2013 and there has been some grouching from Syrian musicians who say it doesn&apos;t represent the richness of their country&apos;s output. &quot;If one or two people said that, it&apos;s their opinion; I can&apos;t argue with that,&quot; Souleyman says. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s jealousy, maybe it&apos;s something else. This traditional music [blended] with popular music is the way forward; everyone is listening to it.&quot; Originally a labourer by trade, Souleyman pursued music as a sideline, forging his reputation by performing at weddings. Each time he would present the bride and groom with a recording, which means that he now has over 700 albums to his name, with songs that sometimes last over an hour. During a trip to Damascus, Californian musician Mark Gergis heard a Souleyman tape blaring from a market stall and started bulk-buying his work, eventually compiling his best tracks for the Sublime Frequencies label, a process that brought Souleyman to western audience. Soon he started performing occasional dates in small London venues, graduating to festival sets and his current deal with Domino. &apos;There is no music in Syria any more, everything has stopped\u2026 After all this killing and destruction, it&apos;s really hard to make music&apos;     Photograph: Hisham Bharoocha    Since crossing over, he&apos;s collaborated with Bj\u00f6rk on a remix for her Biophilia project and recorded his new album with Kieran Hebden AKA Four Tet. However, Souleyman still has doubts about capturing his essence in a recording studio. &quot;When I go into the studio, I have a fixed programme I have to go with; I don&apos;t have the luxury of making mistakes, of singing what I want. Live, even if I do make a mistake, no one will judge me for that.&quot; His recent globetrotting exploits haven&apos;t really altered his approach; the new tracks are still a pounding, rapidly syncopated miasma, with Souleyman&apos;s yelped pronouncements sounding as if he&apos;s trying to catch the eye of a woman glimpsed in a crowd. &quot;My music has no influences,&quot; he says. &quot;Instead of singing in Syria I&apos;m singing in Tokyo, Hong Kong, the US, Europe \u2013 but the music is still the same.&quot; As he has taken dabke to a global audience, however, his country has descended into the mire, making it harder and harder for Souleyman to sing. &quot;The fact that no one knows what tomorrow will bring is a depressing fact in itself,&quot; he says. &quot;There is no music in Syria any more, everything has stopped. Even if there is a musician who is willing to do music, he&apos;s not doing it like he used to do it before, with joy, with a real will to do it. After all this killing and destruction, it&apos;s really hard to make music. It&apos;s affected everyone, especially me. But I&apos;m not into politics, I don&apos;t know any solution.&quot; Stomp, stomp, stomp: where once the dabke rhythm was about unfettered release, it&apos;s now hard not to hear something sadder and more frustrated in its relentless pounding.Wenu Wenu by Omar Souleyman is out in the UK on Mon Omar Souleyman&apos;s top tracks LEH JANI (1998) The entry point into Souleyman&apos;s world for most.

Do not read if you have not seen the film and don&apos;t want to know anything about it. &quot;I&apos;m going to count to three. There will not be a four.&quot; \u2013 Hans Gruber First things first. I know that Die Hard is 25 years old. I know it&apos;s on TV all the time. I know it probably isn&apos;t even the biggest film on television this weekend. But here I am recapping it. Why? Two reasons. First, I recapped Die Hard 2 \u2013 the insane cross-eyed Gizmo of the Die Hard world \u2013 a few months ago, and now I&apos;m secretly determined to do the whole series before the Guardian film editors wise up and yank this feature from my warm, live hands. And second, Die Hard is the perfect action film. Others may have bigger explosions or more ambitious storylines, but Die Hard is a peerless marriage of plot, arena, execution and cast. Repeated views cannot dull its impact, or its humour, or its humanity. It&apos;s a film that should be watched at every opportunity and, having seen the last two Die Hard movies, all I want to do is sit Bruce Willis down in front of it to remind him who John McClane is supposed to be. &quot;Oh, God. Please don&apos;t let me die.&quot; \u2013 John McClane     Die Hard. Photograph: Allstar     Imagine the John McClane from Die Hard 5 using that quote at any point in the film. When he&apos;s driving off bridges. When he&apos;s leaping from the sort of building that would kill a character like Hans Gruber. Even when he&apos;s murdering scores of Russian baddies in a ballroom, he finds time to say: &quot;We&apos;re not going to die today.&quot; He&apos;s become a shiny-domed Terminator, fazed by nothing and with a leaden one-liner for everything. That&apos;s not who John McClane is. Die Hard&apos;s John McClane is a man in over his head. He&apos;s forced into a terrible situation by chance, and his actions are fueled by fear and love. He&apos;s constantly admonishing himself, or questioning himself, or palpably fearing death. You could easily replicate the biggest threat he faces in the film by slipping off your shoes and taking a broom handle to a greenhouse. He sizes up against people he can&apos;t beat in a straight fight. He&apos;s vulnerable enough to be underestimated by Gruber. He&apos;s a human being. He&apos;s Bruce Willis basking in the afterglow of Moonlighting, before he was curdled into a reluctant grump by the prospect of spending his entire life promoting second-rate sequels. To watch the Die Hard series consecutively is to watch a man grow increasingly dead behind the eyes. It&apos;s almost like Breaking Bad, but without as many laughs. &quot;You use a gun, I use a fountain pen. What&apos;s the difference?&quot; \u2013 Harry Ellis For all the talk of one-man armies it generated back in 1988, Die Hard isn&apos;t just about John McClane. He&apos;s always had help in these films, in the form of Samuel L Jackson or Justin Long or that weird coat-obsessed janitor from Die Hard 2. But what makes the first Die Hard shine is McClane&apos;s indelible supporting team. Whether it&apos;s Sgt Al Powell (who likes Twinkies and once accidentally killed a child), Argyle (the nervous limo driver who dances for 90 minutes and then helps John save the day) or Holly (who grounds the film in a reality missing from all the other installments), every non-evil character in Die Hard is a cog. Remove them and the entire film falls apart.     Die Hard Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive     Similarly, although Alan Rickman got all the attention for his portrayal of Hans Gruber, all the other evil-doers are just as worthy of recognition. In fact, the most gold is found at the thin end of the villain spectrum \u2013 past the range where people want to blow everyone up and kill policemen, past the grunting henchman range and deep into the bit where you find the high-frequency douchebags. There is an argument, however slight, that the two best characters in Die Hard are Richard Thornburg and Harry Ellis. One is a fast-talking cokehead who throws McClane&apos;s plan spiralling into disarray because he&apos;s far too convinced of his own abilities (because it was the 1980s), and the other is a conniving reporter who \u2013 in a move that isn&apos;t timely or topical \u2013 endangers everyone&apos;s security in the pursuit of freedom of speech. Though they exist on the periphery of the plot, these two slimy, self-interested arseholes are why I love Die Hard so much.

Writer Ben Trebilcook has been working on a script for Die Hard 6. It&apos;s set in Tokyo, presumably for the Nakatomi connection, and Trebilcook hinted on Twitter that we might see some old faces again.

Do you know how hard you have to edit your menu to pull that off?&quot; Then: &quot;Twenty-seven minutes. That&apos;s the average meal at Jiro&apos;s in Tokyo. &quot;\u00a0 We are having a 63-minute lunch at Ss\u00e4m Bar, on 2nd Avenue, and my effort at following the &quot;thread&quot; (&quot;Can you reinvent the lentil?&quot; or &quot;I want to make simple food new,&quot; or &quot;My dream is good food for people who don&apos;t give a shit&quot;) is not unlike catching a fish with your hands. Chang doesn&apos;t have a mission statement. He has an encyclopedia of them. Actually, Chang in conversation is not unlike Chang on the plate (from pork belly buns to caramelised corn flakes to shavings of frozen foie gras), which is not unlike what might be referred to as Chang&apos;s &quot;anti-business business plan.&quot; Chang, 36, a proprietor-chef for nine years, has four restaurants, six bakeries, a commissary, a fermentation lab, a kitchen-tool thinktank, a magazine, plus restaurants in Australia and Canada.\u00a0 I ask Chang to list 10 things that are important to him. &quot;Japan,&quot; he says and thinks. &quot;Street food.&quot; He pauses. &quot;Hoping, one day, to pay everyone $20 a hour.&quot; (Chang employs 600 people.)

Her first name means &quot;love&quot; in Japanese, and is a keepsake from her earlier days as a professional dominatrix. Back then, about 15 years ago, she was Queen Ai, or Queen Love, and she did &quot;all the usual things&quot; like tying people up and dripping hot wax on their nipples. Her work today, she says, is far more challenging. Aoyama, 52, is trying to cure what Japan&apos;s media calls sekkusu shinai shokogun, or &quot;celibacy syndrome&quot;. Japan&apos;s under-40s appear to be losing interest in conventional relationships. Millions aren&apos;t even dating, and increasing numbers can&apos;t be bothered with sex. For their government, &quot;celibacy syndrome&quot; is part of a looming national catastrophe. Japan already has one of the world&apos;s lowest birth rates. Its population of 126 million, which has been shrinking for the past decade, is projected to plunge a further one-third by 2060. Aoyama believes the country is experiencing &quot;a flight from human intimacy&quot; \u2013 and it&apos;s partly the government&apos;s fault. The sign outside her building says &quot;Clinic&quot;. She greets me in yoga pants and fluffy animal slippers, cradling a Pekingese dog whom she introduces as Marilyn Monroe. In her business pamphlet, she offers up the gloriously random confidence that she visited North Korea in the 1990s and squeezed the testicles of a top army general. It doesn&apos;t say whether she was invited there specifically for that purpose, but the message to her clients is clear: she doesn&apos;t judge. Inside, she takes me upstairs to her &quot;relaxation room&quot; \u2013 a bedroom with no furniture except a double futon. &quot;It will be quiet in here,&quot; she says. Aoyama&apos;s first task with most of her clients is encouraging them &quot;to stop apologising for their own physical existence&quot;. The number of single people has reached a record high. A survey in 2011 found that 61% of unmarried men and 49% of women aged 18-34 were not in any kind of romantic relationship, a rise of almost 10% from five years earlier. Another study found that a third of people under 30 had never dated at all. (There are no figures for same-sex relationships.) Although there has long been a pragmatic separation of love and sex in Japan \u2013 a country mostly free of religious morals \u2013 sex fares no better. A survey earlier this year by the Japan Family Planning Association (JFPA) found that 45% of women aged 16-24 &quot;were not interested in or despised sexual contact&quot;. More than a quarter of men felt the same way.     Learning to love: sex counsellor Ai Aoyama, with one of her clients and her dog Marilyn. Photograph: Eric Rechsteiner/Panos Picture    Many people who seek her out, says Aoyama, are deeply confused. &quot;Some want a partner, some prefer being single, but few relate to normal love and marriage.&quot; However, the pressure to conform to Japan&apos;s anachronistic family model of salaryman husband and stay-at-home wife remains. &quot;People don&apos;t know where to turn. They&apos;re coming to me because they think that, by wanting something different, there&apos;s something wrong with them.&quot; Official alarmism doesn&apos;t help. Fewer babies were born here in 2012 than any year on record. (This was also the year, as the number of elderly people shoots up, that adult incontinence pants outsold baby nappies in Japan for the first time.) Kunio Kitamura, head of the JFPA, claims the demographic crisis is so serious that Japan &quot;might eventually perish into extinction&quot;. Japan&apos;s under-40s won&apos;t go forth and multiply out of duty, as postwar generations did. The country is undergoing major social transition after 20 years of economic stagnation. It is also battling against the effects on its already nuclear-destruction-scarred psyche of 2011&apos;s earthquake, tsunami and radioactive meltdown. There is no going back. &quot;Both men and women say to me they don&apos;t see the point of love. They don&apos;t believe it can lead anywhere,&quot; says Aoyama. &quot;Relationships have become too hard.&quot; Marriage has become a minefield of unattractive choices. Japanese men have become less career-driven, and less solvent, as lifetime job security has waned. Japanese women have become more independent and ambitious. Yet conservative attitudes in the home and workplace persist. Japan&apos;s punishing corporate world makes it almost impossible for women to combine a career and family, while children are unaffordable unless both parents work. Cohabiting or unmarried parenthood is still unusual, dogged by bureaucratic disapproval. Aoyama says the sexes, especially in Japan&apos;s giant cities, are &quot;spiralling away from each other&quot;. Lacking long-term shared goals, many are turning to what she terms &quot;Pot Noodle love&quot; \u2013 easy or instant gratification, in the form of casual sex, short-term trysts and the usual technological suspects: online porn, virtual-reality &quot;girlfriends&quot;, anime cartoons. Or else they&apos;re opting out altogether and replacing love and sex with other urban pastimes. Some of Aoyama&apos;s clients are among the small minority who have taken social withdrawal to a pathological extreme. They are recovering hikikomori (&quot;shut-ins&quot; or recluses) taking the first steps to rejoining the outside world, otaku (geeks), and long-term parasaito shingurus (parasite singles) who have reached their mid-30s without managing to move out of home. (Of the estimated 13 million unmarried people in Japan who currently live with their parents, around three million are over the age of 35.) &quot;A few people can&apos;t relate to the opposite sex physically or in any other way. They flinch if I touch them,&quot; she says. &quot;Most are men, but I&apos;m starting to see more women.&quot;     No sex in the city: (from left) friends Emi Kuwahata, 23, and Eri Asada, 22, shopping in Tokyo. Photograph: Eric Rechsteiner/Panos Pictures    Aoyama cites one man in his early 30s, a\u00a0virgin, who can&apos;t get sexually aroused unless he watches female robots on a game similar to Power Rangers. &quot;I use therapies, such as yoga and hypnosis, to relax him and help him to understand the way that real human bodies work.&quot; Sometimes, for an extra fee, she gets naked with her male clients \u2013 &quot;strictly no intercourse&quot; \u2013 to physically guide them around the female form. Keen to see her nation thrive, she likens her role in these cases to that of the Edo period courtesans, or oiran, who used to initiate samurai sons into the art of erotic pleasure. Aversion to marriage and intimacy in modern life is not unique to Japan. Nor is growing preoccupation with digital technology. But what endless Japanese committees have failed to grasp when they stew over the country&apos;s procreation-shy youth is that, thanks to official shortsightedness, the decision to stay single often makes perfect sense. This is true for both sexes, but it&apos;s especially true for women. &quot;Marriage is a woman&apos;s grave,&quot; goes an old Japanese saying that refers to wives being ignored in favour of mistresses. For Japanese women today, marriage is the grave of their hard-won careers. I meet Eri Tomita, 32, over Saturday morning coffee in the smart Tokyo district of Ebisu. Tomita has a job she loves in the human resources department of a French-owned bank. A fluent French speaker with two university degrees, she avoids romantic attachments so she can focus on work. &quot;A boyfriend proposed to me three years ago. I turned him down when I\u00a0realised I cared more about my job. After that, I lost interest in dating. It became awkward when the question of the future came up.&quot; Tomita says a woman&apos;s chances of promotion in Japan stop dead as soon as she marries. &quot;The bosses assume you will get pregnant.&quot; Once a woman does have a child, she adds, the long, inflexible hours become unmanageable. &quot;You have to resign. You end up being a housewife with no independent income. It&apos;s not an option for women like me.&quot; Around 70% of Japanese women leave their jobs after their first child. The World Economic Forum consistently ranks Japan as one of the world&apos;s worst nations for gender equality at work. Social attitudes don&apos;t help. Married working women are sometimes demonised as oniyome, or &quot;devil wives&quot;. In a telling Japanese ballet production of Bizet&apos;s Carmen a few years ago, Carmen was portrayed as a career woman who stole company secrets to get ahead and then framed her lowly security-guard lover Jos\u00e9. Her end was not pretty. Prime minister Shinzo Abe recently trumpeted long-overdue plans to increase female economic participation by improving conditions and daycare, but Tomita says things would have to improve &quot;dramatically&quot; to compel her to become a working wife and mother. &quot;I have a great life. I go out with my girl friends \u2013 career women like me \u2013 to French and Italian restaurants. I buy stylish clothes and go on nice holidays. I love my independence.&quot; Tomita sometimes has one-night stands with men she meets in bars, but she says sex is not a priority, either. &quot;I often get asked out by married men in the office who want an affair. They assume I&apos;m desperate because I&apos;m single.&quot; She grimaces, then shrugs. &quot;Mendokusai.&quot; Mendokusai translates loosely as &quot;Too troublesome&quot; or &quot;I can&apos;t be bothered&quot;. It&apos;s the word I hear both sexes use most often when they talk about their relationship phobia. Romantic commitment seems to represent burden and drudgery, from the exorbitant costs of buying property in Japan to the uncertain expectations of a spouse and in-laws. And the centuries-old belief that the purpose of marriage is to produce children endures. Japan&apos;s Institute of Population and Social Security reports an astonishing 90% of young women believe that staying single is &quot;preferable to what they imagine marriage to be like&quot;. The sense of crushing obligation affects men just as much. Satoru Kishino, 31, belongs to a large tribe of men under 40 who are engaging in a kind of passive rebellion against traditional Japanese masculinity. Amid the recession and unsteady wages, men like Kishino feel that the pressure on them to be breadwinning economic warriors for a wife and family is unrealistic. They are rejecting the pursuit of both career and romantic success. &quot;It&apos;s too troublesome,&quot; says Kishino, when I ask why he&apos;s not interested in having a girlfriend. &quot;I don&apos;t earn a huge salary to go on dates and I don&apos;t want the responsibility of a woman hoping it might lead to marriage.&quot; Japan&apos;s media, which has a name for every social kink, refers to men like Kishino as &quot;herbivores&quot; or soshoku danshi (literally, &quot;grass-eating men&quot;). Kishino says he doesn&apos;t mind the label because it&apos;s become so commonplace. He defines it as &quot;a heterosexual man for whom relationships and sex are unimportant&quot;. The phenomenon emerged a few years ago with the airing of a Japanese manga-turned-TV show. The lead character in Otomen (&quot;Girly Men&quot;) was a tall martial arts champion, the king of tough-guy cool. Secretly, he loved baking cakes, collecting &quot;pink sparkly things&quot; and knitting clothes for his stuffed animals. To the tooth-sucking horror of Japan&apos;s corporate elders, the show struck a powerful chord with the generation they spawned.     \u2018I find women attractive but I\u2019ve learned to live without sex. Emotional entanglements are too complicated\u2019: Satoru Kishino, 31. Photograph: Eric Rechsteiner/Panos Pictures    Kishino, who works at a fashion accessories company as a designer and manager, doesn&apos;t knit. But he does like cooking and cycling, and platonic friendships. &quot;I find some of my female friends attractive but I&apos;ve learned to live without sex. Emotional entanglements are too complicated,&quot; he says. &quot;I can&apos;t be bothered.&quot; Romantic apathy aside, Kishino, like Tomita, says he enjoys his active single life. Ironically, the salaryman system that produced such segregated marital roles \u2013 wives inside the home, husbands at work for 20 hours a day \u2013 also created an ideal environment for solo living. Japan&apos;s cities are full of conveniences made for one, from stand-up noodle bars to capsule hotels to the ubiquitous konbini (convenience stores), with their shelves of individually wrapped rice balls and disposable underwear. These things originally evolved for salarymen on the go, but there are now female-only caf\u00e9s, hotel floors and even the odd apartment block. And Japan&apos;s cities are extraordinarily crime-free. Some experts believe the flight from marriage is not merely a rejection of outdated norms and gender roles. It could be a long-term state of affairs. &quot;Remaining single was once the ultimate personal failure,&quot; says Tomomi Yamaguchi, a Japanese-born assistant professor of anthropology at Montana State University in America. &quot;But more people are finding they prefer it.&quot; Being single by choice is becoming, she believes, &quot;a new reality&quot;. Is Japan providing a glimpse of all our futures? Many of the shifts there are occurring in other advanced nations, too. Across urban Asia, Europe and America, people are marrying later or not at all, birth rates are falling, single-occupant households are on the rise and, in countries where economic recession is worst, young people are living at home. But demographer Nicholas Eberstadt argues that a distinctive set of factors is accelerating these trends in Japan. These factors include the lack of a religious authority that ordains marriage and family, the country&apos;s precarious earthquake-prone ecology that engenders feelings of futility, and the high cost of living and raising children. &quot;Gradually but relentlessly, Japan is evolving into a type of society whose contours and workings have only been contemplated in science fiction,&quot; Eberstadt wrote last year. With a vast army of older people and an ever-dwindling younger generation, Japan may become a &quot;pioneer people&quot; where individuals who never marry exist in significant numbers, he said. Japan&apos;s 20-somethings are the age group to watch. Most are still too young to have concrete future plans, but projections for them are already laid out. According to the government&apos;s population institute, women in their early 20s today have a one-in-four chance of never marrying. Their chances of remaining childless are even higher: almost 40%. They don&apos;t seem concerned. Emi Kuwahata, 23, and her friend, Eri Asada, 22, meet me in the shopping district of Shibuya. The caf\u00e9 they choose is beneath an art gallery near the train station, wedged in an alley between pachinko pinball parlours and adult video shops. Kuwahata, a fashion graduate, is in a casual relationship with a man 13 years her senior. &quot;We meet once a week to go clubbing,&quot; she says. &quot;I don&apos;t have time for a regular boyfriend. I&apos;m trying to become a fashion designer.&quot; Asada, who studied economics, has no interest in love. &quot;I gave up dating three years ago. I don&apos;t miss boyfriends or sex. I don&apos;t even like holding hands.&quot; Asada insists nothing happened to put her off physical contact. She just doesn&apos;t want a relationship and casual sex is not a good option, she says, because &quot;girls can&apos;t have flings without being judged&quot;. Although Japan is sexually permissive, the current fantasy ideal for women under 25 is impossibly cute and virginal. Double standards abound. In the Japan Family Planning Association&apos;s 2013 study on sex among young people, there was far more data on men than women. I asked the association&apos;s head, Kunio Kitamura, why. &quot;Sexual drive comes from males,&quot; said the man who advises the government. &quot;Females do not experience the same levels of desire.&quot; Over iced tea served by skinny-jeaned boys with meticulously tousled hair, Asada and Kuwahata say they share the usual singleton passions of clothes, music and shopping, and have hectic social lives. But, smart phones in hand, they also admit they spend far more time communicating with their friends via online social networks than seeing them in the flesh. Asada adds she&apos;s spent &quot;the past two years&quot; obsessed with a virtual game that lets her act as a\u00a0manager of a\u00a0sweet shop. Japanese-American author Roland Kelts, who writes about Japan&apos;s youth, says it&apos;s inevitable that the future of Japanese relationships will be largely technology driven. &quot;Japan has developed incredibly sophisticated virtual worlds and online communication systems. Its smart phone apps are the world&apos;s most imaginative.&quot; Kelts says the need to escape into private, virtual worlds in Japan stems from the fact that it&apos;s an overcrowded nation with limited physical space. But he also believes the rest of the world is not far behind. Getting back to basics, former dominatrix Ai Aoyama \u2013 Queen Love \u2013 is determined to educate her clients on the value of &quot;skin-to-skin, heart-to-heart&quot; intimacy. She accepts that technology will shape the future, but says society must ensure it doesn&apos;t take over. &quot;It&apos;s not healthy that people are becoming so physically disconnected from each other,&quot; she says. &quot;Sex with another person is a human need that produces feel-good hormones and helps people to function better in their daily lives.&quot; Aoyama says she sees daily that people crave human warmth, even if they don&apos;t want the hassle of marriage or a long-term relationship. She berates the government for &quot;making it hard for single people to live however they want&quot; and for &quot;whipping up fear about the falling birth rate&quot;. Whipping up fear in people, she says, doesn&apos;t help anyone. And that&apos;s from a woman who knows a bit about whipping."}, {"sentences": ["Nine senior players, expected to include the captain, Richie McCaw, and injured fly-half, Daniel Carter, will fly directly to Paris to prepare for the match against France on 9 November, with the rest joining them after the match in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Autumn internationals", "England rugby union team", "Stuart Lancaster", "Tom Wood", "Chris Robshaw", "Sport", "Rugby union", "Northampton", "Harlequins", "Heineken Cup"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-20T20:49:00Z", "title": "Stuart Lancaster urged to pick Tom Wood as England's autumn captain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/20/stuart-lancaster-tom-wood-england-autumn-captain", "article": "England&apos;s head coach, Stuart Lancaster, still pondering the best man to lead his team in next month&apos;s autumn internationals, has been advised to select Northampton&apos;s Tom Wood as his captain against Australia at Twickenham on 2 November.

Lancaster intends to talk to all of his squad players individually on Monday before announcing his captain on Wednesday but is reluctant to heap too much responsibility on one person&apos;s shoulders and wants as many on-field leaders as he can muster. The 34-man squad will be spending this week preparing in Leeds and will also be assessed injury-wise following a bruising Heineken Cup fortnight.

Wellington loose forward Ardie Savea, the younger brother of winger Julian, has been included as an &apos;apprentice&apos; player for the tour to get a taste of the All Blacks environment, coach Steve Hansen said. &quot;We are continuing the scheme we started with the younger hookers who came into camp earlier this year and, like them, the aim of the initiative is to give him exposure to all aspects of the All Blacks environment,&quot; Hansen said in a statement.

Photograph: Felip Trueba/Alamy    Relations between Iran and the west are beginning to thaw. Barack Obama spoke to Iran&apos;s new president, Hassan Rouhani, on the phone last month, in the first direct contact between American and Iranian leaders since 1979. This week, talks between the Iranian government and a six-nation negotiating group started in Geneva. Hugh Fraser of Corinthian Travel believes that where politicians lead, tourists will follow: &quot;After 34 years, the west may be on the cusp of a new era in its relationship with Iran. Provided the talks succeed, and a resumption of normalised diplomatic and trade relations follows, we may see tourism returning to Iran as early as the autumn of next year.&quot; It&apos;s a big proviso. The Foreign Office is still advising against all travel to parts of Iran, and all but essential travel to the remainder of the country. But Jonny Bealby, founder of Wild Frontiers, expects the warnings to be lifted soon. His company took 25 people on group tours to Iran this year, and advance bookings show at least twice as much demand for 2014. He says: &quot;Iran is second to none in terms of historical sites, and the people are fantastically hospitable, liberal, fun and interested in the west.&quot; BIndeed, before the Iranian revolution in 1979, the country was a major tourist destination for western tourists, with highlights including the ruins of Persepolis, the gardens of Shiraz, and the bridges, squares and monuments of Isfahan. Early tours will be expensive: expect to pay around \u00a32,800 for two weeks, plus flights (Turkish Airlines flies Heathrow-Tehran via Istanbul for about \u00a3450 return). But, as happened in Burma, when a country opens up to tourists, travel companies are quick to meet the new demand \u2013 and prices can fall rapidly.

Lovers of what are called arthouse movies resent the label for being derisive and philistine. And those who detest it bristle at the implication that there is no artistry or intelligence in mainstream entertainment. For many, the stereotypical arthouse film is Ingmar Bergman&apos;s The Seventh Seal. Sergei Eisenstein&apos;s Battleship Potemkin was a classic art film from the 1920s and Luis Bu\u00f1uel investigated cinema&apos;s potential for surreality like no one before or since. The Italian neorealists applied the severity of art to a representation of society and the French New Wave iconoclastically brought a self-deconstructing critical awareness to film-making. Yasujiro Ozu conveyed a transcendental simplicity in his work. Andrei Tarkovsky and Michelangelo Antonioni achieved a meditative beauty, while David Lynch and John Cassavetes demonstrated an American reflex to the genre. Arthouse cinema is dismissed as the connoisseur&apos;s elite fetish; others find it, in the dumbed-down cinema jungle, to be an endangered species. 10. The Gospel According to Saint Matthew     'Austere and realistic': Enrique Irazoqui in The Gospel According to St Matthew. Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive    A gay, Marxist Catholic: not the most likely candidate, you&apos;d have thought, to make arguably the greatest of all religious films \u2013 and one of the very few based on the New Testament that doesn&apos;t lapse into hectoring, literal piety. Pasolini had already roused the wrath of the religious establishment with La Ricotta, a 35-minute comedy on the making of a biblical film; he actually received a four-month jail sentence as a result. But the Gospel According to St Matthew is altogether different: serious, spiritual and utterly clear-eyed about getting to the heart of the Christian gospel. And though Pasolini remained a non-believer, his film was dedicated to &quot;the dear, happy, familiar memory of Pope John XXIII&quot;. This was Pasolini&apos;s third full-length feature, and with it he began his experiments with anthropology that would mark much of his future output. An hour-long documentary, Location Hunting in Palestine, showed him looking for places to shoot his film; intriguingly, he rejected modern Israel and neighbouring Arab areas for having lost the ancient biblical spirit. He ended up doing what you suspect he wanted to do all along: filming in the rundown southern Italian city of Matera. Pasolini&apos;s Gospel is a long way away from the stolid interpretations we&apos;ve become accustomed to from the Cecil B DeMille school. Everything is simplicity itself: the primitive backdrop, the sparsely sketched-in scenes, the minimal dialogue (practically all lifted from the biblical text itself). Pasolini&apos;s aim was to extract the ancient essence from the Jesus story; he does this not by exact recreation, but by inspecting faces, evoking Renaissance and medieval iconography, and mixing Bach, Mozart, spirituals and African masses on the soundtrack. If ever a film told a beautiful, brutal truth, this is it. Andrew Pulver 9. The White Ribbon     Scene from Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon (2009). Photograph: PR    What is it about Michael Haneke&apos;s 2009 Palme d&apos;Or winner that makes it so immaculately disquieting? It&apos;s not just the plot: a series of crimes \u2013 some ascribable, most anonymous \u2013 rumple the surface of a small town in northern Germany on the eve of the first world war. A disciplinarian doctor tries and fails to instil a sense of responsibility and culpability into his children. A woman is left by her lover, then subjected to a torrent of abuse that makes Max von Sydow&apos;s dismissal of his girlfriend in Ingmar Bergman&apos;s Winter Light (a film whose warm monochrone this movie echoes) look compassionate in comparison. It&apos;s clearly \u2013 and this is, by and large, a strikingly foggy film \u2013 a fascist parable, an attempt at explaining the psychology of the people who came to power some 30 years later. It&apos;s also a mystery without resolution, a whodunnit with a hole at the centre \u2013 which is why it&apos;s one of those films more satisfying on second view, when you&apos;re primed for the withheld resolution. But all this is standard-issue for Haneke \u2013 not a huge leap on from Hidden or Funny Games. What makes The White Ribbon the finer \u2013 and the more sinister \u2013 film are the flickers of warmth and humour. The doctor&apos;s young son, traumatised by the death of his pet caged bird, and, most of all, the unimpeachably sweet romance between our schoolmaster narrator and a fresh-faced servant girl. The scene in which they go for a picnic and she tearfully requests that they don&apos;t go to a spot too remote, is unforgettable, less for the undertone of previous horrors, than the fiance&apos;s baffled acquiescence. When all around you have a heart of coal, kindness can be the more upsetting. Haneke&apos;s films always feel, once the credits have rolled, untoppable. This one surely is. Catherine Shoard 8. Fanny and Alexander     Fanny and Alexander: Xan Brooks's dream Christmas viewing. Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive    Ingmar Bergman&apos;s self-styled farewell to cinema is an opulent family saga, by turns bawdy, stark and strange. For novices who are put off by the director&apos;s reputation as a dour, difficult doom master, the film provides a good introduction. But it may also count as the ideal final destination: the picture in which Bergman took hold of his demons and forged a kind of truce. The plot, in a nutshell, goes like this: two wealthy siblings, Fanny (Pernilla Allwin) and Alexander (Bertil Guve), grow up in the bosom of a lovingly dysfunctional home. Following their father&apos;s death, their mother marries the bishop (a superb performance from Jan Malmsj\u00f6) and an Oedipal struggle breaks out between Alexander and his icy new stepfather. Matters are resolved in a devastating final section inside an old curiosity shop in which Alexander is shown &quot;the swift way that evil thoughts can go&quot;. Along the way we run across an androgynous madman, a bloated, bedridden aunt and a lecherous uncle who lights his own farts. Few films boast as many indelible supporting characters as Fanny and Alexander. Bergman diehards usually cite this as the director&apos;s most user-friendly film, as though that&apos;s somehow a bad thing. True, it contains more in the way of light and warmth than some of his more nakedly anguished masterworks. But light does not necessarily mean lite, and certain sections are as harrowing and profound as anything you find in Cries and Whispers or Through a Glass Darkly. In fact, by the time this film pitches towards that astonishing climax (bedsheets burning; magic working) one might even make a case for Fanny and Alexander as Bergman&apos;s most mature, clear-sighted and fully realised work. It strikes me that the director spent the bulk of his career tackling the notion of a world without God (how liberating this is; how terrifying, too), only to arrive at the conclusion that we are all God, and that man makes God in his own image, for better or worse. Significantly, the God who crops up in these final moments is represented by a cheap dummy, jiggled into life by an untrustworthy puppet-master. He is also embodied by an overimaginative child, still smarting from his father&apos;s death and sending malign thoughts out into the ether. And then he is, by implication, the director himself; a man who spent a lifetime conjuring entire worlds on a black-and-white screen and yet who never managed one as beguiling, as terrible and true as the one we see here. Xan Brooks 7. Days of Heaven     Richard Gere (centre) in Terrence Malick's film Days of Heaven from 1978.  Photograph: The Kobal Collection/www.kobal-collection.com    Art for art&apos;s sake, and proud of it, Days of Heaven has no reason to exist beyond the fact that Terence Malick was determined to make it exist and, as with all Malick&apos;s movies, it finally came to exist entirely on his own terms. Using a story as wispy as a fable, Malick constructed one of the most mesmerisingly beautiful evocations of the past ever laid on celluloid. Set between 1916 and 1918, it follows three urban fugitives (Richard Gere, Brooke Adams and Malick&apos;s wonderful discovery Linda Manz) as they flee smoky Chicago for the Texas panhandle and seasonal jobs as wheat harvesters. Days of Heaven takes time to linger on every exquisite image conjured up by Malick and his cinematographer, N\u00e9stor Almendros. A train loaded with harvest migrants sailing, it seems, over a high viaduct bridge; a locust storm that turns into a wheat-field inferno; the many harvest scenes shot at &quot;the magic hour&quot; after the sun has gone down and its last horizontal rays remain. Malick was determined to emulate the silent movies of the film&apos;s own historic setting, and therefore used many of the same methods, ordering his crew to turn off the lighting set-ups and allowing Almendros (and his replacement, Haskell Wexler) to use film stock that greedily drank up the meagre light available in the most gorgeously grainy ways. The interiors are not studio-shot, but take place inside the building whose exteriors one sees in the movie. Against such beauty the humans inevitably seem like small figures dwarfed by malign fate. But the performances are vividly real and Manz&apos;s narration is one of the universal benchmarks of the movie voiceover. John Patterson 6. A Clockwork Orange     Stephen Woolley's first X-rated film \u2026 A Clockwork Orange. Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive    Even though it was made in long-ago 1971, there is still something fetishistically futuristic about A Clockwork Orange. Perhaps that is owed to the exuberant and indelible production design, its characters&apos; peculiar teenage argot (&quot;nadsat&quot;) or its electrified, classical score by transsexual composer Walter (later Wendy) Carlos \u2013 or perhaps simply because the early 70s were crazier \u2013 in hyper-stylised design and fashion \u2013 than any period since. Either way, A Clockwork Orange endures, not so much for its philosophical musings on the nature of free will in the face of good and evil, but because it is simply a triumph of style from its opening sequence in the Korova Milk Bar through its cartoony violence and horrible retribution, all the way to its bizarre final shot of Alex (Malcolm McDowell in a role that has dogged him for 40 years) having wild sex before an audience of voyeurs clad in Louis XIV courtier finery as he crows: &quot;I was cured all right!&quot; Kubrick thought of every detail in the costuming (the droogs&apos; white thug outfits, with their crotch-emphatic outer jockstraps and bowler hats, not to mention Alex&apos;s false eyelashes), furniture, decor and art (the giant plaster penis that Alex uses as a murder weapon) \u2013 giving them as much attention as he had to the dashboards of his bomber in Dr Strangelove, the spaceships in 2001, or the painterly compositions in Barry Lyndon. Within the universe he created, he let loose a cast of characters closer to grotesque gargoyle status than anything in the rest of Kubrick&apos;s body of work, and it is here that Kubrick first deploys his tactic of starting close-up on a face and pulling back drastically to show its environs (by the time of The Shining, most of his camera movements tracked maniacally forwards, not sombrely backwards). These days we have cause to wonder what all the fuss over the violence in the movie was about. It seems so tame now (and probably did even then, alongside, say, Straw Dogs). Evidently the copycat aspect of the audience response \u2013 certain violent crimes were rumoured to have been inspired by the film \u2013 was real enough for Kubrick, who made the movie unavailable in his adopted homeland for the rest of his life. More&apos;s the pity, because it&apos;s a crucial British film of its period, and a key to our larger understanding of Kubrick himself. JP 5. Citizen Kane      So many things about Citizen Kane were outrageous at the time: that this arrogant kid, Orson Welles, in his early 20s, had a deal to do what he liked; that he chose to make a thinly disguised lampoon of one of the most powerful men in the country, William Randolph Hearst; that it was a film ultimately about his own flawed glory (&quot;There, but for the grace of God, goes God,&quot; people said); that he made the picture look and sound richer, denser and more beautiful than anyone had dared before; that he took the attitude, &quot;Don&apos;t expect to understand this on one viewing&quot;; that he cared more about being outrageous than he did about the money. If only a few of those ideas gained ground, Hollywood was in trouble. The secret might get out that film could be art! This astonishing, un-American notion took time to get established. The Hearst media did all they could to block the film. Citizen Kane was a hard film for audiences raised on the slick narrative arc of Hollywood pictures to understand, with its scheme of flashbacks. And Welles would prove not only self-destructive, but also his own worst enemy \u2013 why let anyone else fill that vital job? Yet it worked in the end. Ordinary film-makers knew that the work with lenses, darkness, sound and structure was unique. The film was full of wonderful new actors. The French critics seized upon it. By the late 50s, Citizen Kane was proverbial: it was cinema itself, a tribute to directors, as well as the power and opportunity of cinema. It breathed the unAmerican gospel: see what one man can do, see how films can be owned and authored not by the factory, but by brilliant minds bent on self-expression. And so a new orthodoxy set in, whereby Kane became the best film ever made, a position it has held for 60 years. That greatness now hangs over the history and the future of the medium. Still, if you have never seen it, prepare for one of the great experiences in your life and notice this \u2013 Kane has lasted not for innovation alone, but because it is so emotional and tragic. It&apos;s a great man asking himself whether anything matters. In Kane and Welles alike, there was the same rueful mixture of genius and lack of self-belief. David Thomson 4. Tokyo Story     \"Now I have only to look at the opening credits of Tokyo Story and I\u2019m welling up\" \u2026 Anne Billson    It&apos;s dangerous to start watching Japanese cinema, because the world is so extensive and dazzling you may quickly develop a taste for nothing but Japanese films. Is there a romance more mysterious than Mizoguchi&apos;s Ugetsu Monogatari? Is there action to surpass Kurosawa&apos;s Seven Samurai? And, in terms of family drama, has any film been more moving than Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story? Time and again, Ozu has made films about family, and the shifting structure we refer to as &quot;time and again&quot;. Family is less a fixed entity than a kind of weather system that keeps coming back. So children need parents, and need to outlive them. But while the weather will go on, and your children will become parents, so your life will close, and you will not be there to see the way your own children look back as if to say they understand you, too late. Is this tragedy or comedy? Ozu is never quite sure. He seems to wonder whether any progression can amount to tragedy, or whether it is not simply as inevitable as passing time and changing light. This may not sound &quot;entertaining&quot; or active or even interesting, which only means the viewer needs to undergo the gentle process of being helped to see through Ozu&apos;s withdrawn but compassionate style. So he watches from the corner of a room at a low level (for Japanese domestic life is often conducted from a sitting position) and he declines to rush in with forgiving, approving, loving close-ups \u2013 because he believes people are beyond forgiveness or individual glamour. Family is a group in which everyone has his or her reason. In Tokyo Story, Shukishi and Tomi Hirayama (Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama) visit their grown children, full of hope and the wish to be recognised, but they find the children too busy, too preoccupied. This is not depicted as bad behaviour, or a sign of cultural breakdown; it is the way of the world. The acting is intimate, humane and reserved yet there are no stars, let alone heroes or heroines. There are no &quot;happy endings&quot; in the terms western culture requires. Instead, the riddle of happiness or its opposite runs through &quot;time and again&quot; like light on moving water. Does it sound dull, or too simple? Be warned \u2013 it can make other films seem unbearably crass. DT 3. L&apos;Atalante     L'Atalante Photograph: BFI    At the age of 29, Jean Vigo died from rheumatic septicaemia, just a few days after the opening of his only feature film, L&apos;Atalante. Those bare facts are a landmark not just in French cinema, but in the larger history of artistic film-making, and of the absolute commitment of film-makers. Moreover, the poetic lyricism of L&apos;Atalante, far from dating, has been more appreciated over the years. L&apos;Atalante is 75 years old, yet its beauty and its harshness are still hauntingly alive. Three men work a barge (it is named L&apos;Atalante) on the waterways of northern France: Jean, the skipper is young and hopeful (Jean Dast\u00e9); le p\u00e8re Jules, a tattooed veteran of the world&apos;s oceans (Michel Simon) and a cabin boy. They stop at a small town. Jean meets a girl, Juliette (Dita Parlo), and they are married, while hardly knowing each other. So the barge moves on. It is not an easy transition for the married couple. In Paris they go ashore and the wife flirts with another man. There is a fight and she runs away, then the husband goes in search of her. Marriage is the film&apos;s subject and it is most moving in its cinematic grasp of a deeper bond than that permitted by the lovers&apos; temporary misalliance. The simplicity of the story resembles silent cinema, but these people talk. The film is enhanced by one of the cinema&apos;s first great musical scores (by Maurice Jaubert), and Vigo&apos;s inspired compositions and images in which the spirit of romanticism seems threatened by the very light that reveals it. But it&apos;s Boris Kaufman&apos;s cinematography that is most impressive \u2013 it serves as an example of the way realism can be infected by the characteristics of poetry and dream. Not the least legacy left by Vigo \u2013 to Truffaut and Godard, for instance \u2013 was the essential artistic value of black-and-white photography and its curious but easily forgotten establishment of a new way of seeing. DT 2. Mulholland Drive     Mulholland Dr Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive    Not many films have managed to have their cake and eat it quite like Mulholland Drive (technically it&apos;s &quot;Dr.&quot; not &quot;Drive&quot;, which is important). It is a movie about the worst of Hollywood and the best; the dark, brutal undercurrents and the sparkly celebrity froth, the dream and the reality. But it&apos;s the way it twists the two into some unfathomable Moebius strip that makes Mulholland Drive such a work of art. The film&apos;s greatest feat is to give us all the thrills of a classic Hollywood movie within an avant-garde framework \u2013 and to get away with it. First-time viewers unfamiliar with Lynch&apos;s ways will be taken in by the initial set-up: an amnesiac car-crash victim (Laura Harring) staggers into the house of an aspiring actress recently arrived in town (Naomi Watts), but three-quarters of the way through, having been drawn into a glossy noir fantasy, the rug is pulled out from under us completely. The same actors now appear to be completely different characters. The glamour has all evaporated. The relationships have all changed. Nothing&apos;s nice and sunny any more. Who&apos;s dreaming who? What goes where? What does it all mean? Piecing Mulholland Drive together is half the film&apos;s appeal \u2013 and there&apos;s still no guarantee it all makes sense. Lynch even issued a set of clues shortly after the release to guide people through the mystery \u2013 &quot;notice appearances of the red lampshade&quot; \u2013 which only made the story more cryptic. But even after we think we&apos;ve deciphered it, the film somehow loses none of its power. That sense of being taken in, only to realise we understood nothing, gives us some emotional connection to Watts&apos;s character. And even as he&apos;s tying our brains in knots, Lynch is showing us behind the curtain in Mulholland Drive \u2013 showing us this is all really just his dream. But the illusions remain intact even after they&apos;ve been dismantled. Lynch can still create charged scenes out of nothing but a few skilled actors and our own subconscious. He knows how to push our buttons, and he shows us that he knows how to push our buttons. And we love it. Steve Rose 1. Andrei Rublev     Andrei Rublev Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive    Viewers and critics always have their personal favourites, but some films achieve a masterpiece status that becomes unanimously agreed upon \u2013 something that&apos;s undoubtedly true of Andrei Rublev, even though it&apos;s a film that people often feel they don&apos;t, or won&apos;t, get. It is 205 minutes long (in its fullest version), in Russian, and in black and white. Few characters are clearly identified, little actually happens, and what does happen isn&apos;t necessarily in chronological order. Its subject is a 15th-century icon painter and national hero, yet we never see him paint, nor does he do anything heroic. In many of the film&apos;s episodes, he is not present at all, and in the latter stages, he takes a vow of silence. But in a sense, there is nothing to &quot;get&quot; about Andrei Rublev. It is not a film that needs to be processed or even understood, only experienced and wondered at. From the first scene, following the flight of a rudimentary hot air balloon, we&apos;re whisked away by silken camera moves and stark compositions to a time and place where we&apos;re no less confused, amazed or terrified than Rublev himself. For the next three hours, we&apos;re down in the muck and chaos of medieval Russia, carried along on the tide of history through gruesome Tartar raids, bizarre pagan rituals, famine, torture and physical hardship. We experience life on every scale, from raindrops falling on a river to armies ransacking a town, often within the same, unbroken shot. With Andrei Rublev, Tarkovsky was consciously crafting a language that owed nothing to literature, and it&apos;s a pity so few others followed him. In today&apos;s cinema, we&apos;re still served up linear, cause-and-effect biographies of artists as if, by doing so, we&apos;ll understand the person and be able to make sense of their art. Andrei Rublev operates according to a different understanding of time and history. It asks questions about the relationship between the artist, their society and their spiritual beliefs and doesn&apos;t seek to answer them. &quot;In cinema it is necessary not to explain, but to act upon the viewer&apos;s feelings, and the emotion which is awoken is what provokes thought,&quot; wrote Tarkovsky in 1962. Despite its apparent formlessness, Andrei Rublev is precisely structured and entirely aesthetically coherent. Acts of creation are mirrored by acts of destruction, there are themes of flight, of vision, of presence and absence; the more you look, the more you see. And then there are the horses, Tarkovsky&apos;s perennial favourite: horses rolling over, horses charging into battle, swimming in the river, falling down stairs, dragging men out of churches. At times the screen resembles a vast Brueghel painting come to life, or a medieval tapestry unrolling. We&apos;re always conscious of life spilling out beyond the frame, and never conscious of the fact that this was made in 60s USSR. In Tarkovsky&apos;s own turbulent time, the film lit all manner of controversy. Its Christian spiritualism offended the Soviet authorities; its depiction of Russia&apos;s savage history upset nationalists like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and its challenging form led to various cuts. After opening in Moscow in 1966, it was suppressed until the 1969 Cannes film festival, and didn&apos;t reach Britain till 1973. We don&apos;t necessarily know, or need to know, how Andrei Rublev works or what it&apos;s telling us, but by the end we&apos;re in no doubt it&apos;s succeeded. When in the final minutes, the film pulls off its most famous flourish: the screen bursts into colour and we&apos;re finally ready to see Rublev&apos;s paintings in extreme close-up \u2013 coming at the end of this epic journey, they can reduce a viewer to tears. As the camera pores over the details, the tiny jewels on the hem of a robe, the lines forming a pitiful expression on the face of an angel, the tarnished gilding of a halo, we feel like we understand everything that&apos;s gone into every brushstroke. We&apos;re reminded of what beauty is. It is as close to transcendence as cinema gets.

Washington Bureau chief Dan Roberts and Gary Younge bring you the best analysis of what it all portends for the humiliated American right. The aftermath of conflict still dominates the agenda in many parts of the world. In Egypt, support is blooming for army general and military coup leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, with some even suggesting he should run for president.

Sliced open to remove the skull, the flesh was boiled and mixed with hot gravel and sand, in the belief that the spirit of the victim would now serve the victor. Latterday head-shrinkers can now be saved all that mess and bother by heading to Selfridges, where similar kinds of black magic are being practised in the pop-up iMakr store: there you can get yourself shrunk down and 3D-printed as a six-inch figurine. First launched in Tokyo&apos;s Harajuku district last year, in the cradle of teenage novelty trends, the phenomenon of the 3D photo booth has quickly spread around the world: the service is now offered in Walmart and will soon be rolled out in Asda stores, so you can pick up a self-portrait with your groceries, for around \u00a340. In Selfridges, iMakr&apos;s portraits will set you back \u00a3159 and up. &quot;Ours is the latest technology,&quot; says Sylvain Preumont, founder of iMakr, as he ushers me into an octagonal Tardis, where 48 cameras await to capture my soul in 360 degrees. Standing in the brightly lit booth, hearing the surround-sound of SLR shutters snapping simultaneously, feels like being in the middle of a paparazzi scrum, but one that might end with you being beamed to another dimension. Thankfully, you just end up on the computer. The photos are then mapped and joined together using software that generates a &quot;point cloud&quot; of your body, a kind of three-dimensional map of dots, before creating a polygonal mesh, like a digital chicken-wire model. After a few hours of processing and manual fixing \u2013 creating voids beneath skirts and inside jackets, where the cameras can&apos;t see \u2013 the model is sent to a printer the size of an industrial chest freezer. In a similar process to ink-jet printing, a print head shuttles back and forth, spitting out microscopic dots of ink and binder, only instead of a sheet of paper, there is a bed of plaster dust. Each time the printer passes, another layer of powder is dragged across the bed, 0.1mm thick, until the model is built up \u2013 at a rate of 28mm per hour, taking around five hours to build a six-inch figurine. Just like those rubber-moulded models beloved of craft shops, the printed figures are essentially just made of plaster of Paris, water and ink, the finished objects then dunked in a bath of super-glue to fix the colour and make them a bit more durable. Seeing yourself being extracted from a bed of powder is a surreal sight, like watching an archaeological excavation, knowing that you are the embalmed mummy lying beneath the sand. Your little body comes out looking like a snow-encrusted yeti, before an airbrush and paintbrush are employed to dust away the excess powder and reveal the multicoloured mini-you in all its disturbing glory. Colours are still to be perfected \u2013 flesh tones verge on the corpsey, while my blondish locks came out black. But other details are remarkable, from the knot of my shoelaces to the moth-eaten hole in my jumper. Now all that remains is to work out what to do with this slightly sinister, staring miniature of myself, frozen in an eternal grin. It&apos;s freaking me out, standing watching me on my desk. I just hope there&apos;s some space on my granny&apos;s mantlepiece.

Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    The question of what to wear perplexed me. Should I test the printer and dress up like Leigh Bowery? Or turn up wearing nothing but a feather boa and a thong, as a friend suggested? I tried to invent an outfit that would both maintain my modesty and reveal my caesarean scar, as I was curious to see what the 3D printer would make of that red line of which I have grown so fond. Until it dawned on me that I was really just having my photograph taken, not auditioning for reality TV, so I went in my normal clothes. Which turned out to be the biggest mistake of all. &quot;Would you tie your hair back,&quot; said the Frenchman in charge of the studio, looking at my dark scruffy bob with a concerned face, &quot;as hair that looks like \u2013 like yours \u2026 well. It will come out looking like a helmet. And your outfit! This is going to be interesting.&quot; Given that his prior instructions had said the computer liked details and pattern and colour, rather than solid black, I\u00a0thought my candy-striped pink shirt would be perfect. And the trousers printed with little hieroglyphic people all over them. And the leopard-skin shoes and the wodge of red lipstick and gold chains. It turns out, when he had told me to wear patterns, something had got lost in translation. What he meant was texture, like denim jeans or a knitted sweater. Still, they managed to make my mini-me, and it&apos;s certainly a fun thing to have. It must be, as everybody I&apos;ve shown it to has burst out laughing. &quot;You look so GRUMPY!&quot; they say. (I was told to cross my arms!) &quot;You look kind of sallow and DIRTY,&quot; they add, as my face is yellow and the clothes are all sort of washed in grey. &quot;I can only tell it&apos;s you from the clothes, not the face,&quot; said a member of my own family. I love the physicality of it, though: her tummy curves in just the way that mine does, the slight bulge in the calves is exactly right \u2013 the shape of it is me. My plan now is to get my little girl to pose for one every year of her life, and line them up on the mantelpiece like Russian dolls, to see how the technology improves as she grows. Although I worry that in about five years&apos; time we&apos;ll have done away with these statues altogether, and my mantelpiece will be crowded with 3D holograms. Stephen Moss     'They say the camera does not lie, so the evidence is unendurably brutal' ... Stephen Moss. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    &quot;Why would anyone want to have a statue made of themselves?&quot; a friend asked me. &quot;I can understand why you would want to have one made&quot; \u2013 she is all too aware of my overweening self-regard \u2013 &quot;but why would anyone else want to do it?&quot; It was a fair question, and one I put to mini-you guru Sylvain Preumont when I pitched up for my statue-making session. &quot;Children will want to get one for their grandmother for Christmas,&quot; explained Sylvain, an effortlessly stylish and articulate French-born entrepreneur, &quot;and then there are the people with a little bit of an ego.&quot; I am definitely part of the second market. But there is a problem. I have turned up with a colleague from the Guardian \u2013 young, dynamic, smiley. He would easily pass for a member of One Direction. I feel ancient and dishevelled in his company. And there is a second problem. I have in part ignored Sylvain&apos;s instructions on what to wear. &quot;Avoid plain, uniform colours, especially black,&quot; he told me in an email. &quot;The software likes details and remarkable points.&quot; I have made a point of wearing a ridiculous pair of green trousers, but kept on a black jumper \u2013 supposedly slimming, you see. He makes me take it off. Now I look truly absurd: green trousers, red T-shirt, battered black hiking boots. I\u00a0also have a cold and suddenly realise this is going to be a\u00a0fiasco. It doesn&apos;t help that I am too tall for the booth, so the top of my head will be sliced off. Sylvain and his assistant, Pankaj Raut, say they will rectify this by adding in the top of my head. I suggest superimposing the head of George Clooney on the body of Brad Pitt, but this doesn&apos;t find favour. &quot;Perhaps we could give you a hat or a crown,&quot; says Sylvain, who is considering making a set of chess pieces from the 3D Guardianistas. I try three poses, all hopeless: hands\u00a0in pockets, arms folded, hand on\u00a0chin to suggest deep thought. My cold is getting worse. Why did I\u00a0agree to do this? A few minutes later, Pankaj\u00a0shows me the pictures. They say the camera does not lie, so the evidence is unendurably brutal. My\u00a0self-image is of a saturnine figure: tall,\u00a0athletic, dangerous. So who is this grey, shambling old bloke dressed like a dustman? I have seen enough. What on earth is the statue going to look like? Can I take out an injunction to stop the Guardian using it? I make my excuses and leave. &quot;Perhaps you should have done it naked,&quot; says my friend when I\u00a0relate my depressing experience. &quot;Like Michelangelo&apos;s David after he&apos;s eaten all the pies.&quot; Stuart Heritage     'I wonder who will actually pay to have their every flaw rendered for posterity?' ... 3D models of Lucy Mangan and Stuart Heritage. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    I&apos;ve been in this position once before, and it was just as awkward. I&apos;d returned from Seoul, where I&apos;d been teaching, to find that the mother of one\u00a0of my students had sent me a framed A3 pencil drawing of my face that she&apos;d copied from a yearbook. It was a perfectly good drawing but what was I supposed to do with it? I could keep it, but that&apos;d be an act of incredible vanity. In the end, I gave it to my mum. Which is just as vain. Perhaps more so. &quot;You know what you need, mum? A massive picture of my great big face hanging on your wall for\u00a0ever.&quot; She&apos;s still got it, to the eternal chagrin of my little brother, forever annoyed that a Korean woman didn&apos;t draw his face a decade ago. So this gives me a feeling of deja-vu. I&apos;ve got a little 3D-printed figurine of myself, and it is extraordinary. You can see tiny details, like the outline of my phone in my pocket. It&apos;s not perfect \u2013 my head seems proportionately very tiny, plus I don&apos;t appear to have any eyes at all \u2013 but it still looks a thousand times more like me than my Guardian byline photo. But what to do with it? Put it on my desk as part of a larger shrine to myself? Give it away to someone whose life I wrongly assume will be improved by a tiny me forever blindly gurning at them from the fireplace? It doesn&apos;t help that in both the drawing and the figurine I&apos;m pulling the exact same pretending-to-think-with-your-fingers-on-your-chin pose that photographers apparently delight in forcing me into. Both times I&apos;ve tried to subvert things by pulling a slightly funny face, and both times the end effect has been one of such colossal smugness that even I want to punch myself in the face. Reluctantly, I think I&apos;m going to keep it. If nothing else, in years to come it&apos;ll be a handy reminder of how terrible my dress sense was when I was 33. Perhaps it&apos;ll make a nice stand-in on a nativity scene \u2013 the Three Wise Men could temporarily become the Two Wise Men and That Eyeless Bell-End Doing the Annoying Thing With His\u00a0Face. Lucy Mangan Here I go, stepping into the future. You make sure you are standing on your mark \u2013 the lenses are essentially focused on a column of space in the middle of the booth, so you can&apos;t pose with your arms out to the side or your mini-me will emerge partially limbless \u2013 and the cameras click. This must be what Z-list celebrity feels like. For a &quot;civilian&quot;, as Brigadier General celebrity Elizabeth Hurley refers to normal people, it&apos;s an unsettling experience. I don&apos;t want a picture of me taken from any angle. I wonder who will actually take up the opportunity in a department store when they have to pay for the privilege of having their every flaw rendered in plastic for posterity? The aesthetically fortunate? The supremely self-confident? The tragically\u00a0deluded? I watch the computer screen as my &quot;point cloud&quot; is generated. Do you remember reading reading the bit in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when Mike Teavee gets sent, in millions of tiny pieces, through the air to emerge on the TV screen at the other end? The mental image that conjured up is what I&apos;m looking at\u00a0now. Gradually, a familiar figure takes shape. It&apos;s six inches high and has a slightly rough surface that, together with the fact that the colour of my green top seems to have bled into my face, neck and arms, makes me look as if I&apos;m covered in a light layer of mould. As symbolic representations of the ultimate truth of existence go, it&apos;s not bad, but I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s what I would be expecting had I got this done as a Christmas present for a loved one. Apart from that \u2013 well, the figure looks five months pregnant even though it isn&apos;t and slightly melted. The back view is horrendous. Which is to say, it is completely accurate, a triumph of modern technology and it went straight in the bin. \u2022 iMakr and My Mini Factory will be hosting a pop-up 3D printing store from 24 October at Selfridges, London W1"}, {"sentences": ["We&apos;ve got to pick up the garbage and keep the buses running.&quot; Imagine closing down London or Tokyo or New York?"], "tags": ["Cities", "Finance", "Politics", "Local government", "Public Leaders Network", "Local government", "Society Professionals"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-24T12:40:35Z", "title": "From US to China: the fall of nations and the rise of cities", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2013/oct/24/benjamin-barber-fall-of-nations", "article": "States are proving themselves incapable of action in the face of global crisis.

Cities are after all older than the states to which they belong (Rome far older than Italy, Damascus older than Syria, Boston older than the United States, Alexandria older than Egypt). More importantly, cities are avatars of our human identity. We are German or Japanese or English only in terms of invented monocultural identities; politically such identity amounts to little more than occasional voting or paying taxes, otherwise national politics understood as a spectator sport at best, something we watch on television. But we are Londoners or Parisians or Romans as a matter of our core being. Cities are where we are born, where we are educated and grow up, where we work, play, pray and create, where we are married, have children, get old and die. Cities are the essence of community and theatres of participation and innovation for all of us. No wonder they are so resilient, immunised against paralysis and failure. Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said during another of the periodic shut downs of government to which central government has treated its citizens, &quot;we could never get away with the stuff they do up in Washington. We&apos;ve got to pick up the garbage and keep the buses running.&quot; Imagine closing down London or Tokyo or New York? It couldn&apos;t happen and never has, even when cities were under bombardment or under siege. As Edward Glaeser has said, we are an urban species. Urbanisation has been our destiny. Just a few years ago, UN Habitat reported that for the first time in history more than half the population was living in cities. In the developed world, it is nearly 80%. We are living our metropolitan destiny. Cities are not only more pragmatic and grounded and participatory than nation states \u2013 &apos;participatory budgeting&apos; has become a favourite innovation of cities world-wide \u2013 they are also co-operating to address issues like climate change. Los Angeles has cleaned up and greened up its port, New York has improved its old housing stock with new insulation and white-painted roofs, while Bogot\u00e1 has developed rapid transit surface lines on segregated highway lanes, with significant reductions in emissions being achieved in all three cities. The United Nations has been of little help in resolving toxic global issues. United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), perhaps the most important global association no one has ever heard of, had facilitated practical steps to fashioning common urban solutions to global problems. That is why I have proposed a global parliament of mayors as a kind of network of urban networks, a keystone in the expanding arch of international associations embodying urban cooperation. The polis was once the birthplace of civilization and democracy: today, the cosmopolis beckons \u2013 not just an alternative to the incompetence and disorder of declining nation states, but an inviting option in creating global comity and justice on an interdependent planet that demands civic cooperation.

Yet this chilly north Asian capital is not Pyongyang, but Ulan Bator, Mongolia. When Mongolia&apos;s president, Tsakhia Elbegdorj, arrives in North Korea on Sunday \u2013 the first head of state to visit since Kim Jong-un took power \u2013 it will cement a longstanding relationship. Other countries have ties to North Korea, but Mongolia is highly unusual as a democracy enjoying warm relations with both Pyongyang&apos;s authoritarian regime and Seoul government in the South. &quot;The visit of our president will elevate relations to a new stage,&quot; Mongolia&apos;s foreign minister, Luvsanvandan Bold, told the Guardian. &quot;We want to make a more secure region \u2013 more safe and stable \u2013 with more economic development. Of course we have different systems but we shared a common history and there&apos;s a lot of sympathy between Mongolian and Korean people.&quot; Mongolia, then a Soviet satellite, was the second country to recognise North Korea and took orphans following the Korean war. Such charitable initiatives continued after Mongolia&apos;s democratisation; last month it delivered food aid, following a request from Pyongyang. Charles Armstrong, professor of Korean Studies at Columbia University and author of Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, said the two countries had a shared history that pre-dated the communist period and &quot;a common concern about domination by larger countries, namely Russia and China, and retaining political independence&quot;. On Mongolia&apos;s side, its ability to engage with North Korea is a potentially important asset in dealing with other, more powerful countries. &quot;Ulan Bator can be a useful platform to create understanding,&quot; Bold said. &quot;What Mongolia can provide is leverage to improve the situation in the region and pursue the initiative for parties to share dialogue \u2026 We see a lot of room to be more active.&quot; Last year Ulan Bator hosted talks between Tokyo and Pyongyang on Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea. &quot;Mongolia has done a good job of portraying itself as an honest broker on Korean peninsula issues. It is probably the only country that both North and South Korea can be said to trust,&quot; Armstrong said. &quot;To the extent that North Korea can be persuaded to do anything, Mongolia can play an important mediating role \u2026 Of course, North Korea is fiercely protective of its independence and will act in its own perceived interest, taking maximum advantage of the countries it deals with. But due to its non-threatening nature, Mongolia is in a better position to positively influence North Korea&apos;s behaviour than are China, Russia, South Korea, Japan or the US.&quot; Economic links are becoming as important; one key advantage for the landlocked country is North Korea&apos;s access to the sea. This year, Mongolia-listed HB Oil bought a 20% stake in a North Korean state-owned refinery. It plans to supply crude oil to the Sungri refinery, based in the special economic zone at Rason, exporting the products back to Mongolia. &quot;That has triggered a lot of interest,&quot; said Munkhdul Badral, founder of business research firm Cover Mongolia, who visited Pyongyang with a business delegation last month. &quot;Other potentially developing countries are already crowded with Chinese investment \u2026 It doesn&apos;t make much sense for Mongolian companies to be going into Myanmar [Burma].&quot; Mongolian firms can also benefit from offering others a route into North Korea. &quot;Essentially, tThis HB Oil opportunity has provided those foreign investors who specialise in managing funds in emerging and frontier markets with an opportunity to gain exposure to the DPRK [North Korea],&quot; said Joseph Naemi, non-executive director of HB Oil. If Pyongyang approves the processing deal, Sungri could reach full operational capacity by the first quarter of 2015, he said; the Mongolian oil firm also has exclusive rights to onshore exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons. Given North Korea&apos;s fractious relations with other states, such investments come at significant risk. &quot;Of course, sanctions can change. If they affect the oil and gas industry of the DPRK then yes, we are out of business,&quot; said Naemi, adding that if the sector was not used to risk, &quot;oil would have been at $1,000 a barrel 30 years ago&quot;. Others warn that foreign operations in North Korea face considerable domestic challenges and have little protection even if their countries have good diplomatic relations, as Chinese businesses have found. &quot;I can think of five or six cases - two are success stories,&quot; said Andrei Lankov, an expert on North Korea at Kookmin University in Seoul. Hiring North Korean workers, however, had proved &quot;a capitalist dream: people work hard, don&apos;t ask for much money and never ever unionise&quot;. There are around 1,700 such labourers in Mongolia and construction and manufacturing firms seek more; existing agreements would allow up to 5,000 to work there. Lankov noted that North Koreans paid &quot;very significant&quot; bribes to get jobs abroad because they could earn five or six times the average wage at home. Even after Pyongyang has taken a large chunk of their earnings, &quot;it&apos;s unbelievably profitable - and they save most of it and buy goods that will sell well in the North Korean markets, multiplying it&quot;. He and others argue that exposing North Koreans to the outside world has to be positive. &quot;We are still not a rich country, but we have gained a lot of experience in the past 20 years and more in shaping society and democratising. I think that&apos;s very important,&quot; said Bold. &quot;There are a lot of opportunities for North Korea \u2026 It is very important they can see how there could be a transformation process.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Image six If you thought your commute was bad, spare a thought for the Japanese workers who have to battle through rushhour on Tokyo&apos;s subways.", "And for dozens of insider tips on where to stay, eat, drink and what to see, take a look at our Tokyo City Guide."], "tags": ["Travel"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-25T11:56:33Z", "title": "Did you guess the cities from their transport?

The 130 or so horses that once roamed this sprawling farm in Fukushima prefecture have sustained three generations of Hosokawa&apos;s family. Some were sold for their meat \u2013 a local delicacy \u2013 but his animals were\u00a0better known for their appearances in commercials, period TV dramas and\u00a0films, and local festivals celebrating the region&apos;s samurai heritage. For decades, the 62-year-old horse breeder barely registered that his farm was just 25 miles north-west of the\u00a0Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. But the rural idyll was shattered on the afternoon of 11 March 2011, when the facility was hit by a towering tsunami that caused meltdowns in three of its\u00a0reactors. Even as people living in the path of the plant&apos;s radioactive plume were fleeing in their thousands, Iitate&apos;s 6,500 residents remained in their homes, convinced by official assurances that the village was safe. But two and half years after the accident, Iitate has become a nuclear ghost town. When Hosokawa looks out of his window these days, it is at empty, irradiated fields. Like several other farmers in Fukushima, Hosokawa ignored a government order to exterminate all of his horses and cows. &quot;I told them that if the animals had been suffering from an infectious disease, then I&apos;d have them destroyed,&quot; he said. &quot;But not for something like this. &quot;Just after the accident one of the horses gave birth. When I saw that foal get to its feet and start feeding from its mother, I knew there was no way I could\u00a0leave.&quot; The order to evacuate Iitate did not come until weeks after the meltdown, as local authorities debated the risk posed to the village, which had only recently been voted one of Japan&apos;s most picturesque places. Rather than acting as a shield, the mountain forests surrounding Iitate had trapped radioactive particles, turning the village\u00a0into a repository for dangerously high levels of contamination. Hosokawa, short and wiry with the weathered complexion of\u00a0a\u00a0man who spends most of his waking hours outside, sent his wife and their\u00a0daughter, Miwa, to safer parts of the prefecture. But, unable to bear the thought of leaving his animals to starve, he stayed put and joined the handful of residents who continue to live in the contaminated homes they were ordered to abandon. Although the evacuation order in parts of Iitate has been partially lifted to allow residents to visit during the day, radiation levels are still too high for a permanent return. Last week, visiting officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) urged the government to prepare displaced residents from Iitate and other contaminated towns and villages for the\u00a0grim news that cleaning up their former homes will take much longer than expected. The IAEA report was published soon after Japanese officials admitted that the 5tn yen (\u00a331.7bn) decontamination effort was woefully behind schedule. &quot;We will have to extend the cleanup process, by one year, two years or three years. We haven&apos;t decided for sure yet,&quot; said Shigeyoshi Sato, an environment ministry official in charge of decontamination. As Iitate&apos;s population plummeted in the spring of 2011, Hosokawa managed to find new homes for more than 80 of his horses. Then, in January this year, he noticed that several among the 30 that remained, mainly foals, had become unsteady on their feet. Within weeks, 16 had died in mysterious circumstances. Autopsies on four of the horses found no evidence of disease and tests revealed caesium levels at 200 becquerels per kilo \u2013 twice as high as the government-set safety limit for agricultural produce, but not high enough to immediately threaten their health. Hosokawa recently began legal action against the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], claiming 200m yen (\u00a31,269,534) compensation for the loss of the horses he was forced to sell or give away. The animals that died last winter are not included. Tepco agreed to pay him 10m yen for the loss of 39 horses he could prove were born on the farm, but refused to compensate him for the rest. The family refuses to back down. &quot;No matter how long it takes,&quot; said Miwa, &quot;we will keep on fighting.&quot; The 30 or so animals left behind are sustained by feed paid for with donations, many of them sent anonymously, from horse lovers around Japan. One woman turned up on their doorstep with a million yen in cash. Hosokawa repays their generosity with gifts of Fukushima&apos;s famed peaches. He estimates that he has lost about 100m yen in income since March 2011: the compensation the family received for the enforced evacuation has already been spent on uncontaminated feed from the US and Australia. &quot;There was nothing left for the family,&quot; he said. This summer, Miwa, 27, quit her job in Fukushima city to help her father rescue what little is left of their business. But with no end in sight to the evacuation order and a shortage of people willing to take on his remaining horses, Hosokawa reluctantly accepts that the farm&apos;s days may be numbered. &quot;We can&apos;t give these horses the same life as they had before the nuclear disaster, and no one wants to buy them,&quot; he said. &quot;We can&apos;t make a living from them, but unless we feed them they will die.&quot; As Fukushima&apos;s long and bitter winter draws in, the Hosokawas again fear the worst. &quot;We don&apos;t know why the foals died, only that they died in winter,&quot; Miwa said. &quot;I&apos;m worried that we&apos;ll find more dead horses this winter.&quot; Almost three years on, one of the few signs of human activity in Iitate is the crews of workers who have the near-impossible task of cleaning up the village&apos;s contaminated landscape. As quickly as they remove irradiated soil from around homes, schools and other public buildings, rain washes more radioactive particles down from the mountainous forests that cover much of Fukushima prefecture. Few are convinced by official assurances that their village will again be fit to live in. &quot;Our neighbours have all gone,&quot; Miwa said. &quot;They&apos;re scattered all over the place. I don&apos;t even know where most of them are. The only people who\u00a0say they&apos;ll come back are old. There&apos;s nothing here for people with young children.&quot; Fellow rebel farmers aside, Hosokawa&apos;s only companions are his daughter and the salespeople who frequently cold call with offers of &quot;anti-radiation&quot; pills. &quot;Life here has been very hard for everyone since the disaster,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of the people I know want to return, but because of the radiation they know that they never will. This place is awash with tears.

Tokyo Sexwale, a former Robben Island prisoner turned millionaire businessman, was stopped for questioning at John F Kennedy airport while attempting to enter the United States on a recent business trip. In the 1970s and 80s, the African National Congress (ANC) and various other groups were officially designated terrorist organisations by South Africa&apos;s ruling white minority. Other countries, including the US, followed suit. After the end of apartheid in 1994, certain names remained on the US terrorism watch list. Even Nelson Mandela was only removed in 2008. Ebrahim Rasool, the South Africa ambassador to the US, was forced to intervene with the US state department to secure Sexwale&apos;s release, according to a tweet by the South African public broadcaster SABC&apos;s US correspondent, Sherwin Bryce-Pease. &quot;Amb Rasool says appears no longer sufficient to alert authorities ahead of time to activate override when VIP visits USA,&quot; he added. Sexwale now intends to take legal action through the American courts, the national broadcaster SABC reported. &quot;He has instructed us to take the matter up with the authorities of the US so we will address the letter to the US embassy in South Africa,&quot; his lawyer Lesley Mkhabela was quoted as saying. Soweto-born Sexwale is one of the country&apos;s richest men and hosted the South African version of The Apprentice. In 1975 he went into self-imposed exile to the then Soviet Union, where he underwent military officer training. A year later, on his return to South Africa, he was arrested, charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government and sentenced to 18 years in prison. After his release in 1990 he pursued careers in both politics and business. He made millions as the owner of Mvelaphanda Holdings, a major player in the diamond industry, but was sacked as housing minister in a cabinet reshuffle earlier this year. He has served on various committees at Fifa, the governing body of world football. The ANC reacted angrily to Sexwale&apos;s treatment by US authorities. &quot;If indeed it is true, we think it is totally unacceptable,&quot; said Jackson Mthembu, the party&apos;s national spokesman. &quot;We are living in a democracy and Tokyo is not a terrorist, he is a member of parliament and responsible businessman. He is a leader of the ANC. &quot;We would have thought the Americans would have taken all credible struggle heroes off the list. This is very disappointing. It makes us very worried. If Tokyo can be arrested, who will not be? &quot;You could have other people fall foul of this terrible law of the United States of America. It&apos;s a wake-up call: we must take the matter up. We wouldn&apos;t to see another leader of the ANC going through something like this.&quot; Zakes Mda, a leading South Africa writer now based in the US, tweeted: &quot;What happened to Sexwale in the USA is outrageous. Our government should be lodging a complaint, not just Tokyo as the affected individual.&quot; Even after South Africa&apos;s first democratic election in 1994, ANC members applying for a visa to the US were flagged for questioning and needed a waiver to gain entry to the country. Sexwale was reportedly denied a visa in 2002. In 2008 Condoleezza Rice, the then US secretary of state, described it as &quot;embarrassing&quot; that Nobel peace laureate Mandela remained on the terrorist watch list and needed special permission to visit the country. Later that year Mandela was removed under a bill signed by president George Bush but it is unclear if this applied to other ANC leaders. A former US diplomat, who did not wish to be named, said on Sunday: &quot;During the apartheid era the ANC and other organisations ended up being listed as terrorist organisations and it was difficult to get them removed because of various senatorial pressures. I was not aware there were still people whose names are specifically listed on such an index.&quot; The ex-diplomat added: &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s damaging relations but it is more than a bit embarrassing.&quot; Clayson Monyela, spokesman for South Africa&apos;s international relations department, said it had been told that a resolution is needed in the US Congress to remove all the names. &quot;It is a matter that American government is aware of and is dealing with.&quot; Jack Hillmeyer, a spokesman for the US embassy in Pretoria, said: &quot;We are aware of the media story going around.

But instead of one storm, there are two \u2013 plus a brewing hurricane \u2013 between them and home. On the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Sandy, this is a fitting metaphor. Sandy was the storm that brewed amid the existing, devastating storms of our society \u2013 the swirling winds of climate change, wealth inequality, and our general failure to invest in infrastructure: better housing, more transit, sea walls and levees. Far too many New Yorkers were hurt by the storm. And the storm did not discriminate. Wall Street bankers and street vendors were both hit hard. But its lasting impact was not so undiscriminating: the decisions we&apos;ve made as a society mean that some who were struggling before the storm were effectively wiped out by it. In New York City in the 1950s, we put our elderly and disabled, our hardworking poor and their children, in high-rise brick boxes of public housing on vacant, out-of-the-way waterfront land. It was a good thing to house poor New Yorkers. Perhaps, we can be forgiven for placing that housing where no one wanted to be and where no one would complain about poor neighbors.  At the time, no one knew about climate change and that, by the 1990s, sea levels would be rising twice as fast as they had been over the previous 80-year period. Ultimately, though, this meant that public housing residents were not just underwater economically, but facing a greater environmental threat of flooding and displacement long before the Sandy storm surge. New York is home to the nation&apos;s oldest and largest public housing authority. It houses 400,000 people in 2,600 buildings on 334 such sites around the city. Prior to Sandy, public housing faced an annual deficit of $40m in operating costs and $6.6bn in capital needs, such as repairs to roofs, elevators, heating and grounds. And that was before Sandy flooded basements, corroded electrical boxes and damaged boilers in building after building. Wealth inequality has also long plagued the New York City landscape. New York is home to more billionaires than any other city in the world. We&apos;re second in the world in millionaires, just behind Tokyo. Meanwhile, according to the Economic Policy Institute, an average family of four in New York needs a $93,000 a year income to live modestly. Yet, median household income in 2012 was about $49,500. This means that even before Sandy eroded New York&apos;s economy, millions of New Yorkers were already struggling to keep their heads above water. In other words, for millions of poor people, Hurricane Sandy wasn&apos;t a new storm, but more an exacerbation of existing tumult. While middle- and upper-class New Yorkers in places like the Rockaways and Red Hook certainly struggled in the aftermath of Sandy too, the storm struck poor communities harder. As the water receded, it revealed the profound inequalities that had been here all along \u2013 but which were now even worse.  This is why, for instance, many public housing residents didn&apos;t evacuate \u2013 because they lacked the resources or government support to do so and were afraid they would lose their housing. The city has lost 230,000 rent regulated units (pdf) over the past three decades; and as of March 2013, over 300,000 families were on the waiting list for public housing and housing vouchers. While public housing is no picnic, it&apos;s a lifeline for those who need it. In the poor and marginalized communities of New York \u2013 mostly people of color \u2013 conditions were bad before Superstorm Sandy \u2013 and chaos ensued after. Sandy exposed millions of other New Yorkers to the sense of economic and environmental insecurity that clouds the lives of the poor every single day. It&apos;s hard to find a silver lining here, but here&apos;s my take. We can use the storm to wash away whatever ignorance and complacency we might have had about the daily, long-term and systemic struggles of poor people \u2013 not just in New York, but everywhere. And we can have hope that if we pay attention to these inequities now, we can help prevent such devastation when the next disaster hits. If we can ensure that the most vulnerable Americans, wherever they are, have economic security, quality affordable housing and the community support systems and infrastructure they need, then we can all better weather the next storm, whenever and wherever it hits."}, {"sentences": ["I had to appoint lawyers in Washington, London and Tokyo and started running out of cash because I spent over \u00a31m on lawyers in 12 weeks.&quot; He has since received \u00a310m from the company."], "tags": ["Olympus", "Technology sector", "Business", "Corporate governance", "Competition and Markets Authority"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-28T18:26:23Z", "title": "Auditors must rotate, urges Olympus whistleblower Michael Woodford", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/28/auditors-rotate-olympus-whistleblower-michael-woodford", "article": "Michael Woodford, the former Olympus president turned whistleblower, has attacked the decision of the Competition Commission not to seek automatic rotation of company auditors. Woodford, who sounded the alarm in 2011 over a \u00a31.1bn fraud at the Japanese camera and optical instruments company, says a mandatory change is needed to prevent similar scandals at other companies. In his book Exposure: Inside the Olympus Scandal, Woodford revealed how the close relationship between Olympus and its audit firm KPMG over many years had reduced the likelihood of fraud coming come to light. &quot;You should rotate every 10 years,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;You should let people know there&apos;s going to be another partner coming in and it would lead to more conservatism. So I believe in compulsory rotation of auditors.&quot; Woodford, a leading witness in a Serious Fraud Office prosecution of Olympus and its UK subsidiary, Gyrus, which started last month, dismisses fears that large companies will not be able to move their audit work between the Big Four of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, EY and KPMG. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with the opinion that there will be problems finding another capable auditor. Some companies are deliberately changing their auditors, to demonstrate good governance. &quot;I disagree with the decision because four is better than one, and if you allow an auditing relationship to go year after year, common sense tells you that cannot be ideal. You get a degree of comfort by working with the same people, and ultimately with both parties endorsing a decision which other people may take a view on. There&apos;s a huge amount of lobbying against it by the auditing practices, saying it would cost whatever.&quot; The commission has said there should be a compulsory tender of the audit every 10 years, but no obligation for the auditor to change, despite a call from leading shareholders for a mandatory rotation. Instead, the commission called for more audit work to be overseen by the Financial Reporting Council or the government, more nuanced audit reports and an expanded role for audit committees. Woodford, who has maintained a vigorous media profile since he was fired by Olympus soon after he spoke out, is also calling for better protection for whistleblowers. Having joined the Commission on Whistleblowing set up by charity Public Concern at Work, he says: &quot;You may need legislation or a code of practice, requiring corporations to show they have whistleblowing lines. It would mean you could set up a whistleblowing line where it reports externally to a law firm or the best person internally, such as the chairman of the audit committee, or the chairman.&quot; An effective whistleblowing line should be separated from the executive of an organisation, says Woodford. What shaped his experience was the determination of the Olympus directors at first to deny the fraud existed before firing him and launching an aggressive public campaign to discredit him. &quot;You should filter out minor complaints, but if you have a serious issue where you think criminality may have been perpetrated, or an issue that is wholly against the public interest \u2026 and you feel uncomfortable raising it with your line report, then you should do this.&quot; Woodford says that the greatest hurdle for whistleblowers is often the fear of being victimised. &quot;If you&apos;re making allegations and it&apos;s criminal, then at some point you cannot remain anonymous, and this is why companies are uncomfortable, because it creates the situation of what do I do with this person?&quot; Woodford recognises that he was in a better position than many whistleblowers because he was in the most senior position at Olympus. &quot;It also helped that the amounts were large, so it was newsworthy and I could get the focus of the world&apos;s media on this issue,&quot; he adds. But at the beginning, few in the media would take him seriously, especially in Japan. &quot;It&apos;s easy in retrospect, but in those months the story seemed so extraordinary and journalists were very careful and very cautious and the Japanese media was acting like the press office of Olympus. I had to appoint lawyers in Washington, London and Tokyo and started running out of cash because I spent over \u00a31m on lawyers in 12 weeks.&quot; He has since received \u00a310m from the company. Woodford dismisses the idea that many will not speak out against wrongdoing because of a &quot;climate of fear&quot;. He describes it as &quot;a nice tidy expression&quot;, but adds: &quot;If you&apos;re working in a corporation, do you feel less fearful than you would have 20 years ago? Because of employment tribunals and because of the legislative framework \u2026 I don&apos;t think it&apos;s as bad compared to when I started working.&quot; Woodford is equally forthright on the issue of wilful ignorance at the top of organisations. &quot;If you&apos;re a senior officer of an institution in the public or private sector a different set of rules apply: you&apos;ve got fiduciary duties to manage in a way that&apos;s protective of stakeholders&apos; interests,&quot; he says. &quot;I think moving from paying big fines to [making] officers liable to custodial sentences would be a good thing. There is this feeling \u2026 people [are] turning a blind eye or not exploring.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["One manager facilitated a culture in Rabobank&apos;s offices in New York, London, Utrecht, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore where attempted manipulation appeared to be accepted or even endorsed by the bank, regulators said."], "tags": ["Libor", "Banking", "Business", "Financial Conduct Authority", "Regulators", "Banking reform", "Financial sector", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-29T15:08:07Z", "title": "Rabobank boss quits over \u00a3662m Libor rigging fine", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/29/rabobank-piet-moerland-quits-libor-rigging", "article": "The Libor rigging scandal was reignited on Tuesday when the boss of Rabobank quit after the Dutch bank was fined \u20ac774m (\u00a3662m) for manipulating the benchmark interest rate. The fine, the second largest for Libor rigging after the \u00a3940m paid by Swiss bank UBS, was the fifth levied by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic in their attempt to crackdown on the manipulation of the key interest rate. It comes as a new investigation begins into similar allegations of manipulation in the \u00a33tn-a-day currency markets. UBS and Deutsche Bank became the latest to admit they were co-operating with investigations into currency benchmarks, as the US justice department acknowledged for the first time it was involved. As Piet Moerland, the Rabobank chairman, announced he would step aside earlier than planned, regulators said some of the bank&apos;s traders had colluded with rivals at other financial firms to move rates to make a profit in one of the worst such cases they had investigated. About 30 individuals were involved, according to the mutually-owned bank \u2013 which was set up in 1898 to fund Dutch farmers and until now had escaped the financial crisis virtually unscathed and without needing the taxpayer bailouts handed to rivals. There were 500 instances of attempted Libor manipulation, directly or indirectly involving at least nine managers. One manager facilitated a culture in Rabobank&apos;s offices in New York, London, Utrecht, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore where attempted manipulation appeared to be accepted or even endorsed by the bank, regulators said. Rabobank has also entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the US department of justice. The regulators unleashed the customary cache of emails containing colourful language used by traders. One manager said to a trader that he was &quot;fast turning into [that trader&apos;s] bitch!!!!&quot;. Another was offered &quot;546 beers&quot; for changing rates. &quot;Don&apos;t worry mate \u2013 there&apos;s bigger crooks in the market than us guys!&quot; one submitter wrote. Moerland, who had been with the bank \u2013 which prides itself on its integrity and its roots in the agricultural business \u2013 for 30 years, said he was shocked by the practices uncovered. The bank did not lose its AAA rating until 2011. &quot;I sincerely regret that a number of Rabobank employees acted in an inappropriate manner. This should never have taken place at Rabobank,&quot; said Moerland. &quot;The conduct of these individuals, and the language of some of the individuals&apos; communications, has shocked me. Rabobank fully understands the sense of indignation that this will cause both within our organisation and more broadly.&quot; The US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said Rabobank employees had been making submissions to Libor that they saw at the time as &quot;ridiculous&quot;, &quot;obseenly [sic] high&quot; and &quot;silly low&quot;. Libor \u2013 set in a number of currencies by special &quot;submitters&quot; at so-called panel banks \u2013 is supposed to be the price that banks would charge each other to borrow in the markets and is used to price about \u00a3300tn of contracts around the world. But Rabobank sat its submitters next to its traders and in some cases traders assumed the role of submitter. One of its US dollar traders was known as the &quot;Ambassador&quot; or &quot;Ambass&quot; while one of its submitters was referred to as &quot;madame cadburry&quot;, according to documents released by the regulators. The Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 which is levying \u00a3105m of the total fine \u2013 said the bank had no regard to the integrity of the market. Tracey McDermott, the FCA&apos;s director of enforcement and financial crime, said: &quot;Rabobank&apos;s misconduct is among the most serious we have identified on Libor. Traders and submitters treated Libor submissions as a potential way to make money, with no regard for the integrity of the market. This is unacceptable.&quot; The fine is largely related to yen Libor and, to a lesser extent, dollars and sterling. None of the individuals were identified by the FCA although some were referred to by job titles by the US regulators. The FCA, along with other regulators, has fined Swiss bank UBS, RBS and Icap, as well as Barclays, the first bank to be fined, in June 2012. In June, Moerland said he would retire from the bank next year. He is replaced by Rinus Minderhoud, a member of the supervisory board since 2002. Moerland acknowledged that Rabobank had not appreciated the risk involved in setting Libor and its euro equivalent, Euribor. &quot;We have taken severe disciplinary measures against employees directly involved in or otherwise responsible for the unacceptable conduct,&quot; he added. Some had already left and five been fired with \u20ac4.2m of bonuses being withheld.

Johnson is launching hundreds of battery-powered electric bikes (e-bikes) in the hilliest parts of the capital as part of a pilot scheme. If we had a list of the top 10 things that would boost cycling rates in London the plan to fund electric bikes would be number 11. This is not an argument against electric bikes per se but it is an argument against marketing hype and an argument for getting down to the basics of what gets people on bikes. London currently has about 2% of trips every day made by bike, Paris has 2.5%, Berlin 15% and Tokyo 16.5%. The impressive performance of Berlin and Tokyo has a great deal to do with 20 years of effort to get things right and is nothing to do with bolting an electric motor onto a bike. Bike use goes up as a result of efforts to make streets safe and connect origins and destinations and this involves urban design, measures to reduce the speed and volume of traffic and measures to make public transport bike-friendly. London urgently needs a change of direction in its cycling rhetoric and spending. This would not rule out e-bikes at some point in the future but it would get the basic pre-conditions for cycling sorted out first so that the large number of potential cyclists (those ready to get on a bike but not yet nudged enough) to make the shift from thinking about it into doing it. The change in direction would learn from European and Japanese best practice examples and do the following things as quickly as possible: \u2022 Combine cycling with public transport. In Tokyo there are more than two million bike parking spaces at metro and suburban rail stations. Cyclists can easily cover the distance from home to the station and then take the train. London has 1669 bike parking spaces per 100,000 population and Tokyo has 6398. \u2022 Give cyclists state of the art, segregated, traffic free cycle routes that follow major &quot;desire&quot; lines eg trips to key employment, education, shopping, and health centres. \u2022 Extend the congestion charge area to include the whole of London (all 32 boroughs) to produce a reduction in car trips overall and add to the safety, security and attractiveness of cycling because there is less traffic and at the same time a financial incentive to use the bike. \u2022 Set up a completely new system of speed control and enforcement in London based on community speedwatch initiatives to empower local people to do the speed checks and relieve the police of this duty. Citizens detect the anti-social speeding behaviour (more than 20mph) and the police deal with the offenders. Speed reduction and enforcement will reassure those groups currently under-represented in cycling trips in London, mainly women and older people. \u2022 Ensure that every HGV/lorry operating in London was retro-fitted with state of the art equipment for making sure that cyclists are constantly in view, especially at junctions, and drivers were aware of a duty to make sure that cyclists are not endangered by turning manoeuvres. \u2022 Apply similar travel plan measures to all schools. There will be a presumption that the vast majority of children will not be taken to school by car and small scale street re-design will be facilitated to make cycling a safe, secure alternative Sorting out cycling requires a very firm foundation that replicates Berlin&apos;s integration of public transport with cycling, Tokyo&apos;s metropolitan-wide disincentives to use the car and Copenhagen&apos;s highly attractive, safe segregated cycle routes. London has largely avoided the solid foundation stage of cycle support and has opted for icing on the cake with no cake.

Should I mention the sound of rain on the stairs, and the telephone whose urgent bell interrupts us as we make our way through the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, where Philippe Parreno&apos;s Anywhere, Anywhere Out of the World is now open. Parreno is the first artist ever to fill the whole building, from the steps outside where one of his marquees hangs over the entrance, through the large open spaces beyond the ticketing desk, down stairwells and into the concrete under-crofts, the multi-level lower floors and basement auditoriums of this enormous place. This is an exhibition of sounds as much as sights, darkness as well as light. Often, big surveys of an artist&apos;s work can become one damn thing after another, and they exhaust you. Parreno, who earlier this year created the mise en sc\u00e8ne for the Barbican&apos;s exhibition The Bride and the Bachelors: Duchamp with Cage, Cunningham, Rauschenberg and Johns, never differentiates between his works and their setting. He never forgets his audience, and how his spectators move from work to work. He knows we bring his works to life, asking in return to be surprised, enchanted and taken on a journey. All his works are a collaboration: with the setting, with us, and with the many other artists he has worked with, both living and dead.     'He never forgets his audience.' Photograph: Aurelien Mole    Early on in his planning for this show, Parreno thought of engaging the services of a clairvoyant to help him organise his works, but dropped the idea, and has used instead Igor Stravinsky&apos;s Petroushka, performed by the virtuoso pianist Mikhail Rudy and replayed on four Disklavier pianos dotted through the exhibition, to orchestrate the show. Rudy is an apparition, the keys of the pianos moving to his invisible hands. The exhibition unfolds to Stravinsky&apos;s rhythms. Lights throughout the building flicker to the music. Films start up and stop again. There are entr&apos;actes. Spaces and musical intervals, pauses and action follow the music as we go from work to work, space to space. Petroushka was a doll that came to life, and is but one more ghost in Parreno&apos;s machine. Even the building itself becomes a gigantic automaton. Everything becomes part of a vast mechanical apparatus, churning through Parreno&apos;s preoccupations, the past and the future. We go from spectacle to bafflement, moments of melancholy to visceral excitement. Down in the basement I find myself in a black space flaring and chattering with sizzling neons and light bulbs that pop like champagne corks. The space seems to have no end. Parreno&apos;s 16 theatrical marquees, like the ones you find above cinema entrances, hang from the ceilings and jut from the walls. Each one is different. The bulbs and neons dance on and off, play out visual melodies, hum, drone and chatter. It is like being in a room filled with spaceships. People stand mesmerised. Kids run under the lights, trying to play catch-up, as first one bank of lights then another charges up then dies, leaving us in the dark. Intermittently, the lights follow the surges of Petroushka. I faze in and out of the rhythm, following and forgetting, running ahead and falling behind. People stay here a long time. Parreno has used the exhibition as a way of seeing his own work, and himself, differently. He uses his art as elements in a narrative that dwells on presence and absence. Our own entrances and exits become part of this. Maybe that is why this disjunctive ensemble of video, objects, spaces, ghosts and apparitions, old works and new, is so moving, and why it is not so much an immersive exhibition as one that engulfs you. It is a heart-stopping and difficult experience and it is overwhelming. More than once I saw people cry, and turn away to be with their own thoughts.     Parreno's version of Marilyn Monroe's suite at the Waldorf Astoria. Photograph: Aurelien Mole    Why the tears? My own moment came when watching Parreno&apos;s 2012 film Marilyn. Monroe&apos;s voice, recreated by computer, takes us on a tour of the hotel suite where she lived in the late 1950s. What Marilyn sees, the camera sees. We watch through her eyes. Sunlight falls into the room. Rain beats at the window. Sometimes the camera swerves along with Marilyn&apos;s frantic glances, her growing sense of hysteria and entrapment. Her eyes snag on the corners of things, the light glancing cruelly on polished surfaces. The studied normality of the room becomes a prison. The cushions, too perfectly arranged at either end of a sofa, look like a dumb rebuke. Her solitude seems terrible. The telephone rings but goes unanswered. Towards the end, the camera retreats from the window, gliding between the occasional tables, the slipper chairs, the lilies in the vase. The camera&apos;s tracks appear, then some bulky electronic equipment, as we back off, revealing the room as a movie set with no one in it. As the film ends, lights go up on the other side of the screen where the film has been projected, to reveal a huge snowdrift beyond. The temperature plummets. The sound of the rain we heard in the film is unabated. This moment is somehow intensely moving. We are in a set too, just as Marilyn was. What is this subterranean drift of real snow in the Palais de Tokyo&apos;s basement? Ice in the soul? Death? Are we in Marilyn&apos;s mind or is she in ours? I begin to notice other piles of snow around the auditorium, like the shovelled-up slush you see on winter New York sidewalks. When you buy a ticket for the show you get given a DVD of Marilyn. It can only be played once, because the dvd erases itself as you watch it, leaving you with a memory of something seen that can&apos;t be recaptured. The DVD is called Precognition. Back upstairs, on a huge screen near the show&apos;s entrance area, early films by Parreno play. From 30 yards away, they seem projected in thin air. A cuttlefish writhes, giving off a strange fluorescence. Then a baby&apos;s pink face fills the screen, then some flowers. These early films by Parreno dwarf us as we approach, and as we get close they disintegrate into a grille of little bulbs hanging in space, rows of winking LED lights. There are so many details to catch on. Even the end wall of one space, covered in black material, vibrates with a sonorous hum. And what of the bookcase, for which Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster acted as librarian, that pivots to allow access to a secret room containing a recreation of a John Cage and Merce Cunningham show, in which the pair substitute one another&apos;s work over the show&apos;s duration, swapping Cage&apos;s spidery, trembling drawings with Cunningham&apos;s lovely drawings of owls, cormorants and herons. This inclusion is like a love story.     Annlee, created by Parreno and Pierre Huyghe. Photograph: Aurelien Mole    Much later, in another room, the Japanese Manga character Annlee, who Parreno and fellow French artist Pierre Huyghe bought the rights to in 1999, tells her story. A decommissioned virtual being, she became a kind of common property shared between Parreno, Huyghe and a number of other artists. When the short CGI film ends, a young girl walks into the auditorium. A real-life Annlee. Her choreographed movements and voice have the strange, limpid grace of a computer-generated doll. This live element is a work by Tino Sehgal. The girl pauses and asks &quot;What is the difference between a sign and melancholia?&quot; Annlee is a sign, a trace. Her melancholy is the result of an inability to either fully enter the world or leave it. This is our fate too in Parreno&apos;s netherworld. Does real life end in the gallery, the cinema or the theatre? How much are we in the world when we lose ourselves to our thoughts in music, a movie or a book?     Zidane, a 21st Century Portrait. Photograph: Aurelien Mole    Late on a Friday night I go back. This is my third visit to Parreno&apos;s show in two days. I want to know what the vibe is like close to midnight (the show is open till midnight six days a week). People drift around. I meet a couple cuddling among the Marquees, a man alone watching Marilyn. I make my way to Parreno and Douglas Gordon&apos;s film Zidane, a 21st Century Portrait, probably the work Parreno is best known for. Unlike the single-channel commercial movie, here it is projected, for the first time, on a floating maze of 17 screens. Each screen shows the projected footage from one of the 17 cameras that followed French footballer Zinedine Zidane through a Real Madrid-Villareal game in 2005. As he chases the ball, so we must follow him through the labyrinth of screens, seeing him from this angle and that, losing ourselves in his multiple presences. As we move about, we are being choreographed too, just as we have been throughout the Palais de Tokyo. The only thing to do is retrace our steps and find ourselves again. \u2022 Follow Adrian Searle on Twitter"}, {"sentences": ["The LDP panel, which will present its report to the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, next week, reportedly favours the creation of a special unit to focus on decommissioning while the rest of the company is left to generate electricity for 29m homes and businesses in Tokyo and surrounding areas."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Japan", "World news", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-31T09:43:46Z", "title": "Fukushima Daiichi operator should not handle shutdown, says governing party", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/31/japan-fukushima-daiichi-decommissioning-tepco", "article": "The operator of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant should be stripped of responsibility for decommissioning the wrecked facility, according to Japan&apos;s governing party, as the utility prepares for the most dangerous phase yet in the cleanup operation. Among the options outlined in a proposal by the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) is a new decommissioning unit that is financially independent of Tepco. Another option is the formation of a government-affiliated administrative agency. The proposal comes amid mounting criticism of Tepco&apos;s handling of problems at the plant, including leaks of radioactive water. The firm is expected to begin removing 1,300 spent fuel assemblies from the remains of the reactor No 4 building towards the middle of next month. Some nuclear experts have warned that even a slight mishap involving the fuel rods could result in huge releases of radiation into the air and sea. Shunichi Tanaka, the head of Japan&apos;s nuclear regulation authority, warned that the work would be more hazardous than usual because of debris that fell into the reactors storage pool during hydrogen explosions in March 2011. &quot;It&apos;s a totally different operation than removing normal fuel rods from a spent fuel pool,&quot; Tanaka said. &quot;They need to be handled extremely carefully and closely monitored. You should never rush or force them out, or they may break. I&apos;m much more worried about this than I am about contaminated water.&quot; Toyoshi Fuketa, a senior member of the authority, said the fuel rod removal would mark a &quot;major step towards decommissioning&quot;. This week Tepco released a video explaining its plan to remove the rods, which were being stored in a pool 100ft above ground when the plant was struck by the 11 March 2011 tsunami. Three other reactors suffered core meltdowns in the disaster, forcing the evacuation of 160,000 people in the area. A remote-controlled crane installed inside the reinforced reactor building will perform the delicate task of removing the spent fuel, Tepco said in its video. One by one, the fuel assemblies will be lifted out of storage and placed in dry casks before being moved to a common cooling pool in an adjacent building. &quot;This transfer from one form of underwater storage to another will not lead to any radiation exposure to workers or anyone else,&quot; the company said. Tepco hopes to complete the job by the end of next year before clearing out other fuel pools. Work to remove molten fuel from deep inside three other damaged reactors is not expected to start until 2020. The LDP panel, which will present its report to the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, next week, reportedly favours the creation of a special unit to focus on decommissioning while the rest of the company is left to generate electricity for 29m homes and businesses in Tokyo and surrounding areas. Tepco is hoping to receive the go-ahead to restart its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, the biggest atomic facility in the world, in Niigata prefecture early next year. The firm believes that if all seven of the plant&apos;s reactors were restarted it could save $1bn (\u00a3623m) a month on fuel costs. Niigata&apos;s governor, Hirohiko Izumida, has not ruled out a restart, but says the firm must first address its culture of &quot;institutionalised lying&quot;, citing the firm&apos;s belated admission in July that the plant was leaking radioactive water into the Pacific ocean. &quot;If they don&apos;t do what needs to be done, if they keep skimping on costs and manipulating information, they can never be trusted,&quot;Izumida said. The company faces a multibillion-dollar bill for compensating evacuees. Decommissioning the plant is expected to take around 30 years and cost at least \u00a5100bn (\u00a3634m). The utility, which has lost $27bn since March 2011, was effectively nationalised last year after the government injected \u00a51tn of public funds. On Thursday, Japan&apos;s deputy prime minister and minister of finance, Taro Aso, hinted that the government would step in to fund the decontamination of towns and villages in the evacuation zone around the plant. Tepco is currently required to repay the government for decontamination costs but has reportedly asked for exemption from the payments, which one study has put at as much as \u00a55tn. Aso said: &quot;I wonder if we can put all the blame on Tepco, given that nuclear policy was framed by the national government.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The coastal hunts, which include the slaughter of dolphins in Taiji, are no longer sustainable and should be phased out over the next 10 years, the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency said in a report launched in Tokyo on Thursday."], "tags": ["Conservation", "Marine life", "Whales", "Whaling", "Sustainable development", "Japan", "Wildlife", "Animals", "Asia Pacific", "Environment", "World news", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-31T11:27:18Z", "title": "Japan's coastal hunts for small cetaceans not sustainable, says report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/31/japan-hunts-small-cetaceans-whale-dolphin-porpoise-not-sustainable", "article": "Some species of whale, dolphin and porpoise could be hunted into extinction unless Japan stops pursuing them in its coastal waters, a new report has warned. Japan catches almost 17,000 smaller cetaceans off its coast every year \u2013 a tradition that its whalers say stretches back centuries. The coastal hunts, which include the slaughter of dolphins in Taiji, are no longer sustainable and should be phased out over the next 10 years, the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency said in a report launched in Tokyo on Thursday. &quot;The hunts in Japan&apos;s coastal waters specifically target nine small cetacean species, eight of them with government-set catch limits which are clearly unsustainable,&quot; said EIA campaigner and report co-author Sarah Baulch. &quot;For 2013, the catch limits allow the slaughter of 16,655 small cetaceans, but our analysis of available scientific data raises very serious concerns about the sustainability of these hunts.&quot; The EIA estimates that more than 1 million whales, dolphins and porpoises have been killed in Japanese waters in the past 70 years. The coastal hunt is the biggest of its kind in the world, yet &quot;there is little transparency regarding the methods used to set catch limits and widespread concern that consumers are not informed that the resulting products are toxic with mercury and other contaminants,&quot; the conservation group said. In most cases, Japan&apos;s catch limits are based on data collected more than 20 years ago and some species have already been hunted beyond the point where their numbers can recover, the report said. The current quota is well below the 30,000 killed in Japan every year until limits were introduced in 1993. The coastal hunt is separate from Japan&apos;s annual slaughter of bigger whale species in the Antarctic. The report blames growing demand for dolphins and other small cetaceans from aquariums and sea parks around the world, particularly in China: live dolphins, for example, can fetch between $8,400 and $98,000. Catch limits for the Dall&apos;s porpoise species are 4.7-4.8 times higher than the safe threshold, the report said; catches of the striped dolphin, meanwhile, have dropped from over 1,800 in the 1980s to about 100. &quot;Despite strong indications of population declines, there appears to be little formal monitoring by the government of Japan,&quot; Baulch said. The EIA also cited the risk to Japanese consumers of eating meat and blubber with methyl mercury levels many times higher than the safe limit. &quot;Japan&apos;s stubborn reluctance to relinquish this archaic industry is not only driving threatened marine species towards extinction, but is endangering the health of its people,&quot; said Sakae Hemmi of the Japan-based group Elsa Nature Conservancy."}, {"sentences": ["The first cyclist I spotted in Tokyo was an impeccably dressed grandmother, pootling along on the pavement, as is overwhelmingly allowed."], "tags": ["Japan", "Cycling", "Fitness", "Life and style", "Cycling holidays", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-31T11:36:57Z", "title": "What can the UK learn from Japan's cycling culture? | James Walsh", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2013/oct/31/uk-learn-japan-cycling-culture", "article": "The Japanese, as a nation of 120 million people packed into the floodplains of a largely mountainous country, are a practical people. If there&apos;s a minor inconvenience that can be solved by technology, then they&apos;ve usually solved it. So there are vending machines on mountain tops, and hotel mirrors that leave a perfect oblong clear in front of the sink so you can shave, even if the rest of the mirror is steamed up. This spirit extends to cycling. If everyone who lived in the Japanese mega-cities drove, there would be permanent gridlock of Doctor Who proportions. So, a practical attitude has developed. The first cyclist I spotted in Tokyo was an impeccably dressed grandmother, pootling along on the pavement, as is overwhelmingly allowed. She weaved in and out of the pedestrian traffic, the designated on-pavement cycle path being merely an opening point for negotiation. Road crossings have designated cycle lanes, alongside those for pedestrians. She was riding one of Japan&apos;s mamachari, or granny bikes. A solid, practical, generally single-speed city bike, they&apos;re easy to ride, but unlikely to win you any races to the lights. Often found with front basket, a rear rack and frequently adorned with some form of child seating, mamachari are ubiquitous across Japan. Everybody rides them, not just glamorous old ladies \u2013 parents, students, salarymen, teens on their way to school. Some even have special attachments for umbrellas. My favourite love letter to this kind of bike can be found in the anime Tatami Galaxy, when, after the hero&apos;s expensive road bike has been stolen by Kyoto&apos;s over-zealous bike police, he attempts a road race on his heavy old steed, much to the derision of his university cycle club. It takes him days. This distinction between a mamachari-owning urban bimbler and &quot;proper cyclist&quot; doesn&apos;t exist to the same extent in the UK. In Japan, most treat their bicycle as an extension of their legs, a sensible and logical way of getting from A to B. Most are used for local journeys: for getting to the shops, or to school, or to work. Few ride on the road, unless the footfall (or the signage) deems it absolutely necessary. Bikes are parked everywhere: outside homes, shops, and business. Occasionally, as in the case of Kyoto (those bike police are real, and your bike could end up in the pound), you&apos;ll find them in official bike parks and stands, but mostly they&apos;re left wherever the owners please. To a Londoner, all this takes a bit of getting used to. Mamachari have built-in locks on their back wheels, but they all seem eminently nick-able. But inexpensive and legion, bikes aren&apos;t under the same threat of pilfering as they are here. Cycling on shared pavements, to someone used to battling aggressive city traffic, is similarly counterintuitive. But you quickly adapt. The infrastructure is there, and, crucially, there&apos;s a decent hierarchy: drivers are respectful of cyclists and pedestrians, and despite the occasional irritation, it&apos;s light years ahead of what two and non-wheeled types have to tolerate in Britain. Could any of this work in the UK? Here, those not willing to mix it with motor traffic have to contend with a hotchpotch of shared-use paths strewn, as this GuardianWitness assignment indicates, with trees, lamp posts, and &quot;cyclists dismount&quot; signs, and the wrath of people unhappy with their riding on the pavement. In Japan, the minority of cyclists use the roads, as they are legally able to do. But most prefer the safety of the sidewalks, and the culture and the infrastructure has developed to accommodate them."}, {"sentences": ["This came on the heels of the International Olympic Committee selecting Tokyo to host the 2020 Games, citing the mega-city&apos;s desire to inspire young people&apos;s hope for the future, its already existing infrastructure, and its history as a sporty city."], "tags": ["Olympic Games", "US news", "World news", "International Olympic Committee", "Sport", "Business", "Economics", "US sports", "Boston", "Washington DC", "Winter Olympics", "Olympic Games 2012"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-31T13:45:00Z", "title": "Bidder beware: to host the Olympics comes at considerable cost | Jules Boykoff", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/31/host-olympic-games-cost", "article": "Boosters of Boston&apos;s bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics were buoyed by the Massachusetts state legislature&apos;s recent move to create an Olympic exploratory committee. This came on the heels of the International Olympic Committee selecting Tokyo to host the 2020 Games, citing the mega-city&apos;s desire to inspire young people&apos;s hope for the future, its already existing infrastructure, and its history as a sporty city. These are precisely the selling-points supporters of Boston&apos;s bid have floated. In expressing interest to host the 2024 Olympics, Boston joined other cities with the five-ring fever \u2013 places like Washington, DC, Los Angeles, Dallas, Philadelphia, and San Diego. Earlier this year, the United States Olympic Committee contacted 35 US cities to gauge their enthusiasm. Next year, the USOC will winnow the slate of interested cities to a handful, and in early 2015, it will select a single candidate. Before plunging ahead, some clear-minded thinking is in order. We shouldn&apos;t be hoodwinked by the celebratory hoopla \u2013 hosting the Olympics is a serious affair. It turns out the Olympic games are awash in fiscal myths. Games boosters always roll out tantalizing promises. One common claim is that the Olympics are a windfall for the host city, an economic turbo-charge that benefits all. Although developers and the local construction sector tend to benefit as a city builds the necessary infrastructure, in reality, academic economists simply haven&apos;t found (pdf) a positive relationship between hosting the Games and economic growth. Economist Jeffrey Owen even argues (pdf), &quot;it is unlikely that anyone ever will.&quot; Zealous assurances of an Olympics-induced economic windfall are more wishful than factual, more boondoggle than boon. Games advocates also vow the Olympics will be relatively inexpensive. Bob Sweeney, who is spearheading the DC 2024 Olympic initiative, estimates total Olympic costs at $4-6bn. That chimes with what London 2012 bid promoters reckoned. In the end, though, the 2012 games cost more than three times that amount. The 2014 Sochi Winter Games were originally slated to cost $10.3bn, but the price tag has skyrocketed to $51bn, making them the most expensive Olympic Games ever. Underestimating Olympic costs has almost become an Olympic sport in itself. One recent study found that every single Olympic Games between 1960 and 2012 experienced cost overruns. The authors discovered that unplanned Olympic costs &quot;have historically been significantly larger than for other types of mega-projects&quot;. Aspiring host cities should be aware of this very real possibility. In the post 9/11 era, escalating security costs have contributed to Olympic overspending. To be sure, Washington, DC already boasts security forces experienced in high-profile events, and Boston, too, is no stranger to terrorism. But the Olympic Games inevitably require additional security measures. In London, this meant attaching surface-to-air missile batteries to local apartment buildings and the deployment of more than 18,000 military personnel. None of this is cheap. Would a US host city experience a spike in tourism? Likely not. The European Tour Operators Association actually found the opposite to be true (pdf). Since the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, host city tourism has suffered repeated hits thanks to the sky-high prices and rumors of overcrowding that the Games bring \u2013 tourists who would otherwise visit the Olympic host city stay away. The group found:  [There is] little evidence of any benefit to tourism of hosting an Olympic games, and considerable evidence of damage.  I was in London during the 2012 Olympics and saw this firsthand. I witnessed local businesses that were promised a &quot;five-ring boom&quot; experience a soul-crushing bust. But my conservations do not just represent mere anecdote: the trade association UKinbound found that nearly 90% of tourism-oriented business \u2013 like hotels, shops, and tour operators \u2013 experienced losses during the Olympics compared to the same period in the previous year. As people in cities across the US consider whether to support a local Olympic bid, they would do well to separate the shimmering assurances of Games boosters from the recent experiences of Olympic host cities. If it&apos;s a feel-good festival of sports that you want, then go for it. You&apos;ll get some magnificent athletic events that may lift your happiness quotient and spur goodwill. But as we ponder the possible, we ought to be aware of the Games&apos; hidden economic downside. Recent Olympic history has shown that local backing is key to a bid&apos;s success, so public opinion will matter to both the USOC and, if it gets to that point, the IOC. Residents of aspiring host cities should have a critical voice in the process. Whether to host the Olympics is a decision that deserves serious public deliberation."}, {"sentences": ["Confusing and delighting Tokyo indie audiences in pretty much equal measure this year, Sayuu are a decidedly offbeat duo with a distinctive line in deadpan post-punk eccentrica."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-31T15:23:56Z", "title": "Sayuu \u2013 Yellow Hate: New music from Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/31/sayuu-yellow-hate-new-music-from-japan", "article": "Confusing and delighting Tokyo indie audiences in pretty much equal measure this year, Sayuu are a decidedly offbeat duo with a distinctive line in deadpan post-punk eccentrica.

He earned laughter with a decent impression of Nelson Mandela&apos;s famously inimitable voice. Noting the presence of British actor Naomie Harris, the cynosure of all cameras, the recently separated Sexwale quipped: &quot;I came alone, you know.&quot; The African National Congress (ANC) stalwart was in Johannesburg to introduce the director, producer and cast of Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, the long-awaited $35m film adaptation of Mandela&apos;s autobiography that premieres in South Africa on Sunday. Mandela&apos;s daughter, Zindzi, told how she found the movie &quot;therapeutic&quot;. However, the man who plays Mandela, star of The Wire and Luther, Idris Elba, was missing due to a severe asthma attack for which he had had to be hospitalised. Harris, who is the new Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond series, plays Mandela&apos;s wife Winnie, and got the seal of approval from &quot;the mother of the nation&quot;, according to producer Anant Singh. &quot;Mama Winnie was very moved by it,&quot; he said. &quot;She turned to me as the movie ended and said, &apos;It&apos;s beautiful, don&apos;t change anything, I love it. Naomie is perfect as me. Naomie is African; she&apos;s got Africa in her&apos;.&quot; Harris admitted that the prospect of capturing Winnie&apos;s accent was &quot;terrifying&quot;. Asked for her impressions of post-apartheid South Africa, she commented: &quot;Obviously, in 20 years the country has come an extraordinarily long way, but change is a slow thing. I don&apos;t think that Mandela, when he went into prison, ever expected that it would take 27 years before he came out and a further four years after coming out of prison before he actually became president and was able to properly dismantle apartheid. &quot;Change is slow and it takes generations, and I think there&apos;s been huge progress, but there&apos;s still a lot more progress to go, and I think most South Africans would agree with that.&quot; The glossy biopic comes about six months before Mandela&apos;s beloved ANC faces the toughest election in its history, in effect, a referendum on its 20 years in government and whether it has fulfilled or squandered the legacy of South Africa&apos;s first black president. During that period Africa&apos;s liberation movements have lost their shine and, in some cases, fought dirty to retain power. It took two decades for Robert Mugabe to face a serious challenge in neighbouring Zimbabwe.Some analysts predict that, while the party is still assured of victory, its parliamentary majority could dip below 60% for the first time. That could deepen internal factionalism before the 2019 election, where defeat may not be unthinkable. But the ANC still holds the ultimate ace: Mandela. A man mythologised in his own lifetime, his command on South Africans&apos; affections is impossible to compete with. Will the release of Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom burnish the legend still further and win votes for the ANC? &quot;I hope so,&quot; chuckled Paul Mashatile, South Africa&apos;s arts and culture minister, predicting a 70% share. &quot;It&apos;s a good story. I think it&apos;s really continuing to give people hope that it&apos;s a great organisation that came from great leaders. But sometimes voters tend to vote on the basis of the challenges that they have today.&quot; Mashatile is overseeing next April&apos;s celebrations of the 20th anniversary of multiracial democracy, and recently announced a nine-metre statue of Mandela for the Union Buildings in Pretoria. But he denied that the ANC is trading on nostalgia. &quot;We don&apos;t necessarily want to use that for elections. Nelson Mandela is bigger than everybody now. He&apos;s a treasure, he&apos;s the gift of the whole nation, and I think in this period in his life we want all South Africans to claim him.&quot; The ANC knows it must play its ace carefully or face accusations of exploitation. It was criticised for parading a frail Mandela at its pre-election rally in 2009 and for organising a photo-opportunity at the ailing statesman&apos;s home this year. With Mandela now 95 and in a critical condition, the great unknown about the election is the impact of the emotional earthquake that his death would cause. Some believe the sentiment and pageantry around his loss would rally sympathy for the party to which he is so devoted that he once joked he would seek out a branch in heaven. Justice Malala, a political commentator and columnist, said: &quot;Without being distasteful, if Nelson Mandela was to die now, it would be a massive boost for the ANC.&quot; But it is also possible that reflections on Mandela&apos;s singular achievements could prompt unflattering comparisons with the current president, Jacob Zuma. His first term in office has been plagued by disasters, such as the police massacre of 34 striking mineworkers in Marikana, and scandals including the projected spending of 270m rand (\u00a316.63m) on upgrades to his rural home. He also failed to fulfil an ambitious job creation programme, to curb street protests and to revive the economy. &quot;He&apos;s a huge liability,&quot; Malala said. &quot;Zuma is the reason the ANC will suffer a big reversal of fortune and a reduced majority, probably to below 60%. The middle class will continue to revolt against Zuma. The big issue is whether they will go out and vote.&quot; The ANC faces an unprecedented challenge from both right and leftof the political spectrum. The Democratic Alliance is striving to cloak itself in the colours of the liberation struggle and even claiming to be Nelson Mandela&apos;s true heir, while the Agang SA is led by the formidable Mamphela Ramphele, an anti-apartheid activist and the ex-girlfriend of Steve Biko, with whom she founded the black consciousness movement. But perhaps the most intriguing new threat is the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by Julius Malema, a former president of the ANC youth wing who campaigned for Zuma at the last election but has become his nemesis. EFF, which launched in Marikana among a sea of red berets, aims to seize the socialist revolutionary ground that the ANC occupied during the struggle, accusing the ruling party of being co-opted by white capitalist interests and failing to redress profound inequalities. Some say Malema gives a good cause a bad name. His gift for populistrhetoric that fires up the discontented masses has even earned comparisons with Hitler. But Malala said: &quot;Malema is scratching at the scab of the new South Africa. Whatever he might say and whatever a joke he might be, when you see the demographics there&apos;s something there.&quot; Among Malema&apos;s most prominent allies is Andile Mngxitama, an admirer of Biko and now the EFF&apos;s international relations &quot;commissar&quot;, who said: &quot;The ANC has reached the limit of what it can imagine and what it can do. Twenty years of devastation are the most eloquent argument against the ANC. You can&apos;t spin your way out of 20 years. &quot;The ANC is no longer the party of liberation that is going to do something for you. They will try to use history, but we will point to that koppie in Marikana where a democratic government shot dead its own people.&quot; Citing a 1994 speech in which Mandela said, &quot;If the ANC does to you what the government of the National party did to you, you must do to the ANC what you did to the government of the National party,&quot; Mngxitama added: &quot;That language finds more resonance today. Nelson Mandela at his best does not speak for the ANC of today.&quot; As for the potential impact of Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, Mngxitama said dryly:: &quot;In South Africa we are not persuaded by films. This is not America. It could backfire: it&apos;s becoming very difficult to associate the image of Nelson Mandela with the contemporary ANC.&quot; This will be the first election in which South Africans born after 1994 \u2013 the &quot;born-free generation&quot; \u2013 will be eligible to vote. They have no memory of apartheid, nor Mandela&apos;s imprisonment, and therefore lack the emotional ties of their parents. But it remains to be seen how many will register to vote or whether apathy will prevail. Nor should the ANC&apos;s well-oiled electoral machine be underestimated. Threatened by a breakaway party, Cope, at the last election in 2009,the ANC healed its internal divisions with iron discipline and fell just short of a two-thirds majority. It still has all the advantages of incumbency, including money. While Zuma is much mocked by tweeting urbanites, his routine of singing, dancing and speechmaking in his first language, Zulu, appeals to the crowds in rural areas. And the ANC does have a positive story to tell about three million houses supplied, more citizens connected to electricity, a growing black middle class and a reduction in absolute poverty. It has shown compassion in providing 16 million social grants to the poor and earned international acclaim for turning around the fight against HIV/Aids. Nevertheless, perception is key and more and more South Africans view the ANC&apos;s glass as half-empty: a jaded organisation tarnished by corruption, delivering too little too slowly and in inexorable decline. And just as Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom risks turning the collective history of the anti-apartheid struggle into a one man show,so the ANC&apos;s current travails run deeper than the idiosyncrasies of its present leader. Moeletsi Mbeki,a political economist and brother of Mandela&apos;s successor, Thabo Mbeki, said: &quot;We don&apos;t vote for Jacob Zuma. We vote for the party. This election is really about the credibility of what the party has done over 20 years. South Africa is in a stagnating situation.

The young Germans in the post\u2011hippy uniform of jeans and straggly facial hair and, swaying, yelping, slurrily intoning a sort of festive yodel, with a note of rising mockery, momentarily engulf him. He reappears, is furious, almost in tears of loathing. &quot;Disgusting,&quot; he spits. &quot;This for me is just animal.&quot; The man is Ian Nairn, the writer and broadcaster on places and buildings, and he is appearing in a BBC film in which he traces the route of the Orient Express, which was then a not-yet-re-glamorised trail across a divided continent. He stops at places of interest \u2013 hence the visit to a bierfest in Munich \u2013 to deliver the passionate, pithy, eloquent observations that made him famous. His name might now (although he would hate this) be called a brand \u2013 he wrote books called Nairn&apos;s London and Nairn&apos;s Paris, as if he owned the cities, and his TV series were called Nairn at Large and Nairn&apos;s Travels. &quot;Enter Nairn&quot; announced this newspaper in 1964, when the writer joined the staff of the Observer. Nairn crystallised revolt against the misapplication of modernist architecture to postwar reconstruction, against the unthinking erasure of town and country by road building, bureaucratic procedure and patronising planning. In his urgings against sprawl, and for what would later be called &quot;compact cities&quot;, he anticipates the theories of both Richard Rogers and Prince Charles. He tried hard, for a while, to find good in new architecture and he continued to admire some, such as Sir Denys Lasdun&apos;s National Theatre. But his patience ran out, and in 1966 his exasperation commanded the front of the Observer&apos;s Review. &quot;Stop the architects now&quot; was the headline; &quot;The outstanding and appalling fact about modern architecture,&quot; he announced, &quot;is that it is not good enough.&quot; The public, he said, &quot;see the architect as a wet kind of nuisance, fingering his bow-tie on the edge of real life&quot;. In another Observer article, &quot;Twenty threatened towns&quot;, Nairn listed &quot;national assets now in danger&quot; from planners and developers. One was Gravesend, Kent, dear to Nairn, the &quot;most individual town on the Thames estuary&quot;, but also &quot;a poor, shattered place&quot;, &quot;being transformed from a tough, close-knit pattern of cottages to a drab architect&apos;s exercise in slabs of flats&quot;. To go there now is to see what he loved, what he feared, and Nairn&apos;s continued importance. It is still tough, descending to the broad, industrial, concrete-edged river, not the sort of place people have in mind when they call its county the garden of England. It still has close-knit quarters, and charming uphill-winding streets that, if they were in Hampstead, would be the homes of bankers. It has the Doric town hall that Nairn admired, and its old cast-iron pier, but it also has senseless holes punched out of it, to make car parks, a civic centre and the slabs that he lamented. Some of this damage is from Nairn&apos;s time. There is also evidence of the reaction that he helped inspire, towards preservation of historic fabric and human-scaled streets, but not in a way he would have liked \u2013 metalwork announces you are entering a &quot;heritage quarter&quot;, a pedestrian zone that tacitly gives licence to destruction outside its boundary. Then there is more recent development, which seems to have un-learned most of what he fought for. Apartment blocks miserably fail to make the most of their grand waterside location, as does tokenistic landscaping. Other flats, using terracotta panels faintly inspired by the work of Renzo Piano, rise next to the slabs that Nairn hated, multiplying their discordance. Then, at its edge, the town dissolves into traffic engineering and retail sheds, an update on the formless landscape that, in the 1950s, he called\u00a0&quot;subtopia&quot;. Nairn defended the particularities of place, people&apos;s right to inhabit their localities as they wish, and the beauty and character in the spaces around us. He raged against the destructive collusion of corporations and government. Gravesend, as do most British towns, shows that these battles still need to be fought. In the shadow of Blair&apos;s third way, in which we are still living, such collusions are more powerful than ever, which is why interest in Nairn is now resurgent.            Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch video His name faded after his death in 1983, and to the disgust of his fans an otherwise knowledgeable writer and teacher on architecture quite recently referred to him as &quot;someone called Ian Nairn&quot;, but now he is being well and truly rediscovered. Young writers such as Owen Hatherley are inspired by the furious honesty of Nairn&apos;s outsider voice. Another, older writer, Jonathan Meades, has never let the flame die. This month, the resurgence is marked by a book, Ian Nairn: Words in Place, by Gillian Darley and David McKie, with contributions by Hatherley, Meades and other believers, and a BBC4 programme about him is on the way. Born in Bedford in 1930 and raised in Frimley, Surrey, Nairn, the driver of a Morris Minor, was not the type to have LOVE and HATE tattooed on his knuckles, but these words define the two peaks or poles of his output. HATE was Outrage, a special edition of the Architectural Review, republished as a book, produced by Nairn when he was 24. LOVE was Nairn&apos;s London, 11 years later, a document of devotion, &quot;a record of what has moved me,&quot; as he put it, &quot;between Uxbridge and Dagenham&quot;. Outrage was &quot;less of a warning than prophecy of doom&quot;, an assault on &quot;the annihilation of the site, the steamrollering of all individuality of place to one uniform and mediocre pattern&quot;. According to Outrage, &quot;the end of Southampton will look like the beginning of Carlisle; the parts in between will look like the end of Carlisle or the beginning of Southampton&quot;. To prove his point, Nairn drove from one to the other, and took photographs of their similar-looking peripheries \u2013 identical concrete lamp-posts, rows of semi-detacheds, wires, telegraph poles, the odd tree. He coined subtopia to describe his enemy, which Outrage defines as &quot;making an ideal of suburbia&quot;. Outrage had impact. It was debated in parliament and the Duke of Edinburgh talked of subtopia in a speech. It prompted the creation of an organisation, the Civic Trust, to counter the threats it described. It propelled Nairn to fame. It was an early, memorable document of the reaction, which would last a generation and more, to the mid-century beliefs that development, road building and technology would automatically be beneficent, and that we could trust wise men in authority to direct them to our greatest good.     Outrage, the book that made Nairn's name in the 1950s.    If Outrage showed what not to do, and was concerned with the rural as much as the urban, Nairn&apos;s London described what made a city great. It gave flesh to Nairn&apos;s statement that &quot;there is only one real rule, that each place has its own nature, its genius loci&quot;. It was avowedly personal, in contrast with the dry fact-gathering of Nikolaus Pevsner&apos;s Buildings of England series of guidebooks. It had &quot;no barriers. I just don&apos;t believe in the difference between high and low brow, between aristocracy and working class, between fine art and fine engineering&quot;. All that mattered was &quot;the golden thread of true quality&quot;. So it combines the best-known monuments, such as Westminster Abbey, with places such as the premises of Mallinson&apos;s timber merchants and a gas board building, both in the East End, 27 different pubs, the Agapemonite church in Clapton and Hall Place, a Tudor-plus-Stuart stately home in Bexley, Kent. These places have above all individuality, which in his own person Nairn brought to the level of performance art. He delivered a TV broadcast from the pulpit of condemned church in Bolton; in interviewing a secretary he asked only one question, which was whether she knew where Middlesbrough was; he would answer the phone by saying &quot;woof, woof&quot;, or &quot;Chartres cathedral, south aisle, this is Death speaking&quot;. The power of Nairn, in London, Outrage and in all his best work, was in his observation, his courage and his language. He had the gift of the potent image, making buildings and places animate or human. A church in Stratford is &quot;one of the hungriest-looking in London&quot;; one in Leyton is &quot;as diverse as the characters in a saloon bar&quot;. Or physical, sensual, in motion: a modern and a classical building in St\u00a0James&apos;s are &quot;as inseparable as Guinness and oysters&quot;; in Highgate cemetery, &quot;with a shock like a blood-curdling scream, the Egyptian entrance rises up&quot;; a church in the docks is &quot;a hard punch to the guts&quot;. With the multi-style architecture of London Zoo, &quot;everything is happening at once, like a film projector gone crazy&quot;. He evokes appetite and disgust, and after comparing a polychromatic Victorian church somewhat queasily to an orgasm, he detumesces thus: &quot;Why boggle, when there are a hundred ways of reaching God?&quot; Of the strangely mannered Milner Square in Islington he writes: &quot;Not to be missed, in the sense that you should try Fernet-Branca at least once\u2026 as near to expressing evil as a design can be.&quot; One ancient site has &quot;a quality of picturesqueness rather like one of those deep-frozen American dinners&quot;. Places, for Nairn, were things you could swallow and could swallow you. He is moral, too. The synagogue at Bevis Marks has &quot;the force of undisturbed goodness&quot;, Barking railway station is &quot;one of the noblest new buildings in London&quot; and St\u00a0Cyprian&apos;s, near Baker Street, is &quot;a sunburst of white and gold and all-embracing love\u2026 the moment you go in through the door you know that everything is absolutely right&quot;. Westminster&apos;s Roman Catholic cathedral, on the other hand, &quot;shows the difference between actually being, and trying very\u2013hard-to-be&quot;, the work of an architect &quot;who never found himself&quot;. Reputation counted for nothing. In Nairn&apos;s London, he puts square brackets around buildings which he feels he has to mention, but doesn&apos;t like, such as William Morris&apos;s Red House, and the Royal Festival Hall. Elsewhere, he would call the revered church of St\u00a0Peter Mancroft in Norwich &quot;neurotic and inconsistent&quot;, but &quot;it is old, big, and has a lot of carving on it, and so the fatal fog of antiquarian complacency gains a bit more ground in the city which of all places needs less of it&quot;. Norwich, he felt, was &quot;on a steady, complacent slide down to vacuity&quot;, its best building after its cathedral being Jarrold&apos;s paper factory. Nairn&apos;s instincts, to me at least, are almost always right, both in picking out underrated gems such as Deptford&apos;s Edwardian town hall and Eric Lyons&apos;s 1960s Span housing, and in assailing the over-praised Sir Edwin Lutyens as &quot;unbearably giggly\u2026 you want to give his precocious bottom a good clout&quot;.     Ian Nairn pictured in the 1950s holding a copy of the Architectural Review.    His common themes are a passion for passion, for character, distinctiveness, contrast and surprise, for the unselfconscious and the visceral, and a matching loathing for the statistical, the phoney, the cold, the tepid, the routine, the indifferent and for what he called the &quot;prettification&quot; of places, some of which happened in misguided response to his rages in Outrage. His favourite images included one of Ostia, near Rome, where hay was grown and mown alongside ancient ruins, and one \u2013 as an example of absurd official pedantry \u2013 of a British road sign that commanded NO OVERTAKING FOR 223 YARDS EXCEPT OF PEDAL CYCLES IN SINGLE FILE. He loved life as it is lived or, more precisely, mineral evidence of such life, for he was diffident, and once admitted that he found new places &quot;I am sorry to say&quot; more interesting and subtle than meeting new human beings. When he toured America, in conscious emulation of On the Road, he appears to have minimised the chance human encounters that are the core of Kerouac&apos;s book. At his core seems to have been a love of a version of Britain defended in the war and let down by the peace. Nairn was too young to fight, but he joined the RAF in the early 50s, flew jets over the landscapes he would champion in Outrage and, until he lost his pilot&apos;s licence in 1966, after failing a medical, he continued to use flying as an aid to research and photography. His other territories of investigation were pubs, which he frequently describes, and beer. Nairn&apos;s London ends with a postscript on the state of the city&apos;s brewing, &quot;a telling microcosm&quot; where &quot;individual tastes have been swallowed up by mass-produced flavours&quot;. This helps explain his detestation in Munich, which was not because he hated drinking \u2013 he loved it more than life itself \u2013 but because his religion was being profaned and the fact that he was in Germany would have added an edge to his feelings. &quot;Always,&quot; said Nairn of architecture, the point was &quot;not the what but the how&quot; and here the how was all wrong. Beer was a gathering deluge on Nairn&apos;s life, a blot ever expanding like a figure of mortality. It appears early in playful, affectionate asides on drink and pubs, which he later described as places &quot;to shake off loneliness without being in anyone&apos;s company&quot;. In due course, colleagues would note that he was &quot;wonderful&quot; to work with &quot;before lunch&quot;. One of his BBC directors found that he knew on which side of the Thames the pubs opened earlier and wanted shooting schedules adapted accordingly. In 1970 his second wife Judy, proposing a collaboration with Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, wrote that &quot;beer money (literally!) would be splendid&quot;. At the end of the decade Nairn&apos;s universe was almost all beer, pints and pints of it, consumed at the patriotically named St George&apos;s Tavern in Pimlico. It cost him his last job at the Sunday Times and, just short of his 53rd birthday, his life. There were limits and contradictions to Nairn&apos;s method. His approach was personal and visual, to capture emotional reactions in front of buildings, and record them with literate beauty. He didn&apos;t like to talk to architects and planners, out of shyness and to preserve his outsider&apos;s integrity, which meant he didn&apos;t study much the causes and consequences of design. The price of his visual approach was that it provoked visual responses, such as the prettification that he hated. At a personal level, the price was that it gave him nowhere for his writing to go, except repetition of his responses in new locations (the Sunday Times would fly him to Tokyo, Hawaii and Sydney) or silence. Nairn, in his raincoat and Morris Minor, was an unlikely Icarus. He flew, he burned, he drowned. As alcoholism is now recognised as a disease, we should perhaps simply say that that is what killed him, but it might also be possible to guess that, in asking architecture to fill an emotional void, he was seeking the impossible. Also, that, in wanting officialdom to feel as intensely about places as he did, he was doomed to disappointment. But anyone who cares even slightly about their surroundings should be intensely grateful for his attempt."}, {"sentences": ["New York, Berlin, Tokyo and Paris all have greater financial autonomy than London."], "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Local government", "Service delivery", "Cities", "Finance"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-04T08:01:00Z", "title": "A new English revolution is needed to shake up Whitehall-centric attitudes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2013/nov/04/transfer-government-powers-london-whitehall", "article": "London is a challenge for public policy. It has a vast population and a dominant economy. Its output is 21% of the UK&apos;s total and, with its surrounding areas of the South East and the East (the &apos;Greater South East&apos;), has a super-regional economy amounting to 44% of the country&apos;s GDP. It appears to consume a large share of national investment. On the other hand, it produces disproportionate amounts of tax revenue. For the rest of the UK, this produces a &apos;can&apos;t live with, can&apos;t live without&apos; problem. Since 2000, city-wide government has been restored to London (Mrs Thatcher abolished the former Greater London Council), with an American-style executive mayor to provide yet another reason to see the capital as different. Ken Livingstone and now Boris Johnson have further intensified London&apos;s visibility within the UK political firmament. But despite their huge electoral mandate, the powers and tax freedoms available to the mayor of London are limited. New York, Berlin, Tokyo and Paris all have greater financial autonomy than London. The London Finance Commission, which reported in May this year, argued for a modest but substantive devolution of taxation powers to the capital. Indeed, the report argued that similar freedoms should be made available for the city regions elsewhere in England, notably Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham. The Scottish independence referendum and the UK government&apos;s decision to devolve income tax and other revenues to Edinburgh show, once again, that devolution is a &quot;process not an event&quot;. Scotland and Wales have also had commissions to consider the transfer of tax powers away from the Treasury. Where Scotland goes, Wales will doubtless soon follow. But why should London not be given similar powers? Indeed, why not devolve additional service responsibilities from Whitehall to London government? No one could argue that London does not have a political class capable of managing the kind of devolved powers now enjoyed by the Scottish and Welsh governments. Much the same could be said of Greater Manchester and other city regions within England. The current configuration of central government departments makes it virtually impossible to achieve rationality at the local level: health, education, work &amp; pensions and the home office all defend their budgets and powers. Public money to be spent on children will come partly from the health department, partly from the Department for Education and partly from several other parts of Whitehall. London government, both at the mayoral and borough level, would be perfectly capable of assuming greater responsibility for the NHS, schools and welfare in the capital. Jeremy Hunt would surely be privately pleased to pass the responsibility for handing the unpopular decisions about hospital and GP services to Boris Johnson. The boroughs are already responsible for public health. City Hall has already taken tentative steps towards influence over schools&apos; education. The future of welfare is uncertain: if universal credit is not a success, London government (along with other sub-national government) will have to cope with the consequences. England is a highly centralised country. London, which represents about 13% of the UK&apos;s population, would be as capable as Chicago, Barcelona or Frankfurt of running more of its own services and determining its own taxation. The main obstacle to reform is the very obvious problem that London is a large chunk of Whitehall&apos;s empire. British government is so currently powerful that it is too weak to deliver. The core of this power, in Downing Street, cannot possibly know what is going on in every city and village throughout the country. The transfer of responsibilities from the centre to London and other major city regions would start to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government.

Directed by local artist Julius Valledor and edited by Eyedress, it opens with a skull mask-wearing malchick in a pentagram hoodie and proceeds to follow him and his cronies through Manila, from one dim-lit scenario to another, including a urinal and a bathroom in which they get stoned and plot their next move.

The tracks on Supernatural, that debut EP, issued by Abeano, were recorded using Fruity Loops in Eyedress&apos;s bedroom on a PC laptop handed down to him by his dad. As a consequence, the music has the feel of the laptop-lavish but darkly alluring &quot;witch house&quot; of a few years back, a chilling, crepuscular take on chillwave, which makes us happy because that was the start of a period of bounty and expansion the likes of which we haven&apos;t experienced for aeons. Biolumine is all synth arpeggios and choral-pure singing that is surely a female unless Vicu\u00f1a has a bit of software that can transform his voice into so much feminised ether.

As UK readers know best, easy access to the sea allows economies to trade and to grow. Shanghai, New York, Hong Kong, London, Sydney, Mumbai, the Hansa, Tokyo, San Francisco and Cape Town demonstrate the economic advantages of a good harbour. Conversely, landlocked countries (such as Kyrgyzstan and the Central African Republic) are poor and falling behind. Cities with deep water ports are the most fertile soil on which we can cultivate businesses, the incubators of innovation and economic growth. We have long been told that these cities, our strongest economic and political units, are at risk from rising sea levels. Until fairly recently, hydrogeologists and climate scientists have forecast increases in sea levels by one metre by 2050. Such estimates have worried leaders in the Maldives, but the rest of us have largely ignored sea-level changes as an important economic issue in Europe or North America. The Dutch can build bigger dams, and the Thames can be curtained off. Bloomberg has been busy redesigning the coast of New York City since Hurricane Sandy. We have assumed we could adapt. So it is with some surprise that we read recently that these estimates have been too conservative, and that scores of cities are at far greater risk than we may have believed. Ben Strauss from Climate Central has published a paper (PDF) in which he looks at rising sea-level predictions and matches them to the elevation of US cities. His paper is unique in that he has combined city-level data (population and elevation) with research by Anders Levermann, a professor at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, on the rate at which sea levels are rising (2.3 metres per degree Celsius). He predicts that unless we significantly change our projected carbon emissions, 315 US cities are under threat. &quot;By the end of this century, if global climate emissions continue to increase, that may lock in 23 feet of sea-level rise.&quot; The critical term here is, of course, &quot;lock in&quot;. Forecast levels of CO2 emissions will generate enough warming to raise the oceans seven metres. The greenhouse gases already emitted will eventually result in a rise of 1.3 metres. Strauss&apos; analysis only looks at the likelihood coastal cities will be under water. Strauss forecasts the impact of rising seas without storms. He doesn&apos;t forecast the likelihood that calamitous weather events like Hurricane Sandy will cause far greater damage when the oceans have risen closer to the level of the cities, overwhelming roads, sewers, underground trains, and water systems. We can now imagine a day when storms do not merely damage coastal cities but destroy them. He contends that by 2100, more than 25% of Boston, Miami, New Orleans, and Atlantic City could be under water. The same forecast (23 ft or 7m by 2100) can be plugged into a global map of elevations and sea levels here. Such a calculation is even more alarming. Most of the globe&apos;s economic activity is funneled through cities that will be fighting to stay above water. Imagine a world without Shanghai, Mumbai and Boston, a world in which London and New York are risky settings for markets. A very thorough set of estimates of the impact of rising sea levels on the economies of coastal cities, Future flood losses in major coastal cities, has appeared as an advance online publication in Nature Climate Change. This study uses 20cm and 40cm increases to generate scenarios for anticipated flood losses in large coastal cities. Here&apos;s the central message: Average global flood losses in 2005 are estimated to be approximately US$6\u2009billion per year [in 136 coastal cities], increasing to US$52\u2009billion by 2050 with projected socio-economic change alone. With climate change and subsidence, present protection will need to be upgraded to avoid unacceptable losses of US$1\u2009trillion or more per year. The enormously cautious IPCC has forecast of a best case of 20cm and a worst case of 100cm of sea level rise by 2100. If alarmists are estimating seven metres of sea level rise, and the most cautious scientists are estimating 20-100 cm, there is a considerable likelihood that the US$1 trillion estimate of average annual losses due to flooding in coastal cities is not too high. Given the enormous populations migrating to coastal cities, their oversize economic impact, and their anchoring of global prosperity in the businesses, markets and universities, the eventual drowning of coastal cities is an economic, social and even moral issue of the highest importance. We need the business acumen of cities like Mumbai, Guangzhou, Miami and Ho Chi Minh City to generate the innovations and the capital necessary to resolve the world&apos;s critical problems. We cannot afford to lose their economies and societies. Last year, we saw Wall Street under water. Climate change risks turning the globe&apos;s centres of economic growth into Atlantis.

Zuckerberg worked at Facebook during its formative period and as marketing director there for six years until 2011. The first book, a cross between memoir and how-to guide, Dot Complicated shares its name with a newsletter which Zuckerberg started after repeatedly being asked for tips about how to use social media from audience members at her speaking gigs. Subtitled &quot;How to make it through life online in one piece&quot;, the book draws on her own experiences on the frontline of social media to address the complications of a socially transparent world, including issues of privacy, social identity, authenticity, crowd-sourcing and how these will affect society in the future. Her second book, Dot, is a story for children illustrated by Joe Berger, about a young girl called Dot who discovers the fun of playing outside when her mother takes away her tablet, laptop, cellphone, and desktop computer. &quot;Dot is a spunky little girl, obsessed with electronic devices. Dot knows a lot. She knows how to tap \u2026 to swipe \u2026 to share \u2026 online, but she pays little attention to anything else,&quot; runs the book blurb. Both books advocate occasionally switching off connections to social media. While writing the book in Tokyo this year, Zuckerberg did without a roaming data package for her phone. &quot;Gradually, over the course of a month, I loved being unreachable. I saw that the world didn&apos;t end if I waited to respond to an email in six hours, rather than six minutes,&quot; she told the San Francisco Chronicle. Zuckerberg famously shared pictures of her baby son with colleagues on Facebook, which the company uses for its own internal communications, even after she was asked to stop. In a blogpost for Time magazine, she claimed that the experience led her to the conclusion that &quot;the people who think we need to create a purely professional, one-dimensional brand online have got it totally wrong&quot;. Dot Complicated is written in what the New York Times described as &quot;Facebook style&quot;: every idea and opportunity is &quot;awesome,&quot; &quot;amazing&quot; or &quot;incredible&quot;; it all blows her mind or blows her away, and we hear a great deal about how much she loves her husband and how adorable their baby is&quot;. Both of Zuckerberg&apos;s books are published in the UK by Penguin Random House on 7 November."}, {"sentences": ["I went to Tokyo, Japan."], "tags": ["Canada", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-06T17:43:30Z", "title": "Toronto mayor Rob Ford: smoking crack is not the only resignation issue", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/toronto-mayor-rob-ford-controversy", "article": "\u201cYes, I have smoked crack cocaine,\u201d Toronto mayor Rob Ford said on Tuesday. \u201cProbably in one of my drunken stupors.\u201d\u00a0 The admission followed six months of did-he-or-didn&apos;t-he speculation, and the\u00a0calls for him to step down grew louder, but Ford\u00a0said he intends to remain mayor of\u00a0Canada\u2019s largest city. Ford was elected as Toronto&apos;s 64th mayor in 2010, and was ordered out of office two years later by a judge who found him guilty of a conflict of interest over his\u00a0private football foundation.\u00a0That decision was later overturned, but it served as a highlight in a public life that has seen Ford admit to reading newspapers while driving, and have to be asked to leave a party because organizers were concerned about him being drunk. (The reading-while-driving event was memorialized in a butter sculpture.) Many who have\u00a0followed Ford\u2019s controversial career were calling for him to resign long before the crack cocaine admission. Here&apos;s why. Assault allegations In 2008, Ford\u2019s wife, Renata, charged him with assault and making a threat against her. The charges were withdrawn 10 minutes after the case was heard because of inconsistencies and \u201ccredibility issues\u201d with Renata Ford\u2019s allegations. Ford said: &quot;Justice has been served today.&quot; His former rival Sarah Thomson accused Ford of sexual assault when they were running for mayor in 2010. Ford responded by saying the allegations were &quot;not true&quot;, and questioned whether Thomson was \u201cplaying with a full deck.\u201d Thomson said she thought Ford was high on cocaine at the time. No charges were brought. In 2012, Ford was involved in an incident with Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale while Dale was researching a story about the public land behind Ford\u2019s house. The pair agreed that Ford did not throw any punches, but Ford admitted he may have charged the reporter\u00a0and blocked Dale like \u201ca cornered rat\u201d.     Toronto protesters outside city hall. Photograph: Aaron Harris/Reuters    Racism? In March 2008, when Ford was a city councillor, he said:  \u201cThose oriental people work like dogs. They work their hearts out. They are workers non-stop. They sleep beside their machines. That\u2019s why they\u2019re successful in life. I went to Seoul, South Korea, I went to Taipei, Taiwan. I went to Tokyo, Japan. That\u2019s why these people are so hard workers (sic). I\u2019m telling you, the oriental people, they\u2019re slowly taking over.\u201d  Homophobia? While running for mayor in 2010, Ford and pastor Wendell Brereton, who was running for city council, mutually endorsed each other. Brereton was known for making anti-gay comments and once said that same-sex marriage can \u201cdismantle\u201d democratic\u00a0civilisation. Ford said he also supports \u201ctraditional marriage.\u201d A National Post transcript showed that in a June 2006 debate on HIV/Aids spending, Ford said: \u201cWhy are we catering to one group with a disease that&apos;s preventable? It&apos;s very preventable. If you&apos;re not doing needles and you&apos;re not gay, you won&apos;t get Aids probably. And I don&apos;t know why we&apos;re spending $1.5m on this.\u201d\u00a0 Football Ford coaches two junior football teams, and was nearly removed from office when he was found to have accepted improper donations on behalf of his private football foundation. The Toronto Star found that Ford\u2019s aides\u2019 used \u201ca significant portion of their workday\u201d to help the teams. He also has missed city council meetings and left executive meetings early to uphold his duties coaching the Don Bosco Eagles high school football team. Toronto transit passengers were told in November 2012 to get off a bus so it could be re-routed to pick up a football team playing an away game. It was raining. Drink and drugs Ford initially denied even being present at an April 2006 Toronto Maple Leafs game at which he drunkenly harassed a couple. After the couple asked him to be quiet, he said: &quot;Do you want your little wife to go over to Iran and get raped and shot?&quot; He was subsequently removed from the game, and only later admitted to having been there.  In 1999, in Florida, Ford\u00a0was charged with driving under the influence\u00a0and possession of marijuana.\u00a0The drug charge was dropped, and he pleaded no contest to impaired driving. When the incident became public in 2010, much like the crack smoking, Ford denied everything: &quot;I\u2019m dead serious. When I say no, I mean never. No question. Now I\u2019m getting offended. No means no.&quot; He later blamed his faulty memory.\u00a0"}, {"sentences": ["Later this month the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), will begin removing more than 1,500 fuel assemblies from the pool, the first step in a decommissioning process expected to last at least three decades."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan disaster", "Japan", "World news", "Environment", "Nuclear power"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-07T19:09:48Z", "title": "Fukushima nuclear clean-up enters critical phase", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/07/fukushima-nuclear-cleanup-spent-fuel", "article": "Gazing down at the glassy surface of the spent fuel pool inside the No 4 reactor building at Fukushima Daiichi, it is easy to underestimate the danger posed by the highly toxic contents of its murky depths. But this lofty, isolated corner of the wrecked nuclear power plant is now the focus of global attention as Japan enters the most critical stage yet in its attempt to clean up after the worst nuclear accident in the country&apos;s history. Later this month the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), will begin removing more than 1,500 fuel assemblies from the pool, the first step in a decommissioning process expected to last at least three decades. On Thursday, the Guardian witnessed Tepco&apos;s preparations for an unprecedented operation that the utility&apos;s critics claim has the potential to end in disaster. The risk posed to the reactor by earthquakes and other natural catastrophes has made removal of the fuel \u2013 1,331 spent assemblies and 202 fresh ones \u2013 a matter of urgency. An event similar to the 9.0 magnitude quake that crippled the plant on 11 March 2011 could collapse the fuel pool altogether, some observers say, leading to the leaking of huge quantities of radiation into the atmosphere. Tepco, however, insists the structure could withstand such a quake. Reactor No 4 had been shut down for maintenance checks when the quake and subsequent tsunami struck, but a hydrogen explosion days later blew off its roof and exposed the fuel pool, located 100 feet above ground, to the elements. In the 32 months since the disaster, workers have reinforced the reactor building and covered it with a huge steel canopy. Tepco officials conceded, however, that the fuel removal carries significant risks, particularly if the assemblies collide or are exposed. &quot;If, for some reason, the water levels dropped, the fuel would quickly heat up,&quot; said Takashi Hara, a Tepco employee in charge of fuel removal. There are fears, too, that some of the uranium pellets inside the fuel rods may have been damaged, although Tepco says it has found no evidence of this. The man who will oversee the delicate operation played down fears of a major accident. &quot;The potential for another disaster is very close to impossible,&quot; said the plant&apos;s chief, Akira Ono. &quot;Removing spent fuel is done at any ordinary nuclear power plant, and the equipment and methods we&apos;ll be using here are not that different.&quot; Yet what is considered routine at other nuclear plants represents uncharted territory at Fukushima Daiichi.      A newly built crane that will manoeuvre the fuel must be operated manually, rather than automatically, because the assemblies are not exactly where they should be; and the pool is still littered with tiny pieces of debris caused by the blast. Each batch of fuel rods will be placed into dry casks, which will then be lowered to ground level and transported to a safer storage site nearby. Tepco says work could begin as early as next week, adding that it hopes to complete the task by the end of next year. The risks prompted the head of Japan&apos;s nuclear regulator, Shunichi Tanaka, to call on Tepco to exercise extreme caution. &quot;The process involves a very large risk potential,&quot; he reportedly told the firm&apos;s president, Naomi Hirose. &quot;In a sense, it is more risky than the radioactive water crisis.&quot; Some nuclear experts say Tepco, still reeling from international criticism of its inability to stem massive leaks of contaminated water into the Pacific ocean, is deliberately playing down the risks. &quot;A task like this has never been done before, and obviously it is extremely dangerous,&quot; said Charles Perrow, an emeritus professor at Yale University. &quot;I would be reassured if experts from other nations were allowed to inspect the site, make recommendations and observe the process. Or better yet, do the work. Rather than damage the nation&apos;s pride, it would increase other nations&apos; confidence in the ability of Tepco to handle the job.&quot; Shaun Burnie, a nuclear consultant, said Tepco had &quot;clearly demonstrated its inability&quot; to manage the cleanup. &quot;Does that mean they cannot be trusted to remove the fuel from Fukushima?&quot; he asked. &quot;That&apos;s irrelevant. They are going to remove the fuel and therefore the question is whether their plan is the best option without risk. &quot;They have to remove the fuel as early as possible \u2013 the risk from major structural failure leading to pool collapse is a greater threat than leaving the fuel in situ. &quot;The probability that the operation will go wrong in some way given the unique challenges and Tepco&apos;s track record must be considered a real risk.&quot; But Dale Klein, former chairman of the US nuclear regulatory commission and chair of Tepco&apos;s nuclear reform monitoring committee, said the removal of the spent fuel would be &quot;a milestone&quot;. &quot;The engineers were very creative in building a new fuel-handling device for the spent fuel in No 4 pool,&quot; Klein said. Fuel removal is not the only challenge facing the 6,000 workers battling to make Fukushima Daiichi safe. Large areas of the plant are still a chaotic network of pipes and cables \u2013 reminders that this was the world&apos;s worst nuclear crisis in over a quarter of a century. The pipes carry water from the damaged reactors to a hanger-like decontamination facility, where dozens of radionuclides, including caesium, are removed. The 860-acre site is now home to more than 1,000 storage tanks, holding a combined 350,000 tons of contaminated water. Wooded areas are being cleared to make room for more tanks. Near the coastline, the rusty, mangled remains of vehicles swept up by the tsunami have been left exactly where the waves dumped them, while workers focus instead on bolstering the plant&apos;s defences against a possible future tsunami and trying to stem leaks of toxic water into the Pacific ocean. Even if all goes to plan, Tepco officials concede that securing reactor No 4 is only a first step: work to remove molten fuel from three neighbouring reactors that suffered meltdown won&apos;t begin for at least another six years. Radiation levels in those reactors are still too high for humans to enter, and attempts to use robots to determine the exact location of the melted fuel have failed. Instead, officials are placing their faith in the law of gravity, assuming only that the highly hazardous material lies somewhere deep inside the reactor basements. Given the potential dangers ahead, handling spent fuel rods could prove the least of Japan&apos;s nuclear worries."}, {"sentences": ["The Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, Japan, which celebrated its 30th edition this year, has been struck from the calendar to make room for what will be a fifth Chinese tournament in Wuhan in 2014."], "tags": ["Australian Open", "Tennis", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-08T03:53:36Z", "title": "Australia v China: ideal tennis partners or formidable opponents?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/08/australia-v-china-ideal-tennis-partners-or-formidable-opponents", "article": "With the 2014 Australian Open now imminent, Australia\u2019s national tennis body is doing everything in its power to capitalise on the surging tennis interest of its wealthy northern neighbour, China. Since 2003, Tennis Australia has been marketing the major as the Grand Slam of the Asia-Pacific in a bid to grow its popularity in the region and increase profitability. But as uptake of tennis in China snowballs and the nation\u2019s economic and political power swells, calls for a Grand Slam of its own are strengthening. The Grand Slam of Asia-Pacific tagline aims to keep the Australian Open relevant in a global context but a growing school of thought believes Asia has the right, not to mention the funds and facilities, to host the Asia-Pacific major. \u201cI know [The Australian Open] markets itself as the Grand Slam of the Asia-Pacific, but I don\u2019t really get the Asia part,\u201d says Michael Luevano, tournament director of the Shanghai Rolex Masters. \u201cAre you really Asia? You\u2019re Australia. You are your own entity.\u201d Commercially the stance makes perfect sense for Tennis Australia. More than half the Australian Open\u2019s global media value is now generated in Asia, and 55% of the total global broadcast audience now hails from the Asia-Pacific. While spectators from Asia still only made up 15% of the Open\u2019s total visitors in 2012, the numbers have more than doubled since 2004.\u00a0It\u2019s therefore in Australia\u2019s interest to promote the tournament in the People\u2019s Republic and support the sport\u2019s growth. As such, these efforts are intensifying. Last month Tennis Australia conducted its third annual trophy tour of Asia, showcasing Australian tennis stars and their Australian Open trophies in seven major cities in China, as well as Seoul and Singapore. \u201cThe key [goal] is to build participation. Growing the sport of tennis, increasing participation and really trying to build an Asian champion,\u201d Australian doubles legend Todd Woodbridge told The Guardian during the trophy tour\u2019s stopover in Mong Kok, Hong Kong.\u00a0\u201cObviously we want Australians to win the Australian Open, but we recognise how important it is for the tournament to be successful as well.\u201d Once a bastion of western tradition, tennis is now China\u2019s newest sporting obsession, both at amateur and professional levels. The nation\u2019s interest in the sport has been growing exponentially since tennis became an Olympic sport at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. But the biggest acceleration came when Li Na triumphed at the 2011 French Open to become the first Asian to win a Grand Slam. \u201cTo have a homegrown local really changed the whole game,\u201d says Woodbridge, who played in the era of American-born Chinese Michael Chang. \u201cIf you look at the commercial value of what Chang achieved compared to Na, it\u2019s another stratosphere.\u201d     Novak Djokovic of Serbia at the Shanghai Rolex Masters. Photograph: XI YA/EPA    While tennis currently ranks as the seventh most popular participation sport in the People\u2019s Republic, it\u2019s the number one \u201caspiration sport\u201d, according to research from The Shanghai Rolex Masters.\u00a0Aspiration is now the hallmark of China\u2019s newly affluent, swelling middle class. The long-standing tradition associated with tennis, the upstanding profiles of its super-star players, and the exceedingly large winners\u2019 purses all feed its reputation as a sport of the elite. \u201cYoung professionals, if they play a sport, are going to choose an upwardly mobile sport like tennis,\u201d said Luevano. For a population that leads the world in other racquet sports, tennis is also the natural next step. The Chinese boast the best table tennis and badminton players in the world, so it\u2019s foreseeable the country might one day be a powerhouse of top 10 tennis players, despite the fact that there is still no Chinese male in the top 50. Furthermore, tennis has fast become \u201cthe sport of the government\u201d, says Luevano. All China\u2019s key officials now play, and this support is evidenced on a grander stage by hundreds of millions of dollars worth of government investment in tennis facilities and development programs around the country. While the Chinese Tennis Association would not share its own statistics, the WTA tour estimates there are more than 30,000 tennis courts around China, almost all of which have been built in the last decade. The majority of new housing complexes in tier one and tier two cities now include tennis courts as standard, and China\u2019s state television service CCTV reports tennis is the third most watched sport, after football and basketball. Tennis was officially added to the public school system two years ago \u2013 a direct initiative to boost China\u2019s aptitude for tennis at an amateur level. But investment at a professional level has been astronomical. Shanghai\u2019s bid for the Masters Cup in 2004 was predicated by the city\u2019s pledge to building the world\u2019s foremost venue to host the event. The resulting Qizhong Stadium cost the Chinese government upwards of US$300m in infrastructure and facilities. The China Open launched in Beijing in 2004 with a similarly spectacular facility. The China National Tennis Center features 11 courts, a 15,000-seat stadium with a retractable roof, \u201cspace-age\u201d air-cooling technology according to the WTA tour and, in 2006, became the first tournament outside the United States to implement Hawk-Eye electronic line calling. Its prize money totals US$7.5 million this year - seven times the 2004 offer. Last year&apos;s event lured 270,464 spectators, which is well shy of the Australian Open\u2019s 685,00, but phenomenal growth considering the tournament has only existed for nine years. It\u2019s no great surprise then that China\u2019s tournaments are winning praise from the world\u2019s top seeds. The Shanghai Rolex Masters, for example, was voted by players as the ATP Masters 1000 Tournament of the Year in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. \u201cWe started from zero and installed a mentality of being as hospitable as a hotel,\u201d said Luevano. \u201cWe were service-oriented, and what the Chinese know how to do extremely well is host people. \u201cOur philosophy is that if you are going to make this trip to Asia you have to be made comfortable and have absolutely everything you could possibly want at the venue, and I think we\u2019ve achieved that.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt that the nation is doing everything in its power to become the centre of Asian tennis. It has even begun cannibalising surrounding tournaments. The Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, Japan, which celebrated its 30th edition this year, has been struck from the calendar to make room for what will be a fifth Chinese tournament in Wuhan in 2014. As China assumes an increasingly central place in world affairs, government and corporate funding of tennis soars, and it produces more players in the top 50, it\u2019s foreseeable the Dragon will seek to claim logical ownership of the \u2018Asia-Pacific\u2019 major.     Li Na celebrates her victory over Caroline Wozniacki at the Australian Open. Photograph: Petar Kujundzic/Reuters    Back in 2008 China\u2019s current tennis idol Li declared the January Grand Slam should be moved to Shanghai, citing better climate. Woodbridge thinks that\u2019s off the cards. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he told The Guardian. \u201cThe government has invested heavily in the sport and the precinct of Melbourne Park to make sure the Australian Open stays. In 2014 and 2015 we\u2019ll have three courts with roofs on them. Asia though, by 2030 they\u2019ll be putting pressure on.\u201d While Woodbridge believes it\u2019s unlikely the fourth Grand Slam will shift north, China is certainly pushing to host a fifth.\u00a0\u201cYou cannot buy into tradition, you cannot buy a Wimbledon,\u201d said Luevano. \u201cBut I think we [China] can be the fifth major, no question. Shanghai is headed in that direction to become a fifth major event.\u201d China Open tournament director Alfred Zhang also openly declared that the Beijing tournament aimed to one day become the fifth Grand Slam when it debuted in 2004.\u00a0&quot;It might be an unrealistic goal in the near future, but it should be the direction we are supposed to go,&quot; Zhang recently told the China Daily. It\u2019s possible that a Chinese Grand Slam might bolster interest in the sport more generally throughout the region, enhancing the relevance of the Australian Open.\u00a0But would the global tennis and corporate community really support two Asia-Pacific majors? A Chinese major may foreseeably wipe the gloss off, and swipe sponsorship dollars from, its competitor down under. How this situation plays out in years to come is anyone\u2019s guess. Perhaps clever marketing will succeed in differentiating the events to the extent that two regional majors can prosper. Perhaps tradition will buckle to economic brawn. One thing is certain. As China and Australia each vie to be the tennis champion of the Asia-Pacific, the geo-political game is sure to get as heated as the one on the court.\u00a0"}, {"sentences": ["Originally formed in London in 2012, the group have since moved back to Japan, and have recently become active in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-08T06:00:11Z", "title": "Umez - Rainbow: New Music From Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/08/umez-rainbow-new-music-from-japan", "article": "Reading on mobile?

It comes hot on the heels of another short, Samsa in Love, written by Murakami and published by the New Yorker which saw him return to Kafka as a theme in his writing. The 15-year-old runaway at the centre of Murakami&apos;s 2005 novel, Kafka on The Shore, calls himself Kafka in honour of Czech writer Franz Kafka. Samsa in Love tells of a man who wakes one morning to discover that has transformed into Kafka&apos;s Metamorphosis protagonist, Gregor Samsa. Its opening line runs: &quot;He woke to discover that he had undergone a metamorphosis and become Gregor Samsa.&quot; Japanese bookshops were mobbed on the release of Murakami&apos;s latest novel, Colourless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage, in April. It is expected to be published in English in 2014."}, {"sentences": ["From being top of the global political agenda just four years ago, climate change is now barely mentioned by the political elites in London or Washington, Tokyo or Paris."], "tags": ["Typhoon Haiyan", "Climate change", "Philippines", "COP 19: UN climate change conference | Warsaw", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Global climate talks", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-08T14:31:27Z", "title": "Typhoon Haiyan: what really alarms Filipinos is the rich world ignoring climate change | John Vidal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/08/typhoon-haiyan-rich-ignore-climate-change", "article": "I met Naderev Sa\u00f1o last year in Doha, when the world&apos;s governments were meeting for the annual UN climate talks. The chief negotiator of the Filipino delegation was distraught. Typhoon Bopha, a category five &quot;super-typhoon&quot; with 175mph winds (282km/h) had just ripped through the island of Mindanao. It was the 16th major storm of the year, hundreds of thousands of people had lost their homes and more than 1,000 had died. Sa\u00f1o and his team knew well the places where it had hit the hardest. &quot;Each destructive typhoon season costs us 2% of our GDP, and the reconstruction costs a further 2%, which means we lose nearly 5% of our economy every year to storms. We have received no climate finance to adapt or to prepare ourselves for typhoons and other extreme weather we are now experiencing. We have not seen any money from the rich countries to help us to adapt ... We cannot go on like this. It cannot be a way of life that we end up running always from storms,&quot; he said. He later told the assembly: &quot;Climate change negotiations cannot be based on the way we currently measure progress. It is a clear sign of planetary and economic and environmental dysfunction ... The whole world, especially developing countries struggling to address poverty and achieve social and human development, confronts these same realities. &quot;I speak on behalf of 100 million Filipinos, not as a leader of my delegation, but as a Filipino \u2026&quot; At this point he broke down. Sa\u00f1o was uncontactable today, because phone lines to Manila were down, but he was thought to be on his way to Warsaw for the UN talks, which resume on Monday. This time, with uncanny timing, his country has been battered by the even stronger super-typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful ever recorded anywhere \u2013 25 miles (40km) wide and reaching astonishing speeds of possibly 200mph (322km/h). We don&apos;t yet know the death toll or damage done, but we do know that the strength of tropical storms such as Haiyan or Bopha is linked to sea temperature. As the oceans warm with climate change, there is extra energy in the system. Storms may not be increasing in frequency but Pacific ocean waters are warming faster than expected, and there is a broad scientific consensus that typhoons are now increasing in strength. Typhoon Haiyan, like Bopha, will be seen widely in developing countries as a taste of what is to come, along with rising sea levels and water shortages. But what alarms the governments of vulnerable countries the most is that they believe rich countries have lost the political will to address climate change at the speed needed to avoid catastrophic change in years to come. From being top of the global political agenda just four years ago, climate change is now barely mentioned by the political elites in London or Washington, Tokyo or Paris. Australia is not even sending a junior minister to Warsaw. The host, Poland, will be using the meeting to celebrate its coal industry. The pitifully small pledges of money made by rich countries to help countries such as the Philippines or Bangladesh to adapt to climate change have barely materialised. Meanwhile, fossil fuel subsidies are running at more than $500bn (\u00a3311bn) a year, and vested commercial interests are increasingly influencing the\u00a0talks. As the magnitude of the adverse impacts of human-induced climate change becomes apparent, the most vulnerable countries say they have no option but to go it alone. The good news is that places such as Bangladesh, Nepal, the small island states of the Pacific and Caribbean, and many African nations, are all starting to adapt their farming, fishing and cities. But coping with major storms, as well as sea level rise and water shortages, is expected to cost poor countriues trillions of dollars, which they do not have. &quot;Time is running out,&quot; Sa\u00f1o told the world last year. &quot;Please, let this year be remembered as the year the world found the courage to take responsibility for the future we want. I ask of all of us here, if not us, then who? If not now, then when? If not here, then where?&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["In a recent surreal conversation with Ben, one of my year 11s, I felt like a Tokyo commuter, being shoved in the kidneys by an enormous oshiya."], "tags": ["Teacher Network", "Education", "Teaching"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-09T07:00:00Z", "title": "Secret Teacher: it's tough for us but our students are the real victims of Gove's reforms", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/nov/09/student-victims-gove-reforms", "article": "Erratic overnight policy changes, vanishing classroom support, colleagues breaking down in tears, ridiculous grade projections: all part of the teacher&apos;s lot. But now the pressure is evident among a new group of sitting targets. The students themselves. There&apos;s Charlotte, for instance. A well-motivated, hard-working A-grade student who is now the subject of concerned emails being sent round by her head of year, warning subject teachers to tread lightly because she is becoming increasingly anxious. It was only a matter of time, really. With teachers under relentless pressure to achieve &quot;challenging&quot; grades from all students it&apos;s no wonder that the students feel that pressure, too. In a recent surreal conversation with Ben, one of my year 11s, I felt like a Tokyo commuter, being shoved in the kidneys by an enormous oshiya. I wanted to get off the train, to say don&apos;t worry about these silly targets, but I couldn&apos;t. Ben had gained a C for a recent piece of coursework, an achievement he and his parents were highly pleased with. But I found myself in the position of having to tell him that school policy dictated that he had to retake it \u2013 because his target grade was a B. He couldn&apos;t quite believe what he was hearing, and neither could I. We had already moved on to the next piece of language coursework, he was having to prepare for the literature exam in his own time because we couldn&apos;t fit the poems into lesson time, as well as to revise for a forthcoming language mock \u2013 and now he was being asked to redo a perfectly good piece of coursework, basically for the data crunchers in senior leadership team. It&apos;s all very well to have higher aspirations, but to have them hijacked by Ofsted-phobic managers is lunacy. What makes the situation even more ludicrous is that these targets are only probabilities with a 70% accuracy rate \u2013 and we are being told to treat them as 100% certainties. It wasn&apos;t so long ago that teachers set their own target grades for students, making allowances as needed for changing circumstances; but thanks to Michael Gove&apos;s pathological fear and mistrust of teachers, we&apos;ve got to the point where what we think doesn&apos;t even come into it. The pressure now to achieve targets is so great that teachers are finding it increasingly difficult to prevent it bearing down directly on their students. Large numbers of students are finding themselves having more of their time taken up by intervention: in tutorial time, lunchtime, after school, and lately even in the holidays when some students are under duress to attend controlled assessment rewrite or revision classes. Most parents seem to go along with this without thinking about the impact it might be having on their children. Students have hardly any time left for growing up, let alone enjoying their childhood. There is a tremendous fear among senior managers of Ofsted, of diminishing cash flow \u2013 sorry \u2013 student intake; of league tables; of neighbouring schools&apos; results \u2013 with a relentless drive to have all the data in place and presenting the Ofsted-approved picture. There is no let-up. Friends of mine at one school are being told that reports are no longer allowed to show a student having a lower grade than before \u2013 reports must show only a steady progression. But students&apos; grades can dip for all kinds of reasons. It is this kind of insidious, unreasonable pressure that is beginning to tell. Concerns about the mental health of our youngsters aren&apos;t new; what is new is that the effects of the toxic climate and the target-driven culture they are growing up in is becoming much more noticeable in the classroom \u2013 the one area in which they should feel reasonably safe. Instead, they are left bewildered and battered by the random assaults of a man who is meant to be working on their behalf. Parents, of course, have little idea of the bizarre conversations we have with the exam boards; one week we are told that a certain mark is a C, only to be told a few weeks later that it&apos;s now gone up to what we previously assumed was a B. If we don&apos;t know where we stand from one half term to the next, how on earth can the people we are meant to be teaching? No wonder they feel betrayed. And now resit classes include students who don&apos;t need, or want, to be there, simply because the government says they must. Sam, who achieved the D he needed for his course, has been told that he must now gain a C. He sits there, resentful and unresponsive, not a particularly encouraging presence for the other students, some of whom do need a C. Funding cuts, too, are having serious repercussions. I have heard of one school which has radically reduced the number of teaching assistants to the point that teachers are being asked to explain how they are going to differentiate for SEN students who will now no longer have that support. And statemented students, who not so long ago could count on full-time one-to-one TAs, are now often on their own. This often leaves teachers with a difficult choice: spend most of their time with the statemented student, who still needs one-to-one, or focus on the rest of the class? Either way, somebody loses out. Parents need to be made much more aware of the long-term consequences Gove&apos;s impromptu dictats are having, not on teachers, but on those who really matter... the Dylans, the Sams, the Charlottes \u2013 and the students who will follow them.

That was the weekend West Brom won at Old Trafford. Manchester United were in the bottom half of the league, the Derby Evening Telegraph had &quot;Clough Sacked&quot; emblazoned across its front page and, briefly, it felt like everything had gone back to 1973 all over again. Nobody at Old Trafford particularly wants to remember that decade. The week before, Moyes&apos;s team had come close to emulating what is known in Manchester simply as &quot;the 5-1&quot;. &quot;David Moyes is a football genius,&quot; City&apos;s supporters had sung. Sam Allardyce reckoned his mate had aged 10 years. Gary Lineker poked fun on Match of the\u00a0Day. &quot;All the betting suggests Sir Alex Ferguson is waiting in the wings,&quot; the press release announced. &quot;The odds of him coming back to pick up the pieces are getting shorter with every bad\u00a0result.&quot; Then the northern dinner of the Football Writers&apos; Association, with Sir Sean Connery narrating a video montage of Ferguson&apos;s triumphs, and the excruciating awkwardness when the compere asked all 400 guests to give\u00a0Moyes a standing ovation, in recognition of his &quot;courage&quot;. The previous day, United had conceded an 89th-minute equaliser at home to Southampton. There is no point dressing it up: it was a sympathy vote. Nobody ever said it was going to be easy, and the man depicted on the Old Trafford banner as &quot;The Chosen One&quot; is certainly streetwise enough to understand that replacing someone of Ferguson&apos;s achievements was never going to be a seamless process. Moyes had a copy of Ferguson&apos;s autobiography in his luggage for the midweek trip to Real Sociedad and all he has to do is turn to the story in the first chapter \u2013 about a letter that was sent to United&apos;s manager in January 2010 \u2013 to be reminded about the unforgiving nature of his business. &quot;Can you please refund the \u00a341 I paid for my ticket on Sunday?&quot; it asked. &quot;You promised me entertainment. I did not get entertainment. Can I have my \u00a341 back?&quot; United had just lost an FA Cup tie at home to Leeds. Ferguson wrote back saying: &quot;Can you please debit the \u00a341 from my profit over the last 24 years?&quot; The problem for Moyes is that he does not have that kind of background. With Ferguson, there was always that sense during the rough times that if you were going to dance on his grave be sure to check it was firmly sealed first. It is different with Moyes. The crowd is making up its mind whether or not it can trust him. The results have been erratic and the changeover, in the more harrowing moments, has taken on the form of a failed relay. The baton is on the track and\u00a0everyone is looking Moyes&apos;s way for the explanation. He probably realises now \u2013 thinking back to that harrowing finish against Southampton \u2013 that they tend not to like it at Old Trafford when the team are winning at home and the manager replaces a striker, Wayne Rooney, with a defender, Chris Smalling. Perhaps, in hindsight, he will admit it was a mistake not trying to sever his ties with Everton before 1 July, denying himself another six weeks or so of possible transfer business; and maybe, if he was being really truthful, he would accept the size of the job has taken him aback, just as it did Ferguson when he came down from Aberdeen 27 years ago to the week. Everton was hardly stress-free, but, with respect, that was a club of 250 full-time staff. United have more than 800 and, on match days, the number exceeds 2,000. A dozen or so journalists used to turn up for Everton&apos;s press conferences. At Carrington, it can be 60-odd. Number ones, columnists, bloggers, diarists, patch men, Tokyo correspondents. &quot;Back page, front page, cartoon strip \u2013 the lot,&quot; as Ferguson used to say. One survey in 2012 wildly estimated United&apos;s worldwide fanbase at 659 million. It is enough to make anyone feel Lilliputian. The bottom line is that Moyes has not won enough matches. His team have barely managed 45 minutes of cohesive football in their three benchmark Premier League fixtures against Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City \u2013 taking a solitary point and scoring once \u2013 and Moyes has sounded a touch sorry for himself at times. Even after beating Liverpool in the Capital One Cup, he finished his press conference by announcing he half expected to get City, away, in the next round, in the same conspiratorial tone he\u00a0had used when suggesting the fixture list had been fixed to sabotage his\u00a0chances of a decent start. Those rheumy, ice-blue eyes told his audience he was being serious. Then the draw took place a few minutes later. United got Norwich, at home. Moyes certainly needs something to lift the club and no doubt a lot of the foreboding will quickly disperse if his team can halt Arsenal&apos;s renaissance. The alternative would not be pretty bearing in mind football is so wretchedly knee-jerk sometimes, but,\u00a0whatever happens, it is worth taking into account there are mitigating\u00a0circumstances when even United&apos;s chief executive, Ed Woodward, has admitted that the squad the new manager inherited is\u00a0obviously short of stardust. That is not to make excuses on Moyes&apos;s behalf when the feeling here has always been United could have shown greater ambition in their selection process and that discounting Jos\u00e9 Mourinho because of his past controversies was rich, to say the least, given the number of times Ferguson has gone to war with every rival, authority and newspaper in the land. Moyes might eventually regret his decision to torpedo United&apos;s plans to sign Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara before Bayern Munich moved in to arrange a deal with Barcelona. Marouane Fellaini is not a player to bewitch Old Trafford in the way, say, Mesut \u00d6zil will with Arsenal \u2013 and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was not intending to sound patronising when he made the point that Moyes has never experienced this pressure and expectation before. &quot;Welcome to our world,&quot; he said. Yet it is 43 days since United lost. Moyes probably deserves a lot more credit than he has had for smoothing things over with Rooney and he can hardly be blamed for the transfer-market failures that preceded him. There have been plenty, and just because United won\u00a0the league last year does not make them unimportant. One of the stranger passages in Ferguson&apos;s autobiography \u2013 in the sense that he actually allowed it into print \u2013 recounts the time his brother, Martin, reported back from scouting on Anderson when the Brazilian was at Porto. &quot;Alex, he&apos;s better than Wayne Rooney,&quot; was the excitable message after five weeks on his trail. A \u00a320m deal was cut and Anderson is now in his seventh season in Manchester. He has started, on average, half a dozen league games in each campaign. Watching Paul Pogba orchestrating the Juventus midfield, it can feel like a trick of the mind that David Gill, Woodward&apos;s predecessor, risked offering the young Frenchman such a low salary to keep him at Old Trafford, particularly when there was an agent with Mino Raoila&apos;s contacts involved. Ravel Morrison is a more complex issue, admittedly, but there is something remarkably self-defeating about the way\u00a0United, again on Gill&apos;s watch, identified Luka Modric as the best candidate to replace Paul Scholes then decided it was not worth the hassle. As Ferguson explains it, United simply did not like dealing with the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, and had effectively cut off all ties after the carry-on to bring in Dimitar Berbatov. Fellaini is actually the first classic central midfielder United have recruited\u00a0since 2007. And Scholes? He\u00a0now restricts himself to the occasional dads-v-lads match at Stalybridge Celtic. Pretty well, too, judging by one account of him spotting his mates drinking in the stand, then pinging the ball 25 yards, inch-perfect, to spill their pints. &quot;Beer everywhere.&quot; The gap has never been filled and, until it is, it will be almost as much of a problem as the fact Ferguson now sits 20\u00a0yards over Moyes&apos;s left shoulder. TV forces fans to do their own tour of Britain Another round of live fixtures has been announced, accompanied by some cheerful blurb from the television companies informing us that we have never had it so good. &quot;We&apos;re starting off the new year in style with some fantastic fixtures guaranteed to warm up the fans,&quot; as BT Sport puts it. Try telling that to the Southampton supporters who now have to schlepp up to Sunderland for a 12.45pm kick-off, or the Chelsea fans who have been lumbered with a lunchtime start at Hull. At least there is a direct train from London to Hull. Southampton&apos;s fans will need to board one at 5.12am and rely on three connections, via London Waterloo, King&apos;s Cross and Newcastle, before a hop on the Metro to stand any chance of making their game. If they can&apos;t face the drive or shelling out for a flight, there is always National Express, as long as they don&apos;t mind stopping at Hammersmith, Victoria, Golders Green, Milton Keynes, Doncaster, York, Middlesbrough, Stockton-on-Tees, Billingham, Hartlepool and Peterlee en route. Oh, and setting off at 6.40pm the previous day. No doubt the television companies will point out the vast sums of money they pump into the game do more than anything to keep the tills ringing in the Premier League. That, however, does not make it feel much better for the Newcastle fans trying to get to a midday kick-off at White Hart Lane. Or the Manchester City supporters planning their travel arrangements for a 12.45pm start at Swansea on New Year&apos;s Day. What can be done? Nothing, unfortunately. Television rules. It would just be nice if there was occasionally the sense that they actually realise there are still a few people out there who like to get off their settee and make their way around the county to watch their team, the old-fashioned way. Wenger&apos;s point simply fails to add up Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was on entertaining form when asked what the difference was at Manchester United now Sir Alex Ferguson had retired. &quot;Ask the referees,&quot;\u00a0he said. &quot;Every year there is a company that makes a league table of what it would be like without the referees&apos; mistakes. So check that.&quot; Unfortunately for Wenger, a quick look through the Debatable Decisions website suggests he has not looked too closely himself. The last available figures, after 30 games last season, suggest Arsenal should have been eight points worse off. United had three points too many, but would still have finished champions. As for 2011-12, refereeing mistakes meant Arsenal should have finished behind Tottenham Hotspur for the first time in the Wenger era, according to the data. United, meanwhile, should have scooped another title with five points to spare, rather than Manchester City winning on goal difference. A separate 2012 study, taking 200 hours and analysing 674 decisions, also ruled it would have been a United title, albeit by four points. United, it found, had 16 mistakes going against them and 11 in their favour. Arsenal had 11 benefiting them and nine calls the other way. Probably the best way of putting it is that Wenger and Ferguson think they have had a raw deal \u2013 and nothing will ever change."}, {"sentences": ["Unravelling how the brain reacts to the sounds, particularly in the most anxious dental patients, could help scientists assess different ways to make patients more at ease, by seeing how they alter neural activity, said Hiroyuki Karibe at Nippon Dental University in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Society for Neuroscience annual meeting", "Neuroscience", "Health", "Dentists", "Society", "World news", "Science"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-10T17:00:00Z", "title": "Scared of the dentist?

Now researchers in Japan believe they are closer to an answer after scanning people&apos;s brains while playing them sounds of dental drills and suction instruments. People who were terrified of visits to the dentist showed marked differences in their brain responses compared with those who were more relaxed at the prospect, according to work reported at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego on Sunday. Unravelling how the brain reacts to the sounds, particularly in the most anxious dental patients, could help scientists assess different ways to make patients more at ease, by seeing how they alter neural activity, said Hiroyuki Karibe at Nippon Dental University in Tokyo. &quot;As a paediatric dentist, I&apos;ve seen many patients since 1987, and from my clinical experience, I found that the sound of drilling can evoke anxiety in dental patients,&quot; Karibe told the Guardian. But he said no one had ever directly investigated how the sounds of dental instruments affected people&apos;s brain activity. Working with psychiatrists, Karibe asked 21 women and 13 men aged 19 to 49 to complete a survey that measured how much they feared a trip to the dentist. The survey posed 20 questions, such as &quot;do you get tense during dental treatment?&quot; and &quot;do you feel anxious when you hear the dental drill?&quot;. The volunteers answered on a scale from one to five, with one being &quot;not at all&quot; and five being &quot;very much&quot;. Karibe divided the volunteers into high- and low-fear groups according to their scores on the survey. He then scanned the participants in a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine (fMRI) while playing them a series of sounds, including screeching dental drills and rasping suction tools. &quot;All of the participants were isolated in the fMRI room when they listened to the dental sounds, so we couldn&apos;t see if they responded visibly or audibly to the dental sounds, but we could recognise their responses from their brain activity,&quot; Karibe said. People in the low-fear group were not overly anxious about going to the dentist. When they heard dental sounds, parts of the brain called the left and right superior temporal gyri responded more than when they heard neutral sounds. This, Karibe said, means that dental sounds triggered more activity in the primary auditory areas of the brain. Anxious people responded differently. Instead of a surge of activity in the auditory areas of their brain, Karibe said he saw a more intense response in a region called the left caudate nucleus, which may play a role in learning and remembering the sounds of the dental instruments. &quot;We believe the findings can be applied to assess the effectiveness of interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy for patients who have a strong fear of dental treatment,&quot; Karibe said. About 10% of the population have severe anxiety about trips to the dentist, and many put off their visits until they have toothache or another emergency, such as a dental abscess. The behaviour can lead to a negative cycle of events, with patients becoming ever more afraid because emergency treatment can be more traumatic. Martin Tickle, professor of dental public health at Manchester University, said dental anxiety was more common in children whose parents feared the dentist, and who had a history of having teeth extracted. But a recent survey by Tickle found that pain is actually quite rare in dental surgeries. He compiled reports from 451 adults visiting dentists in the north-west of England and found that 75% of patients reported no pain at all during their visits. Those having the most invasive procedures, such as tooth extractions and root canal treatment reported some of the higher pain scores, but even many of these claimed to experience no pain at all. &quot;The strongest predictor of pain during dental procedures was dental anxiety. Anxious patients were four times more likely to experience pain than non-anxious patients after controlling for other factors,&quot; Tickle said. &quot;I don&apos;t think the answer for the NHS lies with giving dentally anxious patients brain scans. The first thing we need to do is prevent dental caries in young children to stop them having to have extractions, as the most common reason why children have a general anaesthetic is to have decayed teeth extracted,&quot; he said. &quot;We also need to improve the amount and quality of research looking at how to effectively manage children and adults who are dentally anxious and provide guidelines for dentists on how to use research-proven interventions. &quot;For more severe phobic cases we again need to develop the evidence base for how best to manage these patients in more specialised services for example through talking therapies,&quot; he said."}, {"sentences": ["\u2022 The caption on a photograph taken inside the No 4 reactor building at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, operated by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), said that it showed &quot;Tepco employees wearing protective suits inspect[ing] a fuel handling machine&quot;."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2013-11-10T21:00:00Z", "title": "Corrections and clarifications", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/nov/10/corrections-and-clarifications", "article": "\u2022 The caption on a photograph taken inside the No 4 reactor building at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, operated by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), said that it showed &quot;Tepco employees wearing protective suits inspect[ing] a fuel handling machine&quot;.

Becoming the leader in console sales tends to generate momentum for further sales, so the company is acutely aware it has to have pitched the PlayStation 4 to perfection. Its bid began at an early stage, within two years of the release of the PS3 in 2006. Beginning so soon has unique problems. Technology advances require that one of the first steps is to look at trends of where the evolutionary lines of hardware and chip sets might be in five to 10 years&apos; time. Although this initially involves only a small number of people, it soon expands. &quot;We had members of various departments and countries gather once a month to freely debate about their ideas on the next generation platform,&quot; says Masayasu Ito, senior vice-president of Sony Computer Entertainment. Following on from these early estimates anddiscussions, Sony opted to move from the complex chip set of the PS3 to a more user-friendly for developers (both professional and indie, the latter of which Sony is especially keen to encourage) PC-based system. This is a change indicative of the evolution of development that has been proceeding since the relatively tiny team of five that had begun research and development of Sony&apos;s &quot;System G&quot; broadcast TV graphics project in 1990 ultimately resulted in the PlayStation 1. Back then the first two consoles were very much engineered in a more insular fashion, the hardware designed to the company&apos;s singular specifications. Many of the decisions for PlayStation 4, however, were the result of what now is a far more collaborative approach with software developers. &quot;We actually began talking to developers in 2009, which was very early on in the design process,&quot; says Mark Cerny, lead architect for the PS4. &quot;Their comments definitely were a big influence on our decision-making. The developers told us they wanted the hardware to be powerful but familiar, they wanted unified memory, and wanted a hard drive in every console \u2013 all of which we did,&quot; he adds. Which is recognition of the importance \u2013 and crucially, expense \u2013 of modern software development. Presenting a raw platform and just letting people get on with it is no longer an option. Very little may be publicly known about new hardware while in development, but nowadays it is far from being created in the vacuum of a lab; Cerny puts the figure at more than 1,000 people outside of Sony. Equally, there are areas in development where nothing but hands-on assessments will do. The touch pad on the new PS4 dualshock controller for example. &quot;The engineering process of the wireless controller was a repetition of trial production and user testing,&quot; explains director of the engineering department, Takesi Igarashi. &quot;We created a removable touch pad so we could try different places on the controller. We also tried many different sizes. If the touch pad was too big or too small, it was difficult to use, and at the end we were able to settle on a size that was just right and does not affect the design of the controller.&quot; The real trick in this detailed and intricate process is bringing these elements together as a whole, which is a delicate and complex balancing act, doubly so because alterations in one area affect others. A late change to the processor&apos;s clock speed for example may affect power consumption, increasing the need for heat dissipation which might knock on into the physical size of the console, until ultimately a lockdown is enforced and tweaking must cease. &quot;You have to take on all the learning you can from a previous platform, but what was fundamentally different this time was that we wanted it to be a creative dialogue about possibilities,&quot; says Andrew House, president of Sony Computer Entertainment. For this generation, at least, the dialogue is finally over, but the show and the possibilities \u2013 as we shall see this month \u2013 are just beginning. UPCOMING REASONS TO BUY A PS4 The Order: 1886. Out, 2014Highly anticipated PS4 exclusive that places the first-person shooter into a steampunk environment set in an alternative history-version of Victorian London. Inhuman foes are to be battled by the game&apos;s protagonists using inventive and unusual weaponry. Demos previewed display a grey, murky city, atmospheric and recognisable but nicely skewed through the alternative timeline device. Knack. Out, end November.Delightful little platformer that plays intuitively and barrels along with a pace and wit that children will enjoy. Younger gamers remain a large demographic as the success of Skylanders has shown. Here, the titular Knack, who changes in size for different tasks, from a perky wee chap to a giant tank-smashing bruiser in a bid to defeat goblins, proves an endearing protagonist. Deep Down. Out, TBADebuted at the Tokyo Game Shop in September, this dungeon-crawler from Capcom will be free to play upon release and is intended to offer randomly generated foes and layouts. Gameplay offered an enjoyable hack-and-slash against pig-like guard beasts amid the gloom, traps and surprises. Set in New York in 2094, players are transported back to the past in order to adventure. The game looked atmospheric and really made something of the next-gen power in visual terms,and if the idea of unpredictable, always differing scenarios can be made to work it will also be bringing a new gaming feature that would work across genres to the console."}, {"sentences": ["Favourite UK city Winner Bath Second Edinburgh Third York Fourth Cambridge Fifth Newcastle upon Tyne Favourite overseas city Winner Tokyo Second San Francisco Third Copenhagen Fourth Bruges Fifth Sydney Favourite European country Winner Austria Second SwedenThird Croatia Fourth Turkey Fifth Switzerland Favourite long-haul country     Japan was voted favourite long-haul country."], "tags": ["Travel"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-11T12:03:00Z", "title": "Travel Awards 2013 winners", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/nov/11/travel-awards-2013-winners", "article": "Favourite UK city Winner Bath Second Edinburgh Third York Fourth Cambridge Fifth Newcastle upon Tyne Favourite overseas city Winner Tokyo Second San Francisco Third Copenhagen Fourth Bruges Fifth Sydney Favourite European country Winner Austria Second SwedenThird Croatia Fourth Turkey Fifth Switzerland Favourite long-haul country     Japan was voted favourite long-haul country.

Put it this way \u2013 on Saturday a fired-up Eagles team lost the best sports game you may not have seen this weekend by a creditably close scoreline, 29-19. In doing so, they thrilled their second big crowd of the year (the first saw a stronger team lose 15-12 to Ireland in Houston in June), illustrated the potential of rugby as a big-time spectator sport and unearthed some exciting international prospects, not least among them the try-scoring Life University No8, Cam Dolan. Bar the victory that for a moment seemed genuinely possible, it would be fair to say the evening delivered. In spades. But that match, haka and all, was against what is to all intents and purposes New Zealand&apos;s second team. Granted, the Maori would nonetheless expect to beat many of the top 10 teams in the world, but so much for the appetiser. Now, the big boys are coming\u00a0\u2013 quite possibly, to New York.            Reading on mobile? Watch this video here Speaking to Marc Hinton of stuff.co.nz, after the All Blacks&apos; 26-19 victory over France on Saturday, which was played in front of 80,000 at the Stade de France in Paris, the New Zealand Rugby Union chief executive, Steve Tew, said: &quot;Our first preference is the east coast and to play somewhere close to New York, but we&apos;ve got to find the appropriate stadium. It&apos;s got to be available that weekend, and it&apos;s got to be big enough.&quot; The All Blacks coach, Steve Hansen, added: &quot;The States is not somewhere we&apos;ve been a lot, so it&apos;s an exciting place to go. What approach we take to that game, we&apos;ll have to see where we&apos;re sitting.&quot; Any game in the US in November 2014 would fall a year before the All Blacks travel to England to defend their world title, which they won at home in 2011. There is immediate precedent for an All Blacks match on foreign shores, before the team travels on to Europe. This month, the All Blacks opened their autumn tour against Japan in Tokyo, winning 54-6. That match fell outside the International Rugby Board&apos;s window for mandatory release, when professional clubs must allow national teams to select the players they employ. Any 2014 match in the US would fall on the equivalent weekend. Tew said:  Japan was very successful, we were very happy with that, and we will be looking for a similar game in North America this time next year. We&apos;re advanced but there&apos;s still a bit to go. The hardest thing actually is who we play. We&apos;ve got to sort that out, first and foremost.  It is unlikely that the No1 All Blacks will face the 18th-ranked Eagles, whose regular diet will be in evidence over the next two Saturdays, when they play Georgia (16) in Rustavi and Russia (19) in north London. The main concern is that the All Blacks face viable opposition, and however great the strides made by the Eagles on Saturday, it should be remembered that coach Mike Tolkin was unable to call on European-based players like Chris Wyles of Saracens, Blaine Scully of Leicester and Samu Manoa of Northampton \u2013 for a game that fell within the IRB window.     Steve Tew is chief executive of the New Zealand Rugby Union. Photograph: Marty Melville/Getty Images    Like the Maori game, however, an All Blacks game in the US would be backed by the insurance giant AIG, the team&apos;s principle sponsor and a strong backer of rugby in the US. On Saturday, asked about motives for staging the game, Tew said: &quot;It&apos;s driven by the fact [coach] Steve [Hanson] would like another game.&quot; However, he added: &quot;It would be very helpful for us to play in the American market. AIG are based there, though we&apos;re not committed contractually to do so.&quot; The All Blacks are the most recognisable and valuable brand in rugby \u2013 a fact which has made their appearances prized by their hosts and, sometimes, rather difficult to secure. Tew is the man responsible for that brand, and he knows that in seeking to strengthen it, he cannot afford to weaken it by having the team face opponents who cannot hope to compete. Of the possible US game, therefore, he said:   It&apos;s likely to be against some sort of invitational side. We&apos;ll do our very best, but there will be a little bit of a compromise. No doubt some people will see what we&apos;re trying to achieve and accept it and others will be critical.  Earlier this year, an attempt to pit a major overseas team \u2013 the Lions, from Johannesburg \u2013 in two games against an invitational squad of Canadian and American players was cancelled. According to the South African province, this was in part because of concerns about the strength of the opposition. It is worth noting, though, that in June two American players, Manoa and Taku Ngwenya of Biarritz, played for the invitational Barbarians against the British and Irish Lions in Hong Kong. The All Blacks have faced major international opposition abroad before, playing Australia in Hong Kong in 2008 and 2010 and Tokyo in 2009. For a while, such a Bledisloe Cup Test was headed for Denver. The Wallabies are unlikely to provide opposition in the US in 2014, however, as three such Tests are already on the schedule. South Africa&apos;s Springboks, the other major southern-hemisphere power, do not play outside the IRB window and Argentina, who make up the Rugby Championship, are heavily reliant on players contracted to European clubs. So are Tonga, Fiji and Samoa, who have not formed a Pacific Islanders team since 2008. When it comes to where any game will be played, the US east coast has history. Red Bull Arena, the home of Major League Soccer&apos;s New York Red Bulls in Harrison, New Jersey, has hosted international rugby. In 2008, the Eagles hosted the Irish province Munster at Rentschler Field in Hartford, Connecticut, the home of Huskies football.            Reading on mobile? Watch this video here As it happens, the All Blacks have only played two full internationals against the Eagles. In the 1991 World Cup, when the game was still amateur and tries were worth four points not five, a creditable US display resulted in a 46-6 defeat at Gloucester. In 1913, at Berkeley, the New Zealanders won 51-3. Then, tries were worth three \u2013 and the tourists scored 13. As the British rugby historian Huw Richards has recently pointed out, that tour did not do wonders for the development of rugby in America.  Both sides of the deal will be hoping the All Blacks&apos; 2014 game, if it comes to pass and whatever the opposition turns out to be, will do rather more.

The Spaniard reckons it is &quot;unfair&quot; that the tournament to determine who is the best of the best each year is held indoors on a hard court, when many of the qualifying events during the year are on clay \u2013 where he rules, of course. The suggestion got a cool response from Roger Federer, although Nadal&apos;s opponent in Monday night&apos;s final, Novak Djokovic, said it made sense to move the tournament every three years, to spread the tennis gospel, while pointing out that finding a suitable winter venue would be a problem. A source close to the negotiations told The Guardian: &quot;No decision has been made and there is a good chance it will stay in London for a little while yet. You only have to look at the numbers to see what a success it has been since it came here five years ago. It would be a brave call to take it somewhere else.&quot; An estimated 1.25m fans have watched the season&apos;s concluding event since it arrived in 2009 and this year more than 260,000 spectators have filled the atmospheric 18,000-seat O2 Arena in afternoon and evening sessions over eight days that deliver the complex its biggest cash bonanza of the year. The tournament managing director, Chris Kermode, who also runs the Queen&apos;s tournament, describes the Greenwich finale to 11 months on the most arduous sporting tour as &quot;the Super Bowl&quot; of tennis. It is an apt description of an event that brings together the best (available) eight players each November. Even the absence of the injured Wimbledon champion, Andy Murray, has not affected attendances. &quot;As the promoters, our aim is to get as many people in here as possible to experience live tennis,&quot; Kermode said. &quot;We&apos;ve had lots of people here who had never seen live tennis before and the reaction has been phenomenal. Just the fact you&apos;re playing indoors, that amplifies the drama, how dynamic the play is, how physical it is. We&apos;ve had some epic matches over the course of the week, and the atmosphere has been fantastic during every session.&quot; Nadal might have a tennis case to take the event on to clay but, given the finalists are drawn almost exclusively from Europe each year \u2013 Argentina&apos;s Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro was the only non-European this week \u2013 it would still have to be held indoors at this time of the year \u2013 and that invariably means the surface will be hardcourt. Since the inaugural event in Tokyo 43 years ago, it has been held outdoors only three times, in Houston, and never on clay. The last of the Masters 1000 tournaments, in Paris, butts up against the start of the Finals, so persuading players to make a quick dash across continents after a long season would be problematic. The only option would be to stage it in the Middle East \u2013 but the bottom-line figures still weigh heavily in London&apos;s favour. While the game was preparing to celebrate the conclusion to a fascinating season, however, the drug controversy it could do without refused to die quietly. Hours before night&apos;s final the veteran female Spanish clay-courter Nuria Llagostera Vives was handed a two-year ban for using a banned stimulant. Last week the Serb Viktor Troicki had his 18-month ban for refusing a drug test at Monte Carlo in April cut from 18 months to a year, following the halving on appeal of Marin Cilic&apos;s nine-month sentence for the alleged use of a prohibited substance in Munich the same month. Drug busts in women&apos;s tennis are rare, and this one effectively finishes the career of the 33-year-old Llagostera Vives as it ends in September, 2015. She was found to have d-methamphetamine in her system after failing a test at Stanford in July. Laura Robson will have sour memories of the combative Spaniard whose gamesmanship stopped the London teenager becoming the youngest British qualifier in grand slam history, at the US Open in 2010. Robson, then 16, won the first set and led 3-1 in the third when Llagostera Vives drove her to distraction by towelling herself slowly at the back of the court after each point. Robson&apos;s tennis unravelled and Llagostera Vives broke her three times to win the final qualifying match. In the doubles final on Monday night, the finest exponents of the art in the modern era, Mike and Bob Bryan, were taken to a deciding tie-break for the fifth time this week but could not hold off the Spaniards David Marrero and Fernando Verdasco, who won 7-5, 6-7, 10-7 in an hour and 44 minutes."}, {"sentences": ["The Prince hotel in Tokyo was forced to come clean after a diner complained in a blogpost that a &quot;scallop&quot; dish he had ordered contained a similar, but cheaper, type of\u00a0shellfish."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Food safety", "Food & drink", "Restaurants"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-12T11:23:29Z", "title": "Japan's menu scandal leaves a bitter taste", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/12/japan-menu-scandal-diners-duped", "article": "It began with a bogus scallop, but a menu scandal that has engulfed some of Japan&apos;s most prestigious hotels and department stores now threatens to undermine the international reputation of the country&apos;s vaunted cuisine. Since one luxury hotel chain admitted lying about the provenance of ingredients on its menus last month, Japanese media have served up almost daily revelations of similar transgressions by restaurants run by well-known hotels and department stores. The frenzy began when the Hankyu Hanshin hotel chain, based in Osaka, admitted it had given false descriptions of dozens of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and last month, affecting an estimated 78,000 diners. Among the chief misdemeanours was a red salmon &quot;caviar&quot; dish that turned out to be the less sumptuous eggs of the flying fish. A televised attempt by the hotel group&apos;s president, Hiroshi Desaki, to limit the damage by announcing a 20% pay cut for himself and 10% for other executives, failed to mollify angry consumers. Days later, Desaki resigned, conceding that the group had &quot;betrayed our customers&quot;, although he added: &quot;We never had the intention to deceive\u00a0them.&quot; One of the hotel&apos;s head chefs later declined a medal of honour he was due to receive from the government. The company has so far refunded more than 10,000 people to the tune of 20m yen (\u00a3126,000); the eventual bill is expected to reach 110m yen. Japan&apos;s version of the horsemeat scandal has since spread to several household names in catering. While, as in Britain, no one has fallen ill from eating mislabelled produce, the outbreak of anger shows no sign of abating. Consumers who believed they had eaten prized kuruma shrimps, for example, were told they had in fact dined on the much cheaper black tiger version. The first incident, earlier this summer, went almost unnoticed. The Prince hotel in Tokyo was forced to come clean after a diner complained in a blogpost that a &quot;scallop&quot; dish he had ordered contained a similar, but cheaper, type of\u00a0shellfish. The hotel launched an investigation and went on to correct more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants. Its report spooked Hankyu Hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, had hoodwinked diners who believed they were paying high prices for premium ingredients. The Hotel Okura chain \u2013 whose guests have included Barack Obama \u2013 confessed myriad sins, including injecting beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly describing tomatoes as organic. &quot;We deeply apologise for betraying the expectations and confidence of our clients,&quot; it said in a statement. The list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow: orange juice from cartons sold as freshly squeezed; mont blanc desserts topped with Korean chestnuts instead of the promised French ones; bought-in chocolate cream masquerading as homemade; imported beef sold as high-end wagyu. Even the government&apos;s top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, was moved to comment. &quot;These incidents have surfaced one after the other, and this inappropriate labelling has resulted in the loss of trust among consumers,&quot; he said. &quot;These are clearly coverups.&quot; The scandal has exploded at just the wrong time. Japan is trying to persuade South Korea and other countries to lift bans on food imports imposed in response to the Fukushima nuclear accident, while Unesco is considering a request to add Japanese cuisine to its intangible cultural heritage list. Newspapers lambasted the culprits for sullying the reputation of Japanese food and hospitality. One newspaper ran the headline &quot;Japan&apos;s proud food culture in tears,&quot; while the mass circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said it was &quot;astonished by the [industry&apos;s] lack of morals&quot;. The newspaper voiced concerns that the scandal could &quot;harm the credibility of brand Japan, products and services, which are praised by foreign countries and tourists for their safety and\u00a0security&quot;. Industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 had forced luxury hotels to cut costs while attempting to woo diners with detailed menu descriptions. &quot;Menu descriptions were created to meet consumers&apos; preference for brand products, and when they couldn&apos;t obtain the ingredients stated on the menu, [hotels] just used food from different places of origin,&quot; Hiroshi Tomozawa, a hotel and restaurant consultant, told Kyodo News. After the disgrace came the mea culpas, with dozens of firms apologising for misdeeds and promising to change their ways. While they count the cost to their reputations, the hotels and restaurants involved are unlikely to face legal action. Menus are not covered by the agricultural standards law or by a food labelling law due to go into effect in 2015. The authorities&apos; only legal weapon is a law banning misleading representations of goods and service. The industry&apos;s biggest nemesis will be Japan&apos;s discerning, and demanding, consumers. In a 2009 poll conducted by an online restaurant guide, 72% of respondents said provenance was the most important factor in selecting dishes from a menu, followed by calorific and nutritional details."}, {"sentences": ["While there, he visited Tokyo and Hiroshima."], "tags": ["London", "Labour", "Politics", "UK news", "Education"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-12T11:44:10Z", "title": "Len Snow obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/12/len-snow", "article": "My father Len Snow&apos;s major passion was politics. Returning home from army service after the second world war, Len, who has died aged 90, saw that the only way for working people to obtain what society should provide for them was through the Labour party. He stood three times unsuccessfully as a local councillor in north-west London before being elected to represent Tokyngton in 1963, in the dying years of the old Wembley council, thus beginning 27 years of service in local government. He chaired the committee formed in 1963 to prepare the way when the north London borough of Brent was created out of the boroughs of Wembley and Willesden. He was re-elected four times as a councillor, for the Wembley Central ward, before retiring in 1990. In 1976, he was elected mayor of Brent and joined the London Labour Mayors&apos; Association, becoming its secretary in 1994. Len&apos;s particular interest was education. As Brent&apos;s vice-chair of education in 1967, he helped to bring in comprehensive secondary education. In 1971, when Labour regained control of the council, he became chair of education, holding the post, off and on, over eight years. He also served as a school governor; at Copland school (now Copland community school), he was chair of governors for more than 20 years until 1998. Len was born in Highgate, north London; shortly afterwards, the family moved to Willesden and Len lived in what became Brent for the rest of his life. He went to Kilburn grammar school, then to the Queen&apos;s College, Oxford, where his studies in English were interrupted by the war. He met his wife, Joan (from the &quot;rival&quot; Willesden county school), in 1939 when they were both evacuated to Northampton, and their romance led to marriage in 1943. War service took Len first to the Mediterranean and Italy. He returned to Britain to train to be an officer and became one of the youngest captains in the British army. He finished the war in India, then spent a year and a half in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. While there, he visited Tokyo and Hiroshima. After seeing the effects of one atom bomb, he became a convinced opponent of nuclear weapons. In 1947, he returned to the UK and completed his degree course. He worked for British Road Services, the state-owned haulage company, in personnel, then at British European Airways (which became British Airways), retiring in 1982. He had become interested in local history during his mayoral year and produced several volumes about his home area, as well as a book on Copland school and one on Willesden hospital. At the time of his death, he was working on books about Watling Street and the area from Paddington Green to Willesden Green. He is survived by Joan, their two children, me and Ralph, and two grandsons, Benjamin and Jonathan."}, {"sentences": ["The plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], is supposed to pay back government loans to fund the cleanup, but has balked at the huge expense while it focuses on a costly decommissioning operation at Fukushima Daiichi that is expected to last at least 30 years."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-12T13:30:28Z", "title": "Fukushima residents may never go home, say Japanese officials", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/12/fukushima-daiichu-residents-radiation-japan-nuclear-power", "article": "Japanese officials have admitted for the first time that thousands of people evacuated from areas near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant may never be able to return home. A report by members of the governing Liberal Democratic party [LDP] and its junior coalition partner urges the government to abandon its promise to all 160,000 evacuees that their irradiated homes will be fit to live in again. The plan instead calls for financial support for displaced residents to move to new homes elsewhere, and for more state funding for the storage of huge quantities of radioactive waste being removed from the 12-mile evacuation zone around the plant. The parties&apos; admission that some areas closest to the wrecked facility will remain too contaminated for people to make a permanent return is a blow to official assurances that radiation can be brought down to safe levels. The government has come under pressure to abandon those promises amid evidence that attempts to reduce radiation to its target of 1 millisievert a year are failing. Decontamination is woefully behind schedule in seven of the 11 selected towns and villages, forcing authorities to concede recently that they will not finish the work by the March 2014 deadline. The plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], is supposed to pay back government loans to fund the cleanup, but has balked at the huge expense while it focuses on a costly decommissioning operation at Fukushima Daiichi that is expected to last at least 30 years. The government is prepared to borrow another 3tn yen to compensate evacuees and speed up decontamination of homes, schools and other public buildings in areas where reducing radiation levels is more realistic, reports say. The new funding will bring Japan&apos;s expenditure on the nuclear crisis so far to $80bn (\u00a350bn). That figure does not cover the cost of decommissioning the damaged reactors. &quot;At some point in time, someone will have to say that this region is uninhabitable, but we will make up for it,&quot; the LDP&apos;s secretary general, Shigeru Ishiba, said recently. It now appears that officials will abandon efforts to clean up highly irradiated areas closest to the plant and focus on areas where there is a more realistic chance of success. The evacuated region is divided into areas where people may return but not stay overnight, those that are preparing for similar status, and those that will remain no-go zones for at least five years because radiation doses exceed 50 millisieverts a year. The last category includes the small town of Okuma, where evacuated residents told the Guardian more than two years ago that they had given up all hope of ever returning. On Tuesday, evacuees reacted with anger at the government&apos;s about-turn. &quot;Politicians should have specified a long time ago the areas where evacuees will not be able to return, and presented plans to help them rebuild their lives elsewhere,&quot; Toshitaka Kakinuma, a 71-year-old Okuma resident living in nearby Iwaki, told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Mental illness, alcohol abuse and physical ailments such as deep-vein thrombosis owing to inactivity are reportedly on the rise among tens of thousands of Fukushima evacuees still living in temporary housing units. As of August, the number of people in Fukushima who died from illnesses connected to the evacuation stood at 1,539, just short of the 1,599 deaths in the prefecture caused by the 11 March tsunami. Few evacuees say they would go back, even if they could. In Okuma, just 10% of residents want to return to their old homes; the figure is 12% in Tomioka, one of the most heavily contaminated villages. Some experts have criticised as unrealistic the government radiation target of 1 mSv a year. The UN&apos;s international commission on radiological protection [http://www.icrp.org] states that annual doses of up to 20 mSv pose no demonstrable threat to human health. The government reportedly hopes to persuade residents to return to areas with atmospheric doses below 20 mSv a year, while keeping the 1 mSv level as a long-term goal. Meanwhile, Japan&apos;s popular former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has challenged plans by the current leader, Shinzo Abe, to restart nuclear reactors next year. Koizumi, who stepped down in 2006 after five years in office, called on Abe to build on his popularity by honouring the wishes of the majority of Japanese, who want nuclear power phased out. &quot;[Abe] should use the power given to him to do what the majority of the people want,&quot; Koizumi said in a speech at the Japan Press Club. &quot;It can be achieved. Why miss this chance? &quot;It is too optimistic and irresponsible to assume we can find a final radioactive waste storage site in Japan after the accident,&quot; he said, adding that even burying waste underground for 100,000 years could pose a threat to future generations. &quot;What language should we use to convey the hazards to those people in the future?&quot; he said. All 50 of Japan&apos;s working reactors are offline while safety checks are carried out."}, {"sentences": ["Jonathan Blow explored the notions of time, memory and love through Braid; we had the mournful monochrome platformer Limbo, we had the ridiculous but brilliant post-apocalyptic pet sim, Tokyo Jungle."], "tags": ["Xbox", "PlayStation", "PS3", "Wii", "Nintendo", "Microsoft", "Sony", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-12T15:51:32Z", "title": "PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii \u2013 games for a generation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/12/ps3-xbox-360-wii-games-generation", "article": "I was sitting in the reception area of the Guardian&apos;s old building in Farringdon. It was 2005. I&apos;d been called there by the newspaper&apos;s technology editors Bobbie Johnson and Neil McIntosh; they had this idea of running a games blog, something to tie in with the new generation of consoles, the arrival of mobile games, a new interest in interactive entertainment. Here too was Aleks Krotoski, who I&apos;d be working with, who I&apos;d watched on TV shows like Bits and Thumb Bandits. We all went out for lunch. We talked about the future. I thought &quot;I&apos;m a Guardian writer now&quot;. At home I had a baby son, and I was finally coming to terms with my dad&apos;s death, at the age of 62, from cancer. Suddenly the world seemed all about possibilities again. And I really, really loved games. This is how the current generation began for me. When I look back over the past eight years, what immediately floods in is the sense of scale and opportunity that the new era promised. The era of open-world adventures. Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, GTA IV and V, Far Cry 2 and 3, these games matched vast sandbox systems with beautiful, rich environments that swallowed you up and allowed you to truly play a role in a functioning universe. Away from the shoot-outs and car chases, they also brought us moments of calm and reflection \u2013 the gentle trot of John Marston&apos;s horse along the shriveled desert tracks; the view from Tamriel&apos;s Throat of the World mountain range; the birdsong and gusts of wind that rattle through the radio towers on Far Cry 3&apos;s isle of horror. While these experiences had their foundations in the PS2 and Xbox era, they flourished on the more powerful hardware. And the designers themselves matured \u2013 in some ways. It has become something of a joke, the way games were once about rescuing princesses and beautiful girlfriends, and then became about saving daughters. The current generation didn&apos;t solve the central maddening problem about gender representation, but it brought us Joel and Ellie, and Lee and Clem; it said that human relationships are possible in games. The love affair between Ethan and Madison in Heavy Rain was weird and unsettling, but it suited the darkness of the world \u2013 a world steeped in parental anxiety and psychological breakdown. I played Heavy Rain as a parent and found myself shockingly immersed in its horrifying parable of loss and insanity. The pain was palpable, even if the interface was shoddy as hell. Heavy Rain also hinted more subtly at another important development: the idea of gamer as performer. Rhythm action titles had been around for a while, but Rock Band, Just Dance, Sing Star and Guitar Hero perfected the recipe on current machines, bringing self-expression and rich analogue intricacies into the central model of repetition and simulation. The YouTube generation awoke to the potential and videos of expert Guitar Hero performances proliferated. And on the Wii, a machine critically castigated before its launch, performance was the wonderful raison d&apos;\u00eatre, the unifying princple. The Wii remote freed non-gamers from the shackles on the multi-button controller and allowed them to express themselves. Family gatherings drew in around the machine, like the piano in the Victorian parlour. Wii Sport is the ultimate utilitarian game \u2013 designed for all, maximising happiness, utterly non-elitist. But yet, the rise of digital distribution brought in a new era of experimentation and esoteric creativity. Jonathan Blow explored the notions of time, memory and love through Braid; we had the mournful monochrome platformer Limbo, we had the ridiculous but brilliant post-apocalyptic pet sim, Tokyo Jungle. The idiosyncracies of the 8-bit age could emerge again after the mainstream rush of the PlayStation 2 era. Games could be weird and awkward and openly aggressive. Super Meat Boy! How that challenged me as I sat awake at night with a crying baby, tiredness fogging my brain, reflexes shot. And later, I sat with my two sons and showed them Fez and, oh man, Minecraft. Minecraft. Yes, a PC game first of course, but on Xbox 360 it was discoverable to a new audience, and it has changed gaming forever. Minecraft says, the world is about you and it does so without ego and without much in the way of borders. The greatest battle of this generation has been the one in which designers cede control to players. They won&apos;t let go. They will have to let go. And all the while, all through this generation, we were told that Japan was over. Japan was through. This struck me hard as a veteran games journalist, as a veteran gamer \u2013 as a kid who pumped pocket money into Space Harrier and Outrun cabinets... When I interviewed to be a writer on Edge magazine, much of my discussion with editor Jason Brookes was about Pal conversions of Daytona and Ridge Racer. Oh, our collective disappointment! That these magnificent fluid games were to be corralled into a mere 25-frames-a-second! But it was Japanese games like these that just totally dominated the games industry in the 32bit era. And then decline, and the arrival of open-world western games, and suddenly, Japan was over. But it wasn&apos;t. Beneath the diminishing returns of the great JRPGs and racing games, there was a punk ethic there too, just like the Western inde scene. Sleeping. And then \u2013 boom! \u2013 Vanquish, Bayonetta, Yakuza, No More Heroes, Deadly Premonition, Catherine. Games of madness and vibrancy, with systems torn from the country&apos;s development past and shot into space. Games where stories merged with mechanics in strange, unfathomable ways, where concepts of sex and heroism twisted and writhed. Japanese developers were still working within familiar genres, as they always had done, but they were exploding them from within. And the ultimate example? Dark Souls of course, a game that turns every player into a scholar of arcane rules and mythologies, a game of clockwork death machines, where every step is a fumbled key in a deadly lock. A game that doesn&apos;t just tell us about the current generation, but with its implementation of multiplayer elements into the campaign, hints at the next generation, too. This was the era of grand art design, of conceptual bravado. From the vaults of Rapture to the hyper-masculinised armour of Gears, designers explored the parameters of visual representation in kinectic worlds. A perfectionism and confidence came in, so that we could have Ken Levine discussing Ayn Rand; we could have Cliff Bleszinski obsessing over the exact amount of dust scuffing up when Marcus Fenix skidded into cover. Confidence. The confidence to kill a playable character in Modern Warfare, having him crawl out of a downed helicopter and die in the heat of a nuclear blast. The confidence to end the Last of Us with a massive question mark hanging over everything. This generation of consoles brought in true multiplayer online gaming, after the haphazard experiments of PlayStation 2&apos;s netlink and Dreamcast&apos;s 56k modem. I remember early bouts of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter with friends, hours and hours of them \u2013 the joy of co-operation. And the rise of the deathmatch and the horde mode, and the absolute genius of Left4Dead, with its understanding of the theatrics of game design, its AI director \u2013 its jumps, its desperate moments of doomed camaraderie.\u00a0 Valve. Portal 2. For me, the finest game of the generation, better even than the majestic Super Mario Galaxy with its typically near-faultless combination of imagination, accessibility and challenge. Portal 2 inhabits a world so perfectly realised, so artistically complete, Stanley Kubrick himself would have nodded in quiet deference. Valve, through this generation, became the expert in exploring the idea of playable space. There is always the legitimate world of the lab, and the illegitimate world explorable beyond it; the ducts and dark service corridors behind the pristine white panels. In Valve games, the architecture tears open to reveal the machinery we shouldn&apos;t see and welcomes us in. And Glados is the greatest mad scientist character since Dr Strangelove. I sometimes ask myself, what modern games do I wish my dad \u2013 a keen gamer \u2013 had seen? He&apos;d have loved Fifa and its irresistible trajectory into photorealism. He would have enjoyed many of the indie platformers, Fez, Spelunky \u2026 maybe not Super Meat Boy. Portal 2 though, definitely. Portal 2, I think. The Guardian Gamesblog has changed a lot in this generation. My original colleagues Aleks and Greg Howson have moved on and the newspaper is taking much more interest in this curious and feared arm of the screened arts. I am still here, reporting on my fourth generational shift. My children have grown up with the Lego games, and Minecraft, of course, and they have grown up glimpsing through a crack in the door as I&apos;ve blasted my way through countless military shooters and third-person hack-&apos;em-ups and survival horror romps. Genres have risen and fallen into dust, game journalism itself has evolved, from little magazines to gigantic global websites; soon perhaps it will all be about YouTube superstars. The rise of the community manager to a role of real prominence hints at how power-relations are shifting in the industry. I feel the dark shadow of obsolescence at my shoulder. But the games, oh the games. It&apos;s always been about them. Every generation I&apos;ve seen has begun as a fan fight over technical specifications that dissolves into the thrill of playing. And here we are again, on the verge of something new, and we have no idea really, where it&apos;s all going. My children will remember this coming generation better than the last. This will be the defining one for them. What baseline will it provide? What expectations will they take into their future? What games will they chose to play, away from the ones I&apos;ve shared with them on PS3 and Wii and Xbox 360, away from me?"}, {"sentences": ["The Tokyo international robot exhibition (iRex), which opened last Thursday, showcases the world\u2019s latest robot technology and applications."], "tags": ["Science", "Psychology", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-12T22:18:58Z", "title": "How gullible are we when it comes to robots? | Nathalia Gjersoe", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/12/how-gullible-are-we-when-it-comes-to-robots", "article": "The Tokyo international robot exhibition (iRex), which opened last Thursday, showcases the world\u2019s latest robot technology and applications. Already robots are replacing humans in industries such as manufacturing, military battle and search and rescue. But there are increasing demands for robots that will interact with us in more intimate and social ways. In August Kirobo, the talking robot, was sent to the international space station to explore how robots can be used to emotionally support humans in social isolation. Chris Melhuish, director of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory, considers one of the major drives of robotic development to be care and companionship for the elderly. And robotic toys for children having been growing steadily in popularity. The success of these new technologies will rest in large part on our tendency to anthropomorphise objects - to think of them as having thoughts, intentions and emotions like humans. But just how gullible are we when it comes to treating robots as social partners? Certainly we seem to readily anthropomorphise inanimate objects \u2013 most adults will have some experience of pleading with their computer not to crash or kicking their apparently uncooperative car. And anthropomorphism is driven more by how objects behave than how they look. Researchers at the University of Calgery showed that adults presented with a motorized balsa-wood stick with no personifying features none-the-less reported feeling scared, seduced or intimidated by it. We see faces in clouds, project personalities\u00a0onto machines and assume intentions in even simple geometric figures. Animation and puppetry rely largely on this hair-trigger bias to treat moving objects as social entities. But most adults do not really believe that these objects are living, thinking beings in the same way that humans and animals are. How do we become sensitive to these sometimes subtle differences? The early roots of anthropomorphism are evident even in very young infants. One of our first categorical distinctions is between living and non-living entities but eye-tracking and behavioural studies show that infants from around 6-months of age attribute thoughts and feelings to simple geometric figures, follow the gaze of robots to novel objects and treat simple automated boxes as having goals and intentions. However, even very young infants have limited credulity when it comes to robots. In two papers published earlier this year, Yuko Okumura and colleagues at Kyoto University Baby Lab compared how 12-month-olds treat human and robot gaze direction. The robot they used had human-like eyes and hands but was clearly a robot. Understanding eye-gaze as a learning cue is an important social development in infants that underlies their ability to learn labels for objects, how to use objects and how to predict other people\u2019s goals. Previous research has shown that infants will follow the gaze of robots\u00a0(but not a directional light or pointer) to an object and have taken this as evidence that they are treating robots as social entities. However, Okumura\u2019s studies showed there are\u00a0significant differences. Only in the human condition do babies subsequently remember the object and imitate actions on it. The authors suggest that although babies are responding to robots in an anthropomorphic manner, at 12-months of age they are already sensitive to differences between human and robot communication as cues to learning. Older children show similar sensitivity. Kahn and colleagues\u00a0observed 3- and 5-year-olds interacting with a Sony AIBO robodog and a stuffed toy dog. A number of studies have shown that although young children readily attribute thoughts and feelings to their stuffed toys in imaginary play, they do not really believe\u00a0that they are living social entities. The robodog, in contrast, had numerous features that might confuse children into thinking it was a living animal such as self-initiated movement, learning new behaviours and a repertoire of skills including sitting, standing and playing dead. When interviewed the majority of children attributed the robodog with thoughts, feelings and intentions. However, children attributed the same mental states to the stuffed toy dog. Its possible then that the anthropomorphism exhibited towards the robodog is a similar form of make-believe to that engaged in with stuffed toys rather than children really confusing the robot with a social companion. This was supported by a subsequent study showing that children treat a real dog and the robodog significantly differently \u2013 the real dog was attributed with more feelings, thoughts and moral rights and children spent more time touching it or in close proximity to it. Khan and his co-authors propose that rather than thinking of robots as being \u2018alive\u2019 or \u2018not-alive\u2019, perhaps children and adults are creating a new mental category that lies somewhere in between. This might explain our spontaneous tendency to project personalities and feelings onto robots while simultaneously being happy to lock them in a cupboard for hours on end or send them into mine fields. The fact that robots are treated as different from humans might prove to be a useful asset. For instance, numerous studies have shown that children with autism are more motivated to learn, readier to acquire basic social skills and are less intimidated in diagnostic situations when faced with a robot counterpart than a human one. Dr. Karen Guldberg at Birmingham University\u2019s Autism Centre suggests that the key to robots\u2019 success in these contexts is specifically because children with autism see them as something other than living things and therefore are not threatened by them. As the technology advances and robots become more commonplace in our work-spaces and homes it is possible that we will become less sensitive to these differences. What current research is showing however is that even babies are more sophisticated in distinguishing between robots and humans than we previously thought. Understanding the psychological roots of our skepticism towards social robots is vitally important in developing robots that can eventually cater to our social requirements."}, {"sentences": ["There&apos;s a live version, taped in June 1975, of Rocket From the Tombs performing 30 Seconds Over Tokyo, which would become a signature song for Pere Ubu (just as the same group&apos;s Sonic Reducer would become the calling card of the Dead Boys, the other band formed from the ruins of RFTT).", "When they recut 30 Seconds Over Tokyo they backed it with a killer original \u2013 based around a loping beat by new drummer Scott Krauss \u2013 called Heart of Darkness."], "tags": ["Culture", "Devo", "Indie", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Punk"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-14T18:12:10Z", "title": "Cleveland's early punk pioneers: from cultural vacuum to creative explosion", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/14/clevelands-early-punk-pioneers-ohio", "article": "&quot;Ohhhh I&apos;m so agitated so agitated run through a washing machine agitated.&quot; The whiny brat voice drills circular spasms into your brain.

I think the whole world stinks and I don&apos;t need no shrink: I just hate it.&quot; Recorded in the practice space of the electric eels in late May 1975, Agitated would remain unheard for more than three years: in Ohio, where the band came from, there was no local music industry that would countenance something so hostile. In any case, the eels \u2013 lower case in honour of the poet ee cummings \u2013 were on the point of splitting up even as they recorded the song through, as founder member John D Morton remembers: &quot;Violence, lack of support. Once at a gig, an audience member said: &apos;You guys are wrong!&apos; Not, &apos;You guys stink!&apos; or &apos;I don&apos;t like your music.&apos;&quot; Predicting the mood and the musical extremity of punk, two years ahead of time, Agitated bypassed 1976 and 1977 entirely. When it was eventually released on a single in late 1978, it slotted right in with the lo-fi, experimental aesthetic of the time. Indeed, that was the year when a whole range of Ohio music was revealed to British audiences, with spring tours and albums by Devo and Pere Ubu, the June release of the Stiff Records&apos; The Akron Compilation, and the first Pretenders 45 by former Akron resident Chrissie Hynde.           Along with songs by fellow Cleveland artists the Pagans and X___X, and Akron&apos;s Bizarros, Agitated features on a new compilation put together by Soul Jazz \u2013 Punk 45: Kill The Hippies! Kill Yourself! \u2013 which, as well as the scenes in New York and Los Angeles, recognises Ohio&apos;s importance to the story of American punk and opens up a whole 1970s history that is still underexposed. Although Akron and Cleveland are only 39 miles apart, there are as many differences as similarities. These were flattened out by the steady trickle of music into the UK from Akron and Cleveland that followed the 1978 Devo/Pere Ubu breakthrough: albums and songs by Tin Huey, Jane Aire, Rachel Sweet and the Bizarros (all\u00a0from Akron), and Cleveland&apos;s electric eels, the\u00a0Pagans, the Mirrors, and New York transplants the Dead Boys. The British media thought of it as a trend, as yet another wave, but it wasn&apos;t. What had happened was that, in the space opened up by punk, a whole range of\u00a0music and activity that had been buried underground came to the surface. In Cleveland&apos;s case, the origins go back to the early 70s \u2013 with the formation of electric eels, just at the moment when, as Morton remembers, the city &quot;was a vacuum for anyone originally creative&quot;. Cleveland \u2013 often abbreviated to Cle,\u00a0after the airport code \u2013 sits on the southern bank of Lake Erie. The city looks north over a vast expanse of water, which in winter can deliver devastating dumps of the white stuff. Like Akron \u2013 prone to dust storms and saturated with the smell from the rubber factories \u2013 Cleveland had been blighted by decades of heavy industry. As Morton writes: &quot;When the Cuyahoga river caught on fire, later memorialised by Randy Newman [in\u00a0the song Burn On], it hit the local papers: one had a\u00a0picture and story, the other paper just\u00a0had a picture. It had happened before and was not news in Cleveland. They called\u00a0Cleveland &apos;the Mistake\u00a0on\u00a0the Lake&apos;.&quot;            Reading on mobile? Watch here The impulse to make music began in\u00a0rage and isolation. In\u00a01972, Morton formed the eels with guitarist Brian McMahon and singer Dave E MacManus: among their inspirations were Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, early Alice Cooper, the Kinks, and Fleetwood Mac&apos;s Then Play On. &quot;We thought we were going to be extremely popular,&quot; Morton says. &quot;Dave and I really worked on it immensely and with strident purpose. We\u00a0were really taken aback when we\u00a0weren&apos;t popular.&quot; There were two other big influences on the new Cleveland groups, which would shortly include the Mirrors and Rocket from the Tombs, the precursor to Pere Ubu. The Velvet Underground had played several times at La Cave on Euclid Avenue and, even more to the point, there was the strange figure of Ghoulardi, the late-night television presenter who for three years, between 1963 and 1966, wove a strange spell over a generation. Ghoulardi, who hosted horror and sci-fi movies on WJW-TV, was really a man called Ernie Anderson, who pitched the character as a beatnik-style hipster: with slogans such as &quot;stay sick&quot; and &quot;turn blue&quot;, he turned his absurdist humour on the city itself. &quot;He used to blurt out, &apos;PARMA!!!!&apos; and said everyone from Parma \u2013 the very worst west-side suburb of Cle \u2013 wears white socks and eats Cheez Whiz, which was pretty much spot on. The mayor of Parma tried to have Ghoulardi sanctioned, to no avail. It just made him way more popular.&quot; Along with this surreal humour, the Cle groups were influenced by industry. Morton remembers with fondness &quot;the steel mills at night. The 2am sky orangey-blue from a blast furnace with requisite sulphur smell.&quot; Pere Ubu&apos;s David Thomas felt the same, telling me\u00a0in 1990: &quot;The steel mills were fascinating, they turned the sky different colours and made wonderful sounds. There&apos;s a wonderful geometry, and you\u00a0could appreciate them the way you&apos;d go to an art museum and look at\u00a0sculpture.&quot; In her memoir of this period, Those Were Different Times, Charlotte Pressler enumerated the disadvantages faced by this generation of musicians as they groped their way towards a truly 70s rock style. There was no &quot;already evolved, recognised &apos;New Wave&apos; style \u2026 for new bands to aim at. The task of this group was different: to\u00a0evolve the style itself, while at the same time struggling to find in themselves the authority and confidence to play it. And they had to do this in a total vacuum.&quot; Pressler felt the eels represented &quot;something new, a cultivation of the potential for physical violence&quot;. Morton, in particular, would go out of his way to\u00a0provoke a confrontation, in one infamous incident dancing in a blue-collar bar with Brian MacMahon: &quot;We weren&apos;t necessarily a homosexual couple either in fact or in theory,&quot; he told Alex Simon of Ugly Things magazine, &quot;just two males dancing with each other in order to mindfuck the drunken lumpen prole patrons.&quot;            The eels disliked all their contemporaries and fought with each other but, most of all, they channelled their anger into their music, much of which, four decades on, still sounds like nothing else. The 40 or so songs that comprise the eels repertoire are confrontational in sound (trebly, distorted, skronky to the max) and in lyric: frequently obnoxious and offensive but often hilarious \u2013 Accident, for example, is\u00a0told from the\u00a0standpoint of a car crash victim. This extremity wasn&apos;t just the province of the eels. There&apos;s a live version, taped in June 1975, of Rocket From the Tombs performing 30 Seconds Over Tokyo, which would become a signature song for Pere Ubu (just as the same group&apos;s Sonic Reducer would become the calling card of the Dead Boys, the other band formed from the ruins of RFTT). It&apos;s an astonishing, seven-minute evocation of a &quot;suicide ride&quot; \u2013 with a prophetic lyric, &quot;ahead the dim blur of an alien land, time to give ourselves into strange gods&apos; hands&quot; \u2013 and a dive-bombing metal riff that accelerates until the tape cuts dead. Pere Ubu, though, did not regard themselves as punk. When they recut 30 Seconds Over Tokyo they backed it with a killer original \u2013 based around a loping beat by new drummer Scott Krauss \u2013 called Heart of Darkness. In December 1975, Jane Scott interviewed them for the Cleveland Plain Dealer: &quot;We&apos;re putting out the hits of the next psychedelic era,&quot; said Thomas, still known at that point as Crocus Behemoth. &quot;We&apos;re pointing towards the music of the 80s,&quot; said guitarist Peter Laughner. Time proved their prophecies correct. Just as Ubu were taking off, the eels were no more. They had always teetered on the edge of a furious abjection and, in the end, the violence was directed against themselves. Morton&apos;s next project was the conceptual group, Johnny and the Dicks, who released not music but a package made up largely of drawings of penises: &quot;Dicks make visual art accessible,&quot; they promised. Morton returned to music with X___X: the underlined line open to whatever he felt like placing there. X___X released two singles in 1979 and 1980, one of which appears on the Soul Jazz comp. But in 1979, Morton quit the group and relocated to the east coast, where he still lives: &quot;I felt I would die in Cle. It was so anti-John Morton.&quot; It has taken time, but Morton has come to realise, somewhat to his surprise, &quot;that I had a consistent sound. I was actually a competent musician. I had been, but I didn&apos;t realise it. I have, as\u00a0a\u00a0musician, always sounded like I\u00a0wanted. I feel grateful for that. I used to go into DiFiore&apos;s Music and hear the punks \u2013 not the &apos;good&apos; kind of punks \u2013 actually playing Stairway to Heaven. Why would I want to play something somebody else played?&quot; Punk 45: Kill the Hippies! Kill Yourself! is out now on Soul Jazz.

The move was immediately criticised as &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;unambitious&quot; by developing countries and climate groups at the talks. In a statement, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), a group of 44 low-lying island and coastal nations that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, said: &quot;[We] are extremely concerned that the announcement represents a huge step backwards in the global effort to hold warming below the essential 1.5-2 degrees celsius threshold, and puts our populations at great risk. &quot;This is neither the time nor the place to be backtracking on commitments.

He was still hopeful that the UK and other members of the G8 leading economies could encourage Tokyo to change its mind. &quot;It is deeply disappointing that the Japanese government has taken this decision to significantly revise down its 2020 emissions target. This announcement runs counter to the broader political commitment to tackle climate change, recently reaffirmed by G8, as well as the enhanced ambition we have seen from the world&apos;s major emitters,&quot; he argued in unusually robust terms. &quot;Yet I believe we can persuade Japan to change her mind again, to resume her leadership role in the world on climate change. Despite the challenges, if the public backs the government it can invest in low carbon electricity,&quot; he added. However, Christiana Figueres, UNFCCC exective secretary, said she &quot;understood&quot; the problems that Japan faced following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which had forced the country to close 50 nuclear power plants. &quot;I do have some understanding that Japan has been hit by several catstrophes in the past few years. My hope is that Japan understands that investment in renewable energies galvanises investments and creates new jobs,&quot; Figueres said. &quot;This move by Japan could have a devastating impact on the tone of discussion here in Warsaw,&quot; said Naoyuki Yamagishi, WWF Japan&apos;s climate ands enrgy group leader at the talks. &quot;This decision is a gross negligence of its responsibility and should be revised in line with the level that science and justice requires.&quot; As compensation, Japan said that its public and private sectors intended to raise $16bn (\u00a39.9bn) by 2015 to help developing countries reduce their emissions, with the intention of helping others to reduce the emissions that it could not. The aid package is thought to include supplying developing countries with &quot;green&quot; technologies developed by Japanese firms, including offshore wind turbines, fuel-cell vehicles and high-tech housing insulation. No figures were given on the scale of the emission cuts that the package might achieve. &quot;The new target is based on zero nuclear power in the future. We have to lower our ambition level,&quot; said Hiroshi Minami, Japan&apos;s chief negotiator. The talks in Poland, at which 190 countries are meeting to try to agree additional action to put the world on course to avoid dangerous climate change, have been overshadowed by typhoon Haiyan, which has increased the determination of developing countries to negotiate compensation for climate damage done in the past. The Japanese announcement follows open criticism by Australia and Canada of policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in their countries, and reluctance from the US and Europe to aim for more ambitious emissions cuts. Oxfam&apos;s climate change spokesperson, Kelly Dent, said: &quot;Japan&apos;s dramatic U-turn on its emissions target commitments is a slap in the face for poor countries who are right now struggling to cope with changes to their climate, and who will face yet more extreme and unpredictable weather in the future.&quot; She added: &quot;As one of the world&apos;s largest Co2 emitters, Japan has a responsibility to help lead the world in reducing emissions to ensure temperatures are kept at a safe level below 1.5 degrees celsius. Instead, their actions may well further erode trust in current negotiations which must deliver a global climate deal in 2015.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The town&apos;s mayor, Futoshi Toba, whose wife, Kumi, died in the tsunami, has been a vocal critic of the red tape and inaction by politicians in Tokyo.", "Additional reporting by Justin McCurry in Tokyo and Adam Gabbatt in New York"], "tags": ["Typhoon Haiyan", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Haiti", "Americas", "Fukushima", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment", "Climate change", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-15T19:04:44Z", "title": "Typhoon Haiyan \u2013 how do you rebuild after such destruction?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/15/typhoon-haiyan-how-rebuild-philippines", "article": "First things first: there are people to rescue, mouths to feed. Medical supplies to distribute, bodies to bury, law and order to reinstate. But what next? When the immediate threat from Typhoon Haiyan has passed and the rains have stopped, when the suddenly homeless of Tacloban take stock and regard the obliterated ruins of their city, where do you start? How do you rebuild a city? There is no shortage of recent precedents: Port-au-Prince following the 2010 earthquake, the towns of northeastern Japan following Fukushima a year later. The tsunami cities of southeast Asia, New York after Hurricane Sandy, New Orleans. But the lessons are\u00a0sobering. There is no quick fix. Clear up Storms make a mess. After the 2010 quake in Haiti, there were 19m cubic metres of debris in Port-au-Prince, a\u00a0quantity that could have filled a\u00a0line of containers all the way from London to Beirut. The 2011 Fukushima tsunami created 25m tonnes of rubble and wreckage. The first daunting task: what\u00a0to do with it all? The Japanese authorities were praised\u00a0for quickly clearing destroyed coastal towns like Rikuzentakata. These days, neat piles of debris and rubbish stand on the outskirts of levelled towns that the passage of time has turned into empty fields overgrown with grass and weeds. The waves themselves did their bit, too: as much as one fifth of the wreckage was washed out to sea. Some of it even turned up on the other side of\u00a0the Pacific. In Port-au-Prince, international agencies such as the UN and USAid financed removal programmes with excavation equipment, as well as on a\u00a0smaller scale, with neighbourhood teams working on specific plot of lands. But it&apos;s not a process that is done overnight. Just clearing Tacloban of the ruins will take months. Experts say that the first priority is to clear roads and other transport connections. Access to all places is crucial. And not everything should be thrown away. Some of the wreckage will be reusable.     Wrecked \u2026 communities along the Fukushima coast in Japan are still debating whether to rebuild inland. Photograph: Kimimasa Mayama/EPA    Plan Following a survey of the disaster-hit buildings, there needs to be a reconstruction strategy. Perhaps the first question is this: are you going to just revive the city on the devastated site? After the 2004 tsunami, for example, the Sri Lankan authorities considered relocating the city of Galle inland. &quot;The government had thought of a\u00a0buffer zone along the coast of about 200 metres,&quot; says Jan Meeuwissen of UN-Habitat, who worked in the region after the tsunami, &quot;but you can&apos;t move a\u00a0city inland that easily.&quot; The plans were shelved. Galle was restored on its original site. But Meeuwissen adds: &quot;You can&apos;t say that in general you can build specifically where a city was before. Sometimes it&apos;s not relevant to build back in the same place if the place is prone to floods, or on a slope that would expose it to other risks.&quot; In Japan, communities along the wrecked Fukushima coast are still debating whether to rebuild inland, which would require levelling mountains to free up land for housing, or construction of huge and expensive, sea walls to keep out any future tsunami. In Banda Aceh, decimated by the 2004 tsunami, some of the 140,000 houses rebuilt were done so on higher ground. New Orleans, unfortunately, is not so moveable. So ever since the 2005 Katrina storm that killed 1,400 and flooded 80% of the city, much of the effort has focused on making the city more viable in the face of the perennial threat from the other side of the levees. &quot;The physical barriers that are in place are much more robust,&quot; said John J Kiefer, director of the University of New Orleans&apos; master of public administration program, who specialises in disaster research. &quot;The mechanisms to inspect those physical mechanisms such as the levies are now much more professional than they were.&quot;For the residents of Banda Aceh, there was a different imperative: ensuring that inhabitants would stand a chance if there was a repeat disaster. &quot;There are roads built to escape,&quot; said Satya Tripathi, former UN recovery coordinator for Aceh. &quot;Everytime an earthquake alert is set off, evacuation of the population is very orderly. A safe way out has become part of the living space.&quot; The realisation in the city was this: that in the face of a tsunami, the city cannot be saved. But people can.     Daunting \u2026 the 2010 quake in Haiti left 19m cubic metres of debris in Port-au-Prince. Photograph: Jorge Silva/REUTERS    Rebuild Some of the more resourceful survivors may to try to rebuild their homes immediately, or at least repair shelter temporarily. Yet unfortunately there are no quick fixes. Reconstruction is not just about the four walls of your own home; there is the wider social infrastructure \u2013 access to water and sanitation, electricity, supply chains, roads. Practitioners say it is crucial to &quot;build back better&quot;, to mitigate the impact of future disasters. Good governance is vital. If the authorities thought of the possible disaster scenarios in advance, they are more likely to achieve a better outcome in the face of a real one. The high density of urban areas can be problematic. &quot;In many urban situations the occupancy rates of multi-storey buildings are very high and there may be a high percentage of renters, as in Haiti,&quot; says Sandra D&apos;Urzo, shelter officer at the International Federation of Red Cross. &quot;The collapse of the building creates problems of ownership, access and temporary re-housing. Who owns the rubble? Who should remove it? What to do with slabs of concrete? Do renters move elsewhere and rent\u00a0again?&quot; Before reconstruction begins, the local authorities and the agencies need to assess the conditions of the buildings after a disaster. It is crucial to see which buildings can be repaired and which cannot, explained Robin Cross, CEO of\u00a0Article 25, a charity that works on reconstruction in disaster-hit areas and\u00a0has rebuilt schools in Haiti. After conducting assessments on around 20 buildings, Article 25 rebuilt nine. &quot;We are always trying to build back better so that buildings are more resistant and communities more resilient to the threats,&quot; Cross said. Authorities also usually decide about &quot;no-build&quot; areas, which will have an impact on the longer term solution they are seeking to find. But again, it&apos;s a slow process. Thousands of Japanese have still yet to be rehoused after Fukushima. In Haiti, there are still around 300,000 people living in temporary shelters. &quot;In all the recreation of urban space after a disaster there is a potential mistake: because people have immediate need for shelter, you establish post-disaster camps at the edge of a city,&quot; says Paul Knox-Clarke, head of research at the ALNAP international humanitarian group. &quot;The problem is that those settlements become permanent. Red tape     Perennial threat \u2026 New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images    Another problem is bureaucracy. In Japan, more than two years after the earthquake and tsunami hit, the Fukushima prefecture is still grappling with radiation cleanup and recovery. This week Japanese officials admitted that thousands may never be able to return home. Earlier this year, the mayor of Kamauchi, a town in the prefecture, told the Guardian that the village&apos;s future was in doubt and there had been considerable delays in cleanup. The main obstacle to swift reconstruction is not financial \u2013 the administration of Shinzo\u00af Abe has raised the reconstruction budget to 25tn yen over five years. It is red tape. Progress in\u00a0towns such as Rikuzentakata, where 1,800 people died out of a population of\u00a024,000, is being held up by Japan&apos;s infamous bureaucracy and disagreement among residents over where to rebuild their homes, schools, hospitals and businesses. About 5,000 of Rikuzentakata&apos;s survivors live in temporary housing units built on higher land, while others have moved to towns and cities inland. Construction of new residential areas began in April, more than two years after the disaster. The town&apos;s mayor, Futoshi Toba, whose wife, Kumi, died in the tsunami, has been a vocal critic of the red tape and inaction by politicians in Tokyo. &quot;Reconstruction isn&apos;t going well at all,&quot; Toba said earlier this year. &quot;We are still surrounded by mountains of rubble, and the few buildings that survived the tsunami have been left standing. The survivors share my view that there is little hope for the future.&quot; Toba added: &quot;I have come up against that vertical thinking time and again over the past two years. Politicians here say they stand with us, but their words are not being matched by actions.&quot; Communities Rebuilding a city is not just a physical process; it&apos;s also psychological. And that is why, according to Meeuwissen, it\u00a0is vital to include locals. &quot;They call it the people&apos;s process,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s extremely important to involve people affected by the disasters. Identifying what their needs are and involving them\u00a0in the reconstruction process. The\u00a0people who experienced a disaster have a capacity to build back: it is not just about physically rebuilding communities, but also rebuilding them\u00a0psychologically.&quot; Charities such as Article 25 agree, and talk to residents about what they want for their communities in the long run. John McAslan, the architect behind the refurbishment of King&apos;s Cross Station in London, has a special relationship with the city of Port-au-Prince. He had visited several times before the earthquake, and in 2010 worked to restore the city&apos;s Iron Market,\u00a0built in 1891. The market was\u00a0the heart of commercial life\u00a0in the\u00a0Haitian capital. The site had been damaged by a fire\u00a0in\u00a02008, and it collapsed after the 2010 quake, killing a number of people. For nine months, McAslan&apos;s practice worked with 700 local constructors \u2013 bricklayers, artisans and metalwork specialists \u2013 to bring the market back to\u00a0life. &quot;The Iron Market, along with the cathedral and the citadel, is a symbol of\u00a0the country, so it was incredibly important and more than just a building,&quot; McAslan said. The project was finished in January 2011, almost a\u00a0year after the quake. Statistics from the UN show that for the first time in history, there are more humans living in cities than in the countryside, and the rate is likely to\u00a0increase. With extreme weather becoming more common, issues of reconstruction after natural disasters are crucial for the future of cities and how they adapt. There is a perception that in Haiti it was not the earthquake that killed people, but the buildings. &quot;Building back better&quot; may become a\u00a0mantra for the 21st century.

The operation to remove more than 1,331 used fuel assemblies and 202 unused assemblies began on Monday and is expected to take just over a year. Decommissioning the entire site is expected to take at least 30 years. The plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], said the fuel removal was an important step in decommissioning the plant, which experienced multiple meltdowns and explosions after Japan&apos;s north-east coast was hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. Tepco brushed off fears that removing the rods from near the roof of reactor No 4 could cause a serious accident. Some experts have warned that a collision involving the fuel assemblies, a sudden loss of coolant water or another earthquake could cause a chain reaction and release huge quantities of radiation into the atmosphere. Reactor No4 was closed for routine maintenance at the time of the disaster and so did not suffer a meltdown. But a hydrogen explosion on 15 March 2011 blew the walls and roof off the reactor building, leaving it vulnerable to further damage from earthquakes. The utility has since reinforced the building with a huge steel canopy and insists the structure can withstand seismic events of the same intensity that shook the plant in March 2011. But it conceded that the fuel assemblies needed to be moved to a safer storage site as soon as possible. &quot;After the explosion, one big challenge was to deal with the spent fuel pool, because if the water evaporated it would cause a radioactive cloud stretching all the way to Tokyo, which would have to be evacuated,&quot; Yuichi Okamura, deputy manager of the water treatment department at Fukushima Daiichi, told the Guardian on Monday. &quot;It was a big challenge, so today is a big success for the cleanup teams.&quot; Yoshimi Hitosugi, a Tepco spokesman, said: &quot;This is an important moment. It is one big step towards decommissioning the reactor.&quot; He added that three fuel assemblies had been discovered that were damaged prior to the tsunami and measures were being taken to deal with them. Hitosugi said the firm was confident that the workers would be able to cope with any debris caused by the explosion that remained in the spent fuel pool, adding that it would not compromise the fuel removal operation. Tepco&apos;s president, Naomi Hirose, said the fuel extraction &quot;represents the beginning of a new and important chapter in our work&quot;, and thanked plant workers for the &quot;ingenuity, diligence, and courage that made this achievement possible&quot;. The utility believes that a specially chosen team of 36 men will need until late 2014 to remove all of the fuel assemblies from the pool, located 130 feet above ground, and place them in submerged protective casks. The casks will then be taken to ground level and transported to a more stable storage pool nearby. Each cask can hold up 22 assemblies comprising between 60 and 80 fuel rods. Workers will remove the fresh fuel assemblies first because they are easier to handle. &quot;The extraction work started at 3:18pm and the first fuel completed its extraction from the fuel rack to the cask placed inside the pool at 3:57pm as planned, following thorough safety preparations with the co-operation of many partner companies and individual workers,&quot; Tepco said in a statement. But antinuclear campaigners have voiced concern over Tepco&apos;s ability to complete the work without incident following revelations that up to 300 tonnes of radioactive water are leaking from the site into the sea every day. The utility also came under fire this summer for installing poorly designed tanks that leaked toxic water. &quot;We are concerned that Tepco may not be capable of conducting this risky operation safely, and that there are significant risks involved in this operation,&quot; said Kazue Suzuki, a nuclear campaigner with Greenpeace Japan. &quot;Tepco&apos;s inability to solve the problems with leaking tanks that store contaminated water, and the continued flow of contaminated water from the site to the ocean adds to our concerns about its ability to handle this dangerous operation to remove spent fuel. &quot;If Tepco makes mistakes again and can&apos;t handle this task, workers could be exposed to excessive levels of radiation and in a worst-case scenario there could be a massive new release of radiation to the atmosphere.&quot; The head of Japan&apos;s nuclear safety agency, Shunichi Tanaka, recently warned that removing the fuel involved huge risks, particularly if any attempt were made to force fuel assemblies that have become impeded by debris. &quot;The process involves a very large risk potential,&quot; he said. &quot;In a sense, it is more risky than the radioactive water crisis.&quot; According to Tepco, the specially designed handling equipment has inbuilt mechanisms to prevent the fuel from being accidentally dropped, and that even breakages in a small number of fuel assemblies would not pose a risk to areas around the plant. Local authorities in Fukushima will send emergency notifications to residents via mobile phones and other devices in the event of an accident. Even if the fuel removal ends without a hitch, Tepco faces the even more difficult task of locating and removing melted fuel from deep inside the three reactors that suffered meltdown. Radiation levels inside those reactors are still too high for humans to enter, and the technology has yet to be developed to carry out the unprecedented operation. As a result, Tepco says it will not be able to begin removing melted fuel from those reactors until 2020 at the earliest."}, {"sentences": ["However, according to a report in the Tokyo Times, it only cleans book covers and not the individual pages."], "tags": ["Fifty Shades of Grey", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Libraries", "Pharmacy and pharmacology", "Education", "Higher education", "Belgium", "Europe", "World news", "EL James"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-18T14:08:27Z", "title": "Fifty Shades of Grey goes viral \u2013 literally", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/18/fifty-shades-of-grey-viral-library-herpes", "article": "Library copies of Fifty Shades of Grey have reported positive for traces of herpes virus and cocaine, according to two Belgian professors. A second novel, Tango \u2013 a romance by Pieter Aspe \u2013 also tested positive for herpes, after tests were run on the most popular books on the shelves of Antwerp library. The study was carried out by researchers at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, who ran chemical tests on the 10 most-borrowed books at the library. All 10 tested positive for traces of cocaine. Jan Tytgat, a professor of toxicology at the Catholic University of Leuven, told website the Flanders News that the traces both of herpes and of cocaine were too small to be harmful to future readers of the book. &quot;The levels found won&apos;t have a pharmacological effect. Your consciousness or behaviour won&apos;t change as a result of reading the tomes,&quot; Tytfat said. It is isn&apos;t the first time academics have tested the hygiene of books. Students at Brigram Young University, Utah, found that books categorised by their university library as in high demand averaged 25-40% more microbial life than neglected volumes .

An earlier study, Are public library books contaminated by bacteria? published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, concluded that library books posed no risks. Authors Itzhak Brook and Sara J Brook concluded: &quot;The microbial flora on the surfaces of 15 books obtained from a public library and from 15 books obtained from a family household were studied. Staphylococcus epidermidis was recovered from four of the library books and three of the family household books. The number of organisms per page was between one to four. This data illustrates the safety of using library books, as they do not serve as a potential source of transmission of virulent bacteria.&quot; Hygeine-conscious libraries in Japan are taking no chances, however, installing Bacteria Elimination Boxes to kill off any harmful microbes. The box uses UV rays to kill off bacteria, and is said by its manufacturers, the Kiraha Corporation, to be effective against Yellow Staphylococcus and E Coli, and also against the influenza virus.

His rise to fame was swift and inexorable; by the early 1990s he was reportedly more recognisable to US children than Mickey Mouse. But there was always something disconcerting about video gaming's poster boy being a poster man, complete with pot belly and hectic facial hair, a strange choice for a medium founded on principles of youth and playfulness. \nBut watch carefully and you notice that this mildly sinister-looking man in his 40s runs and jumps with the freewheeling abandon of innocence, demonstrating a childlike glee as holds his arms out while pretending to be an aeroplane, leaps off buildings with a triumphant \"yahoo\" or dresses up in a bee costume. As the average game player enters their 30s and 40s, who better to represent the reviving power of playfulness in the stern face of advancing age? Mario is a man who never forgot the importance of play, capturing the spirit of Peter Pan's eternal youth, if not his fresh face \u2013 and we are invited to do the same through his games as they echo onwards through time. \nMario also reflects the character of his maker, 61-year-old Shigeru Miyamoto, arguably the most consistently brilliant game designer in the world. In his role as director of Super Mario 3D World, Miyamoto demonstrates a freshness and generosity of imagination that few other mainstream games makers come close to rivalling. The Super Mario lineage may be 30 years old, but its latest iteration is as spritely as its best. Nintendo EAD, the game's closeted, Tokyo-based crack team of inventors may have retreated from the buckshot heavens once explored in the Wii's Super Mario Galaxy titles, settling once again on terra firma (even if, predictably enough, it's often covered in ice or lava) \u2013 but what a world. \n \n  \n  \n  Super Mario 3D World: claws for thought \n  \n \nThe game, which is set within the Sprixie Kingdom, is broken into seven main worlds, each subdivided into a number of discrete levels. The structure allows the designers to play with ideas in a way the grim, cinema-aping blockbuster games, which must squeeze their game design ideas into tight narratives, cannot. Mario's verbs of play may remain consistent throughout \u2013 run, jump, pound, clamber \u2013but each level is presented as a rounded idea that can stand alone, a vignette-like five-minute journey around a single idea, or a set of juxtaposing ones. Nintendo EAD's mastery can be seen in the seeming ease with which the team introduces brilliant ideas, often as one-offs, never to be reprised. \nThere are the levels in which your character \u2013 chosen between Mario, his brother Luigi, frequent damsel-in-distress Princess Peach or her dutiful attendant Toad (with another unlocked during the glorious post-ending world) \u2013 is cloned and you control two, three, four and even more versions of your character as they chaotically navigate the level's pipes and platforms in unison. There's the level in which you dress as a Goomba, and stealthily creep past the other unsuspecting mushroom-like foes, or the one in which you role-play as a cannon, spitting bullets back at antagonist Bowser's minions. There's the time you hop into a giant ice-skate, and trace lines in the ice as you try to send a skating rival off the edge of the precipice. And there's the cat costume, ostensibly 3D World's grand invention, which adds to Mario's increasingly fetishist wardrobe, allowing its wearer to temporarily climb walls and swipe at enemies with sharpened claws. \nThese are the game's standout inventions, but this is a game filled with playful touches, many of which have no real bearing on play. Play with friends (there's drop-in drop-out multiplayer for up to four players) and, at the end of each stage, the player who won the most points during the stage is given a crown to wear. This offers no discernable bonus other giving its bearer a sense of aesthetic dominance. But preening victory can be short-lived: other players can knock the crown from their rival's head and wear it themselves. On the world map, the hub whose layout nods towards 1990's Super Mario World, you can move freely around the landscape before choosing which stage you wish to tackle next. The environment offers a clutch of bonuses: extra lives and coins found amongst the tall grass and houses and casinos full of item-spewing distractions. \n \n  \n  \n  Super Mario 3D World: high spirits \n  \n \nEnemies also delight. One, the long-necked Conkdor bird, attacks by slamming its beak downwards. If it misses you and hits the ground, the sunglasses it is wearing will fall from its nose. Mini-Goombas can be whisked through the level by blowing into the Wii-U controller's microphone. Occasionally the level designers leave a baseball lying around, for absent-minded kicking. The flippant playfulness on display equals the cast iron level design that underpins every moment of this coherent masterpiece. \nThe game is a technical marvel too, revealing the surprising power of the Wii U system (launched earlier this year ahead of the Christmas battle between Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One), running in full HD at 60 frames per second, a technical claim few of the rival manufacturer's launch titles are able to make. Complete a stage and your \"ghost\" (a translucent version of your Mii character that recreates your every move) is uploaded to the cloud, ready to be downloaded without fuss into someone else's game for them to compete against. Each stage has a hidden \"stamp\" to find, which can then be used to illustrate notes and messages, which can be pinned to levels for other players to read. Nintendo makes these touches appear effortless, but their deft execution is the result of generations of design experience. \nEach of the game's worlds is bookended with a face-off against a larger boss character, and these missions can only be unlocked when you've collected the requisite number of green stars. Each stage contains three of these stars, hidden about the level's furniture. It's a somewhat antiquated design decision (strange to tie a player's progression to the number of optional collectibles they've found) but this is the only questionable (if workable) decision in a game defined by masterly choices. \n \n  \n  \n  Super Mario 3D World: biting humour \n  \n \nTo some, Super Mario may appear tired: a mascot whom Nintendo trots out every few years to sell another console with repackaged but fundamentally stale ideas. Super Mario 3D World is a fierce rebuttal to the accusation. Mario and his makers once again assert their dominance of spatial navigation games, displaying a rude abundance of ideas to delight, surprise and celebrate innocence and playfulness."}, {"sentences": ["Speaking at his Tokyo corporate headquarters , Naomi Hirose, president of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), which runs the stricken Fukushima plant, said Britain&apos;s nuclear managers &quot;should be prepared for the worst&quot; in order to avoid repeating Japan&apos;s traumatic experience.", "Tepco&apos;s Fukushima Daiichi facility on the coast about 124 miles (200km) north-east of Tokyo, comprising six nuclear reactors, was hit by a giant tsunami with waves peaking at 17 metres high caused by the Great East Japan earthquake on 11 March 2011."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "World news", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment", "EDF Energy", "Business", "UK news", "Politics", "Green politics"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-19T18:10:54Z", "title": "Fukushima nuclear disaster is warning to the world, says power company boss", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/19/uk-government-new-plant-fukushima-nuclear-disaster-warning", "article": "The catastrophic triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in March 2011 was &quot;a warning to the world&quot; about the hazards of nuclear power and contained lessons for the British government as it plans a new generation of nuclear power stations, the man with overall responsibility for the operation in Japan has told the Guardian.

The other side is the people who listen and for them it is easy to hear OK, it&apos;s safe, sure, why not? &quot;But we have to explain, no matter how small a possibility, what if this [safety] barrier is broken? We have to prepare a plan if something happens \u2026 It is easy to say this is almost perfect so we don&apos;t have to worry about it. But we have to keep thinking: what if \u2026&quot; British ministers recently agreed a commercial deal with the French state-owned energy company EDF Energy to build the UK&apos;s first new nuclear reactor in a generation at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The agreement included the UK government providing accident insurance. Tepco&apos;s Fukushima Daiichi facility on the coast about 124 miles (200km) north-east of Tokyo, comprising six nuclear reactors, was hit by a giant tsunami with waves peaking at 17 metres high caused by the Great East Japan earthquake on 11 March 2011. In what quickly became one of the world&apos;s worst nuclear disasters, operators lost control of the plant when the power supply, including emergency back-up, failed amid massive flooding. As cooling systems malfunctioned, reactors 1, 2 and 3 suffered meltdowns. Reactor 4 was closed for routine maintenance at the time. But one of several hydrogen explosions blew the walls and roof off the reactor building. This week a delicate and lengthy operation to remove fuel rods from that reactor began. Radiation leakage following the explosions forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the surrounding area. An exclusion zone roughly 11 miles by 19 miles remains in force around the plant two and half years later. The entire facility is now being decommissioned, but Tepco&apos;s clean-up, which has been strongly criticised by environmentalists, is expected to take up to 40 years. Hirose said that although the situation facing Fukushima Daiichi on 11 March was exceptional, measures could have been adopted in advance that might have mitigated the impact of the disaster. Tepco was at fault for failing to take these steps, he said. &quot;After I became president [in 2012], we formed a nuclear safety review committee. We focused mainly on what we could do, what we could learn. We had a lot of data by then. Three other reports, one from the Diet [Japan&apos;s parliament], one from government. We had a lot of information. Tepco&apos;s own report, too. We concluded that we should have avoided that catastrophic accident, and we could have. We could see what we should have done.&quot; Preventative measures included fitting waterproof seals on all the doors in the reactor building, or placing an electricity-generating turbine on the facility&apos;s roof, where the water might not have reached it. In addition, wrong assumptions were made, he said. &quot;I don&apos;t know if I could have seen or thought this before the accident \u2026 Probably I assumed that people had discussed counter-measures to avoid a huge tsunami by something very special like a complete shutdown.&quot; It transpired that the huge cost and technical complexity of a multiple shutdown, in what was considered the unlikely event of an abnormally large tsunami, had led managers to discount such a scenario as implausible and inefficient, he said. &quot;What happened at Fukushima was, yes, a warning to the world,&quot; he said. The resulting lesson was clear: &quot;Try to examine all the possibilities, no matter how small they are, and don&apos;t think any single counter-measure is foolproof. Think about all different kinds of small counter-measures, not just one big solution. There&apos;s not one single answer. &quot;We made a lot of excuses to ourselves \u2026 Looking back, seals on the doors, one little thing, could have saved everything.&quot; Tepco was willing to share its experience with British and other nuclear plant operators if they wished, Hirose said. &quot;We can share all the information, all the data we obtained, that we learned from this accident, and then hope that people will use the data and information to prevent the same thing happening.&quot; Hirose confirmed that his company has paid a large price for the disaster. It planned to &quot;streamline&quot; the business and shed hundreds of jobs through voluntary retirement to keep itself in business. &quot;We have a huge debt for the compensation for damages and losses and for decommissioning \u2026 We have to be sustainable as a going concern.&quot; Concerned that Tepco may be unable to cope and responding to criticism that the company has bungled parts of the clean-up operation, Japan&apos;s government has agreed to spend 47bn yen (\u00a3292m) on dealing with hundreds of static tanks to store radiated water at the plant. It is also considering paying part of the cost to decommission Fukushima&apos;s damaged nuclear reactors. Tepco will reportedly seek 500bn yen (\u00a33.1bn) in bank loans by the end of the year to help keep itself afloat. Asked about the severe domestic and international criticism that followed the discovery in July of leaks from some of the tanks storing contaminated water, Hirose said the problem stemmed from a &quot;simple mistake&quot; in managing the tanks. Since the discovery, the monitoring system had been changed and new welded tanks installed, instead of the old bolted together versions. Hirose said he could not state categorically that all leakage of contaminated groundwater into the sea had ceased, but the outflow was much reduced. &quot;Probably there is some leakage. It is very difficult to say where it comes from and how much it is, but the harbour [radioactivity] level does not go down, so that means there is some leakage \u2026 We are trying to stop it.&quot; Hirose said he felt deeply sorry for the estimated 150,000 local residents who have been forced to leave their homes due to potentially harmful radiation levels, and may in some cases never be able to return. &quot;I have visited Fukushima many times, met the evacuees, the fishing union, the farmers, many people whose businesses have been damaged very much. I feel very sorry for them. We have to compensate them fully for the damage we caused by our accident.&quot; Tepco was investing in the area and creating jobs by building a new thermal power plant. But he acknowledged reconstruction and rebuilding would take many years. After the Fukushima catastrophe, the UK&apos;s Office for Nuclear Regulation conducted a safety review and its chief inspector, Mike Weightman, concluded there were &quot;no fundamental safety weaknesses&quot; in UK nuclear plants. He said: &quot;We already require protection of nuclear sites against the worst-case scenarios that are predictable for the UK.&quot; But his report found 38 areas for improvement including risks associated with flooding and the state of preparedness for emergencies. In 2012, documents released under freedom of information rules showed that all eight coastal nuclear locations in the UK, including Hinkley Point, were at risk of flooding and coastal erosion, which would worsen with climate change. EDF Energy said it was confident its UK sites were adequately protected against storms and floods. &quot;Without these arrangements in place the regulator would have the authority to close us down,&quot; said an EDF spokeswoman. Hirose said that although there are currently no nuclear powerplants operating in Japan, nuclear power had a future in the country. Popular former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi called last week for Japan to abandon nuclear power altogether, saying it was demonstrably dangerous. The best course for Japan and other developed countries was energy diversification, Hirose said, combining nuclear power with other forms of generation, including oil, gas and renewables.

Briar Hill, whose trainer Willie Mullins has started the Irish season in similarly dominant form, was the 25-1 outsider of his trainer&apos;s three runners in the Champion Bumper but produced a commanding performance to win by seven lengths. He was at the other end of the betting for the maiden hurdle which opened Tuesday&apos;s card at Wexford, setting off as the 1-9 favourite, and duly outclassed his field, easing clear from four furlongs out to beat Molly Connors by 11 lengths. &quot;Wexford is not a track that would suit his strengths but I&apos;m delighted he won,&quot; Walsh said. &quot;He jumped super and travelled very well. I didn&apos;t feel like he was going that quick, but that could be down to his class [as] he&apos;s a Grade One Cheltenham Festival winner.&quot; Mullins suggested that the Grade One Royal Bond Novice Hurdle at Fairyhouse on 1 December may come too soon for Briar Hill, and the Navan Novice Hurdle on 15 December may be the five-year-old&apos;s next start. Most bookmakers left him unchanged at around 12-1 for the Supreme Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham in March. Walsh later finished only third on Mullins&apos;s Royal Moll, the favourite for a mares&apos; novice hurdle, but he has two fancied rides \u2013 Devils Bride and Rough Justice \u2013 for Ireland&apos;s champion trainer at Fairyhouse on Wednesday, in the 12.45 and 2.15 respectively. Following Briar Hill&apos;s easy success, Mullins has saddled 18 from 43 runners over the past 14 days as he prepares for what could prove to be one of the most important and rewarding weekends of his career. Mullins has two of the seven entries for the Grade Two Coral Hurdle at Ascot on Saturday, including Annie Power, the winner of all seven of her starts last season highlighted by a Grade One novice hurdle at Fairyhouse in March. Potential opponents for Annie Power include Zarkandar, whose only defeat last year came behind Hurricane Fly in the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham, and Melodic Rendezvous, the recent winner of the Elite Hurdle at Wincanton. Mullins has also entered Prince De Beauchene for the Grade One Betfair Chase at Haydock, while on Sunday the yard will hope to pick up a first prize of around \u00a32m when Simenon lines up for the Japan Cup in Tokyo, roughly five times the amount which the stable earned when Hedgehunter won the 2005 Grand National. Sue Smith, who took the latest running of the National at Aintree in April with the 66-1 chance Auroras Encore, has withdrawn her appeal against a \u00a33,000 fine imposed by the stewards at Southwell on 11 November over the running and riding of Emral Silk in a novice hurdle. Jonathan England, Emral Silk&apos;s jockey, has also withdrawn his appeal against an 18-day riding ban for the same offence, while Emral Silk is banned from racing for 40 days from 11 November and will not be free to compete until 24 December. The British Horseracing Authority&apos;s inquiry into Gerard Butler&apos;s use of the drug Sungate, which contains the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol, on nine horses at his yard in Newmarket concluded on Tuesday.

In 1950, the Motor City had 1.8 million residents, but by the last census, in 2010, that had fallen to 700,000. So much of the city is unoccupied that swathes of the city are reverting to the wild, and becoming what is known as &quot;urban prairie&quot;. There are 70,000 empty buildings, including theatres, libraries and churches \u2013 even Michigan Central Station has been left deserted. What&apos;s more, nearly 40% of the inhabitants live in poverty. Almost half the street lights do not work and the city cannot even afford batteries for its parking meters. That&apos;s the background against which the city declared itself bankrupt (it is currently awaiting the outcome of the largest public bankruptcy in US history). Despite all that, the Detroit-born techno veteran and Transmat label boss, Derrick May, 50, remains optimistic about his hometownWhy do you think Detroit attracts so much attention from the press?You know why? Because people like to marvel as it falls down. It was sensationalised to begin with, but this isn&apos;t news for the city. Detroit has been bankrupt or broke or financially in strife since I was a kid. I can&apos;t tell you anything different because it&apos;s the truth. I don&apos;t remember the city never having financial problems or not being caught up in political corruption \u2013 it&apos;s always been that way. The sad part is that it doesn&apos;t reflect the people; the local community, these are hard-working, honest people. There was a time when if you spoke badly of the city, when I was in my early 20s, if you said, &quot;Detroit is a shit city, I cant stand this place, the people are stupid,&quot; somebody would punch you in the mouth, but it&apos;s different now.  Do you think the situation is worse than it&apos;s ever been?The McDonalds and Burger Kings are shutting \u2013 that&apos;s a sign of the times; it reflects the level of exodus of the community that was once there.  Why do you think this is happening?I think people have left because they want to have the opportunity to raise their children in a better environment and get a job or people just wanted to meet a nicer girl. For young people under 45 years old, they want to get out. I understand that.              Reading on mobile? Hear Derrick May&apos;s techno classic Strings of Life here Why you have stuck around when so many others have left? It&apos;s home. I stick around in Detroit because it&apos;s my home No 1. That&apos;s a bit patronising and patriotic and ridiculous \u2013 yes, of course it is \u2013 but it&apos;s cheap and I can create an environment where positive things can happen and I can help to re-establish a creative class. And also the fact that I can leave when I want, I can fly out of the city. Now, if you said: &apos;Derrick, you have two weeks to make a decision where you wanna live because the gates are gonna close on Detroit and you won&apos;t be able to ever leave again,&apos; that would change my view \u2013 I would probably move to Tokyo. Seriously I would. Because I don&apos;t have that kind of alternative, I plan to stick it out as long as I can. From Aaliyah and J Dilla, to Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson, a huge list of music stars come from Detroit. Why has there always been so much creative talent there?In the past, there was such a young, vibrant generation involved in the automotive industry \u2013 people were making $70,000 or $80,000 working on the line straight out of high school. All you got to do was work on the line when you&apos;re 19 years old and you got yourself a sweet Cadillac. All these things encouraged the creative juices. Black people in the community had the money to give their children the chance to think outside the box and based on that, it was a tribe. No other city in America produced such a community.  What about New Orleans?New Orleans was driven by poverty, there was no way out. In Detroit this wasn&apos;t a factor. Berry Gordy was a used car salesman, the guy wasn&apos;t poor, Diana Ross went to one of the best schools in the city. They were not uneducated people, they were not your typical hip-hop star, straight off the street from prison, these people had money.  You helped set up Movement, the first electronic music festival held in Detroit, which was praised for injected youthful energy into the city. Do you think other successful people give enough back?No. They haven&apos;t they given anything back. A lot of people back in the 60s and 70s called Berry Gordy a pimp \u2013 the reason they said this was because he created Motown, which became the most successful black independent record label, and I think for all that he did to help create Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jacksons, for all he did to make them icons, he never turned around and did a lot for the community. And I think he is just one example of that situation happening. You have to look at why he did it, why did he up and take his entire business to LA to make movies? He has nothing to do with Detroit, he puts no money in the city. Are you optimistic about the future of the city?Detroit is an original city and we have got to the point of no return. We&apos;ve hit the bottom of the bottom, now we&apos;re recreating ourselves, a whole new creative class, a whole new energy that will be instilled upon kids my young daughter&apos;s age. We will be talking about Detroit till the day we die. It will always be something magical. People ask how did you three guys [Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson] create techno, and why did you do it? How did three black guys from Detroit, Michigan, create this music, how did you do that? And what do you say?We say we have no fucking idea."}, {"sentences": ["Grave of the Fireflies      Seita tries to protect his young sister Setsuko as Tokyo is firebombed."], "tags": ["Animation", "Film", "World cinema", "Fairytales", "Books", "Film adaptations", "Brad Bird", "Ted Hughes", "The Beatles", "Marjane Satrapi", "Comics and graphic novels", "Aardman", "Mel Gibson", "Hayao Miyazaki", "Pixar", "Family", "Walt Disney Company", "Classical music", "The Iron Giant", "Persepolis"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-20T15:07:00Z", "title": "Top 10 animated movies", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/nov/20/top-10-animated-movies-films", "article": "   Tale of the Fox still    10. The Tale of the Fox A sneaky fox plays a series of underhand tricks on his neighbours in the animal kingdom, among them a timorous hare and a gullible wolf. The king of the beasts, a lion, summons him to face charges but the fox proceeds to outwit everyone, including the king himself. When Ladislas Starevich told this tale in the 1930s it was by no means new \u2013 versions of the Reynard story had been circulating around Europe for the best part of a millennium \u2013 but the means of telling it were utterly novel. Animated over 18 months from 1929 to 1930 (and premiering after a long delay in 1937, in Nazi Berlin), Starevich&apos;s beguiling film is often cited as the one of the earliest animated features ever made; it&apos;s certainly one of the first features composed of stop-motion animation. What&apos;s striking, eight decades on, is just how sophisticated it is. By 1930, Starevich had been directing stop-motion films for 20 years \u2013 he started out making short films using dead insects in what is now Lithuania; after the October revolution, he emigrated to France and continued making films there until the 1960s. The Tale of the Fox is a testament to his great skill as an animator: the anthropomorphised cast (an unscrupulous badger barrister, a courtier cat with eyes for the queen) are remarkably expressive and the film-making brims with invention. In the process of tricking the poor old wolf for the umpteenth time, the fox conjures up a gourmand&apos;s vision of heaven that recalls the imaginative flights of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s (whose neglected studio in Paris Starevich used after arriving in France). There are extended dream sequences and, at the climax, when the king has been exasperated into all-out military action, a comically protracted siege on the fox&apos;s lofty lair involving many pulleys and swinging logs. It&apos;s hard to imagine that Wes Anderson, in preparation for The Fantastic Mr Fox, didn&apos;t watch Starevich&apos;s film with an attentive eye, and pick up a trick or two in the process. Killian Fox 9. Grave of the Fireflies      Seita tries to protect his young sister Setsuko as Tokyo is firebombed.    Animation in Japan has a more adult and exalted status than in other parts of the world, in part because they&apos;ve used it to grapple with darker issues than the likes of Disney-Pixar dare touch: politics, metaphysics and of course the defining event of 20th century Japanese history \u2013 nuclear annihilation. Whereas the supernatural, end-of-days millenarianism of Akira (1988) was a slightly insane response to the insanity of instantly losing 200,000 citizens from two bombs, Isao Takahata&apos;s Grave of the Fireflies \u2013 released the same year as Akira \u2013 is something else entirely: a human response to how the war affected two perfectly average children.  The teenage Seita&apos;s mission to take care of his baby sister, Setsuko, in an old bomb shelter after their parents are killed is foolhardy and prideful \u2013 you can&apos;t help screaming &quot;Go back to your wicked aunt!&quot; as he ponders eating frogs to stay alive \u2013 but it is a kind of genuine heroism that is not reflected in the actions of the film&apos;s selfish grownups. Seita and Setusko watch as the rest of the country slows returns to normal; but their Robinson Crusoe adventure, though doomed, has a joyful purity that damns the hypocritical status quo.  Though Studio Ghibli&apos;s animation may be slightly dated now, it also shows how you can draw what you&apos;d struggle to capture on camera: maggots dropping from burn victims, yes, but also the physical details of a little girl&apos;s life \u2013 rocking from side to side to cope with separation from her mother, bravely conserving her three remaining fruit drops by eating only the sticky shards. It&apos;s pathos a four-year-old actor could never convey. You wouldn&apos;t think a film about child starvation would be so uplifting, or so beautiful. Chris Michael 8. The Iron Giant      QUALITY:2ND  GENERATION-- IRON GIANT-- FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT WARNER PRESS OFFICE ON 0171 437 5600 IRON GIANT 5    When the new Star Wars films were announced, there was a brief glimmer of excitement when Brad Bird&apos;s name was mooted. It&apos;s not hard to see why. While Mission: Impossible IV and The Incredibles showed that Bird could pull off style and kinetic set-pieces, 1999&apos;s The Iron Giant proved that he&apos;s also got the one thing that&apos;s been missing from Star Wars for over 30 years: colossal heart. A loose remake of Ted Hughes&apos;s tremendously sad modern fairy tale The Iron Man, The Iron Giant flopped on release. This, plainly, is absurd. The film has been called one of the best non-Disney animations ever made, and the assessment is still hard to argue with.  Hogarth, a young boy, discovers a giant metal robot that has fallen from space, its memory wiped. Hogarth goes about teaching him a uniquely childlike, wide-eyed ideology of the world. The giant learns about good and bad, about death. He becomes a kind of local folk hero, but falls afoul of the military. By the film&apos;s end, after Bird has forced Hughes&apos;s broader themes of courage and pacifism through his own retro-futurist prism, heartstrings will have been tugged and tears will have been fruitlessly fought back. A true hidden gem in all regards, The Iron Giant was perhaps a little ahead of its time. Five years after its release, Bird had corralled the might of Pixar into making The Incredibles; a flashier film that shares many of The Iron Giant&apos;s core messages. Had he held on for a few more years and given it the full CGI treatment, there&apos;s little doubt that The Iron Giant would have conquered all that stood in its way. Stuart Heritage 7. Yellow Submarine     Paul, John, Ringo and George performing in Pepperland in a scene from Yellow Submarine. Photograph: Apple Corps    Yellow Submarine was the fourth Beatles film in the space of four years and premiered in the summer of 1968, two years after the band quit touring in a hail of jelly babies (George Harrison&apos;s favourite candy, thrown by screaming fans). Seen in the light of the band&apos;s growing contempt for their publicity machine, this ambitious animation feature not only builds on the conceit of the the Fab Four&apos;s three previous films, in which they played versions of themselves as characters, it takes it to the logical extreme: not only are they not physically in it, they didn&apos;t even voice it. Following their landmark Sgt Pepper album, and pre-empting the Monkees&apos; equally surreal Head by several months, the Beatles somehow managed to smuggle the film&apos;s psychedelic aspects past the general public. Indeed, the film was quickly embraced by children, who responded to the simplicity of Lee Minoff&apos;s script, which seems remarkably rich considering he later claimed his only influences were repeated plays of the song Yellow Submarine itself and a meeting with Paul McCartney, in which the moptop expressed his hope that the film would contain &quot;a monster&quot;. Pitting the band against music-averse killjoys the Blue Meanies, who attack Pepperland and leave it in a state of frozen limbo, the film was directed by experimental Canadian animation producer George Dunning on a budget of just $1m. Dunning&apos;s masterstroke was to install Czech-German illustrator Heinz Edelmann as art director, and it is Edelmann&apos;s pop-art creations that stay in the mind, notably the Eleanor Rigby sequence with its bombed-out Liverpool streets and the abstract brainscapes of Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds. It says a lot about the band&apos;s careful curation of their own image that Yellow Submarine remains their favourite of their three feature films for United Artists. But it perhaps says more that the following year&apos;s Let It Be \u2013 the only film to capture the &quot;real&quot; Beatles, on the precipice of a break-up \u2013 is currently unavailable on DVD. Damon Wise 6. Persepolis     Persepolis is Iranian director Marjane Satrapi\u2019s adaptation of her graphic novel about growing up during Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic revolution. Photograph: c.Sony/Everett / Rex Features    French-Iranian graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi co-wrote and co-directed the film adaptation of her own Persepolis, based on her memories of growing up during the 1979 revolution. Her young on-screen counterpart, Marji, is a spunky, rebellious sprite who worships Bruce Lee, shoots the breeze with God and believes herself to be a prophet. Her family embraces the overthrow of the shah&apos;s regime, but Marji realises that Iran is not changing for the better. Like John Boorman&apos;s Hope and Glory, which offered the definitive child&apos;s-eye view of life during wartime, Persepolis honours its protagonist&apos;s trifling concerns. Even with the Iran-Iraq war escalating and missiles destroying the neighbourhood, Marji&apos;s prime concern is winning a game of &quot;My uncle has been in prison longer than your father&quot;, or scoring a copy of the new Iron Maiden album. Persepolis brings a lightness of touch to weighty topics, while the drawings capture precisely Marji&apos;s bewilderment at her rapidly changing world. When she visits her dissident uncle in a Gothic prison cell rendered in charcoal smudges, the soft, clear lines of her own body make it seem as if she&apos;s strayed into a more sinister comic book. At school, headscarves and veils transform Marji and her classmates into rows of Russian dolls, peeking timidly from behind each other&apos;s sloping shoulders.  The picture&apos;s back-to-basics visual flair remains wonderfully refreshing. The simple black lines, or the blocks of inky darkness inflected with white detail (such as the silhouetted gas masks with two lunar circles for eyes), are both plain and poetic. Satrapi and her co-director, Vincent Paronnaud, make a little go a long way: the dots of snow falling on a sooty Tehran landscape show that you don&apos;t need to be David Lean to conjure an evocative sense of place. There&apos;s something satisfying, too, about the use of tidy, monochromatic, near-minimalist animation to describe a subject as messy as modern Iran. Ryan Gilbey 5. Chicken Run      ROCKY & GINGER Film 'CHICKEN RUN' (2000) Directed By PETER LORD & NICK PARK 21 June 2000 CTE12503 Allstar/Cinetext/DREAMWORKS SKG **WARNING** This photograph can only be reproduced by publications in conjunction with the promotion of the above film. For Editorial Use Only Entertainment Orientation Landscape Group Shot Film Still Comedy Animation Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/DREAMWORKS SKG    Why did the British animators cross the road? To sign a multi-picture deal with Steven Spielberg. Having turned down a similar offer from Disney several years earlier, Aardman Animation, the stop-motion &quot;claymation&quot; studio from Bristol, teamed up with Spielberg&apos;s DreamWorks. &quot;It used to be that the best we could hope for \u2014 the very summit of our ambitions \u2014 was to do something like The Wombles or Paddington Bear,&quot; said Peter Lord, who co-directed Aardman&apos;s debut feature, Chicken Run, with Nick Park. The Aardman/DreamWorks marriage was dissolved after disappointing returns from subsequent collaborations Flushed Away and The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. But Chicken Run, the first out of the coop, was a hit. At the very moment that slick, spick-and-span computer animation was threatening to render old techniques obsolete, this movie went boldly against the grain by looking for all the world like it was all made in someone&apos;s back yard. It&apos;s essentially a PoW film with chickens rather than plucky British soldiers, rubbery beaks instead of stiff upper lips. It revolves around the efforts of Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha) and her fellow hens to escape Tweedy&apos;s Chicken Farm \u2014 a struggle that is given a boost by the arrival of Rocky the rooster (Mel Gibson), who has fled the circus and is recruited to teach the downtrodden hens to fly. Even in its most ambitious sequences, such as those involving a terrifying pie-making machine, into which chickens are dropped only to emerge at the other end ready for the supermarket shelves, the picture has the earthy, handmade feel consistent with Aardman&apos;s earliest shorts. You can feel the care that has gone into it. More than that, you can practically see the thumbprints. RG 4. Spirited Away     Film Spirited Away (2001)    Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki took his lead from Lewis Carroll to rustle up this delirious rites of passage tale about a small girl&apos;s adventures in a bath-house for the gods. One moment 10-year-old Chihiro is bored on the back seat, en-route to a new home. The next, it seems, her parents are pigs, she&apos;s forgotten her name and is being asked to scrub down a &quot;stink spirit&quot; that has booked an appointment. Somewhere up ahead sits a dragon and a witch. In a perfect world, more children&apos;s films would be like Spirited Away, which boasts a kind of dream logic, rustling up an outlandish universe which nonetheless runs to its own set of rules. Most film-makers install their supporting players as fixed representations of good and evil. Miyazaki, however, sends them bouncing like pinballs, troublesome and scary, so that the diffident &quot;No Face&quot; blooms into an all-consuming carnivore. Spirited Away has the same skittish, volatile rhythm. It&apos;s a magic spell, a booby trap, a helter-skelter to a happy ending. Xan Brooks 3. Up     Up    The economy, grace and restraint of Up&apos;s four-minute &quot;Married Life&quot; montage, at the very start of the film, may alone be one of animation&apos;s finest achievements. At the peak of their flawless streak in the mid-00s, Pixar dared to follow that up with the tender, energetic and boundlessly adventurous story of Carl Fredricksen and Russell, the unlikeliest pair of South American explorers. Up is sillier and more committed to spectacle than some other great animated films, but it&apos;s told with Pixar&apos;s famously rigorous storytelling, along with precise animation that brings it all \u2013 from perfectly cartoonish humans to dramatic vistas \u2013 to roaring life.  Up is a story that couldn&apos;t exist outside of animation, with a flying house and talking dogs, but even the most realistic moments prove the value of the medium; Carl&apos;s weary movements through his creaky house, the vibrant colors the balloons cast on the ground, the cliffs of South America made that much more crooked and wild by being drawn. The film walks a taut line between fantasy and reality, so that the canine fighter pilots feel as important and authentic as Carl&apos;s grief. The emotional climax comes as the house is perched at the top of Paradise Falls \u2013 the sacrifices and joys of marriage and age made powerfully literal.  Animation is still made in Hollywood almost exclusively for children, which means most big screen cartoons have similar numbing themes of self-acceptance and triumph. Up has that too, but slips in richer, deeper themes from its very start, as much an exploration of the life&apos;s disappointments and regrets as of the majestic Paradise Falls. Katey Rich 2. Fantasia     Fantasia. Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive    The popular view of Walt Disney is that he was a pragmatist; even the recent quasi-biopic Saving Mr Banks, released by his own company, shows the animation legend handing out pre-printed autographs at his theme park. Yet at the height of his popularity, Disney set out to make a high art concert movie \u2013 inspired by the abstract films of New Zealand artist Len Lye \u2013 that would take the Silly Symphonies series of the 1930s to a place where &quot;sheer fantasy unfolds&quot;. He knew the risks he was taking, telling the New York Times that &quot;if someone didn&apos;t break loose with new things, the movies wouldn&apos;t be where they are today\u2026 Somebody&apos;s got to be a damn fool.&quot; Even with today&apos;s resources the 1940 Fantasia is a remarkable undertaking, mixing the music of Bach, Tchaikovsky, Schubert and Beethoven with hand-drawn animation from his 700-strong team, using an innovative sound system \u2013 Fantasound \u2013 that would give the illusion of a full orchestra in the cinema. But Disney&apos;s plan was not for the music to accompany the images but the other way round, in perhaps the film&apos;s most extraordinary sequence we are invited to Meet The Soundtrack \u2013 literally, the film&apos;s white magnetic strip gets its own surreal solo as it responds to various instruments. This movement by movement approach made the studio&apos;s distributor, RKO, nervous, so Disney released the film in the roadshow fashion of the silent days, moving from city to city, which proved to be a costly mistake. Regular Disney fans didn&apos;t get the non-narrative aspect, and classical music experts hated its literal-mindedness. Over time, though, Disney&apos;s intent sank in; once known as his flop, it is now his high watermark. Indeed, its most famous section \u2013 Mickey Mouse in The Sorcerer&apos;s Apprentice \u2013 isn&apos;t simply a great piece of 20th century populist art, it is also the apotheosis of its creator&apos;s thinking: whoever would have expected Uncle Walt to bring Goethe to the masses? DW 1. Waltz With Bashir      Waltz with Bashir    This extraordinary, hallucinatory animation by Israeli film-maker Ari Folman is the story of what he sees as his nation&apos;s willed amnesia at the Sabra and Chatila massacres during the Lebanese civil war. The &quot;Bashir&quot; of the title is Lebanon&apos;s internationally admired Phalangist leader Bashir Gemayel who was engaged in a tricky diplomatic and strategic dance with Israel, appearing to connive at the Israelis&apos; invasion of his country in 1982 to help drive out the Syrians and the PLO. Gemayel was assassinated by pro-Syrian forces three months after Israel&apos;s invasion, but the killing was wrongly blamed on Palestinians. In the sinister atmosphere of fear, anger and revenge, Israeli troops helped close off the camps in Beirut&apos;s Sabra and Chatila districts to facilitate a horrendous retaliatory massacre by Lebanon&apos;s Christian militia: up to 3500 Palestinian civilians were slaughtered. Israel was not held directly culpable for this proxy bloodbath; its Kahan Commission accepted a partial or indirect guilt; and this, Folman suggests, is why the historical fact has never been entirely resolved or absorbed in the nation&apos;s collective consciousness, and is always threatening to break the surface of memory. It is evidently why he has chosen the medium of animation for the movie, digitally derived from live-action video \u2014 like the Rotoscoping techniques of Bob Sabiston. It is hyperreal and at the same time unreal: a bizarre dreamscape in which reality is morphed into something between two and three dimensions. Planes and surfaces stir and throb with colours harder, sharper, brighter than reality. It looks like one long hallucination, and therefore perfect for the trauma of Folman&apos;s recovered memories. This is his acid-trip down memory lane, and he might just have created Israel&apos;s very own Apocalypse Now. It starts with the director&apos;s appearance as himself: in middle age, having a beer with a guy who did military service in the Israel Defence Force with him. His friend tells him that he is plagued by a recurring dream about being pursued by savage dogs and says that he believes it has something do with the 1982 Lebanon war. The director himself realises that he has suppressed much of his memory of his own participation of these events. It is all a blur. So he sets out to track down his old comrades, to ask them what they remember, and so the animation surreally assumes something of oral history and psychoanalysis as well as personal drama. They tell him bizarre and horrifying episodes which pulse out onto the screen: sometimes it is not entirely clear if these episodes were real, or if they are the traumatised dreams which are, however, nonetheless telling the dreamer something important. And still the director does not know what he remembers about Sabra and Chatila or even if he himself was actually present. As his investigations proceed, he gets nearer and nearer to the truth, and the experience becomes more and more painful, and disorientating. Waltz With Bashir appeared in 2008, seven years after Richard Linklater&apos;s Waking Life, which employed a similar animation technique; it did not become widespread or popular, like the style of Pixar and Dreamworks in their golden decade of digital animation, and it did not become a personal signature, like the &quot;hand-drawn&quot; work of the Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki. But it is distinctive and compelling \u2014 and uniquely suited to a unique film.

The entire plant is being decommissioned, a clean-up they reckon could take 40 years. After a disaster of these proportions, when three reactors suffered meltdowns after being hit by a giant tsunami, nothing its operator does or says today is taken at face value in Japan. The ability of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) to handle the build-up of toxic water used to contain the melted cores is being questioned as never before, after a string of water and radiation leaks and one incident in which six men were doused with contaminated water. The embattled company faces plummeting morale, a shortage of skilled labour, insufficient funds \u2013 all exacerbated, according to some, by a refusal to accept outside help. For all this, it is worth reading what Naomi Hirose, Tepco&apos;s latest president, had to say in an interview with the Guardian. What happened at Fukushima, he said, was a lesson to the world: &quot;Try to examine all the possibilities no matter how small they are, and don&apos;t think any single counter-measure is foolproof.&quot; In hindsight, one tiny detail, such as waterproof seals on doors, would have saved everything. Is the unthinkable being thought as Britain plans for a new generation of reactors? Fukushima prompted the UK&apos;s Office for Nuclear Regulation to conduct a safety review in which Mike Weightman, its chief inspector, concluded there were no fundamental safety weaknesses, although his report identified 38 areas for improvement. Is the review, as the independent nuclear analyst John Large maintains, a whitewash? Would UK reactors, as he contends, not survive an hour without power? Documents released under freedom of information rules showed that all eight coastal nuclear locations in the UK, including Hinkley Point, were at risk of flooding and coastal erosion, which would worsen with climate change. The point here is not whether we need nuclear power. It is whether the nuclear industry in Britain is learning from disasters. Is it coming clean about all the risks associated with the venture? The pressure to produce the answer that confirms the consensus view is intense. Fukushima prompted Japan to close all 50 nuclear power plants. Little surprise that at the UN climate talks in Warsaw, Japan, which is the world&apos;s fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gas, slashed plans to reduce emissions from 25% to 3.8% on 2005 figures. Hiroshi Minami, Japan&apos;s chief negotiator, said that with no nuclear power, Japan has to lower its &quot;ambition level&quot; on greenhouse gases. In the short term, Japan is trapped, as are we all, in a vicious circle of greenhouse gas dependency and worsening climate change."}, {"sentences": ["We&apos;ve found the top 10 places for a cheap bite to eat Image eighth Park Hyatt, Tokyo, Japan Fancy a trip?"], "tags": ["Travel", "Hotels"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-22T17:46:00Z", "title": "How many of these famous world hotels do you know?

Rough Trade&apos;s co-president, Stephen Godfroy, is, however, bullishly optimistic about his new New York flagship store, having previously defied a plunging market with the 2007 launch of Rough Trade East on Brick Lane in east London. &quot;Rough Trade East was going against the grain,&quot; says Godfroy. &quot;It was based on instinct and feedback from the trade and public, not metrics.

There&apos;s a relative lack of places [in New York] that allow people to hang out in an environment that celebrates the art, not the commodity.&quot; The idea of the record shop as cultural hub echoes Rough Trade&apos;s modest beginnings in 1976. Two years earlier, founder Geoff Travis abandoned a career in teaching to hitchhike around America and became a regular customer at San Francisco&apos;s beatnik hangout City Lights. &quot;I loved the fact it was an environment you could sit in,&quot; he says. &quot;You could stay all day as long as you didn&apos;t spill coffee on the books. It was so different to anything in London, which was like a Wimpy bar: the lights were too bright and the seats were too uncomfortable.&quot; A friend, Ken Davidson, asked what Travis planned to do with the hundreds of records he had collected on his travels and suggested they open a shop in London. Finding cheap premises at 202 Kensington Park Road, west London, Travis installed a secondhand Jamaican sound system, hand-picked the stock and ran the business on co-operative principles. &quot;I wanted a place I could go to every day where I could listen to music,&quot; he says. &quot;It was that situationist thing: turn your work into your play. We were living in squats so all that mattered was having enough money to buy meals and go to gigs. Imagine trying to do that in London today.&quot; After a slow start Rough Trade took off with punk rock, becoming so busy at weekends that the staff had to hire a bouncer, who also fended off local skinheads. The shop had in-store appearances by the Ramones and Talking Heads, employed members of post-punk groups the Raincoats and Swell Maps behind the counter, and attracted customers as hip as Patti Smith. &quot;She came over and I thought, &apos;This is fantastic! Patti Smith&apos;s going to say some words of wisdom,&apos;\u2009&quot; Travis recalls. &quot;And she just said, &apos;Where can I score?&apos;&quot; She didn&apos;t have to go far. &quot;It was a much dodgier neighbourhood,&quot; says Travis. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t wander down All Saints Road on your own unless you were going to score. Of course, it&apos;s full of American bankers now.&quot; Rough Trade spawned a distribution network and record label (signings over the years include the Smiths, the Strokes and the Libertines), which gradually diverted Travis&apos;s energies from the shop. When, in 1982, the larger business&apos;s financial problems threatened the survival of the shop, it was taken over by three devoted employees who bought the stock for \u00a37,000, paid themselves only what they would have got on the dole, relocated to 130 Talbot Road, and revived the shop&apos;s fortunes. Two of the trio, Nigel House and Pete Donne, still work there. Rough Trade operated a second branch in Covent Garden for almost 20 years but branches in Tokyo, San Francisco and Paris all closed. The failure of the Paris outlet a decade ago brought the whole company within days of collapse before new backers saved the business and funded the second store&apos;s move to a converted brewery on Brick Lane. Rough Trade East&apos;s launch six years ago sounded a rare note of optimism at a time when rising rents, declining demand for most physical formats and competition from online retailers had left many British towns without a single independent record shop. HMV, which survived by the skin of its teeth this year, is the last of the high street chains. Rough Trade accepted it couldn&apos;t compete with online retailers on price and chose to emphasise the social aspect of record-shopping, from in-store performances to expert recommendations. Unlike the big chains, each branch is free to experiment and take risks. &quot;There are people who would rather go to Rough Trade on a Saturday and spend \u00a310.99 instead of \u00a38.99 on Amazon,&quot; says Nigel House. &quot;It&apos;s fun going shopping. I just want a record shop I&apos;d be happy in.&quot; Pundits have been predicting the death of the record shop for years, yet many of the best endure and, in the case of Rough Trade, even expand, helped by the resurgence in vinyl sales and international events such as the annual Record Store Day, which celebrates the independent sector. Even though the internet means music fans no longer need to visit a shop, it seems many still want to. Thirty years after cutting his ties with the shop, Geoff Travis has rejoined the business as a shareholder in the Brooklyn branch. &quot;I&apos;m convinced people don&apos;t want to spend all their lives in front of the computer,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s important to walk in off the street and take the plunge and discover a new world. Record-buying people can be very antisocial so I think it&apos;s good for them to find themselves in a social space sometimes.&quot; Black Friday, the next Record Store Day event, is on 29 November"}, {"sentences": ["Many in the west will come to this album through its association with Jim O&apos;Rourke, Chicago-born, now Tokyo-based arch-collaborator with artists as diverse as Joanna Newsom, Wilco and Sonic Youth."], "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-24T00:06:47Z", "title": "Eiko Ishibashi: Imitation of Life \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/24/eiko-ishibashi-imitation-life-review", "article": "Many in the west will come to this album through its association with Jim O&apos;Rourke, Chicago-born, now Tokyo-based arch-collaborator with artists as diverse as Joanna Newsom, Wilco and Sonic Youth.

The Obama administration weighed in after China moved to in effect &quot;rope off&quot; the seas and skies around the disputed Japanese-administered Senkaku islands in the east China Sea. In a tough statement reflecting the surprise and alarm felt in Washington and Tokyo at China&apos;s perceived sudden escalation of the dispute, Chuck Hagel, defence secretary, said the US was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; at the development, in which China appears to be trying to control who can enter and leave the area. The imposition of the zone was a &quot;destabilising attempt to alter the status quo in the region&quot;, Hagel said. &quot;This unilateral action increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations\u00a0... We are in close consultation with our allies and partners in the region, including Japan. We remain steadfast in our commitments.&quot;      Hagel reminded Beijing that the remote Senkaku islands, known as Diaoyu in China, are covered by the 1952 US-Japan security treaty, under which the US is committed to fighting alongside Japan to repel any &quot;common danger&quot;. On Monday China&apos;s foreign ministry said it had complained to the US about its &quot;irresponsible remarks&quot;.  Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in a statement China had asked the US through its ambassador, Gary Locke, &quot;to correct its mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks on China&quot;. Defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said the ministry had complained to the US embassy&apos;s military attache on Sunday evening. Japan&apos;s deputy chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters on Monday that China&apos;s declaration had escalated a tense situation. &quot;It can invite an unexpected occurrence and it is a very dangerous thing as well,&quot; he said. &quot;The step just announced unjustly interferes with the freedom to fly above the open sea, which is a general principle under the international law. The measure is not enforceable to our country.&quot; Washington&apos;s swift intervention showed just how easily a little local difficulty in the volatile east Asian region could potentially trigger a superpower clash. The Senkaku stand-off is but one of several similar disputes pitting a more assertive China against its less powerful neighbours. Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan (all US allies) are \u2013 like Japan \u2013 enmeshed in arguments with Beijing over relatively obscure but potentially strategic bits of maritime real estate. These numerous flashpoints have led the Japanese government to describe the regional security environment as &quot;increasingly severe&quot;. In response, Tokyo has been busily building up mutual defence and security ties across south-east Asia, and with Australia and India, as a hedge against Beijing. For its part, China has sought to enlist Laos, Cambodia, North Korea and Myanmar as de facto buffer states while projecting itself as a rival to the US as a &quot;blue-water&quot; Pacific power. Japan has denounced the zone set up by China on Saturday as &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;, and indicated that aircraft from its self-defence force would ignore Beijing&apos;s attempt to oblige aeroplanes to obtain its permission before entering. Fumio Kishida, foreign minister, warned that China&apos;s action &quot;could well lead to an unforeseen situation&quot;. He called the development &quot;very dangerous&quot;. Hagel said that US forces in the Pacific theatre, including those based in Japan and South Korea, would also ignore China&apos;s strictures. China&apos;s foreign ministry called Japan&apos;s objections &quot;absolutely groundless and unacceptable&quot;. It said it had made solemn representations to the Japanese embassy in Beijing. The Chinese government-run Xinhua news agency published map co-ordinates for what it called the &quot;East China sea air defence identification zone&quot; covering most of the sea and the skies over the islands. It said China&apos;s armed forces would take &quot;defensive emergency measures&quot; against aircraft that failed to identify themselves properly or follow its radio instructions. Xinhua claimed the &quot;air zone could contribute to regional peace and security by curbing the increasing rampancy of Japan&apos;s right-wing forces, as well as the continuous and dangerous provocations of Japanese politicians, which even Washington should be vigilant against&quot;. The statement was an apparent reference to Shinzo Abe, Japan&apos;s conservative prime minister, who was elected last December on a platform of standing up for Japan&apos;s rights. Abe, who says he is intent on making a &quot;proactive contribution to peace&quot;, has been denounced in China and South Korea as a reckless nationalist and historical revisionist. Although China and Japan share two-way trade worth $250bn (\u00a3150bn) a year and maintain many other bilateral links, Abe and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, have yet to hold a summit meeting, and other high-level contacts remain frozen. The dispute over the Senkakus, situated south-west of the Japanese mainland, dates back to 1971 when China claimed sovereignty. Up to that point, the islands had been under unchallenged Japanese control since the 19th century, although Taiwan also has a claim.The row escalated last year when Tokyo effectively nationalised some of the chain, purchasing two islands from private owners. The takeover provoked street protests in China and furious official condemnation. Since then there have been almost daily incursions by Chinese fishing boats and other non-military vessels. Although tiny in size, the Senkakus are thought to sit on top of valuable energy deposits. But analysts say the outcome has broad implications for regional security, given that an ever more assertive China is prosecuting similar disputes with several other neighbours. Akio Takahara, professor of international relations and law at Tokyo university, said: &quot;[Senkaku] must be viewed as an international issue, not just a bilateral issue... and it is very, very dangerous. They [China] must stop the provocations. If Japan did buckle, it would send a very bad message.&quot; In a foretaste of what could happen in the weeks ahead, China sent an air patrol into the zone shortly after the official announcement. Later on Saturday afternoon, Japan scrambled fighter jets after two Chinese reconnaissance planes appeared over the East China sea."}, {"sentences": ["File next to: Treefight For Sunlight, Tiny Animals, the Submarines, Tokyo Police Club."], "tags": ["Indie", "Music", "Pop and rock", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-25T07:00:19Z", "title": "Air Traffic Controller (New band of the day No 1,647)", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/25/air-traffic-controller", "article": "Hometown: Boston, USA.

The background: Air Traffic Controller are one of those bands where it&apos;s really an outlet for the frontman and the others are just there to realise his grandiose/madcap schemes. They&apos;re a solo act in all but name, which isn&apos;t to disparage the other musicians involved, because they do a fine job of turning what might have been tedious acoustic ditties from the nerd-megalomaniac in question - Dave Munro - into fully arranged, and sometimes orchestrally overblown (in a good way), paeans to baroque self-absorption.  Munro was a real-life air traffic controller for the US Navy - true story, apparently - only instead of focusing on the job at hand, i.e. making sure the planes didn&apos;t go careening into the hull of his ship, he spent long hours poring over the minutiae of his past and present romantic liaisons. And so he wrote an album called Nordo. Now, Nordo refers to aircraft that experience radio failure while flying. And if you can decipher what the meaning behind that little metaphor might be vis a vis interpersonal relations, you&apos;re more insightful than us (not difficult, admittedly). Suffice to say we&apos;re imagining that crashing and burning are probably involved, unless that&apos;s just us casting back to our first marriage, which we do a lot.       Reading on mobile? Click here to listen Not that Nordo is heavy-going or takes effort to enjoy. Far from it. In fact, it&apos;s a delight almost from end to end, and one can&apos;t help wondering what a record company push over here might achieve (we&apos;re told legions of A&amp;R ladies and gentlemen are already queuing up for their London gig on Tuesday, although it is a tiny venue). Is there a market for upbeat geek-indie-pop with rhythms and melodies so finger-clickingly good you keep Googling that they weren&apos;t already hits from 1986 or featured in a Brat Pack movie scene in which Molly Ringwald jitterbugs in an ironic mid-&apos;80s homage to the original rock&apos;n&apos;roll era? Munro might sing &quot;I&apos;m so miserable&quot; but he&apos;s no US Morrissey - or rather, he is, which means he&apos;s got Hollywood in his blood and he can&apos;t resist allying his every solipsistic aphorism and wry miserablism to the jauntiest power pop this side of the Knack&apos;s My Sharona, all handclaps and woah-ohs. It&apos;s orch-pop for the emotionally challenged, and unashamed with it. Pretty much anywhere you alight on the album you get something good, if you like this sort of thing. &quot;Listen to me: do I sound happy?&quot; Munro sings in his high, keening tenor. To be honest: in your own happy-when-it-rains way, yes. Upbeat despair: yum, our favourite. What can we say? Another One to Watch for 2014. Our shortlist currently contains about 117 names.

That sparked an angry response from Tokyo, which has administrative control of the uninhabited outcrops, and strong words from Washington. China and Japan have been locked in a row over the rocky islets known as the Senkaku by the Japanese or the Diaoyu by the Chinese for years. They are surrounded by fisheries and other natural resources. A transport ministry official in Seoul told Reuters that South Korean planes flying in the zone would notify China&apos;s civil aviation authorities of their flight plans, as would Taiwanese carriers, according to officials in Taipei \u2013 which also claims the islands. A Japanese official said companies there would probably need to inform China. The zone covers an area roughly two-thirds the size of the UK.

The US secretaries of state and defence both issued statements at the weekend expressing deep concern about the new zone, with John Kerry warning: &quot;Escalatory action will only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident.&quot; China hit back, with its state news agency Xinhua reporting that the foreign ministry had summoned Japan&apos;s ambassador to complain about &quot;unreasonable accusations&quot;. A ministry spokesman earlier said it had lodged representations with the US ambassador. &quot;We reiterate that the purpose of China&apos;s approach is to defend national sovereignty and territorial airspace security, maintain the order of airspace flight, and is an effective exercise of our right of self defence,&quot; defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said in a statement. He urged the US to &quot;not take sides, not make inappropriate remarks and not give the wrong signal to Japan and encourage [its] risky behaviour&quot;. Tensions over the islets escalated last year when Japan bought three of them from a private landowner, saying it was trying to prevent nationalists from purchasing them. China accused it of changing the status quo and there were widespread anti-Japanese protests. Behind the dispute lies broader concern in the region about China&apos;s growing power and assertiveness, particularly on maritime issues. On the Japanese side, Abe has a hawkish reputation and has sought to beef up defence capabilities since taking office almost a year ago. &quot;Xi Jinping is developing foreign policy with a great power mindset and people need to get their heads around that,&quot; said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, Asia-Pacific director at the US Institute of Peace. &quot;They don&apos;t foresee any real negative consequences [from the zone]. They certainly didn&apos;t predict the level of pushback [from the US] \u2013 but they don&apos;t feel they need bother to budge. Since Japan does not admit the dispute they are under no pressure to have direct talks with Japan.&quot; But she added: &quot;I think there are a lot of people in China who think they can control escalation. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the case necessarily. &quot;An unexpected aerial encounter certainly carries greater risk of a clash than anything maritime. The risks are far greater when there are reduced decision-making times and the like.&quot; Earlier this year, Japan scrambled jets after Chinese planes and an unidentified drone flew near the disputed islands. Western diplomats have said they are concerned that China has underestimated both Japan&apos;s maritime capabilities and US commitment to supporting Japan. The area designated by China overlaps with similar zones established years ago by Japan and South Korea. In its announcement on Saturday, China&apos;s defence ministry said it would set up other such zones when preparations were finalised. Beijing also claims much of the South China Sea, important for its shipping routes and rich energy resources, where a multi-party sovereignty dispute involves the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan."}, {"sentences": ["No need to take viewers on a whistle-stop tour of Sony\u2019s Tokyo headquarters, where some of the world\u2019s leading tech mavens have, through their designs, steered the video game industry."], "tags": ["PlayStation", "Technology", "Sony", "Games"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-27T10:00:38Z", "title": "PlayStation 4: the rebirth of cool", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/27/playstation-4-sony-new-console", "article": "In a cavernous hangar way out in the industrial wilds of Acton, west London, where the ground is strewn with junkyard shrapnel and the sky is October grey, a film crew hopes to condense PlayStation\u2019s 20-year history into an advertisement. It\u2019s a tall order. Not only is Sony\u2019s series of increasingly powerful video game systems about to enter its fourth generation when the monolithic slab known as PlayStation 4 launches this week, this is also an empire that has transformed the cultural landscape. PlayStation remains Sony\u2019s most iconic brand. It\u2019s proved more enduring than the Walkman, and is more culturally embedded than the Bravia. By the early 2000s it was the company\u2019s key source of profit. Indeed, the Japanese electronics company\u2019s current slogan &quot;Make. Believe.&quot; appears to be founded on the essence of gaming. Outside of Sony, the console has had a disruptive influence. The video game designer Yoshiki Okamoto recently said: \u201cPlayStation has completely changed the distribution, sales and image of video games.\u201d That transformative effect is borne out in the figures: approximately 350m PlayStations have been sold around the world since the first iteration launched in 1994 \u2013 equivalent to the total number of iPods that have been sold to date. There is, then, an awful lot of history to squeeze into 90 seconds. Into a teenager&apos;s bedroom But the plan \u2013 and it&apos;s a good one \u2013 is to simplify and personalise the story. No need to take viewers on a whistle-stop tour of Sony\u2019s Tokyo headquarters, where some of the world\u2019s leading tech mavens have, through their designs, steered the video game industry. Nor will the cameras peer into the thousands of development studios around the world, where PlayStation\u2019s defining games have been produced, generating billions of dollars. Instead the film crew is headed into the eye of a cliche: a boy\u2019s pungent bedroom, where the PlayStation has provided the focal point for millions of likeminded players. The ad\u2019s script shows two friends playing PlayStation across the years, as the London skyline seen through the bedroom window morphs into its current arrangement of cogs and spires. The boys\u2019 hairstyles change, along with their girlfriends and the accompanying soundtrack, but the PlayStations remain, blinking and whirring in the corner. Sony believes that its consoles have been the life constant for at least two generations of young people around the world. It keenly hopes that will continue with PlayStation 4. The inspiration came from Twitter. This year, one of the company\u2019s so-called community managers devised the hashtag #PlayStationMemories. Twitter users were encouraged to share their memories of a life spent growing up with PlayStation. The response was tremendous, with tens of thousands of tweets reminiscing about the consoles and the place they\u2019ve had in our lives. The ad is what\u2019s known in the industry as a \u201cheritage piece\u201d, designed to play on the viewer\u2019s nostalgia for the product. For this particular scene the bedroom is dressed circa 1996: the newspaper of the day lies crumpled on the carpet; the actors wear historically accurate Levi&apos;s and pristine trainers. Dominoes even reprinted some of its pizza boxes from the era: realism has always been of paramount importance when it comes to the modern video game. Sony believes that heritage is the key differentiator between its PlayStation 4 and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One, the two rival \u201cnext-gen\u201d video game systems that will battle for the valuable prime real estate beneath our television sets this Christmas and beyond. But there is one part of the heritage Sony\u2019s keeping well away from the cameras, the secret of its origin story. PlayStation, far from being the result of a Japanese master plan is, in fact, an empire built upon a grudge. Humiliating turnabout At the Consumer Electronics Show in June 1991, Sony unveiled its first video game console, a joint venture with the dominant video game maker of the time, Nintendo. The system was to be Nintendo\u2019s route into the emerging world of multimedia entertainment. But the following day the Kyoto-based company announced it was terminating its deal with Sony in order to partner with rival manufacturer Philips. Few snubs in Japanese business have been played out so publically, and the turnabout humiliated Sony. The following month president Norio Ohga called a meeting to plan a lawsuit. Ogha explained that financial recompense would not be enough to sate his appetite for revenge. He stood to his feet. \u201cWe will never withdraw from this business,\u201d he declared to the room, which included among its occupants Ken Kutaragi, an ex-Nintendo contractor who was desperate to design a video game console. \u201cKeep going,\u201d he urged. It\u2019s a promise that Sony has stuck to with grim resolve ever since. The first PlayStation, designed by Kutaragi, helped define the 3D era of video games. All 100,000 PlayStation launch units sold out in Japan on their day of release. Over the course of console\u2019s life innumerable game mechanics were established, countless technological boundaries overcome and a vast number of best-selling franchises launched. Sony sold 102m PlayStation 1s across the world, success that only grew with the launch of its successor, the plainly named PlayStation 2, which soon became the best-selling video game machine yet made. Today, history is set to repeat. PlayStation 4 is, in a sense, a video game console built upon a vendetta. In recent years the company has slipped from its once-dominant position in the industry. Since its launch in 2006 PlayStation 3 sold around half the number of units as its predecessor. This year Sony reported the operating income of its PlayStation business was down by 94.1% year-on-year. From a financial perspective PlayStation 3 was a disappointment. But from an engineering point of view, it was nothing short of a disaster. The PlayStation\u2019s rise had coincided with a cultural shift in emphasis away from hardware engineering towards software, one best exemplified by Apple\u2019s iPod music players. When Sony had developed the Walkman, the device was almost entirely hardware-based. But with the rise of digital music, pairing devices with intuitive software had become the key to success. Sony\u2019s innovations focused on making products smaller and sleeker, with the software that fired them almost an afterthought. Despite the rise in PlayStation\u2019s importance, the company had been slow to embrace the idea it was now a software developer. The father of PlayStation These rifts were made clear in the PlayStation 3\u2019s development: the hardware team developed the machine in relative isolation, before handing a near complete product to the software guys. Sony\u2019s US president, Jack Tretton, would later identify this as the key issue for PlayStation 3, a system hamstrung in its early days by the lack of collaboration within Sony. Kutaragi himself, now widely known as the &quot;father of PlayStation&quot; exacerbated the situation. The success of the PlayStation 2 had given the designer the position of renegade auteur. In September 2006, just before the PlayStation 3\u2019s launch Kutaragi spoke out against his company. \u201cIf I was asked whether Sony&apos;s quality of manufacturing has declined, I would have to say &apos;yes,&apos;\u201d he said. At a board meeting a few weeks later the designer told the assembled executives that he planned to slash the price of the console by 20% before launch in order to make it more competitive, increasing the amount of money lost on each console. Meanwhile the message coming back from developers was that the system\u2019s architecture was difficult to develop for and came with inadequate tools. It\u2019s this last issue that PlayStation 4 has been designed to specifically rectify: righting a wrong that indisputably hurt its predecessor. Just as books sell eBook readers, films sell Blu-ray players and music sells iPods, video games sell consoles. \u201cFor PlayStation 4 we placed developer needs first and foremost in the equations,\u201d Andrew House, the current president of Sony Computer Entertainment tells me. \u201cThat for me was what we had to do with this machine.\u201d On the eve of PlayStation 4\u2019s launch, it&apos;s clear that Sony is confident in its product. It has prepared a console that is arguably more powerful than its competitors, easier to produce games for and, unexpectedly, $100 cheaper than the rival Xbox One. But the company wasn\u2019t always this confident. Following the PlayStation 3\u2019s disastrous launch, Ken Kutaragi was replaced as president of SCE. Five months later he retired.

His stance exudes quiet purposefulness. The Murasame, armed with advanced missiles, torpedoes, a 76mm rapid-fire turret cannon and a vicious-looking Phalanx close-in-weapons-system (CIWS) Gatling gun, is on the frontline of Japan&apos;s escalating standoff with China and its contentious bid to stand up for itself and become a power in the world once again. And Fujii clearly relishes his role in the drama. Asked whether he will be taking his ship south, to the hotly disputed waters off the Senkaku islands in the East China sea (which China calls the Diaoyu and claims as its own), Fujii smiles and bows. His executive officer, acting as translator, explains that &quot;for security and operational reasons&quot; the captain cannot comment. The situation there is just too sensitive.     The disputed islands in the East China Sea known as Senkaku in Japan and  Diaoyu in China. Photograph: Kyodo/Reuters    The name Murasame means &quot;passing shower&quot;. But Japan&apos;s decision last year to in effect nationalise some of the privately owned Senkakus \u2013 officials prefer to call it a transfer of property rights \u2013 triggered a prolonged storm of protest from China, which has been sending ships to challenge the Japanese coastguard ever since. So far, there have been no direct armed exchanges, but there have been several close shaves, including a Chinese navy radar lock-on and the firing of warning shots by a Japanese fighter plane. China&apos;s weekend declaration of an exclusive &quot;air defence identification zone&quot; covering the islands was denounced by Tokyo and Washington and sharply increased the chances of a military clash. US B-52 bombers and Japanese civilian airliners have subsequently entered the zone, ignoring China&apos;s new &quot;rules&quot;. On Tuesday, Beijing said it had monitored the flights; its next move is awaited with some trepidation.     Japanese navy on manoeuvres last year: Beijing and Seoul view efforts to give Japan a bigger role on the world stage as intrinsically threatening. Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images    For Shinzo Abe, Japan&apos;s conservative prime minister who marks one year in office next month, the Senkaku dispute is only one facet of a deteriorating east Asian security environment that is officially termed &quot;increasingly severe&quot; and which looks increasingly explosive as China projects its expanding military, economic and political power beyond its historical borders. One year on, Abe&apos;s no-nonsense response is plain: Japan must loosen the pacifist constitutional bonds that have held it in check since 1945 and stand up forcefully for its interests, its friends and its values. The way Abe tells it, Japan is back \u2013 and the tiger he is riding is dubbed Abe&apos;s &quot;new nationalism&quot;. It is no coincidence that high-level contacts with China and South Korea have been in deep freeze ever since Abe took office, while the impasse over North Korea has only deepened. Unusually, a date for this year&apos;s trilateral summit between Japan, China and South Korea has yet to be announced. The Beijing and Seoul governments profess to view Abe&apos;s efforts to give Japan a bigger role on the world stage, forge security and defence ties with south-east Asian neighbours, and strengthen the US alliance as intrinsically threatening \u2013 a throwback to the bad old days of Japanese imperialism.     Shinzo Abe reviews  troops near Tokyo: Abe believes Japan must loosen the pacifist constitutional bonds that have held it in check since 1945 and stand up forcefully for its interests. Photograph:    Issei Kato/Reuters    Abe is also charged with arrogance, chauvinism and historical revisionism, by minimising or ignoring wartime legacies such as the controversy over Korean &quot;comfort women&quot; who were forced into prostitution by Japanese troops during the second world war. Addressing the UN general assembly in September, Abe set an unapologetically expansive global agenda for a newly assertive Japan. Whether the issue was Syria, nuclear proliferation, UN peacekeeping, Somali piracy, development assistance or women&apos;s rights, Tokyo would have its say. &quot;I will make Japan a force for peace and stability,&quot; Abe said. &quot;Japan will newly bear the flag of &apos;proactive contribution to peace&apos; [his policy slogan].&quot; Referring to the initial success of his &quot;Abenomics&quot; strategy to revive the country&apos;s economic fortunes, he went on to promise Japan would &quot;spare no pains to get actively involved in historic challenges facing today&apos;s world with our regained strength and capacity\u00a0\u2026 The growth of Japan will benefit the world. Japan&apos;s decline would be a loss for people everywhere.&quot; Just in case Beijing missed his drift, Abe spelled it out: as a global trading nation, Japan&apos;s reinvigorated &quot;national interest&quot; was existentially linked to freedom of navigation and open sea lanes around the Senkakus and elsewhere. &quot;Changes to the maritime order through the use of force or coercion cannot be condoned under any circumstances.&quot; Akio Takahara, professor of international relations and law at Tokyo university, said such statements made clear the Senkaku standoff was potentially precedent-setting for all the countries of the region, including Vietnam and the Philippines, which have their own island disputes with Beijing. &quot;[Senkaku] must be viewed as an international issue, not just a bilateral issue\u00a0\u2026 and it is very, very dangerous. They [China] must stop the provocations,&quot; Takahara said. &quot;If Japan did buckle, it would send a very bad message to China&apos;s hardliners, they would be triumphant and the modernisers and reformers would be marginalised.&quot;      A senior government official was more terse: &quot;We don&apos;t want to see China patrolling the East and South China seas as though they think they own them.&quot; Abe&apos;s forcefulness has produced forceful reactions. In a recent editorial, South Korea&apos;s Joongang Daily, lambasted him as &quot;one of the most rightwing politicians in Japan in decades&quot;. It continued: &quot;Buoyed by the nationalist mood sweeping Japanese society since Abe took the helm of the once-pacifist nation, [rightwing politicians] are increasingly regressing to a militarist path\u00a0\u2026 As a result, the political situation of north-east Asia is becoming shakier than ever.&quot; Pure hyperbole, say Abe&apos;s defenders. Tensions were high primarily as a result of China&apos;s aggressive bid for hegemonic regional leadership, a senior foreign ministry official insisted, while describing the antagonistic South Korean leadership&apos;s anti-Japan behaviour as &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot;. Abe&apos;s premise, said government spokeswoman Kuni Sato, was that, after years of restraint, &quot;Japan can now do what other countries do within international law&quot;. What Abe was doing was &quot;necessary and justified&quot; in the face of China&apos;s diplomatic hostility and rapid military buildup, said Yuji Miyamoto, a former ambassador to Beijing. &quot;Only three countries don&apos;t understand this policy \u2013 China, South Korea and North Korea,&quot; said Nobuo Kishi, the prime minister&apos;s younger brother and senior vice-minister for foreign affairs. In contrast, the members of Asean (Association of South-East Asian Nations) were mostly on board. Abe&apos;s advancing security agenda suggests his second year in office will be even more rumbustious than the first. It includes creating a national security council modelled on the US and British versions (David Cameron and William Hague have offered their advice), a new national security strategy, revamped defence guidelines, and a harsh state secrets law. Criticised by the UN and the main opposition parties, the proposed law threatens long jail sentences for whistleblowers and journalists who break its vague, catchall provisions. Abe has increased the defence budget for the first time in years, is overseeing an expansion of naval and coastguard capabilities (Japan&apos;s maritime self-defence force, or navy, is already the second biggest in Asia by tonnage), and has gathered expert support for a reinterpretation of article 9 of Japan&apos;s pacifist constitution to allow &quot;collective self-defence&quot; \u2013 meaning that if the US or another ally is attacked, Japanese armed forces will join the fight. On the diplomatic front, Abe is busily wooing his Asian neighbours. Having visited all 10 members of Asean in his first year, he will host a gala Asean summit in Tokyo on 13 December that looks very much like an anti-China jamboree. He comprehensively outflanked Beijing during this month&apos;s typhoon emergency in the Philippines, sending troops, ships and generous amounts of aid, the biggest single overseas deployment of Japanese forces since 1945 \u2013 while China was widely criciticised for donating less financial aid that the Swedish furniture chain Ikea. Abe is also providing 10 coastguard vessels to the Philippines to help ward off Chinese incursions. Improved security and military-to-military co-operation with Australia and India form part of his plans. Officials insist, meanwhile, that the US relationship remains the bedrock of Japanese security. Taking full advantage of Barack Obama&apos;s so-called &quot;pivot to Asia&quot;, Abe&apos;s government agreed a revised pact in October with the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and the defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, providing for a &quot;more robust alliance and greater shared responsibilities&quot;. With a wary eye on China, the pact envisages enhanced co-operation in ballistic missile defence, arms development and sales, intelligence sharing, space and cyber warfare, joint military training and exercises, plus the introduction of advanced radar and drones. Japan is also expected to buy American advanced weapons systems such as the F35 fighter-bomber and two more Aegis-equipped missile defence destroyers. Washington is positively purring with pleasure over Abe&apos;s tougher stance. &quot;The US welcomed Japan&apos;s determination to contribute proactively to regional and global peace and security,&quot; a joint statement said. The pact reflected &quot;shared values of democracy, the rule of law, free and open markets and respect for human rights&quot;. But Abe&apos;s opponents fear the country is developing a new military mindset. What the Japanese public makes of what seems to amount overall to a landmark post-war shift in the scope and ambition of Japan&apos;s regional and global engagement is hard to gauge. China&apos;s disapproval ratings are a record high 94%, but a big majority (80%) of people polled also believe good bilateral relations are important. Many cling to the old pacifist verities but many others now understand the world around Japan is changing fast and unpredictably, said Kuni Miyake of Tokyo&apos;s Canon Institute for Global Studies. &quot;Despite his conservative, hawkish image, Abe is in fact a very pragmatic, reasonable politician. But he is also proud of Japan and he is saying it&apos;s OK to be proud,&quot; Miyake said. &quot;A huge power shift is going on in east Asia. Before Abe and the new era, we were day-dreaming. We thought we could follow pacifism, not threaten anybody, have no army, and the world would leave us alone. We were in a bubble. And it worked because of the US alliance, not because of pacifism. &quot;The next generation doesn&apos;t believe that\u00a0\u2026 People are aware that prayers for peace are not enough. We have to deter many potential aggressors. If China insists on being a Pacific power and challenges the US-Japan hegemony at sea, a showdown is inevitable,&quot; Miyake said. For Takahara, the opposite holds true. There were limits to what Japan could do when faced by China&apos;s rising power and Abe&apos;s approach was fraught with peril. &quot;There is really no choice but to use diplomacy and dialogue to mend ties with China,&quot; Takahara said. &quot;Abe is very rightwing by traditional measures. He is a historical revisionist at heart. He would really like to visit the Yasukuni shrine where Japan&apos;s war dead are remembered. He is a nationalist \u2026 But Abe won&apos;t succeed with his &apos;new nationalism&apos;. We are a post-industrial society. There&apos;s no way the youngsters will go along.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Washington and Tokyo are refusing to acknowledge the zone and US officials said the B-52s had entered it without identifying themselves, with no attempted contact from the Chinese military."], "tags": ["China", "US foreign policy", "US news", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-27T10:55:00Z", "title": "China monitored US B52 bombers' flight through disputed air defence zone", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/27/china-air-defence-zone", "article": "The open challenge by the US to China&apos;s new air defence zone over the East China Sea was met with a muted response in Beijing, as China faced growing resistance to its attempt to extend its authority in the region. China&apos;s defence ministry said it had monitored two unarmed B-52 bombers that flew though the zone on Tuesday, and reasserted its ability to control the airspace. But its statement did not mention a previous warning that it would take &quot;defensive emergency measures&quot; if aircraft did not respond to instructions. The zone covers islands at the heart of a long-running territorial dispute with Japan and overlaps with those already established by Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Analysts say China is testing Japan&apos;s administrative control of the islands, while Beijing says it is exercising its right to self-defence. Washington and Tokyo are refusing to acknowledge the zone and US officials said the B-52s had entered it without identifying themselves, with no attempted contact from the Chinese military. The two main Japanese commercial carriers, Japan Airlines and ANA \u2013 which initially offered China flight plans \u2013 stopped doing so on Wednesday under government pressure. In Australia, the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said the government had summoned the Chinese ambassador to voice its concerns. China&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said it had expressed strong dissatisfaction at the &quot;irresponsible&quot; remarks and urged Australia to avoid damaging bilateral relations. Air defence zones go beyond a country&apos;s national air space and require aircraft to identify themselves. Analysts have said China&apos;s rules do not distinguish between aircraft flying through the zone and those flying towards Chinese airspace. The US has said it does not apply identification procedures to foreign aircraft in its own zone unless they intend to enter US airspace. US officials said Tuesday&apos;s flight was a long-planned training mission, with the bombers carrying out a round trip from their base in Guam that took them into the zone for less than an hour. Chinese officials said they were there for two hours and 20 minutes. The state department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki ,reiterated the US government&apos;s belief that China&apos;s move was an attempt to change the status quo, which she said would &quot;raise regional tensions and increase the risk of miscalculation, confrontation and accidents&quot;. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Chinese policy was &quot;unnecessarily inflammatory&quot; and destabilising. Some believe the creation of the zone may backfire by pushing countries in the region closer to the US. &quot;At one fell swoop, Beijing&apos;s decision has injected new problems into its ties with South Korea, Taiwan and the US, further soured relations with Japan, and frightened smaller nations in south-east Asia,&quot; wrote Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, in the Asia Times. &quot;It appears that Xi Jinping, who by all accounts has emerged stronger from the recently held Chinese Communist party third plenum, is willing to fan the flames of nationalism so he can ensure the party&apos;s popularity as he tackles economic reform at home,&quot; Glaser wrote. Analysts suggest China is initially likely to log what it describes as intrusions \u2013 as Japan does \u2013 and perhaps gradually step up efforts at enforcement. &quot;The Chinese can now start counting and reporting what they call Japanese violations, while arguing that the Chinese side has shown great restraint by not exercising what they will call China&apos;s right to shoot, and arguing further that China cannot be so patient indefinitely,&quot; Denny Roy, a security expert at the East-West Centre in Hawaii, told the Associated Press. The zone covers the airspace over the rocky island chain claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan, which is inhabited only by goats but surrounded by fisheries and other natural resources. They are known as the Senkaku or Diaoyu islands. The row over sovereignty is long-running but escalated last year when Japan bought three of the islets from a private owner, saying it was doing so to prevent nationalists from purchasing them. China&apos;s weekend announcement may also be in part a response to Japan&apos;s extension of its own zone this spring and its recent warning that it was willing to shoot down unmanned drones it regarded as a threat to its airspace. An unidentified drone was detected near the islands this autumn. The official People&apos;s Daily website quoted a military expert, Li Jie, as saying the US flights sought to test China&apos;s reaction, to discourage future interference as it continued &quot;reconnaissance, patrolling, and spying on Chinese information&quot; and because it wanted to show that it was still in charge in the Asia-Pacific region."}, {"sentences": ["For its part, Tokyo says it wants to talk, but is busily boosting its military and security capabilities and alliances.", "There is deep frustration in Tokyo that Beijing does not give more weight to Japanese support for China&apos;s development.", "Tokyo would collapse,&quot; the senior government adviser said."], "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "China", "Japan", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-27T16:37:00Z", "title": "Senkaku islands row reflects broader tensions between China and Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/27/senkaku-islands-broader-tensions-china-japan", "article": "The potentially explosive struggle between China and Japan for physical control of the energy-rich Senkaku islands in the East China Sea reflects broader security, ideological and historical tensions between the two east Asian leviathans, the world&apos;s second and third biggest economies respectively, which could yet produce a head-on collision, Japanese officials and analysts say. According to a senior government adviser, the security situation in the east Asian region has begun to resemble Europe in the 1930s, when a resurgent, re-arming Germany began to project its power beyond its borders. China&apos;s declared defence budget has expanded five times over in 10 years to $102bn (\u00a363bn) in 2012, almost double Japan&apos;s, the adviser said. For its part, Tokyo says it wants to talk, but is busily boosting its military and security capabilities and alliances. &quot;China tries to present a smile to the world but it will always revert to bullying when it suits it,&quot; the adviser said. &quot;They have bigger guns and bigger money than us, but they can&apos;t lead. They have no vision for the world\u00a0\u2026 Integrating China into the global mainstream is the biggest challenge of this century. I hope they will be like us one day. But it may not happen.&quot; Yoshiji Nogami of the Japan Institute of International Affairs said European governments and businesses were failing to appreciate or understand the extremely high levels of instability in east Asia, partly because of &quot;wishful thinking&quot; arising from a desire to profit from China&apos;s vast markets. &quot;The US-Japan security alliance is expanding in scope in the South China Sea, not only in the East China Sea. The Australians and the Indians are getting involved, too, so if things deteriorate further, it potentially gets very dramatic,&quot; Nogami said. &quot;China is not going to back off. It views the East China Sea as a core interest. But so too does the US forward-deployed navy and Japan. So how do we manage this clash of core interests? I think the situation can ultimately be managed, but for the next decade or more the atmosphere will be very uncomfortable.&quot; Officials complained that like its predecessors, China&apos;s new leadership under its president, Xi Jinping, was willing to whip up residual anti-Japanese sentiment to distract attention from the country&apos;s severe social and economic problems. Portraying Japan as a threat also served the People&apos;s Liberation Army, which used it to justify increased weapons budgets. Following acceptance of his &quot;reform&quot; programme at the Communist party&apos;s central committee plenum earlier this month, Xi was emerging as the strongest Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping (who died in 1997), the officials said. His approach to external (as well as internal) security and defence issues was uncompromising, and on occasion confrontational, the officials said. There is deep frustration in Tokyo that Beijing does not give more weight to Japanese support for China&apos;s development. &quot;There are 20,000 Japanese companies investing in China, mostly in manufacturing, employing 10 million Chinese workers,&quot; a senior official said. Two-way trade was very important for both countries, but China&apos;s behaviour often jeopardised it, and Japanese businesses were beginning to look elsewhere. &quot;Japan and China have tremendous communication problems,&quot; said Yuji Miyamoto, a former Japanese ambassador to Beijing, pointing to China&apos;s suspicions over what it views as reviving nationalism in Japan under conservative prime minister Shinzo Abe. &quot;There is no dialogue at present. Neither leader has an incentive to deal. We need a confidence-building process,&quot; he said. &quot;It is too early to say whether China is a threat to Japan. There are conflicting currents [in the Beijing leadership]. One group definitely wants a superpower position in the world. Other groups say China needs co-operative relationships. I don&apos;t know which way it will go. But Japan and the international community still have time to influence China&apos;s decision.&quot; For Japan, the unstable outlook in east Asia is compounded by uncertainty over the unpredictable behaviour of nuclear-armed North Korea. &quot;If Kim [Jong-un, the North Korean dictator] goes crazy, he could blow up everything. Tokyo would collapse,&quot; the senior government adviser said. Japan&apos;s relations with South Korea are also at a low point, poisoned by renewed recriminations over second world war legacies. For all these reasons, Miyamoto said, the US-Japan alliance was more important than ever. &quot;We need a long-term regional security framework. But we need the US more, until such a framework can safeguard every country. Because, at present, the situation is so fragile, so unstable, so insecure.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The land to which the islands are closest is neither Japan nor China, but Taiwan \u2013 with which Tokyo has few problems.", "Last year Taiwan showed the way out of these disputes by signing an agreement with Tokyo which sidestepped the issue of sovereignty and divided the fisheries to mutual benefit."], "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "China"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-27T23:52:39Z", "title": "Japan and China: collision course | Editorial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/27/japan-china-editorial", "article": "Is it Europe before the first world war or the second? Analysts disagree, but all see the escalation of military threats between the two industrial giants China and Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea with growing alarm. The latest crisis was caused by China&apos;s decision to extend its &quot;air defence identification zone&quot; (ADIZ) over a group of uninhabited islands which Japan calls the Senkakus and China knows as the Diaoyutai. Several overflights later, not least by a pair of US B-52 bombers, and nothing much has changed, except that a hairtrigger that originally was to be measured in hours and governed by the speed of boats, has now become a matter of seconds. Few can say what prompted the latest Chinese move. This is a time when the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, is attempting to drive major economic reform and the announcement may be a sop to the military, when its voice in the national debate could be weakening. It is hard to avoid the conclusion, though, that the declaration was a way of testing the waters for a reaction \u2013 which they duly got. The state-run China Daily accused Japan and the US of overreacting, saying that if the world&apos;s sole superpower needed multiple ADIZs to fend off perceived threats, China should be allowed theirs. Besides, they claimed the measure was not targeted at any particular country. This is not how it is seen in Japan, which has witnessed a growing number of confrontations, or &quot;incidents&quot;, over islands in which Beijing showed little interest for much of the last decade. For Japan, the dispute over the islands is part of a major naval push to extend China&apos;s maritime influence beyond the first island chain of the Pacific. China claims the status quo was changed by Japan&apos;s decision to nationalise the islands. What they don&apos;t want to admit is that this was done to stop the islands being used by Japanese nationalists on madcap flag waving stunts. The land to which the islands are closest is neither Japan nor China, but Taiwan \u2013 with which Tokyo has few problems. Last year Taiwan showed the way out of these disputes by signing an agreement with Tokyo which sidestepped the issue of sovereignty and divided the fisheries to mutual benefit. This model, first applied in the North Sea, is the only rational way out of these disputes \u2013 although it is not one that Britain is particularly keen on applying to the Falklands. China and Japan agreed in 2008 to co-operate on the joint development of the East China Sea. Further talks have never been pursued and, to date, not even a hotline exists between the two powers to avert another incident in the sea or in the air. It is time for people in China and Japan to turn down the volume of simplistic nationalist rhetoric and to pursue pragmatic dialogue."}, {"sentences": ["The action is brutal and relentless, each character is stretched to the very limits of survival, Neo Tokyo is reduced to rubble in the most spectacular fashion, and somehow genuine hope survives."], "tags": ["Children and teenagers", "Children's books: 7 and under", "Children's books: 8-12 years", "Teen books", "Books", "Culture", "Comics and graphic novels (children and teens)"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-28T12:52:05Z", "title": "Robin Etherington's top 10 comic books", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2013/nov/28/robin-etherington-top-10-comic-books", "article": "&quot;I&apos;ve always liked making top ten lists. During my time here on planet earth I&apos;ve happily categorised my favourite books, films, games, sports, foodstuffs, road kill, enemies, colours, credit cards, teeth and spam email, to name but a few. And to be honest they were all pretty easy (all except for movies, which I had to break into innumerable sub-divisions, from Thrillers Featuring Log Cabins to Comedies Featuring an Amusingly Small Dog).  But then we reach comics; my achilles heel. Where does one start? To pick just 10 titles from the oodles of awesomeness that fill the shelves of book stores and comic shops the world over, well, it seems a shame.  As it happens there are 10 that, for me, stand just a little taller than the rest of the pack. Each is a work of genius that I recommend you consume (when you reach the right age) as soon as humanly possible.&quot; Robin Etherington is one half of the Etherington Brothers, creators of Monkey Nuts and contributors to Star Wars, Transformers, the Dandy and Wallace and Gromit. They also contribute to the Phoenix comic, 32-pages of reading fun by some of the best writers and artists from the UK and around the world, for children age 6-12 years. 1. Calvin and Hobbes (7+) One of the greatest friendships ever depicted on the page. A boy and his imaginary/real tiger, more adventures than you can shake a stick at, gags piled on gags and big ideas perfectly captured in the simplest form. This is a comic that you will love forever. The complete collection in paperback contains every strip every created, which should keep even the most avid reader busy! 2. Asterix the Legionary (7+) My favourite comic series of all time. Although there are many brilliant examples of the genius of those indomitable Gauls and their ongoing battles with the Roman Empire, the 10th volume stands apart. Albert Uderzo&apos;s art had reached its zenith and Rene Goscinny&apos;s writing is near unbeatable. The comedy, pacing, action, characters, setup and payoff are perfect. 3. Bone (9+) Ten years ago, this comic book fuelled the fire of creativity beneath my feet. Bone is a great big roaring tale of action, love, loss, laughs and stunning art. One big story that rolls through 1300 pages of epic excellence, this is the ultimate independent comic success story. Jeff Smith brings to life a cast of wonderful characters that live on long after their story is told.  4. Usagi Yojimbo (10+) Stan Sakai has been writing and drawing the tales of his masterless rabbit samurai for almost thirty years, and they just get better and better. With clean black and white artwork Stan brings talking animals, genuine pathos, sublime humour and cartoon violence to the world of feudal Japan. Do not be fooled by his cute style, this is a story of depth and heart and consequence, where traditional Japanese myths and legends rear off the page in one magical scene after another. 5. Dungeon (16+) Despite our close proximity to mainland Europe, there is a wealth of fantastic material that never gets translated. Thankfully the back catalogue of comics&apos; luminary Lewis Trondheim has been substantially tapped and with Dungeon \u2013 his sword and sorcery comedy series (co-created with Joann Sfar) \u2013 you can see why. Blissfully funny characters stroll through a surreal fantasy landscape trying to get out of work, avoid the tax man and generally disobey conventions, while at the same time delivering a huge slice of satisfying action. For older readers. 6. Sam and Max Surfin&apos; the Highway (12+) Funny, funny, funny! There&apos;s nothing else to say. Steve Purcell makes great computer games but his oddball opus is the comic adventure of a rabbit and a dog and a lot of jokes.  7. Akira (16+) At 3000 pages and six giant volumes, Akira is the longest and greatest cyberpunk epic of all time and a game-changing manga. The action is brutal and relentless, each character is stretched to the very limits of survival, Neo Tokyo is reduced to rubble in the most spectacular fashion, and somehow genuine hope survives. An ode to misunderstood youth and telekinesis (what a combo!) this is a fantastic book for older readers. There&apos;s simply nothing else like it. 8. Fungus the Bogeyman (7+) One of the first comic books I can remember reading, Fungus is probably Raymond Briggs&apos;s second most memorable creation (after the Snowman). Hundreds of gross visual treats await the reader as we join Fungus on a typical day in his life as a human-scaring bogeyman. The language is rich and colourful, and there is enough snot, slime and generally horrible things to entertain even the most unlikely reader.  9. Lucky Luke (7+) When Rene Goscinny wasn&apos;t thinking up adventures for Asterix he was busy collaborating with Belgian cartoonist Morris (on books 9-31), breathing golden life into an already fabulous cowboy series. Lucky Luke is the fastest gun in the west, a wanderer, a hero, a legend and a fantastic comic creation. Together with his horse, Jolly Jumper, Luke saves the day, time and again.

That is all. I want blackheads gone, spots to fizzle and die, and my skin to be calm and soft like the outside of a peach. What I don&apos;t want are injections, freezing my face off, or, as in one Japanese treatment, snails crawling all over my nose and mouth. Facials are merging with more invasive procedures such as micro-mesotherapy and glycolic peels. They no longer seem to be just about making one&apos;s skin look nice, through removal of all accumulated gunk. Is it still possible to get something that comprises nothing more than a good old wash, steam, extraction and mask. I want high-quality products \u2013 a simple treatment shouldn&apos;t necessitate dodgy &quot;earthy&quot; masks and greasy creams made in someone&apos;s kitchen sink. I want very clean skin \u2013 at present, you could fill a black bin liner with the gunk extractable from my epidermis. But I just don&apos;t want the faff and expense of gimmicks that deliver pain and the ew-factor along with their roster of skin-enhancement claims. Dermaroller treatments are an example of the medical-style treatments segueing into your average facial. The &quot;Genuine Dermaroller&quot; treatment involves rolling over the skin with a device that looks like one of those lint rollers used to get cat hair off black clothes. Only this tool is covered in spikes. After the application of an anaesthetic cream, the procedure &quot;create[s] approx 300 micro medical needle channels per cm\u00b2 in to the dermis of the skin. Below the outer stratum corneum layer of the epidermis the needle is penetrating in to living tissue.&quot; This then stimulates collagen production, generates new skin cell growth, and improves blood supply.  Then there are the peels. Just the words &quot;chemical&quot; and &quot;peel&quot; to name a product I am supposed to put on my face is enough to make me scarper. Glycolic versions \u2013 using an acid derived from sugar cane to lift away old skin cells \u2013 are said to lead to discolouration and inflammation. It all seems a bit much. Happily, there is a growing trend among facialists for a type of deep cleansing that does not resort to drastic, often painful, methods. Susan Harmsworth, founder of ESPA, says: &quot;We are seeing a general backlash against severe and gimmicky facials because of the many short and long-term side effects, contraindications and issues that can&apos;t necessarily be easily resolved. Because of the rise of the more severe procedures we are seeing an increase in sensitivity, middle-aged acne, rosacea \u2013 to name a few. We are working with very interesting technology to produce high-quality serums that are 99% natural and are focused on particular age groups and issues.&quot;     Snails crawls on the face of a woman for the demonstration of a new beauty treatment at the beauty salon Ci:z.Labo in Tokyo Photograph: Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty Images    At the ESPA-appointed Harbour Spa at the Christchurch Harbour Hotel, guests can have the Re-Balancing Facial, which uses tea tree and white thyme, instead of harsh chemical peels, to bust those nasty dead cells that make one&apos;s skin look sad and grey. In London, skincare expert Debbie Thomas, who works from Hari&apos;s salon, says she has seen a 30% drop in customers seeking Botox. She says that customers are instead asking for Skinbreeze treatments. Dreadful name, in my book, but instead of needles, it uses an oxygen infusion to allow serums to go deep into the skin. Could it be, then, that a deep cleanse is taking the place of anti-ageing treatments too? Although they haven&apos;t necessarily seen a backlash against more extreme facials, the Paul Edmonds salon in Knightsbridge is launching a new range of organic facials in response to a growing interest from clients who want skincare formulated without pesticides (these days, there is less of that made-in-someone&apos;s-kitchen-sink vibe). Saynab Omar, beauty therapist and facials expert at the salon, says: &quot;It&apos;s always been very difficult to be able to provide truly organic and natural-based aesthetic therapies that have a consistent short and long-term skin-improving result.&quot; But with one of the treatments promising brighter skin by tackling hyperpigmentation with a natural alternative to hydroquinone, a bleaching agent, I&apos;m happy to opt for the substitute, even if the effects are less dramatic. Dr Perricone&apos;s Blue Plasma, \u00a378, is one alternative to harsh chemical peels. I raise my eyebrows at some of the claims in the marketing material \u2013 after four weeks&apos; use in trials, &quot;87% agreed their skin felt like it has been replaced with &apos;new skin&apos;.&quot; What is this, sci-fi? But the stuff is rather good. It lifts away only dead skin cells, removing the nasty build-up of all the dirt my skin carries. It&apos;s a deep cleanse without resorting to the chemical peels that may cause long-term damage. Is it the ultimate solution to my dirt-filled pores, then? Time shall tell. No treatment is going to work wonders, needles or no needles. For now, I&apos;m steering clear of the snails, and any facialist brandishing a lint-roller covered in spikes, or the ingredients for an acid peel."}, {"sentences": ["More central to the argument, the drive to create a peer-to-peer currency that operates outside the existing authorities and exchanges is the same one that encouraged investment banks to devise peer-to-peer trading platforms away from the central exchanges in London, New York and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Currencies", "Bitcoin", "Financial crisis", "Technology", "Business", "World news", "Economics", "Banking", "Financial sector", "Regulators", "JP Morgan", "Bank of England", "US Congress", "Cryptocurrencies"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-28T16:02:04Z", "title": "Is Bitcoin a potential weapon of mass economic destruction? | Phillip Inman", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/nov/28/bitcoin-potential-weapon-mass-economic-destruction", "article": "Why are we giving Bitcoin house room? Surely it is akin to a counterfeiting scam promoted by people who like the idea of their computer making them rich without lifting much more than a finger? The story on Wednesday of the Newport IT worker James Howells who threw away a hard drive with \u00a34m worth of Bitcoins stored on its memory is a case in point. If Howells had set up a printing press in his bedroom and run off a whole bundle of banknotes, only to throw away the suitcase he stored them in, sympathy would evaporate and the police would pay a call. Of course, Howells is no fraudster, yet somehow, because he generated the money based on computer programs designed in the hallowed confines of Silicon Valley tech offices, the process is deemed, at least by some people, as a legitimate way of generating funds. As an article by my colleague Alex Hern described earlier this week, Bitcoin is being taken seriously in the US Congress, by US central bank boss Ben Bernanke and by some larger commercial businesses, notably Virgin. So why do we need Bitcoin? Is there something about existing currencies, or even the lack of a global currency, that makes Bitcoin attractive? Likewise, is there something about the way we buy and sell electronically at the moment \u2013 the speed and the cost \u2013 that can be made faster and cheaper by a new electronic currency? As an aside, these questions reinforce my general view that graduates of Stanford, MIT and Cambridge \u2013 to name just three science-oriented universities \u2013 are potential weapons of mass financial destruction, adopting the term used by Warren Buffett when asked to describe the mortgage derivatives behind the Lehman Brothers crash (he said they were WMFDs). Where once these graduates were small in number and locked in a room with the letters NASA on the door, these excessively clever people (I didn&apos;t say worldly or wise) are now appearing in their millions, bored and restless and in search of a quick way to grab the kind of fortune that buys a mansion and a big car. More central to the argument, the drive to create a peer-to-peer currency that operates outside the existing authorities and exchanges is the same one that encouraged investment banks to devise peer-to-peer trading platforms away from the central exchanges in London, New York and Tokyo. These exchanges were deemed to be slow and subject to excessive charges. They were regulated by government or quasi-government agencies and sometimes subject to taxes. When governments refused to back radical reform, the JP Morgans and Citibanks took their trading to these so-called dark pools where no regulator could see what was going on. Five years after the financial crisis there is still a debate about size, scope and legitimacy of a global trade that the Bank of England&apos;s deputy governor Charlie Bean has said could create &quot;a serious problem&quot;. Regulators say they are worried about the growth of shadow banking as much in China as in the US and Europe (China has its fair share of restless, clever graduates). They should be equally worried about Bitcoin. Regulation is annoying and banks can charge too much for processing transactions, but that is not a justification for a shadow currency with the potential, should it be allowed to proliferate, to wobble and crash. The Bitcoin early adopters and the people who are currently using computer programs to &quot;mine&quot; Bitcoins want a new currency so they can make trading profits from doing nothing other than trading. There is no higher motive. In the early days of its operation individuals can go bust \u2013 so who cares? They took the risk of a collapse in the currency&apos;s value (so far it has only gone from $1 to $1,000 in its five-year life). But once institutions are trading with other people&apos;s money \u2013 pension money \u2013 then it becomes serious when losses occur. Before you know it there will be a clamour for regulation and the regulators will impose charges to cover their costs, place restrictions on trading and possible apply a tax. And the reaction from the Bitcoiners? Start another currency. We often talk about the brightest graduates turning their backs on manufacturing and engineering in favour of banking. They still do but there is not enough banking to go round for the star-studded students of today and tomorrow. Left to their own devices, and without being channelled into more productive activities, of course they will print new money if, in our ignorance, we all say it is OK. In the meantime, businesses should shun the currency. It is no surprise that Virgin boss Richard Branson, who loves to pose in anti-establishment garb, has embraced Bitcoin. That does not mean anyone else should. Shareholders should demand real money in exchange for goods and services, for the good of society at large. As Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, wrote more than two years ago: &quot;What we want from a monetary system isn&apos;t to make people holding money rich; we want it to facilitate transactions and make the economy as a whole rich. And that&apos;s not at all what is happening in Bitcoin.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["This fall, prior to their European tour, the All Blacks played a sold-out game in Tokyo, beating Japan 54-6."], "tags": ["New Zealand rugby union team", "US sports", "Rugby union", "Sport", "New York", "US news", "Autumn internationals", "Dan Carter", "Richie McCaw"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-28T18:05:00Z", "title": "All Blacks take first bite from Big Apple \u2013 and may soon be back for more | Martin Pengelly", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/nov/28/all-blacks-new-york-carter-mccaw", "article": "The New Zealand Rugby Union, and its main sponsor, would like America to meet &quot;the greatest sports team it&apos;s never heard of&quot;. To that end, seven All Blacks \u2013 Richie McCaw, Dan Carter, Sam Whitelock, Ma&apos;a Nonu, Israel Dagg, Liam Messam and Aaron Smith \u2013 flew to New York this week. For a while, as the great Thanksgiving storm of 2013 scotched plans for a Water Taxi tour, my A train idled infuriatingly at Canal Street and the maps function on my phone inexplicably refused to, well, function, the All Blacks were in danger of becoming the greatest sports team I had ever failed to meet. Fortunately, after a charge up Broadway and a quick left into the Liberty Street Pronto Pizza, I found them. &quot;We&apos;re all pretty excited to be here,&quot; said Dan Carter, 100-cap fly-half, scorer of 1,442 international points, model citizen and possibly the greatest sports star of whom America has never heard \u2013 unless of course you count his captain, McCaw. &quot;I&apos;ve been here once before and I&apos;d say it&apos;s probably my favourite city in the world. &quot;It&apos;s not often the All Blacks get to come to America. You know, we travel the world, to Europe and South Africa and Australia, and Argentina now too, but never really the States. It&apos;s good to be here \u2013 it&apos;s a real pleasure for us.&quot; I asked Carter a question I also asked McCaw (&quot;the expats see you right enough&quot; \u2013 a statement proved correct five or six times on the short walk to Wall Street) and the 6ft 8in Whitelock (&quot;as a tall fella, I&apos;ll always be spotted&quot;): What&apos;s it like to walk about a city and not be recognised by every passerby? After all, in the rugby world \u2013 which stretches from Dunedin to Aberdeen and many points east, west and in between \u2013 the All Blacks are pretty much royalty. &quot;It&apos;s quite refreshing actually,&quot; Carter said. &quot;Obviously people at home recognise us a lot more. We&apos;ve been quite surprised though \u2013 I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s the film crew that&apos;s been following us or that we&apos;re all in our All Blacks gear, but we&apos;ve been recognised.&quot; That was true, for example, outside the New York Stock Exchange. I don&apos;t speak French, alas, but I managed to decipher an excited cry of &quot;c&apos;est les All Blacks!&quot; from a party of female tourists. A battery of iPhones came out and volleys of photos were shot, to the evident puzzlement of the NYPD officers who were patrolling the nearby square.     The All Blacks visit the New York Stock Exchange Photograph: Leon Kirkbeck/Augusto    &quot;It&apos;s been a good response, both from the expats and the locals,&quot; said Carter. &quot;I&apos;ve been quite surprised \u2013 a lot of the locals have heard of rugby and they&apos;ve heard about the All Blacks. It just goes to show how strong the All Black name is.&quot; AIG \u2013 the insurance giant which sponsors New Zealand rugby \u2013 also supports USA Rugby and is looking to grow the American game. Such efforts look likely to bring the All Blacks back to the east coast this time next year. Earlier this month Steve Tew, the chief executive of the New Zealand Rugby Union, said as much in an interview with stuff.co.nz. Nothing has since been confirmed, including whom the All Blacks would beat \u2013 sorry, play \u2013 in the States. But it seems likely they will be back, following in the footsteps of the Maori All Blacks team who beat the US Eagles and sold out a stadium in Philadelphia earlier this month. This fall, prior to their European tour, the All Blacks played a sold-out game in Tokyo, beating Japan 54-6. The matches that followed saw France beaten 26-19 in Paris, England edged 30-22 in London and Ireland squeaked out \u2013 in a stone-cold classic, a game to sell rugby to any sports fan anywhere \u2013 24-22 in Dublin. The All Blacks thus won every game they played in the calendar year, a feat unmatched in the modern era. They are the reigning world champions and they have won 26 of 28 games under their current coach, Steve Hansen. That is why their sponsor says they are the greatest sports team of whom America has never heard. It&apos;s also why that isn&apos;t just marketing speak \u2013 there&apos;s an argument to be had over whether they&apos;re the greatest of all sports teams, of all time.     Whitelock and Richie McCaw contest a loose ball with Cian Healy of Ireland. Photograph: Niall Carson/PA    On Wednesday, dodging raindrops, Daniel Glantz of AIG indicated where his company stands on the matter: &quot;We are hoping to do our part in introducing the USA to the greatest sports team in the world. Having an opportunity to have the players in New York for the first time is something special.&quot; For now, after an evening trip across the East River to watch the Brooklyn Nets lose to the Los Angeles Lakers, for six of the seven it&apos;s time for the long haul back to the land of the long white cloud, there to continue their build-up to the 2015 World Cup in England. One of their number, though, plans on staying a little longer. &quot;I&apos;m going to have Thanksgiving in New York,&quot; said Carter. &quot;It&apos;ll be my first in America \u2013 I thought I&apos;d like to stay here and experience it. I&apos;ll eat plenty and fall asleep by five in the afternoon, hopefully.&quot; If the greatest player on the greatest sports team America has never heard of can so seemlessly adapt to the American dream, perhaps America, in return, could yet adopt his team.

China&apos;s air force spokesman Shen Jinke says several fighter jets and an early warning aircraft were sent on normal air patrols in the zone on Thursday. He was quoted by the state news agency Xinhua. Shen described the flights as &quot;a defensive measure and in line with international common practices&quot;. He said China&apos;s air force would remain on high alert and will take measures to protect the country&apos;s airspace. Japanese and South Korean aircraft flew through the airspace without informing China, officials said on Thursday, challenging a new Chinese air defence zone that has increased regional tensions and sparked concerns of an unintended clash. China rejected South Korea&apos;s demand for the repeal of the zone but appeared to soften its demand that commercial aircraft tell its military authorities of any plans to pass through the area. Japan&apos;s two biggest airlines have already begun defying that order. &quot;This has already increased the risk [that the situation] will escalate from confrontation to conflict,&quot; said Shi Yinhong, an expert on international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. &quot;I think China will take flexible measures towards any aeroplane that flies over the zone, and that will still be compatible with China&apos;s declarations,&quot; he added. &quot;America is not our direct enemy, and South Korea is our friend. But Japanese armed aircraft would be a different story. If they dare to come into China&apos;s declared\u00a0zone, the Chinese air force will take action.&quot; China announced the zone at the weekend, prompting criticism from Japan and the US. Some experts said it was aimed not only at chipping away at Tokyo&apos;s control of disputed islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, but also at challenging US dominance in the region. On Tuesday the US flew two unarmed B-52 bombers over the islands without informing Beijing. &quot;The East China Sea air defence identification zone is not aimed at normal international flights,&quot; said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang. &quot;We hope that relevant countries&apos; airlines can proactively co-operate so there is more order and safety for flights.&quot; Asked if China was worried it would be seen as a &quot;paper tiger&quot; in light of its response to the US flights, Qin advised reporters to check Mao Zedong&apos;s use of the phrase. Mao used the term as a metaphor for &quot;US imperialism&quot; in 1956 \u2013 seemingly powerful, but easily crippled by adversity, he said. He wanted to stress that the Chinese government had adequate resolution and ability to defend its national sovereign rights and to control the zone. &quot;This was clearly very calculated, but that doesn&apos;t mean it wasn&apos;t a miscalculation,&quot; said Scott Harold, an expert on east Asian security at the Rand Corporation. China probably thought that declaring the zone was no different from its past strategic actions in the region \u2013 small, incremental steps that might annoy neighbouring countries but wouldn&apos;t cause them to react. Instead, it &quot;inflamed an underlying suspicion that everyone had: that China is going to work in grey zones, push the envelope and expand its territorial sovereignty claims with every opportunity it gets&quot;. China essentially has two options, Harold said: it &quot;can do nothing, and confirm to the outside world that its rise is as risky as some people thought. Or on the other hand, it can do something to reassure the region and the world that it is not going to be a threat.&quot; For the Chinese leadership, the first could jeopardise a bevy of important diplomatic relationships; the second would entail a major loss of face. &quot;I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s an easy out here for China,&quot; Harold added. &quot;The easy thing would be if they&apos;d never done it in the first place.&quot; Japan&apos;s top government spokesperson, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, said on Thursday that the country had sent patrol planes into the airspace without informing China, and that China did not intercept them. &quot;They are carrying out surveillance activity as before in the East China Sea, including the zone,&quot; he told a news conference, according to Reuters. &quot;We are not going to change this (activity) out of consideration to China.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["But also a Spike Jonze love story, meaning it&apos;s set in a very near, slightly off-kilter future, in a squeaky-clean but still recognisable Los Angeles (complete with an unlikely fully functional public-transit system), which is augmented with shots filmed in other Pacific-rim capitals such as Shanghai and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Her", "Spike Jonze", "Culture", "Film", "Scarlett Johansson", "Rome film festival", "Festivals", "Joaquin Phoenix"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-28T19:00:00Z", "title": "Spike Jonze on Jackass, Scarlett Johansson's erotic voice and techno love", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/28/spike-jonze-her-interview-scarlett-johansson-joaquin-phoenix-jackass", "article": "      Spike Jonze is looking to the future. &quot;I kinda think, as I look around, that everything is slowly getting a little bit nicer.

You&apos;d be surprised. It&apos;s late September and I&apos;ve just watched the movie, minus a couple of CGI digital inserts, at a majestic suburban house in the hills above the Sunset Strip which is functioning as the post-production set-up for films backed by Annapurna Pictures. The company&apos;s head honcho, producer and Oracle Corporation heiress Megan Ellison, lives in an even more sumptuous mansion right next door. The views of the city, all the way to the silver thread of the Pacific coastline, are million-dollar breathtaking. The others at the screening are the production and editing teams: they lock picture tonight after nearly a year in post-production.     Jonze and Scarlett Johansson at the Rome film festival premiere of Her. Photograph: Camilla Morandi/REX    Spike wants to know if I like it \u2013 he has a slight dazed look I&apos;ve seen before in other directors at this stage of post-production: he&apos;s been editing so long he wonders if he can tell the wood from the trees any more. I loved it, I say. I&apos;ve seen love stories between real human beings with bodies and bedrooms, and felt none of the rich emotions prompted in me by Her. I ask where the idea came from. &quot;The very tiniest seed came about 10 years ago when I saw this article online that said you can interact live with an artificial intelligence. So I went to the website, and I IM-ed this address, and I was like, &apos;Hi, how are you?&apos; and I got responses like, &apos;Great, how are you?&apos; And you can talk to it and tease it \u2013 not a him or her, it&apos;s just typing \u2013 and get a little banter going, getting mocked and so on. I got this sort of buzz thinking: this thing&apos;s actually keeping up with me. And then after a couple of minutes you start to notice the cracks and the flaws. Oh, this is a very cleverly written program, I thought in the end, but for those couple of minutes I got a very distinctive, tingly kind of buzz from the experience. The movie has a lot of large conceptual ideas holding it up, but most of all, I always wanted to make it a moving relationship movie \u2013 that was what I was most interested in.&quot; It might have turned out very differently, though. On the set, Phoenix interacted live with Samantha Morton as digi-Samantha. &quot;Samantha was a big part of it, and we&apos;ve been friends for a long time. What happened in post was that we edited the movie for ages and finally realised that what Samantha and I had done together wasn&apos;t working the right way. It was a really hard realisation to come to, and it was really, really hard to tell her about it. So we brought Scarlett in during post-production, and we somehow got it to work.&quot; Johansson was working on Broadway in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof at the time, and Jonze grabbed her for rehearsals at any odd moment. At one point, Johansson said recently: &quot;We were even rehearsing on Maggie the Cat&apos;s bed on stage.&quot;      Jonze on set. Photograph: Sam Zhu    Blessed with a naturally deep, expressive and erotic voice, Johansson turned in an extraordinarily deft and beautiful, yet totally disembodied, performance that won her the best actress award at the Rome film festival and has some critics calling for Oscar plaudits (though the Golden Globes have already excluded her from contention). We&apos;re slumped on couches in one of the back rooms, and I&apos;m gratified how agreeable and open Jonze is. He&apos;s kind of scruffily dressed in apres-skate attire, including an uncomfortably jaggy-looking pair of trousers that seem to be made from flour sacks. I know he has pranked a few journos in his time. He once asked an interviewer to join him on an urgent visit to someone difficult he had to deal with, and took him to Johnny Knoxville&apos;s house, who \u2013 pre-scripted by Spike \u2013 promptly declared violent rhetorical war on the stunned hack. Another interview on YouTube shows Spike at the wheel of his car in downtown LA traffic. Suddenly he goes all green, steps out of the car and emits a stupendous fountain of orange vomit, then sheepishly wobbles back into the driver&apos;s seat.             This is, after all, the man behind the Jackass TV show and movies. In fact, even as he is readying Her for lock-down, he&apos;s simultaneously dipping in and out of the production for the Jackass spin-off, Bad Grandpa, starring Knoxville as a fake 86-year-old granddad with a huge capacity for giving offence. Still, no pranks for me, not so much as a whoopee cushion. I tell him that what I like about his movies is that they don&apos;t live in relation to other movies, as so much homage-heavy film-school product often does. They feel organic and hand-made, like carefully wrought, gleaming objects \u2013 for all their CGI interventions. But the Jackass movies have something in common with the earliest, oldest kinds of cinema, in which a camera was simply set up, and insane things were enacted before it. &quot;No doubt. We watched a lot of Keaton and Chaplin \u2013 and we stole everything from them we could. Abbott and Costello, the Three Stooges. To do a live-action Tom and Jerry cartoon was a big part of what we wanted.

That was just part of skating and hanging out, and the camera in that situation is an absolute inspiration \u2013 it just forces you to use it. You know, it could be for some epic ride \u2013 attach it to the board, maybe, or just goofing off and doin&apos; pranks, like, hey, there&apos;s a shopping cart, climb on in and we&apos;ll push ya down this steep hill and into that big bush, and film it! It was just a part of skate culture to make videos like that.&quot;     Jonze at the Rome film festival in November 2013. Photograph: Ernesto Ruscio/Getty Images    Jackass just came about. One day they were sitting around bullshitting, next thing they knew, MTV had picked them up. &quot;We thought, we have 20 minutes on national TV to do whatever the hell we want, as long as the lawyers approve it. We got no notes from them whatsoever, and we just made whatever we wanted. But then it came out finally, we had no idea ... Johnny Knoxville went from struggling to pay his rent to being on the cover of Rolling Stone in the course of like a month. It was like wow, what did we stumble upon here?&quot; Skateboarding cast a deep influence on Jonze&apos;s teenage aesthetics, but so did DIY punk rock and old school hip-hop. &quot;I loved Fugazi, the DC hardcore band, because they always did everything themselves. They had their own label, and the CDs always cost nine dollars, the T-shirts always cost eight dollars, the shows always cost five dollars, no major label. Mainly I was loving their music, but also the idea of doing it yourself and not giving power and control over to big companies.&quot;           This conviction was deepened by his long collaboration with the Beastie Boys, for whom he made numerous music videos. &quot;One of the amazing things they did when they got their advance for their second album on Capitol, Check Your Head, was they took their whole advance and a lot of time to build their own studio, Grand Royal, out in a neighbourhood called Atwater Village, really a little sleepy, 1950s small-town vibe to it. It was a kind of exploration of what it was like to make a record again, literally reinventing themselves for the third album in a row. They were always gonna make exactly the thing they wanted, even from the earliest videos I made with them, the label didn&apos;t get to have a say. It was all going to go through their filter first and last, and all be under their control.&quot; It&apos;s five years since his last movie, Where The Wild Things Are, and he says it&apos;s likely he&apos;ll now do again what he did after that movie, which itself took five years to complete: cleanse his palate. &quot;I took a year where creatively I wanted to just have an idea and go make it right away. I don&apos;t have to be making a movie just to be making one. I like to get to the point where I need to make a particular movie. In between times I make small movies, some animations \u2013 I did one in stop-motion felt back then. For a while I want to make things that are more like pencil sketches, while movies are more like large oil paintings. For a while I&apos;m gonna think small.&quot; The kid has quite a future. In fact, he just made a movie about it. Look to it.

The other has been said to resemble a vagina, rising out of the Qatari desert in a great vulvic bulge. Both are in fact sinuous sporting stadiums by the London-based Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid, who is facing calls for her exuberant designs to be scaled back. This week Japanese sports officials finally bowed to growing criticism that Hadid&apos;s scheme for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic stadium was too big and too expensive, saying they would shrink the design by a quarter. The 80,000-seat venue, planned for the site of the current 48,000-seat national stadium, built in 1958, is described by Hadid as &quot;light and cohesive&quot;, its structure forming a dynamic bridge that &quot;creates an exciting new journey for visitors&quot;. But the design has been met with fury by Japanese architects, who have complained that it is grossly insensitive to its context, looming 70 metres above the area of low-rise buildings and parks in the west of the city, close to the Meiji shrine, where a 15-metre height limit is in force. The 100-strong group, led by Pritzker prize winner Fumihiko Maki, 85, filed a petition against the project earlier this month, protesting that the stadium was two to three times the size of its equivalents in London and Athens, and more than three times their cost, at 300bn yen (\u00a31.8bn).     Japanese architects have complained that Zaha Hadid's design for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic stadium is grossly insensitive to its context. Photograph: AP    In response to mounting pressure, the Japan Sport Council has now announced it will scale back the floor space by a quarter to 220,000 sq metres, and reduce the budget to 180bn yen \u2013 still nearly 40% higher than the government&apos;s initial estimates for a new stadium. With its ambitious scale, the project has echoes of Hadid&apos;s plans for the London 2012 aquatics centre, which were originally intended to be two such buildings, twice the size, rippling along the edge of the Olympic park like a pair of stingrays. But the realities of a budget got in the way and the scheme was cut in half. The Tokyo news comes as Hadid has been forced to bat off claims that her design for Qatar&apos;s Al-Wakrah stadium, for the 2022 football World Cup, is based on the female genitalia, after images of the &quot;vagina stadium&quot; went viral last week. The architect insists that the building&apos;s swollen flaps, which part along the roof to frame a central ovoid opening, were inspired by the sails of local dhow sailing boats, but others have ridiculed their labial similarities. The Daily Show ran images of the stadium sprouting a forest of pubic hair, describing Hadid as &quot;the Georgia O&apos;Keeffe of things you can walk inside&quot; and sent its sports correspondent to find the clitoral &quot;press box&quot; in vain. As the feminist website Jezebel put it: &quot;Any discerning human will be quick to recognise that the building looks exactly like an enormous vagina.&quot;     Zaha Hadid has been forced to bat off claims that her design for Qatar\u2019s Al-Wakrah stadium is based on the female genitalia. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    Response has been muted in Doha, where Jean Nouvel&apos;s tampon-shaped tower already graces the skyline, but it is unlikely the country&apos;s more hardline neighbours will be amused. In 2011, a cleric in Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Muhammad al-Shahrani, railed against plans for the new King Abdulaziz international airport near Jeddah, accusing a &quot;western conspiracy&quot; of making the building in the shape of a woman&apos;s prostrate body, with a phallic control tower looming above, below which &quot;the movement of the aircraft is similar to the trajectory of sperm&quot;. Hadid has little time for such lewd comparisons. &quot;It&apos;s really embarrassing that they come up with nonsense like this,&quot; she told Time this week. &quot;What are they saying? Everything with a hole in it is a vagina? That&apos;s ridiculous.&quot; Potted profile Queen of the curve and conjuror of otherworldly forms, Dame Zaha Hadid has become a sought-after global brand, dotting the world with her rippling white structures, from Abu Dhabi to Azerbaijan. She has turned her hand to everything from swirling urban plans and challenging footwear, to jagged jewellery and garish superyachts. But success hasn&apos;t always come easy. Born in Baghdad in 1950, Hadid studied mathematics in Beirut, before training as an architect at the Architectural Association in London. Long dismissed as an dreamy &quot;paper architect&quot;, her early work grew out of dynamic paintings of skewed perspectives and fractured geometries, inspired by the fragmented forms of Russian constructivism. Her first building was a small fire station in Germany, built in 1994, whose tilting walls and angled stairs proved too much for the firefighters to stand. Almost a decade later it was still her only building, yet since the mid-2000s commissions have flooded in, from the BMW headquarters in Leipzig to the Guanzhou Opera House in China. Hadid was first woman to win the Pritzker prize (architecture&apos;s Nobel) in 2004, and is two-time winner of the RIBA Stirling Prize, for the Maxxi art centre in Rome and the Evelyn Grace Academy in London. Her 400 staff are working on projects in more than 40 countries \u2013 including the central bank and new parliament in Iraq.

They assumed they could do this without damaging the all-important relationship with China.\u00a0 That was because they didn\u2019t believe the talk about the escalating strategic rivalry between Washington and Beijing, or the bitter enmity between Beijing and Tokyo. They didn\u2019t comprehend China\u2019s growing power and confidence. And they didn\u2019t understand the fine line that previous Australian governments had learned to tread between the US and China on these issues. This week they found out their mistakes, when Beijing responded so sternly to their reprimand over the declaration of an air defence information zone [ADIZ]. As such, the very serious situation in the East China Sea has now created an ugly rip in Australia\u2019s relations with China. The question now is whether Abbott and Bishop can profit from the lesson this provides, repair the damage made to their relation with Beijing, and start to contribute to lowering tensions in Northeast Asia, instead of helping to fan them? Of course, Bishop is right to be worried about China\u2019s ADIZ. It has stoked the already dangerous confrontation in the East China Sea, and raised the risk of catastrophic conflict between the US and China. She is also right to have decided she should express her concerns. But she is wrong not to have seen that the way she went about it, combined with the broader policy directions of the new government, would create a counter-productive reaction from Beijing. For context: the dispute between Japan and China over the Senkaku/Daioyu Islands has nothing to do with these uninhabited rocks themselves, or even with the resources that might lie around them. It is about how Asia learns to live with China\u2019s growing power. That is why the stakes are so high, and the dangers so serious. China believes that its growing weight should be matched by growing status in the region. It no longer accepts subordination to US leadership, and seeks at least some kind of equal partnership. The US wants to remain the leader in Asia, and thinks China should be happy with that. Japan fears that the more space China gets, the more it will squeeze them. China\u2019s military pressure over the disputed islands is designed to force the US to back off from its support for Tokyo, thus weakening Washington\u2019s leadership in Asia and showing Tokyo who is boss. It is a high-risk strategy and sets some very bad precedents. On the other hand Beijing believes that the US and Japan are determined to resist any serious accommodation of China, and that only stern actions like this will force them to take China\u2019s ambitions seriously. Meanwhile, Tokyo feels it must urge Washington to stand up to China or risk falling under China\u2019s shadow. They are all right to some extent, which is what makes the situation so complex. Australia\u2019s interests are best served by a deal which gives something to everyone. America does need to make some space for China, and treat it as an equal partner in Asia. China does need to forgo the use of force to settle disputes, and accept that it can\u2019t exclude America from Asia. Japan needs to be given iron-clad assurances of its future security.  All this requires exceptional diplomacy to help avoid further escalating strategic tensions and a growing risk of major war. Instead, the Abbott government has chosen simply to side with the US and Japan against China, calling Japan &quot;Australia\u2019s best friend in Asia&quot;, encouraging it to take a bigger military role, promising more basing for US forces in Australia, and generally behaving as if it is eager to join the US and Japan in containing China\u2019s aspirations. \u00a0All this only stokes Beijing\u2019s belief that it will have to throw its weight around before the rest of us take its demands seriously. And of course it guarantees damage to our long-term relationship with Beijing. If Bishop and Abbott really believe, as they claim to, that none of this will affect Australia\u2019s economic relationship with Beijing, they are in for a nasty shock.\u00a0 The Abbott government, like its Labor predecessor, is struggling to come to terms with the new political and strategic reality in Asia. They want to believe that Asia can be fundamentally transformed economically, but remain completely unchanged strategically, with American power still calling all the shots.\u00a0 Abbott\u2019s deep-seated conservatism means he would dearly love that old order to last for ever. Hopefully his pragmatism will allow the harsh new reality to intrude. As we grow rich on China\u2019s growing economy, we must learn to live with its growing power."}, {"sentences": ["See our tips on where to stay Image eight: Tokyo Fancy a trip?"], "tags": ["Travel", "City breaks"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-29T06:00:00Z", "title": "Metro signs around the world: picture quiz answers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/nov/29/picture-quiz-answers-world-metro-signs", "article": "Image one: New YorkFancy a trip?

The state news agency Xinhua announced the patrols after Japan, South Korea and the US all sent military aircraft through the zone in a clear challenge to the Chinese measure. Beijing had previously responded only by saying it had monitored the flights. Shen Jinke, a spokesman for the Chinese air force, described Thursday\u2019s dispatch of aircraft as &quot;a defensive measure and in line with international common practices\u201d in the Xinhua report.\u00a0 &quot;China&apos;s air force is on high alert and will take measures to deal with diverse air threats to firmly protect the security of the country&apos;s airspace,&quot; he said.\u00a0 A previous patrol took place on Saturday, when the zone was declared. Many countries have similar zones, requiring aircraft approaching their territorial airspace to identify themselves, and China has said it created the area to defend its national security. But its zone is controversial because it includes the skies over islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, which are the subject of a long-running territorial dispute, and overlaps zones established by Japan and South Korea. Taylor Fravel, an expert on regional security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said establishment of the zone increased the potential for an incident in the air that could spark a larger crisis. But he said tensions might ease if China continued to clarify the nature of the zone and how it intended to deal with unidentified aircraft, especially those flying through the zone but not heading toward China. \u201cChina has always chafed at Japan&apos;s ADIZ, which at some points is less than 150km from China and has been used by Japan to report intrusions into Japan&apos;s airspace. China probably wants to level the playing field with Japan and increase the pressure on Tokyo regarding the disputed islands,\u201d he said. Japan does not acknowledge that the ownership of the islands is disputed. The US does not take a view on sovereignty but recognises Japan\u2019s administrative control and has said the joint security pact covers the islands. Many analysts think China is laying down a long-term marker, but did not anticipate the forceful response it has received from the US as well as Japan. \u201cI think the logic is that incrementally it will make other countries accustomed to China exerting an enhanced degree of authority in that space,\u201d said Rory Medcalf of Australia&apos;s Lowy Institute. China is now seeking to dampen the international pushback without appearing weak to other nations or its own people.\u00a0 Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, Asia-Pacific director at the US Institute of Peace, said the creation of its zone had its own momentum. \u201cThe danger in the announcement is that it empowers the People\u2019s Liberation Army, maritime agencies and netizens [internet users] to hold the government to account,\u201d she said. \u201cNow people are transgressing the zone, they have to make it look to the domestic audience like they are serious. They have given birth to internal pressures.\u201d Dai Xu, a famously hawkish air force colonel and high profile media commentator, wrote on his Weibo microblog: \u201cThe war of public opinion\u00a0is more interesting than diplomatic war.\u201d Other users wrote scathingly about China\u2019s muted response to foreign military flights into the zone, describing the government as a paper tiger.\u00a0 Behind the immediate issues lie regional concerns about China\u2019s growing strength, Beijing\u2019s unease at Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s determination to strengthen his country\u2019s forces, and questions about the US presence in and commitment to the region.\u00a0 The US vice-president, Joe Biden, will visit Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul on a trip beginning this Sunday which is likely to be dominated by discussions of the zone. &quot;We decline to comment on Chinese flights, but the United States will continue to partner with our allies and operate in the area as normal,&quot; a Pentagon spokesman said. In a statement released on Thursday, the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs chief Lady Ashton expressed concern at the establishment of the zone and China&apos;s warning of &quot;emergency defence measures&quot; in the event of non-compliance.\u00a0 \u201cThis development heightens the risk of escalation and contributes to raising tensions in the region. The EU calls on all sides to exercise caution and restraint,\u201d she said. Yan Xuetong, a foreign relations scholar at Tsinghua University, said: \u201cI think the only problem is Japan because it has taken a confrontational policy.

It&apos;s a truth that was discovered in 19th-century Paris by the fl\u00e2neur \u2013 that &quot;botanist on\u00a0asphalt&quot;, to use Walter Benjamin&apos;s memorable phrase \u2013 who turned the city&apos;s boulevards into drawing rooms in which to dissect the metropolitan crowd. And now, from Tokyo to London, urbanophiles agree that it is\u00a0through what Michel de Certeau beautifully termed &quot;the long poem of walking&quot; that you can truly understand that most complex and beguiling feature of\u00a0modern life: the city. Sociologist William B Helmreich was born and grew up in New York City. As a boy, he and his father played a game called &quot;Last Stop&quot;. It involved riding the subway from the station at 103rd Street near their Upper West Side apartment to the last stop on the line. Then, like intrepid explorers, they would discover the area&apos;s secrets on foot. (Helmreich&apos;s father died in 2011 at the age of 101.) In a sense, this book is a continuation of that urban game. To write The New York Nobody Knows, Helmreich walked 6,048 miles, covering almost every block in\u00a0the city&apos;s five boroughs: Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island, Brooklyn and the Bronx. It took him four years, walking an average of 1,512 miles a year. He wore out nine pairs of shoes. Helmreich admits that &quot;you have to\u00a0be a little crazy to explore the city as\u00a0I did&quot;. But big cities do that to you. Their scale and Babel-like hubris seem to demand an extreme response. On his footloose wanderings, he recorded conversations with New Yorkers, including current and former mayors, reassuring his subjects with the words: &quot;It&apos;s all right, I&apos;m a professor.&quot; His aim was to see how New York has changed since the disastrous years of the 1970s, when the city was almost bankrupt and the murder rate rose to 2,000 per year. That was when Travis Bickle sat in his taxi and ranted against the &quot;whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers and junkies&quot; on the city&apos;s mean streets. By the 80s, crime and social deprivation had turned New\u00a0York into a place of fear. John Carpenter&apos;s 1981 film Escape from New York, which depicted a hellish place transformed into a convict colony, seemed to reflect ordinary Americans&apos; horror of their most infamous sin city. But today the city is enjoying &quot;a tremendous renaissance&quot;. The murder rate is down to around 500 annually and, Helmreich writes, &quot;New York is now perhaps the safest large city in the\u00a0country&quot;. Its success, he thinks, stems from two groups of people: the immigrants and the gentrifiers. The former brought an incredible drive and ambition; the latter have transformed how the city is\u00a0seen, turning it into a fashionable, exciting place, bubbling with new ideas and commercial potential. It is now a city people want\u00a0to live in, not escape from. New York has always been what Helmreich terms &quot;the melting pot capital of the world&quot;. In 1917, an American journalist boasted: &quot;It is the largest Jewish city in the world, the largest Irish city, one of the largest German cities. New York is the great whirlpool of the races.&quot; More than three million immigrants have come to\u00a0NYC since the 1960s, and Helmreich thinks their determination to live the American dream has created its current dynamism. Indeed, a\u00a0laudable feature of this excellent book is its celebration of New York&apos;s rainbow diversity. More than a third of its 8.3 million inhabitants were born abroad and at least 170 languages are spoken there. Elmhurst, Queens, is the most diverse neighbourhood, with people from 120 countries. You rarely hear English in Hispanic parts of the Bronx. Likewise in the Chinese neighbourhoods of Flushing, Queens and Sunset Park, Brooklyn. There are also at least 600,000 undocumented immigrants in the city, mostly Mexicans and Chinese, all struggling to realise the American dream while working as waiters and washing dishes. Helmreich says most New Yorkers have immense sympathy for their plight. One Hispanic manager from the Bronx tells him: &quot;This country&apos;s been founded on illegal activity. End of story.&quot; Over the past quarter century or so,\u00a0hundreds of thousands of young people \u2013 &quot;urban pioneers armed with optimism, hope, and more than a little moxie&quot; \u2013 have streamed into New York, reclaiming a city their parents deserted for the suburbs. Gentrification is now one of the key issues facing the city. It began in the 1970s, in Soho, then the East Village in the 80s, followed by north Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in the 90s. Now gentrification has reached places like &quot;Soha&quot;, as real-estate agents have rechristened south Harlem. But gentrification comes at a price. One long-term Harlem resident complains about a new cafe: &quot;I went in there for a piece of cake and it was like four bucks! I can get a whole cake for four bucks. Obviously they don&apos;t want too many of\u00a0us in there.&quot; Helmreich admits that gentrification is a complex issue and that there are losers as well as winners. But he thinks it has transformed New York, and that this is one reason why the people he meets on his walks are so optimistic about the future of their city. In the end, the voices and\u00a0stories of the people he encounters are what make this book so memorable. He\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0modern-day Henry\u00a0Mayhew, the\u00a0journalist who documented the\u00a0hardscrabble lives of ordinary Londoners in the 1840s. The result is\u00a0a \u00a0vivid portrait of the city, a view from the sidewalk of what former mayor David Dinkins called the &quot;gorgeous mosaic&quot; of New York: Hispanic men playing dominoes in a\u00a0club on Westchester Avenue, in the\u00a0Bronx, while a naked light bulb &quot;swings wildly back and forth&quot;, blown by a noisy metal fan; Hasidic children with skullcaps and sidelocks watching African American kids shoot hoops in the park near where Jay Z grew up in Brooklyn; a procession of some 2,000 people following a statue of the Virgin Mary through the Pelham Bay area of the Bronx; black people playing chess in the light of portable fluorescent lamps in Morningside Park, near Harlem, while a young man in sunglasses beside Helmreich finalises adrug deal on his mobile phone; and a\u00a0cricket match at a club founded in 1872 in Walker Park, Staten Island, where &quot;the soft strains of calypso music fill the air, mixed in with the smells of curried goat and roti&quot;. It&apos;s refreshing to read a book that celebrates so unreservedly the ethnic diversity of a city and entirely fitting that it should be about a metropolis that has always been defined by its cosmopolitan culture.

Seeking to strengthen the spine of a team that leaked 27 goals in their last campaign, the former Chicago Red Stars manager said: &quot;There may be more signings to come to us. A couple more.&quot; Bassett, who was linked with the new FAWSL club Manchester City before joining Chelsea, said that the new signings were influential in her decision to join Hayes, as well as the manager&apos;s vision for the development of the club. &quot;I think the players that will hopefully be announced shortly will make a massive difference on the results compared to last season,&quot; said the 30-year-old, who captained Birmingham to their first ever FA Cup win last year \u2013 they beat Chelsea on penalties in the final. &quot;It wasn&apos;t an easy decision to leave Birmingham, I was speaking to other clubs as well, but Emma and her staff are so passionate and ambitious, they have a real clear vision of where they want to go and how they&apos;re going to get there. I just got caught up in it.&quot; In Japan, where Chelsea will enter at the semi-final stage next Wednesday to take on either the Australian league winners, Sydney, or the Japanese runners-up, NTV Beleza, the central focus will undoubtedly be on the Blues striker Yuki Ogimi \u2013 a 2011 World Cup winner with Japan and 2012 Olympic silver medallist, who is currently shortlisted for Fifa&apos;s World Player of the Year award. &quot;They&apos;re women&apos;s football mad in Japan,&quot; said Hayes, who explained that Japan&apos;s World Cup win came just three months after the devastating tsunami that hit the country. &quot;Yuki says it just exploded after that. It just filled the hearts and minds of the Japanese public.&quot; Japanese media organised a press conference solely to announce that Ogimi would captain Chelsea in the tournament. &quot;You can&apos;t go anywhere without 20-30 journalists mobbing you there, it&apos;s nutty,&quot; said Hayes. &quot;Going over there with an American team last year, we never even saw the [US World Cup winners] 1999 generation get treated like that over in the US. We couldn&apos;t believe the adulation, it was mind-blowing. It&apos;s fabulous. It&apos;s a cult following. Their top club team, INAC Kobe Leonessa, average anywhere between 12-20,000 for a home game.&quot; The IWCC, also known as the Mobcast Cup and organised for the first time last year by the Japan Football Association and Japanese Women&apos;s Football League, is being touted to Fifa officials as a women&apos;s equivalent to the Fifa Club World Cup. The top sides from around the world will descend on Okayama, Kagoshima and Tokyo for the second edition of the Cup, with Chelsea facing either Japanese Cup and League winners Kobe Leonessa or the South American side Colo-Colo should they progress to the final. With the Champions League winners Wolfsburg having turned down the opportunity to travel to Japan, Hayes jumped at the chance to participate in a tournament that also ties in with Chelsea&apos;s Asia marketing plans. &quot;I think the club are keen for the women to be involved in Japan because we have a female star so to penetrate that market makes it easier if you have a player. It makes sense for us to be invested there.&quot; Hayes views the tournament as a good opportunity for her new signings to bed into the team ahead of pre-season training in the new year, and is unrepentant about poor results in the last campaign. &quot;We&apos;ve just been concentrating on getting it right behind the scenes,&quot; says Hayes, who insists she had to implement a new infrastructure to enable the club to move forward. &quot;For me last season was a massive success off the pitch. We progressed players from our centre of excellence \u2013 we finished the season with five centre of excellence players in our line-up, which is a sign of how far we&apos;ve come. I&apos;m a big fan of player development and developing my own players. Our project is different to City and Liverpool, we&apos;re not trying to buy instant success.

I was about to dispatch my second when a greying, pot-bellied man appeared next to me at the bar. I froze. He no longer looked anything like the powerful Brazilian striker who had torn defences to shreds in the 1970 World Cup, one of the stars of the greatest football team of all time. But there was little doubt who he was. &quot;Is that Jairzinho?&quot; I mouthed to the barman. He nodded with a smile. A member of the glorious, beautiful team that lit up the World Cup like none since, Jairzinho was its unstoppable goal machine \u2013 the &quot;Hurricane&quot;, the only player in history to score in every round of the tournament, a feat not even Pel\u00e9, his teammate, got close to. And there he was \u2013 no longer looking much like a hurricane \u2013 but standing next to me at the bar. Starstruck, I blurted out the first thing that came into my head: &quot;Hi! You&apos;re a legend!&quot; &quot;Yeah, I know that,&quot; he replied, as if it was the most obvious thing he&apos;d heard all day. I composed myself enough to offer him a beer (he had one, but paid for his own) and ask him about the football coaching programmes he runs in the city&apos;s favelas, but inside I was aglow. (If you&apos;re not a football fan, this was like having a chat with Jean-Paul Sartre over a pastis in a Parisian cafe.) I was looking forward to many things on my four-day walk across Rio de Janeiro. Thanks to its unique topography and gobsmacking natural beauty, it offers a city walk like nowhere else on earth, taking in a lake, mountains, two of the world&apos;s most famous beaches and some of Brazil&apos;s last remaining virgin Atlantic rainforest, not to mention colonial villages and the biggest favela in Latin America \u2013 all within the city limits. But I&apos;d never dreamed of sharing a beer with a living legend in a scruffy little bar in the arse end of Copacabana. I&apos;d begun my walk eight hours earlier in the spot where Brazil itself had started, or at least came of age and shook off its colonial past. In 1889, at the Imperial Palace in Pra\u00e7a XV, the heart of old Rio, a group of army officers delivered a letter to Dom Pedro II, the Emperor of Brazil descended from Portuguese royalty, with words to the effect: &quot;You know what, mate, I think we can manage our own country on our own from now on. Pack your bags and head back to Europe.&quot; Some of Rio&apos;s most impressive architecture can still be found in and around Pra\u00e7a XV, but it has been throttled by modernity, its colonial charm obliterated by a concrete flyover, now black and decrepit, built directly over the top of it. In the morning rush hour, I got off a bus in a tunnel underneath the square with dozens of commuters, and within seconds was engulfed by thousands more pouring off the ferries from Niteroi, the satellite city across Guanabara Bay, as planes coming in to land at the domestic airport nearby grazed the tops of the boats in the harbour.      The only person I saw not rushing to work was a homeless man standing next to a old disused fountain in the middle of the square. When I asked him about the fountain&apos;s history, he said: &quot;It&apos;s never worked; it&apos;s just for tourists to come and take pictures.&quot; But there were no tourists around and the palace was yet to open, so instead I ducked under an arch, Arco do Teles, to a narrow cobblestone street, where, as a child, Carmen Miranda lived at number 13. If I were true to the spirit of this series of megacity walks \u2013 which has included Mexico City, Shanghai and Tokyo \u2013 I should have headed north from here, through the endless gritty suburbs and poor favelas that are homes to millions in the urbanised and industrial stretch of Rio. (Actually, scratch that. If I were true to this series, I wouldn&apos;t be here at all; I&apos;d be 270 miles away in S\u00e3o Paulo, South America&apos;s largest, most dynamic city \u2013 twice the size of Rio, but not nearly half as much fun.)  Which is why I headed south, through old Rio, towards the natural playgrounds of Copacabana and Ipanema, P\u00e3o de A\u00e7ucar, Corcovado, Cristo and other places that slip off the tongue like a silky bossa nova melody. I had to battle through the morning commuters, but one boy, asleep on the pavement outside a bank, was completely oblivious as passers-by stepped over him. &quot;Is he dead?&quot; one guy asked. A hefty nudge from the bank&apos;s security guard reassured him he wasn&apos;t. The air was already thick with the meaty, garlicky whiff of simmering feij\u00e3o (black beans), the staple that would feed the army of office workers at lunchtime. And by 10am, it was soupy with humidity, too, so I headed for the cool and calm of the Metropolitan Cathedral. From the outside, it looks like an enormous upturned concrete bucket, an example of graceless 70s architecture. But this just made the spectacular interior, of stained-glass windows ascending to the heavens, all the more breathtaking. An effect as awe-inspiring as the grand medieval cathedrals of Europe. Slipping out through the back door, I felt as though I&apos;d walked into in a different city. The office workers had vanished, and the empty, ramshackle streets of Lapa, Rio&apos;s bohemian quarter, were still asleep in the late morning.     Gavin on the Escaderia Selar\u00f3n     Lapa has been the home of Brazilian artists for two centuries, but no one has contributed more to the area than Chilean-born Jorge Selar\u00f3n, whose one-man project, the Escadaria Selar\u00f3n, a flight of 215 mosaic steps, has become a focal point of the neighbourhood. The artist covered every inch of the steps in front of his house in tiles, ceramics and mirrors \u2013 originally in the green, yellow, blue and white of the Brazilian flag, later adding tiles in other colours brought by visitors. At the top of the steps, I turned left and headed to Santa Teresa, a sleepy hillside village of cobblestone streets, colonial houses and artists&apos; studios that feels cut off from the rest of the city. This was the first of several occasions on the walk when I didn&apos;t feel I was in a big city at all. Heading back down the hill, I got my first &quot;wow&quot; moment as I gazed at Botafogo beach on the edge of Guanabara Bay, with Sugarloaf mountain beyond, like a granite spaceship ready for lift-off. This is where the Portuguese fleet arrived on 1 January 1502, hence Rio de Janeiro, (January River) \u2013 they mistook the huge bay for a river delta. Even laced with roads and buildings, it&apos;s a jaw-dropping vista, but I tried to picture what it looked like 500 years ago, the mountains swathed in emerald forest, the beaches ringing to nothing but the sounds of the jungle. It must have been like sailing into Eden. Five minutes later, all notions of tropical paradise vanished as I was confronted by a mash-up of flyovers, tunnels, deafening traffic and pollution \u2013 a natural bottleneck resulting from the granite morros that shoot into the sky all over Rio. There&apos;s no easy way to walk from Botafogo to Zona Sul, the area of Rio with all the famous bits. Until the early 20th century, Rio ended here; Copacabana was an isolated Atlantic fishing village. But once the T\u00fanel Engenheiro Coelho Cintra opened in 1906, the Brazilian middle class started moving south, followed by the rich and famous, who turned the Copacabana Palace into one of the world&apos;s most glamorous hotels. I took the narrow footpath through the six-lane tunnel and saw Copacabana beach beckoning at the other end, but I opted for that cooling beer with Jairzinho rather than a swim. I made my way to the beach afterwards, exhausted but ecstatic, my head full of beer and Brazilian football, and practically danced the two miles back to my hotel, cooling my sore feet in the crashing waves.     Copacabana\u2019s famous wave mosaic motif on the mosa 'Portuguese' pavement. Photograph: Jeremy Walker/Getty Images    Copacabana&apos;s star has long since faded; it is now one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in the world, tightly packed high-rise blocks squeezed between the mountains and the sea, beer-bellied blokes drinking their pensions away and women with small dogs and bad facelifts. Yet the 4km arc of beach still has an irresistible shimmer, a crescent of white sand 100m deep from the water&apos;s edge to the famous wave motif on the black-and-white mosaic pavement. And it&apos;s still where Brazil shows off to the world. When Usain Bolt ran an exhibition race earlier this year, when the Rolling Stones played a free gig, and the new Pope addressed the city, they did it on this beach in front of millions. My hotel, the Sofitel, was at the far, western end of Copacabana, in front of the neighbourhood&apos;s tiny fishing community, a vestige of when this was an isolated hamlet rather than the most famous beach in the world. The next morning, I walked round the corner to the city&apos;s second most famous beach, Ipanema, which was grey and moody, the pointed peaks of the Dois Irm\u00e3os mountains looming over the far end of the beach, shrouded in heavy cloud. (I went back with friends a few days later, when the sun was out, and Rio was at its sultry best. Hundreds of people were meditating \u2013 legs crossed, eyes closed \u2013 on the rocks at Arpoador, at the eastern end of the beach. On the pavement nearby, a busker was playing the saxophone, his hat containing a not inconsiderable amount of cash. This might sound like an everyday scene for a hip city beach, but when I lived in Brazil 20 years ago, people in Rio seemed almost scared to blink lest their bags were snatched from their hands; and the busker&apos;s hat would have been nicked by hoodlums, along with his sax. It&apos;s still not the safest city in the world \u2013 I was warned to stay away from Copacabana and Santa Teresa at night \u2013 but, boosted by the booming economy and double feelgood factor of hosting the World Cup Finals and the Olympics \u2013 Rio feels a far happier, more confident place. Admittedly, I was there before this summer&apos;s riots, but I would argue that the demonstrations were a positive sign of a population confident enough to express its frustration.)     The hillside colonial 'village' of Santa Teresa. Photograph: Luiz Grillo/Getty Images/Flickr RF    But I still had half the city to walk, so I tore myself away from watching locals playing the incredibly skilful hybrid of footvollei on Ipanema, and headed down Rua Vinicius de Moraes, named after the lyricist and bossa nova composer. On the left is Garota de Ipanema (the Girl from Ipanema), the bar where de Moraes wrote the classic song with Tom Jobim in 1962. Despite changing its name (it used to be called Bar Veloso) and being just one block back from the beach, the bar still attracts locals as well as visitors, and does a great steak (go for the picanha, rump cap: it&apos;s the most expensive thing on the menu \u2013 around \u00a325 \u2013 but will serve two or three people). Down the end of the street is the Lagoa, simply &quot;the Lake&quot;, which will host the rowing in the 2016 Olympics. It seems unfair for a city with so many fantastic beaches to be blessed with a beautiful lake too, especially one ringed with imposing black mountains. From the tallest, the 710m Corcovado, straight ahead of me the statue of Christ the Redeemer surveyed the city. After a mile, I turned west through the pleasant but uneventful middle-class suburbs of Leblon and G\u00e1vea. It was a quiet, easy day&apos;s stroll which I cut short to plan the most challenging section of this walk, through Rocinha, one of the biggest favelas in Latin America. Many of the city&apos;s favelas have been &quot;pacified&quot; in recent years and small companies have sprung up offering tours. But when I rang a couple to ask if they had a guide for for a whole day, to take me up the long and winding road through Rocinha, they reacted as if I was slightly mad. So I asked for help at the community centre on the main road at the bottom of the favela. There Dilmar Borges called her grandson Rog\u00e9rio, who came to meet me and agreed to be my guide the following day. So, on day three, I started at sea level and walked back up to where I&apos;d stopped the day before. &quot;A favela is like a mountain: you need to climb it from the bottom,&quot; said Rog\u00e9rio. At the more desirable bottom of the favela, a two-bedroom house can go for R$80,000 (around \u00a322,000). At first it felt like any other working-class Brazilian street, full of nail bars and mobile phone shops, banks and restaurants.

Photograph: Nadia Nightingale; Stuart Dee/Getty Images    But as soon as we hit the dank alleyways off the main drag, the place felt Dickensian. Every thoroughfare was overhung with a black plastic spaghetti of hundreds of internet, telephone and electricity cables. This is how at least 12 million Brazilians live, most in far poorer favelas than Rocinha. It felt otherworldly, but also welcoming and completely safe. This was partly thanks to Rog\u00e9rio, who seemed to know everyone we met on the long, slow climb to the top of the favela. Young children he knew came to say hello and insisted on having their pictures taken with us. Two policemen armed with huge machine guns also said hello, but declined the photo opportunity. The only time I felt in danger was when I was stung by a bee. &quot;See, I told you favelas can be dangerous,&quot; smiled Rog\u00e9rio. He proudly showed me the new, sadly underused, ecological park, and a pristine clay tennis court funded, with little fanfare, by Novak Djokovic. At the top of the morro, we had a drink at Laje Carlinhos (terracetourist.com), a bar on the roof of a small house, with a sweeping view of the whole favela \u2013 a mountain dotted with tens of thousands of tiny houses made of cheap red bricks. Beyond lay the Atlantic, to the right was Pedra da G\u00e1vea, the imposing mountain I was planning to climb the following day. Up a floor, from another improvised rooftop, we looked in the opposite direction to where the Tijuca rainforest climbs up the hillside in a carpet of dark velvety green. From here, the Cristo \u2013 who had watched over my entire walk \u2013 looks down over the city. These views are just as exhilarating as those from the top of Sugarloaf and Corcovado, but free \u2013 and more rewarding given the long slog it took to get here. And, instead of swarms of tourists, the only other person here was the friendly bar owner Senhor Carlinhos, on hand to point out the sights and crack open another cold beer. I said farewell to Rog\u00e9rio at the summit of Rocinha, and in less than five minutes I was walking back down through Alto G\u00e1vea, Rio&apos;s most salubrious suburb. Within touching distance of the favela is the Escola Americana, the most expensive school in town, landscaped into the hillside. Standing on top of a favela full of people living in poverty looking down on a school that charges day fees of over \u00a32,000 a month, it felt like a mad world, but my God, what a beautiful one. On the final day of my walk, I climbed another mountain, but unlike Rocinha, where every crevasse is crammed with humanity, the 844m Pedra da G\u00e1vea, two miles to the west, is stark, empty and covered in some of Brazil&apos;s last remaining Atlantic rainforest, inside the Tijuca national park. I was accompanied by Rob, a Scottish friend who has lived in Rio for nearly 20 years. He says misses the Highlands but I reckon having mountains like this on your doorstep \u2013 which you can climb in the morning and then be back down on the beach in the afternoon \u2013 is ample compensation.     End of the road \u2026 on top of  Pedra da G\u00e1vea, looking back over Rio. Photograph: Paul Edmondson/Getty Images    There are dozens of hiking trails in Rio but only in recent years, as a result of greater affluence and expanding horizons, have locals really started taking advantage of them. The ranger at the start of the trail told us, with some pride, that 200 people had come through already that day. Perhaps because it&apos;s so close to the city, many were woefully unprepared for the hike, wearing cheap trainers and even flip-flops. The near-vertical rock faces were far more challening than I was expecting and \u2013 though it pains me to say it \u2013 I wouldn&apos;t have made it to the top without Rob there to chivvy me along. Luckily the mountain was covered in mist for much of the assent, protecting us from the sun. But as we reached the summit the clouds lifted, revealing the city below bathed in sunlight. To the west was the modern suburb of Barra da Tijuca, Rio&apos;s future, full of shopping malls and Florida-style condos \u2013 and home to many of the venues for the 2016 Olympics \u2013 fringed with sand and sparkling blue sea. To the east, I looked back to the city I&apos;d spent the last four days walking across: the white apartment blocks and favelas seemed tiny and insignificant next to the vast sweep of Copacabana, the ocean and the towering mountains swathed in tropical rainforest. There might be a megacity of 13 million people down there but, from up here at least, it seems that man, despite his best efforts, has barely made a dent on this incredible landscape. \u2022 The trip was provided by British Airways Holidays (0844 493 0787,  ba.com), which offers direct flights from Heathrow and five nights at Sofitel Rio de Janeiro on Copacabana from \u00a31,449, or seven nights from \u00a31,739"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;China has always chafed at Japan&apos;s adiz [air defence identification zone], which at some points is less than 150km from China \u2026 China probably wants to level the playing field with Japan and increase the pressure on Tokyo regarding the disputed islands,&quot; he said.", "US vice-president Joe Biden will visit Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul on a trip beginning this Sunday which is likely to be dominated by discussions of the zone.", "&quot;The international community has ignored the roots of this \u2026 Abe has clearly stated that his fundamental goal is to revise the constitution [under which Japan renounces war] and he needs security tensions to legitimise his efforts.&quot; Tokyo&apos;s military ambitions are particularly sensitive because many in China say Japan has not adequately recognised or atoned for its brutal occupation."], "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "South Korea", "Japan", "US national security", "US news", "Air transport", "South China Sea"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-30T06:36:00Z", "title": "China scrambles fighter jets towards US and Japan planes in airspace", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/29/china-scrambles-fighter-jets-us-japan-aircraft", "article": "     China scrambled fighter jets to investigate US and Japanese aircraft flying through its new air defence zone over the East China Sea on Friday as the regional clamour over the disputed airspace escalated. The ministry of defence announced the move, which is the first time China is known to have sent military aircraft into the zone alongside foreign flights, stepping up its response to the challenge after its unilateral establishment of the zone.  It previously said it had monitored US, Japanese and South Korean aircraft and had flown routine patrols in the area on Thursday. The ministry&apos;s statement said two US reconnaissance aircraft and 10 Japanese early warning, reconnaissance and fighter planes had entered the zone. The airforce &quot;monitored throughout the entire flights, made timely identification and ascertained the types&quot;, defence ministry spokesman Shen Jinke told the official China News Service. The Pentagon has yet to respond to the statement. Japanese officials declined to confirm details of any flights, saying that routine missions were continuing. Late on Friday the US state department advised American commercial airlines to notify Chinese authorities of flight plans over the East China Sea. But a US administration official said that did not mean Washington accepted Beijing&apos;s jurisdiction, the Reuters news agency reported. &quot;The US government generally expects that US carriers operating internationally will operate consistent with Notams [Notices to Airmen] issued by foreign countries,&quot; the state department said in a statement. &quot;Our expectation of operations by US carriers consistent with Notams does not indicate US government acceptance of China&apos;s requirements.&quot; The developments came as South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency said officials were discussing how to expand its own air zone. In Taiwan, legislators issued an unusual joint statement chiding Ma Ying-jeou&apos;s government for its tempered response to China&apos;s announcement of the zone and urging it to lodge a tough protest with Beijing. The government later said it would convey its &quot;stern position&quot;. Earlier the European Union&apos;s foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton expressed its concern that the zone had contributed to tensions in the region, saying that the EU called on all sides to exercise caution and restraint. Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang urged the EU to handle the situation &quot;objectively and rationally&quot;, adding: &quot;European countries can have air defence identification zones. Why can&apos;t China?&quot; While such zones are common, China&apos;s is controversial because it includes the skies over islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, which are the subject of a long-running territorial dispute, and overlaps zones established by Japan and South Korea. There has also been concern over China&apos;s warning that it would take unspecified &quot;emergency defensive measures&quot; if aircraft did not comply. Taylor Fravel, an expert on regional security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said establishment of the zone increased the potential for an incident in the air that could spark a larger crisis. But he said tensions might ease if China continued to clarify the nature of the zone and how it intended to deal with unidentified aircraft, especially those flying through the zone but not heading toward China. &quot;China has always chafed at Japan&apos;s adiz [air defence identification zone], which at some points is less than 150km from China \u2026 China probably wants to level the playing field with Japan and increase the pressure on Tokyo regarding the disputed islands,&quot; he said. Japan does not acknowledge that ownership of the islands is disputed. The US does not have a position on their sovereignty but recognises Japan&apos;s administrative control and has said they are covered by the joint security pact. Many analysts think China is laying down a long-term marker, but did not anticipate the forceful response it has received from the US as well as Japan. &quot;The Chinese government is not going to concede the substance,&quot; said June Teufel Dreyer of the University of Miami. &quot;When circumstances are more conducive, they will try to enforce it more strictly in the future. This is a pattern we have noticed for decades.&quot; Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, Asia-Pacific director at the US Institute of Peace, said the creation of its zone had its own momentum. &quot;The danger in the announcement is that it empowers the People&apos;s Liberation Army, maritime agencies and netizens [internet users] to hold the government to account,&quot; she said. &quot;Now people are transgressing the zone, they have to make it look to the domestic audience like they are serious. They have given birth to internal pressures.&quot; Behind the immediate issues lie regional concerns about China&apos;s growing strength, Beijing&apos;s unease at Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe&apos;s determination to strengthen his country&apos;s forces, and questions about the US presence in and commitment to the region. US vice-president Joe Biden will visit Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul on a trip beginning this Sunday which is likely to be dominated by discussions of the zone. &quot;I think the only problem is Japan because it has taken a confrontational policy. They want clashes and to drag America into military containment against China,&quot; said Yan Xuetong, a foreign relations scholar at Tsinghua University. &quot;The international community has ignored the roots of this \u2026 Abe has clearly stated that his fundamental goal is to revise the constitution [under which Japan renounces war] and he needs security tensions to legitimise his efforts.&quot; Tokyo&apos;s military ambitions are particularly sensitive because many in China say Japan has not adequately recognised or atoned for its brutal occupation."}, {"sentences": ["In Tokyo I discovered a trick that makes even brown paper look instantly luxurious."], "tags": ["Christmas", "Miranda Hart", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-01T00:05:00Z", "title": "How to survive Christmas", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/01/how-to-survive-christmas", "article": "How to tell a Christmas cracker joke by Miranda Hart I am crackers about crackers.

For example, my sister once got hysterical at this: &quot;Who delivers presents to cats? Santa Paws.&quot; We can&apos;t ruin what we think are rubbish jokes for those who find the simpler things amusing in life (a kind way to describe my sister!). And don&apos;t do that thing of starting the joke: &quot;What does Santa suffer from if he gets stuck in a chimney?&quot; Then go: &quot;Come on, oh you can guess it, come on.&quot; The joke suddenly turns in to some terrifying quiz that you feel stupid for not getting. &quot;Claustrophobia.&quot; Oh yes, right, of course, should have got it. The only way to deliver a Christmas joke is with the joy and merriment of a six-year-old so everyone cheers on the delivery and the Christmas spirit is fully maintained. Or like my father \u2013 who gets hysterical as he reads it out, for no reason at all, and then we all get hysterical at him being hysterical. Either way, laughter ensues. And we all need laughter.Miranda Hart is co-hosting a Christmas programme with Jon Holmes on Radio 2 on 23 December, from 2-5pm.

Photograph: Katherine Rose for the Observer    There are two obvious tactics for winning at Trivial Pursuit. The first is to take a keen lifelong interest in Art, Literature, Sport, Leisure, Entertainment, History, Geography, Science and Nature. A shortcut would be to watch Pointless every day. That&apos;s what I do. Secondly, cheat. This is easy in Triv, because you can just read all of the answers beforehand. It is made even simpler by the fact that everyone you&apos;re playing against is drunk. But let&apos;s assume you have left it too late to try option one, and you are too terrific a\u00a0human being to countenance option two. Here are some tactics that might give you the edge. Remember that there have been many versions of Triv. If you are over 50 make sure you are playing with the 1984 version, where the answers all tend to be Jack Nicholson, Michael Foot or Spandau Ballet. If you are under 25 go for the most recent version and rely on the fact that Uncle Keith won&apos;t have heard of twerking or Heston Blumenthal. Also remember that you will not win Triv without answering a question on a category chosen by your opponents. Therefore at all times try to hide which subject is your weakest. Mine is Science and Nature. Or is it? Thirdly, learn a few lists. My tips would be Oscar -winning films, kings and queens of England and capital cities of the world. If you know everything on these lists, people will think you are clever for the rest of your life. And if all that fails, then the answer is probably Charlotte Bront\u00eb.

Photograph: Suki Dhanda  for the Observer    Getting the most out of New Year&apos;s Eve in a restaurant is a tricky business. There are restaurants opening for the night across Britain, from the glorious fish brasserie Ondine in Edinburgh to Le Manoir in Berkshire to half of London&apos;s flashest eateries, but they&apos;ll make you pay for it. At Le Manoir it&apos;s \u00a3370 for dinner per person, or up to \u00a34,380 for two people for two nights. Sushisamba, in the City of London, looks like a bargain by comparison: \u00a3275 for a night-long party. And so it goes on: \u00a3115 for three courses at Bar Boulud, \u00a3130 at Tom Aikens, \u00a3160 for a coveted place at the Kitchen Table at the back of Bubbledogs. The real issue is getting in, unless you&apos;re the sort of person who sorts New Year&apos;s Eve in June, and who wants to be them? All hope is not lost. Christmas is such a\u00a0tense and complicated time for families and lovers that some who were looking forward to spending New Year&apos;s together find by 29 December that they now detest each other. They are more likely to stuff their forks into each other&apos;s eyes than eat with them. So the best time to pick up a\u00a0cancellation is probably 30 December. Got anything better to do with your time on that dreary day than sit on the phone? I\u00a0doubt it. A lot of places are doing two sittings, with the early one being at a knock-down price. The New Year&apos;s sitting at Tom Aikens from 6.30pm for two hours is a full \u00a350 cheaper. At Bistrot Bruno Loubet the early menu is \u00a350. Is any of it cheap? Of course not, and reasonably so. The biggest cost is all those people not celebrating New Year&apos;s Eve so they can serve you. How to wrap presents with flair by Jane Means     How to get ahead with your paperwork.    In Tokyo I discovered a trick that makes even brown paper look instantly luxurious. Begin by creating pleats along your wrapping paper, pinching and folding it over in small amounts. When you&apos;ve staggered pleats along the paper, stick some Sellotape across them, on the underside, to stop the paper from stretching. This works best for wrapping boxes and flat items. Wrap the box as normal, and add a simple ribbon.Jane Means is a gift wrapping expert; get her DVD The Art of Gift Wrapping for a special price of \u00a310 using the discount code &apos;OB13&apos; (janemeans.com) How to sing carols by Alfie Boe     Alfie Boe hits the high notes. Photograph: Richard Saker    Song choice is key. The fast patter songs \u2013 things like &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot; \u2013 can be quite tricky when you&apos;ve had a few sherries. &quot;Ding Dong Merrily on High&quot; can have you leaning to one side on the &quot;Glo-or-oria&quot; chorus, so you want a nice big breath before that bit. And don&apos;t go for anything with too many verses \u2013 the professionals have autocue; you&apos;ll just forget. Sing the words with meaning, and pronounce every syllable if you want to seem polished. But if you&apos;re really struggling, the main thing is that your mouth is opening and closing and that you&apos;re making some noise. A carol is like singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;: everybody&apos;s got to do it, so man up and do it\u00a0properly. No ad libs. Stick to the classics. No\u00a0Justin Bieber&apos;s &quot;Mistletoe&quot;, however much the kids might want it. If in doubt, substitute the words. Rude versions can work very well. Shepherds watching their flocks becomes shepherds washing their socks for kids. There&apos;s also another word that rhymes with flocks and socks which I won&apos;t mention here but you can Google it. Rewrite the whole song and you&apos;ve started the party. And if you&apos;re going up against competitive carollers, remember: it all comes down to your woollen scarf and bobble hat. Both are obligatory, of course.Alfie Boe&apos;s album, Trust, is out on Decca Records.

Photograph: Karen Robinson    For many, dread, not delight, is the primary emotion sparked by the festive season. &quot;Tis the season to be jolly&quot;, allegedly, but it&apos;s the conscientious objectors of popular fiction who sum up the reality of this most commercialised of religious festivals. Scrooge feared profligate spending and the Grinch dreaded hammy happiness \u2013 both reach epidemic levels at this time. As desperate shops ratchet up the seasonal cheer, the most terrifying threat has to be the invasion of intolerable siblings, meddling mother-in-laws, hysterical children, grumpy parents, ghastly uncles and aunts, feral nieces and nephews. For most of us it&apos;s a holiday experience to endure, not enjoy, but with a few behavioural tweaks you, too, can survive this annual emotional Armageddon. First, reduce exposure \u2013 halve the time you spend with family and you can halve the arguments. Even in the most acrimonious of environments it usually takes 12 hours to kick off. Also, spend less. Cut down on the amount you spend on gifts and you&apos;ll decrease your resentment levels. Finally, create a diversion \u2013 bring a box set in which you can all immerse yourselves when civil conversation becomes a challenge. I&apos;d also recommend that you stock up on Kalms, the herbal alternative to Class A drugs, and try to remember: these people are only human \u2013 even if particularly annoying examples of the species. If all else fails, you could turn to the Bible \u2013 in 1 Corinthians 10:12 you&apos;ll find good advice: &quot;This, too, will pass.&quot; How to put up Christmas decorations by Matthew Williamson     Matthew Williamson and Gwyneth Paltrow at the Kids Company dinner.

Countries are becoming less reliant on each other. They show a willingness to use currency manipulation as an economic tool. Surreptitious protectionism is being deployed. For the most part these developments are happening below the radar, which is why it has been possible to ignore them. That will not be the case this week when trade ministers from 159 countries meet in Bali in the hopes of salvaging something from 12 years of so far fruitless talks. Bali matters. At stake is not just the future of the World Trade Organisation, but the way and for whom the global economy is governed. There is everything to play for when the WTO ministerial meeting begins on Tuesday. Trade ministers have travelled far and wide in search of a deal. In 1999, talks called to launch a new round in Seattle were the story of bad blood at the negotiating table and riots on the streets. It took a burst of international solidarity after 9/11 to launch the talks in Doha two years later. Cancun in 2003 saw a further setback as a group of the leading developing countries made it clear that they were not prepared to accept the usual stitch-up organised by the US and the European Union. Now it is make or break time. When the talks began in 2001 the talk was of opening up new fronts in trade liberalisation, cutting tariffs and tearing down protectionist barriers in services and agriculture just as they had been progressively in manufacturing in the decades after the second world war. All that&apos;s left now of the original agenda is a proposal to cut trade red tape and root out corruption at borders, coupled with the promise of easier access to western markets for the world&apos;s least developed nations. But even the low-hanging fruit is proving hard to pick. Developing countries say they will need time and money to improve their customs practices, while western nations say that without a trade facilitation deal they will not sign off on better access to their markets for exports from the poorest countries. A bigger problem may be India&apos;s insistence that it be allowed to stockpile subsidised grain to ensure food security. The Americans are unhappy about providing an open-ended commitment. The package on the table would have little real impact on the global economy. On the other hand, failure this week would be a disaster for the WTO, which might continue as the court where trade disputes are settled but would cease to exist as a forum for serious trade liberalisation talks. Already, the bigger global players are seeking to cut their own side deals, seeing that as easier than the tortuous process of getting agreement at the WTO. Washington and Brussels almost certainly underestimate the time and effort it will take to forge their transatlantic trade partnership, but frustration with the WTO process means that&apos;s where the political energy already is. A big fat zero in Bali could easily result in the EU and the US giving up on multilateral negotiations completely. So how did it come to this? Well, let&apos;s start by turning the clock back to Geneva in December 1993, when Peter Sutherland, the then head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, ended the Uruguay round of trade liberalisation talks. It was four years after the end of the cold war, two years since the collapse of the Soviet Union. China and India were opening their economies up and Russia was being given free-market shock treatment. It was the high noon of liberalisation. Even so, completing the Uruguay round was no picnic. It took seven years and was only brought to a conclusion after the G7 took a hand at its 1993 summit in Tokyo. Few though would have suspected that the world would still be waiting for a successor to the Uruguay round two decades later. There was no desire to launch another round immediately, and the priority by the end of the 1990s was to secure China&apos;s entry into the WTO, something that coincided with the launch of the Doha round in November 2001. But since then, there have been a number of developments that have made it much harder to secure an agreement. The first is the impact of the financial crisis and the recession that followed. This has made countries more inward-looking and cautious about opening up their markets to foreign competition. A second has been rising energy prices, which have pushed up the cost of transporting goods around the world and made offshoring less attractive. A third has been the growing prosperity of China, where labour costs are still low in comparison with those in the west but not as low as they were a decade ago. James Carrick, economist at Legal &amp; General, says: &quot;Since 2006, the ratio of global imports to production has moved sideways. In other words, a product bought today is using the same proportion of domestic and foreign components as a product bought six years ago. This is in sharp contrast to the prior two decades of globalisation, when more and more of the goods we bought were made overseas. &quot;The pause in import penetration has not just happened in weak economies like the UK and the euro area, but has been most pronounced in China \u2013 the strongest economy \u2013 as well as the relatively robust US.&quot; Carrick says closer integration of economies in the 1990s was associated with cheaper imports into the west from China and other emerging economies, so a stalling of globalisation can be expected to lead to higher global inflation. The stalling may not be temporary. Technological trends suggest the world will become more integrated; political trends point in the opposite direction. In the west, globalisation is not associated with cheaper imports but with manufacturing jobs being lost to offshoring and service sector jobs threatened by cheap migrant labour. Few voters will be impressed by warnings from business groups that failure in Bali will mean throwing away the possibility of a $1tn boost to the global economy. That&apos;s only partly because the $1tn figure is made up; it&apos;s also because the public now associates increased integration with falling wages and job insecurity. Precedent suggests that if there is a $1tn boost to the global economy on offer, the benefits will accrue to capital as higher profits rather than to labour in the form of higher pay or lower prices. Free trade is seen as a racket dominated by a particular class interest. Unless that changes and the fruits are more equitably shared, the WTO will continue to stumble from crisis to crisis and globalisation will remain a dirty word."}, {"sentences": ["And though the cast clearly knew that the stars were the cars, the presence of Diesel and Walker proved so integral to the formula that it became imperative to reunite them, after Diesel was absent from the second film 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), and Walker from the third, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) \u2013 with those pictures proving to be the least commercially successful of the series."], "tags": ["Paul Walker", "Film", "Action and adventure", "Culture", "US news", "Los Angeles"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-01T18:09:42Z", "title": "Paul Walker obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/01/paul-walker", "article": "Paul Walker, who has died aged 40 in a car accident, combined unthreatening star charisma with preppy good looks and a canny commercial sensibility.

While the US and Japan have made a public show of unity following China\u2019s demand last week that all aircraft passing over a disputed island chain identify themselves to Beijing, American and Japanese aviation authorities are adopting divergent positions over whether civilian flights should comply with the Chinese demand. Biden, who arrived in Tokyo late Monday night local time, now has the task of reassuring Japanese and South Korean allies over their fraught confrontation with China about its expansive so-called \u201cair defense identification zone.\u201d The issue is likely to overshadow a week-long trip to the three Asian countries that US officials had hoped would focus on economic affairs. \u201cI believe this latest incident underscores the need for agreement between China and Japan to establish crisis management and confidence-building measures to lower tensions,\u201d Biden said in an interview with Japan\u2019s Asahi Shimbun newspaper on the eve of his arrival. The dispute over the Japanese-controlled islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, began nine days ago when Beijing unilaterally declared its enlarged air defense identification zone. The Chinese defense ministry ordered all aircraft flying through the zone to notify Chinese authorities, warning that it would it would &quot;identify, monitor, control and react to&quot; any air threats or unidentified flying objects coming from the sea. Washington has not taken a formal position on the sovereignty of the islands. However, it recognises Tokyo&apos;s administrative control, and said explicitly last week that its treaty to defend Japan militarily applies to the islands. The US, in its most direct challenge to Chinese military endeavors in two decades, flew two B-52 bombers through the zone without notifying the Chinese. The US navy has sent P-8 Poseidon patrol aircraft to Japan, a long-planned move that gives the allies greater ability to track hostile submarines and other naval ships in Japanese waters. But Washington and Tokyo have appeared out of sync on the appropriate response that civilian aircraft should take to the newly-declared Chinese zone. Japan\u2019s civilian and commercial aviation companies are defying the Chinese air defense identification zone, declining to give the Chinese prior notification of any passage through the disputed air space. Following Washington\u2019s lead, Tokyo has sent military aircraft, including F-15 fighter jets and Awacs surveillance planes, directly through the claimed Chinese zone. For Japan, which has recently reopened debate on its formal post-second world war pacifist defense policies, it has been a notably aggressive response. In contrast, the US Federal Aviation Administration instructed aircraft to comply with the Chinese identification demand in the interest of safety, even as US officials insist they do not recognize the legitimacy of China\u2019s air declaration. The discrepancy has roiled Japan, despite Washington\u2019s repeated insistence last week that its commitment to Japanese security is beyond question. The Japanese TV station NHK quoted a former senior foreign ministry official, Yukia Okimoto, saying the US \u201churt Japan\u2019s interests over an issue related directly to Japan\u2019s national security in a way visible to the whole world.\u201d Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, said he would \u201cdeal with the matter by coordinating closely\u201d with Biden, who will visit Beijing on Wednesday and meet with China\u2019s president Xi Jinping. The US vice-president\u2019s trip enables him to have face-to-face contact with all the regional players with a stake in the controversy, including South Korea, where he will spend two days meeting senior government officials. South Korea, which has strained relations with Japan, is also being sucked into the dispute. Local reports indicate that Seoul is in the final stages of expanding its own six-decade-old air defense identification zone southward, which would overlap with territory claimed by China. The move comes after a defense consultation last week between China and South Korea failed to reassure Seoul that China\u2019s expanded zone was aimed exclusively at Japan. China\u2019s military is immature by the standards of the US. But the pace of change and increase in military spending in China has been rapid, causing deep concern in the region and in Washington over Chinese intentions, which Biden will seek to test during his talks in Beijing. The Chinese move, coupled with the evident disparity between American and Japanese responses, has prompted an escalation in a region home to three of the world\u2019s largest economies, further complicating the Obama administration\u2019s message that the US is itself a Pacific power, and one that has an unshakable commitment to the security of its allies. It is unclear if Biden will attempt to mediate between China, Japan and South Korea. Aides to the vice-president told reporters last week that Biden would seek only \u201cclarity\u201d from China about its military intentions, but declined to say that he would call for China to reverse its declaration, which Japan is seeking. China has thus far shown no signs of retreating over the zone. It announced that it scrambled its own fighter jets in the air defense identification zone on Friday, an intended challenge to the US and Japan. But the Japanese defense ministry sharply questioned whether the Chinese jets ever actually passed through the zone, issuing a statement saying it spotted no additional air traffic in the area."}, {"sentences": ["Inevitably, the move has provoked major regional angst, and Biden will emphasise the need for calm in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul in coming days.", "The EU and United States have urged caution to calm regional tensions, and this will be a theme Biden will emphasise in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul.", "Tokyo&apos;s goal here is to bring enhanced international scrutiny to this issue in a bid to undercut Beijing."], "tags": ["China", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "US national security", "Air transport", "US military", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-02T17:48:24Z", "title": "China's bellicose declarations aren't helping its quest to be a superpower | Andrew Hammond", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/02/china-air-defence-zone-asian-crisis", "article": "US Vice-President Joe Biden meets with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe tomorrow at the start of a key Asia trip that will also take him to China and South Korea (including the Demilitarized Zone). The original rationale for Biden&apos;s mission was re-assuring US allies about Washington&apos;s commitment to the region following Barack Obama&apos;s cancelled trip in October at the time of the US federal government shutdown. However, a more pressing purpose has now arisen following China&apos;s decision last week to declare a new &quot;self defence identification zone&quot;. Inevitably, the move has provoked major regional angst, and Biden will emphasise the need for calm in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul in coming days. The zone covers an area of land and sea that encompasses islands, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in Chinese, that both countries claim as their own. The dispute over the islands dates back at least three decades, but has become much more heated since last year when the Japanese government decided to nationalise them. Since the declaration of the air defence zone last week, Beijing has insisted that all flights, civilian and military alike, must submit flight plans before entering. The EU and United States have urged caution to calm regional tensions, and this will be a theme Biden will emphasise in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul. In response to China&apos;s declaration, the Obama administration has recommended that US commercial aircraft report their flight plans into Beijing, although US military aircraft continue to operate without notification. Meanwhile, Japan (which also continues to operate flights in the zone) announced on 30 November that it has asked the UN organisation overseeing civil aviation to examine whether the zone could undermine aviation safety. Tokyo&apos;s goal here is to bring enhanced international scrutiny to this issue in a bid to undercut Beijing. While air zones of this nature are commonplace across the world, there is concern that China has both imposed this measure unilaterally and warned that it will take unspecified &quot;emergency defensive measures&quot; if aircraft do not comply with submitting flight plans (already, it has frayed some nerves by scrambling fighter jets to investigate US and Japanese aircraft in the zone). Whatever Beijing&apos;s motives in declaring the zone, it will add to the growing international tide of suspicion and sometimes even outright hostility, as China increasingly asserts its growing power. The central challenge the country faces here is that its soft power \u2013 its ability to win the hearts and minds of other nations and influence their governments through attraction rather than coercion or payment \u2013 has lagged far behind its hard power built on its growing economic and military might. In Japan, for instance, public favourability toward China fell from 34% to 15% between 2012 and 2011, according to Pew Global, largely in response to China&apos;s new international assertiveness. Meanwhile, in the United States, public favourability toward China fell to 40% in 2012 from 51% in 2011. Issues such as Beijing&apos;s alleged currency manipulation, the large size of the US trade deficit with China, and the large US financial debt held by Beijing, not to mention alleged Chinese cyber attacks on US interests, has taken its toll on US public opinion. With distrust of China growing, many countries in Asia Pacific are actively strengthening their diplomatic alliances, particularly with Washington, in a bid to balance Beijing&apos;s growing economic and military strength. This is a political headache the new Chinese leadership could do without, and it must now think hard about how to enhance the country&apos;s image in the world. Most immediately, Beijing must restart a process of addressing concerns of foreign governments about its intentions. Here, it needs to intensify efforts to be seen as a responsible, peaceful power, and then match this rhetoric with actions. President Xi Jinping made a good start toward this goal in his landmark summit with President Barack Obama last summer. He pledged to form a &quot;new model of co-operation&quot; and said:   China and the United States must find a new path ... one that is different from the inevitable confrontation and conflict between the major countries of the past.  As the Pew Global data indicates, China&apos;s international image would also benefit from enhanced public diplomacy to win more foreign &quot;hearts and minds&quot;. At a symbolic level, example measures might include utilising the country&apos;s growing capabilities in space travel for high-profile international cooperation projects. Surveys underline that many around the world admire China&apos;s strength in science and technology. A related problem is that international communications of Chinese state institutions often lack legitimacy and credibility with foreigners. One solution might be expanding the numbers of non-state groups \u2013 including from civil society networks, diaspora communities, student and academic groups and business networks \u2013 involved in the country&apos;s diplomatic outreach. For many foreign publics, there also needs to be stronger Chinese commitment to domestic political change, transparency and concrete steps towards democratisation. Many in the international community are likely to remain wary of the country while it clamps down on its own citizens seeking domestic reform, including human rights activists. Taken overall, the challenges ahead for China are deep-seated and will require sustained investment and significant reform. However, unless they are tackled, the country&apos;s reputation problems will increasingly disable its ambitions as a rising superpower."}, {"sentences": ["The explicit request for China to \u201crescind\u201d threats against unannounced aircraft passing over a chain of islands in the East China sea was made by the US just hours after Biden landed in Tokyo ahead of a six-day trip to Japan, China and South Korea.", "Biden, who was met at Tokyo airport by Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of former president John F Kennedy and recently appointed ambassador to Japan, is expected to attempt to defuse the controversy during his visit.", "However, it recognises Tokyo&apos;s administrative control, and said explicitly last week that its treaty to defend Japan militarily applies to territory around the islands.", "Following Washington\u2019s lead, Tokyo has sent military aircraft, including F-15 fighter jets and Awacs surveillance planes, directly through the claimed Chinese zone."], "tags": ["Obama administration", "US news", "China", "Japan", "World news", "Senkaku Islands", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T06:43:49Z", "title": "US calls on China to rescind air defence zone to avoid Japan confrontation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/us-china-rescind-air-defence-zone-confrontation-japan", "article": "The US called on China to scrap its newly declared air defence identification zone on Monday, warning that Beijing risked a potentially dangerous confrontation with Japan and its allies at the start of a trip to the region by vice-president Joe Biden. The explicit request for China to \u201crescind\u201d threats against unannounced aircraft passing over a chain of islands in the East China sea was made by the US just hours after Biden landed in Tokyo ahead of a six-day trip to Japan, China and South Korea. \u201cThe fact that China\u2019s announcement has caused confusion and increased the risk of accidents only further underscores the validity of concerns and the need for China to rescind the procedures,\u201d said Jen Psaki, the chief spokesperson for the State Department. Biden, who was met at Tokyo airport by Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of former president John F Kennedy and recently appointed ambassador to Japan, is expected to attempt to defuse the controversy during his visit. Senior diplomats privately concede that the dispute over the airspace above the islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, will almost entirely dominate Biden\u2019s trip, which had been intended to focus on US economic interests in the region. The row began nine days ago when Beijing unilaterally declared the enlarged air defence identification zone. The Chinese defence ministry ordered all aircraft flying through the zone to notify Chinese authorities in advance, warning that it would &quot;identify, monitor, control and react to&quot; any air threats or unidentified flying objects coming from the sea. \u201cThat kind of coercive, strong language is worrisome, and we hope it is not tested,\u201d a senior government official from the region told the Guardian, echoing growing concern about the possible risk of an accidental confrontation that spirals out of control. The official said one possible scenario would see military aircraft scrambled simultaneously by China and the US, and possibly Japan too, meeting in the air. Another would be that China feels the need to intercept an aircraft that enters the contested airspace without prior notice. \u201cMishaps and miscalculations can happen, particularly if aircraft are scrambled to intercept an aircraft. You never know how these situations can unfold.\u201d Japanese airlines passing through the military zone declared by China are not currently informing Beijing of their flight plans. However, aircraft associated with other countries, including those flown by US and South Korean airlines, are submitting information to the Chinese, after domestic civil aviation authorities advised it was in the interest of safety. Psaki stressed that the guidance to airlines from the Federal Aviation Authority \u201cin no way indicates\u201d US acceptance of China\u2019s declaration. She said China had made the declaration \u201cin an uncoordinated fashion\u201d which was \u201cinconsistent with standard practice\u201d, adding the US did not believe the declaration to be legitimate. Her remarks were echoed by the White House. &quot;This is about the safety and security of passengers and is not, in any way, indication of a change in our position,\u201d said spokesman Jay Carney. \u201cThis appears to be a provocative attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the the East China sea and thus raises tensions and increases the risk of inadvertent confrontation.\u201d On Tuesday the Chinese envoy to the Philippines added to tensions, saying Beijing had a sovereign right to establish a maritime air defence zone over other regions. When asked to comment about concerns that China might set up a similar zone over the South China Sea \u2013\u00a0where it has disputes with the Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam \u2013 Ma Keqing said it was the Chinese government&apos;s right to decide &quot;where and when to set up the new air identification zone&quot;.\u00a0Ma said the East China Sea zone&apos;s designation &quot;will not hinder any normal freedom of flights within this area if they&apos;ve notified the Chinese authorities&quot;. The US ambassador to Manila, Philip Goldberg, described China&apos;s move as dangerous. &quot;We do not believe that this is a move intended to build confidence or in any other way improve the situation,&quot; he said. Instead, China&apos;s new zone &quot;will create tension and the possibility of miscalculations and that&apos;s never good&quot;. Biden, who arrived in Japan late on Monday night, is now tasked with delicate role of attempting to cool tensions. \u201cI believe this latest incident underscores the need for agreement between China and Japan to establish crisis management and confidence-building measures to lower tensions,\u201d the vice-president said in an interview with Japan\u2019s Asahi Shimbun newspaper on the eve of his arrival. Washington has not taken a formal position on the sovereignty of the islands. However, it recognises Tokyo&apos;s administrative control, and said explicitly last week that its treaty to defend Japan militarily applies to territory around the islands. The US, in its most direct challenge to Chinese military endeavours in two decades, flew two B-52 bombers through the zone without notifying the Chinese. The US navy has sent P-8 Poseidon patrol aircraft to Japan, a long-planned move that gives the allies greater ability to track hostile submarines and other naval ships in Japanese waters. Following Washington\u2019s lead, Tokyo has sent military aircraft, including F-15 fighter jets and Awacs surveillance planes, directly through the claimed Chinese zone. For Japan, which has recently reopened debate on its formal post-second world war pacifist defence policies, it has been a notably aggressive response. However the decision by US aviation authorities to advise airlines to comply with China\u2019s requests has roiled Japan, despite Washington\u2019s repeated insistence last week that its commitment to Japanese security is beyond question. The Japanese TV station NHK quoted a former senior foreign ministry official, Yukia Okimoto, saying the US \u201churt Japan\u2019s interests over an issue related directly to Japan\u2019s national security in a way visible to the whole world\u201d. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, said he would \u201cdeal with the matter by co-ordinating closely\u201d with Biden, who will visit Beijing on Wednesday and meet with China\u2019s president Xi Jinping. The vice-president is known to have a particularly good relationship with Xi, formed over several years. Biden\u2019s trip enables him to have face-to-face contact with all the regional players with a stake in the controversy, including South Korea, where he will spend two days meeting senior government officials at the end of the week. South Korea, which has strained relations with Japan, is also being sucked into the dispute. Local reports indicate that Seoul is in the final stages of expanding its own six-decade-old air defense identification zone southward, which would overlap with territory claimed by China. The move comes after a defense consultation last week between China and South Korea failed to reassure Seoul that China\u2019s expanded zone was aimed exclusively at Japan. The senior government official said one unintended consequence of China\u2019s declaration could be that Japan and South Korea, rivals undergoing a particularly strained relations at the moment, will be brought closer together. The official said the two countries were expected to \u201ccompare notes\u201d over how to respond to China\u2019s move \u2013 and high-level meetings between the two countries remain a possibility. It is unclear if Biden will attempt to mediate between China, Japan and South Korea. Aides to the vice-president told reporters last week that Biden would seek only \u201cclarity\u201d from China about its military intentions, but declined to say that he would call for China to reverse its declaration, which Japan is seeking. China has thus far shown no signs of retreating over the zone. It announced that it scrambled its own fighter jets in the air defence identification zone on Friday, an intended challenge to the US and Japan. But the Japanese defense ministry sharply questioned whether the Chinese jets ever actually passed through the zone, issuing a statement saying it spotted no additional air traffic in the area.

His comments came at the start of a week-long trip that will be dominated by rising tensions between China and Japan over a territorial dispute. Biden, who will visit Japan, China and South Korea, is seeking to avoid escalation in the dispute, which intensified late last month when Beijing imposed an air defence identification zone (Adiz)] in an area of the East China Sea that includes the Senkaku islands \u2013 known as the Diaoyu islands in China \u2013 which Japan and China both lay claim to. Washington has been downplaying reports of disagreements between the US and Japan over the issue; a senior administration official travelling with Biden insisted there was &quot;no daylight&quot; between the two countries. Earlier in the day, Biden told reporters in Tokyo that the US-Japanese security arrangement was &quot;the cornerstone of security not merely in the Pacific basic but the cornerstone upon which our security is built for the next 20 years or more&quot;. Biden is accompanied on the Japanese-leg of the trip by Caroline Kennedy, the newly appointed US ambassador. A second senior official said the US intended to call on China to &quot;exercise restraint&quot; and &quot;avoid any other destabilising actions&quot;, including a new declarations of air defence zones. However, Biden and officials travelling with him have stopped short of calling on Beijing to &quot;rescind&quot; its declaration \u2013 a demand made by the state department on Monday. Speaking in Tokyo at the start of a visit that was supposed to have focused on strengthening economic ties between the US and the region, Biden said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about China&apos;s abrupt imposition of the zone, saying it would raise regional tensions and increase the risk of accidents and miscalculation. Biden said he would raise US concerns with &quot;great specificity&quot; when he met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing later this week. He stopped short of calling on Beijing to scrap the zone, calling for better communication between Japan and China, whose leaders have not held official talks since taking office. But he said China&apos;s move had &quot;raised regional tensions and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculation&quot;. China insisted it would not rescind the procedures governing the air defence zone, despite US calls for it to do so. &quot;The fact that China&apos;s announcement has caused confusion and increased the risk of accidents only further underscores the validity of concerns and the need for China to rescind the procedures,&quot; Jen Psaki, the chief spokeswoman for the state department, said on Monday. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, described the Chinese announcement of the zone nine days ago as &quot;a provocative attempt to unilaterally change the status quo&quot; that increased the risk of\u00a0inadvertent confrontation. While many countries \u2013 including the US and Japan \u2013 have similar zones, China&apos;s is controversial because it includes airspace over the disputed islands. But on Tuesday the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, told reporters: &quot;It is not China that has escalated the regional tensions. It is that some countries keep playing on the issue for their selfish gains, and China is firmly opposed to them doing that.&quot;\u00a0 Hong urged other countries to respect China&apos;s actions, which he described as &quot;justifiable and lawful&quot;. He added: &quot;China established it [the zone] to safeguard sovereignty and the freedom and order of flight in the related airspace.&quot; Concerns have grown of an accidental confrontation that could escalate. China said last week it had scrambled jets to monitor flights in the airspace by the US and Japan. But Shen Dingli, an expert at Fudan University in Shanghai on US-China relations, said: &quot;The US has not sent armed aircraft \u2026 China in turn does not send its fighters to fly towards B-52s.&quot; He added: &quot;There is no need to resolve the dispute: the dispute does not exist.\u00a0The US is messing around by not observing China&apos;s unilateral action. But in a similar way, China will soon be in a position to reciprocate by not observing [the US] Adiz.&quot; China&apos;s defence ministry said in a statement posted on its website on Tuesday that countries whose aircraft were not reporting their flight plans to China were &quot;irresponsible&quot;. But it added\u00a0that China considered the zone to be one of co-operation rather than confrontation. The zone covers more than 600 miles from north to south, above international waters separating China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. China says all aircraft entering the zone must notify the Chinese authorities beforehand or face unspecified &quot;emergency defensive measures&quot;. The rules apply to all aircraft passing through the zone, not just those heading towards Chinese airspace. Japan and the US believe the zone is an attempt by China to assert control over the islands. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he and Biden had &quot;confirmed we should not tolerate any attempt by China to change the status quo unilaterally by force&quot;. Biden flew into Tokyo late on Monday faced with the delicate task of avoiding provoking China while demonstrating support for Japan, its main ally in a region already nervous about Chinese naval aggression and North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. Behind US pleas for Japan and China to reduce tensions lie fears that an accident or miscalculation could quickly escalate into armed conflict. The US raised hackles in Tokyo when it emerged that three US civilian airlines, acting on government advice, were complying with Chinese regulations and identifying their aircraft before flying through the zone. US officials insisted, however, that the move did &quot;not indicate US government acceptance of China&apos;s requirements&quot;. To underline Washington&apos;s opposition, two B-52 bombers flew into the area last week without notifying Chinese authorities. Japanese and South Korean military jets also flew through the zone in defiance of Chinese regulations. But the decision to advise US civilian airlines to comply was less than the unequivocal show of support that Japan had hoped for. Japan, by contrast, has urged Japanese airlines to ignore China&apos;s demands to submit flight plans in advance. &quot;China&apos;s declaration of an air defence identification zone is an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo, which can invite unexpected situations and is an extremely dangerous act,&quot; Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters before Biden&apos;s meeting with Abe. &quot;Japan and the United States share the position that China&apos;s Adiz is unacceptable \u2026 I think [Biden] will head to China to discuss various issues, including this, with his understanding of Japan&apos;s position.&quot; On Monday, Chinese officials attempted to exploit divergences in the approaches of Washington and Tokyo. Hong Lei, a foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in Beijing the US had showed a &quot;constructive attitude&quot; but dismissed Japan&apos;s &quot;erroneous actions&quot;. In an editorial, the Global Times, a tabloid published by the Chinese Communist party&apos;s official People&apos;s Daily, cautioned Biden against offering unrestrained support for Japan&apos;s position on the air defence zone. &quot;The only choice he has if he wants a successful trip [to China] is not to go too far in his words over there,&quot; it said. &quot;If he openly supports Tokyo and wants to &apos;send an expedition to punish&apos; Beijing, the Chinese people won&apos;t accept it.&quot;\u00a0 Washington has refused to take sides in the simmering dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, a strategically important archipelago surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potentially large gas and mineral deposits. But the US recognises Japan&apos;s administrative control over the territories \u2013 reinforced just over a year ago, when Japan&apos;s government effectively nationalised the islands \u2013 and is obliged by its bilateral security treaty with Japan to defend its ally, should the diplomatic row escalate."}, {"sentences": ["A more plausible outcome is tacit agreement from Tokyo and Beijing on what sort of behaviour is acceptable in the area \u2013 for now at least."], "tags": ["Asia Pacific", "US news", "China", "World news", "Japan", "Obama administration"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T18:36:31Z", "title": "Asia economic talks on back burner as US  mediates China air defence row", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/03/asia-economic-talks-air-defence-row-biden", "article": "Joe Biden\u2019s trip to Asia was supposed to focus on economic co-operation.

A more plausible outcome is tacit agreement from Tokyo and Beijing on what sort of behaviour is acceptable in the area \u2013 for now at least.\u00a0 But China sees the US as anything but a neutral arbiter.

In the background are broader questions about influence in the Asia Pacific region as a rising power exerts itself to the concern of neighbours and faces the world\u2019s only superpower. The US and Japan have a joint defence pact, but some diplomats suspect China does not believe the US is truly committed to backing up its ally. At the same time, the US hopes to prevent the tensions between China and Japan from escalating. \u201cThe US had to send B-52s; it couldn\u2019t let Japan do it,\u201d said Kleine-Ahlbrandt. \u201cSo the issue has enlarged itself to the great powers coming directly head to head \u2026 It has brought the US into [the broader East China sea dispute] in a really direct way and thrown a lot of light on the great power dimensions of this conflict. \u201cVery prominent in this latest round is the sense that in China they would like the US to play a much lesser role in the region \u2013 and the US intends to remain in the region with no change whatsoever.That\u2019s the bottom line of the struggle and it\u2019s playing out here.\u201d Some believe the Obama administration\u2019s 2011 announcement of a \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0refocusing its foreign policy towards the region \u2013 spurred Chinese fears of containment.\u00a0 June Teufel Dreyer, an expert on the region at the University of Miami, suggested that, rather, it offered China an opportunity to assert itself.\u00a0 \u201cThey never say they are taking the initiative to do something; they always say it is a response to something else,\u201d she noted. \u201cI don\u2019t think it needs to be concerned actually \u2026 Given sequestration and the fact the US is unlikely to ever be able to extricate itself from the problems of the Middle East, we are not going to have the wherewithal to reinforce it.

The removal of nuclear fuel rod assemblies from a badly damaged building at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant is finally under way. Months in the planning, the job is risky, complex, and crucial. Here begins the first major step in the toughest decommissioning project ever attempted. Fukushima is home to six nuclear reactors, three of which were running when the giant tsunami swept across the site on 11 March 2011. The defuelling operation centres on the building for reactor four. Though the reactor was shut down for maintenance when the towering wave struck, all its radioactive fuel, and more from earlier runs, was held in a storage pool on an upper floor of the building. Under normal conditions, the storage pool above the reactor was a safe haven. But four days into the crisis a hydrogen explosion tore through the structure and blew the walls and roof off. Moving the radioactive fuel from the wrecked building to a more secure site became a high priority. Some fuel assemblies have already been moved. Workers use a crane to reach down into the pool, lift an assembly from its rack, then lower it into a waiting cask that sits upright on the pool floor. When a cask is full \u2013 each can take 22 fuel assemblies \u2013 a second crane hoists it from the pool and places it on a trailer. Filled casks are then transported to a more secure storage facility on the site. The procedure sounds straightforward enough. But there are 1,533 fuel assemblies in the pool at building four. Each is 4m long, and holds up to 80 individual fuel rods. The team of 36 workers that are responsible for the job will work in six shifts around the clock. The job will take until the end of 2014. And that is with no glitches. But the work at reactor four is only the start. Once the fuel is removed to a safer place, workers will turn their attention to a further 1,573 fuel rod assemblies held in similar pools in the buildings for reactors one, two and three. All were running when the tsunami struck; all suffered meltdowns. The radiation in these buildings is still intense, and access inside is limited. Though delicate and painstaking, retrieving the fuel rod assemblies from the pools is not the toughest job the workers face. More challenging by far will be digging out the molten cores in the reactors themselves. Some of the fuel burned through its primary containment and is now mixed with cladding, steel and concrete. The mixture will have to be broken up, sealed in steel containers and moved to a nuclear waste storage site. That work will not start until some time after 2020. To fully decommission Fukushima Daiichi might take 40 years and no one expects a cakewalk. Independent researchers point to the litany of mishaps that has blighted the cleanup. They doubt the plant&apos;s operator Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) is up to the task, and want a global team of experts to take over. Even high-level advisers signed up by Tepco describe the decommissioning project as an &quot;unprecedented&quot; challenge. At stake is Tepco&apos;s reputation, the health and livelihoods of local communities, and the future direction of the industry worldwide.     An IAEA inspection of the damage at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Photograph: Iaea/AFP/Getty Images    &quot;With the sheer number of things that are going wrong, they should be more openly bringing in help,&quot; says Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts, who has analysed seawater for radiation directly offshore from Fukushima. &quot;Tepco is a nuclear power producer, not a cleanup operation. There are people with expertise in decommissioning reactors, and they need to be brought in whether they are Japanese, European or American. Every time they have a problem, they come up with a solution that takes a long time to bring in, and then doesn&apos;t even solve the problem. &quot; Tepco does have international advisers. In the wake of criticisms over its handling of the crisis, the company set up an independent Nuclear Reform Monitoring Committee. The committee is led by Dale Klein, former chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). His deputy is Lady Barbara Judge, former head of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. They do not underestimate the long job ahead: this is make or break time for Tepco. Who should the public trust? In nuclear issues it can be hard to know. The engineers with most experience, those best placed to make a dangerous site safe, are industry insiders. Nuclear is their livelihood. But who does not have biases? Are anti-nuclear activists better qualified, more honest? Are academics more independent? University staff who work on nuclear technology are often funded by, or have close links to the industry. Perceived biases can be just as harmful to trust as real ones. John Large, a UK-based nuclear consultant, says Tepco needs more outside help to decommission the plant. He wants the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to arrange for a team of engineers with hands-on experience to assess the site, and come up with a fresh plan of action. But he concedes there are problems with the idea. Industry engineers will defend the industry, he says. &quot;They need to be told: &apos;Forget the fact that you design these reactors, right now we need your expertise.&apos;&quot; Tepco has planned heavily to reduce the danger of another high-profile mishap while it removes fuel from the storage pool at unit four. Engineers have beefed up the cranes that will move the fuel. If a fuel assembly jams in its rack, the crane should stop pulling immediately, to reduce the risk of breakage. A second crane that lifts the cask is designed to hold its load even if power is lost. All these will help. A dropped nuclear fuel assembly will not go critical, but more radiation might escape. That may not be dangerous beyond the site, but it could be the final straw for Tepco&apos;s reputation.     Workers on a crane for a huge  container that will transport fuel rods.

When you&apos;re dealing with decommissioning a reactor that&apos;s reached the end of its productive life, you are being proactive and you can do it in a much more slow and methodical manner.&quot; Good news is hard to find around Fukushima. In the earliest days of the crisis, a plume of radioactive material blew northwest from the site and settled as a teardrop scar reaching more than 30km across the land. From the coastline, through the towns of Okuma, Futaba and Namie, are huge patches of ground where the additional annual dose of radiation is more than 50 millisieverts. Natural background radiation, from cosmic rays and sources in the air and rock, reaches 2 to 3 millisieverts per year. A preliminary IAEA report in October on efforts to clean up the contaminated land was full of praise for the remediation work so far, and made a handful of gentle suggestions for improvement. Yet the work is far behind schedule in seven of 11 selected towns and villages; the deadline of March 2014 is now unachievable. This month, officials in Japan admitted for the first time that thousands of evacuees from the worst affected areas may never return home. The governing Liberal Democratic party says a more realistic approach is needed: it wants compensation for the 160,000 people displaced by the radioactive leak, so they can rebuild their lives elsewhere. Up on the cliff overlooking the Fukushima plant is a bleak reminder of an ongoing battle at the site. This strip of land was once filled with trees, a place for workers to go walking. Tepco has cut the trees down now, to make room for 1,000 huge metal storage tanks. They hold more than 360,000 tonnes of radioactive water, enough to fill 140 Olympic swimming pools. The volume rises every day. Over the next three years, Tepco wants to add storage for another 270,000 tonnes of radioactive wastewater. Ultimately, the water must be returned to the Pacific. There is nowhere else for it to go. The steady accumulation of contaminated water is in part down to geology. The three reactors that were running when the tsunami struck are kept cool by flushing them with 400 tonnes of water each day. The process leaves the cooling water laced with radioactive contamination. But Fukushima sits at the bottom of a hill, on land with a high water table. Hundreds of tonnes of water drain down the hill every day, quietly beneath the surface. When this subterranean flow reaches the power plant, it enters the cracked reactor buildings and mixes with the contaminated cooling water. Much is pumped out and passed through a filter made with zeolite clay, which removes dangerous caesium isotopes. But the other radioactive substances remain. This water, around 300 tonnes a day, is pumped into the storage tanks up on the hill. Some scientists questioned from the start Tepco&apos;s decision to store contaminated water. Another earthquake could rupture the tanks and see another major radioactive release from the site, they feared. So far, Tepco has been spared that particular disaster, but the concerns are still justified. Smaller accidents have been rife. In August, workers discovered that 300 tonnes of radioactive water had leaked from one of the tanks. The radiation emanating from the puddle left on the ground was enough to give a bystander the industry&apos;s five-year maximum permissible dose in just one hour. In October, half a tonne of contaminated water spilled on to the ground and may have drained to the sea, when tanks overflowed with rainwater. &quot;It&apos;s clearly something they need to get a handle on,&quot; Allison Macfarlane, chair of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told the Guardian. &quot;Water is a big issue for them, but they&apos;ve also got to keep the reactor cores cool, and they&apos;ve got to clean it up.&quot; Tepco has taken on a US consultant, Lake Barrett, who led the NRC&apos;s cleanup of Three Mile Island, the worst commercial nuclear power accident in the nation&apos;s history. &quot;It&apos;s certainly confidence-shaking to hear about spills and inadvertent releases from the plant. Even though the radioactivity levels are quite small, the public certainly don&apos;t have trust and confidence in Tepco&apos;s ability to do the more important things like the defuelling, and that is a problem for them,&quot; he says.           In a November report, Tepco said it had set up 15 specialised teams to replace old bolt-fastened tanks with welded ones, install water level gauges, and up the number of patrols that inspect the tanks for leaks. While two thirds of the storage tanks are welded steel vessels, more than 300 are makeshift, added in haste to increase capacity at the site. They are made from steel sheets that are bolted together and sealed with plastic packing. Water stored in the tanks is contaminated with a host of radioactive substances. One of the most troubling is strontium-90, which mimics calcium when it gets into the body. The substance concentrates in bones, so even low levels in the environment can build up over time and become harmful. When released into the ocean, strontium works its way into fish bones, which can make catches unfit for consumption. The hazard will last a long time: strontium&apos;s radioactivity takes 30 years to fall by half. Tepco is trying to decontaminate the water with an &quot;advanced liquid processing system&quot; (Alps). In principle, the technology can strip all radioactive substances from the water, except tritium, one of the less dangerous radioactive substances, which was spread widely through the environment by nuclear bomb tests in the 1950s and 1960s. Tepco claims the system will ultimately decontaminate more than 500 tonnes of water a day. But that may be optimistic. The equipment has\u00a0suffered multiple failures. In the latest setback on Sunday, an ALPS unit was shut down when a pipe began to leak acid. Workers wrapped a vinyl bag around the joint to stem the flow while Tepco investigates.     A nuclear fuel rod being lifted from a pool in reactor four. Photograph: TEPCO / HANDOUT/EPA    Even at a rate of 500 tonnes a day, cleaning the stored water will take many years. But Tepco must get Alps up and running. The company then needs to arrange disposal of the treated water, and the radioactive material filtered out by the system. The radioactive waste will go into containers and be sent for long-term storage. The tritium-laced water will be released into the Pacific, but Tepco has yet to get public support for the move. &quot;The problem hasn&apos;t gone away,&quot; says Macfarlane. &quot;The water is cleaner, but you still end up with tritium in there, so they&apos;re going to have some tough decisions about what to do.&quot; Fukushima is the first nuclear accident to release large amounts of radioactive material directly into the ocean. Radiation levels surged in seawater after the tsunami struck, with concentrations of caesium-137 recorded at 60 million becquerels per cubic metre near the plant. The nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima released 89 trillion becquerels of caesium-137. The levels in the waters off Fukushima fell sharply though, as the caesium dissolved and dispersed on the ocean&apos;s currents. Tepco estimates that around 300 tonnes of contaminated groundwater still flow into the Pacific each day. The levels of radioactivity are small compared with the releases in 2011. Buesseler has measured contamination in water, fish and other organisms from a ship off the coast of Fukushima since the accident unfurled. He is not worried about the immediate health risk, but says fish and other marine life will concentrate radioactive substances, making them unsuitable for consumption for years. &quot;We&apos;re not talking about levels that cause direct harm when I&apos;m one kilometre offshore,&quot; says Buesseler. &quot;But through the uptake into the seafood and fisheries, you end up having to keep those closed, and that&apos;s a billion dollar industry and a cultural loss for Japan.&quot; Buesseler is critical of what he sees as false reassurances from the Japanese government. &quot;They have said some silly things, that it&apos;s largely under control. That doesn&apos;t really mean anything when you are out on a ship and you are seeing elevated levels of these isotopes. &apos;Under control&apos; is not a good phrase for the situation right now,&quot; he says. Tepco&apos;s latest plan to stem the flow of radioactive groundwater into the ocean is to solidify the soil around the site to form an impermeable &quot;icewall&quot;. This should divert groundwater around the site, and stop it mixing with contaminated cooling water. The project will not be cheap. The Japanese government has pledged \u00a3300m to help build the barrier, insisting that the danger of leaks and spills make the wall essential. Ice wall technology has been effective in the construction and mining industries, but has never been tried on the scale planned at Fukushima. Lake Barrett, the US consultant brought in by Tepco, is sceptical of the plan. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll make that big a difference. It&apos;s several hundred million dollars, and some of that might be better spent on an integrated water plan,&quot; he says. Even if the ice wall works, it could cause fresh problems. Groundwater flowing out to the ocean keeps seawater from seeping inland at Fukushima. Block that flow, or divert it, and saltwater is sure to encroach. Normally, this would not be a problem. But the soil around Fukushima is laden with radioactive caesium. The substance binds to clay in freshwater conditions, but crucially is released again by saltwater. &quot;If you stop the fresh water flowing out, that would very likely cause the caesium in the ground to be released. You then have a pulse, of what is currently in some way safely buried, going back into the ocean,&quot; says Buesseler. &quot;It is certainly something they should think about.&quot; More mishaps are inevitable at Fukushima. The plant is wrecked and decommissioning will take decades of arduous, complex work. In Japan and in other countries, the crisis has already dented public confidence in nuclear power. That has harmed their economies, says Judge. &quot;Many countries, not just Japan, overreacted to Fukushima and they are suffering. In Germany they are buying gas from Russia, they&apos;re buying nuclear energy from France. The Poles are planning, right on the German border, a nuclear power plant to service the German market. They&apos;re burning coal, which is really amazing, because their emissions are also going up. So what was a political decision has turned out to be detrimental to the entire economy\u00a0and particularly to\u00a0the\u00a0people,&quot; she says. The media have not helped. &quot;Two years ago there was a huge earthquake and tsunami that killed around 20,000 people. But every day when I read the paper, it said, &apos;nuclear disaster, nuclear disaster, nuclear disaster&apos;. In\u00a0actual fact, not one person has died of\u00a0radiation, nor is anyone likely to. &quot;The straight story is the Japanese didn&apos;t have a nuclear response plan. There were a lot of human errors during what happened at Fukushima. It was old technology, badly maintained, and the regulator was not respected. Those are the facts. They have to be faced and\u00a0dealt with.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Brussels is thought to have focused on yen Libor, based on Japanese interest rates and priced out of London; Euribor, the Brussels equivalent to Libor; and the Tokyo rate known as Tibor."], "tags": ["Libor", "Banking", "Business", "Royal Bank of Scotland", "Deutsche Bank", "European banks", "JP Morgan", "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale", "Cr\u00e9dit Agricole", "European Union", "Europe", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T23:52:23Z", "title": "Banks braced for huge EU fines over Libor rate-rigging scandal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/03/banks-braced-huge-fines-libor-rate-rigging", "article": "The interest rate-rigging scandal that has damaged the reputation of the banking sector looks likely to be reignited as Brussels is expected to impose multimillion-pound fines on a number of major firms for manipulating crucial benchmarks. The action by Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, will pile further pressure on Royal Bank of Scotland, the bailed-out bank already dealing with the fallout from a major systems meltdownthat left millions of customers without access to cash and allegations \u2013 which it denies \u2013 of mistreating its small business customers. The 81% taxpayer-owned bank is reported to be among at least six major players in the financial markets, including Deutsche Bank in Germany and Citigroup in the US, caught up in the cartel investigation. The EU is said to be ready to impose record-breaking fines for alleged collusion for rigging key benchmark rates. Brussels is thought to have focused on yen Libor, based on Japanese interest rates and priced out of London; Euribor, the Brussels equivalent to Libor; and the Tokyo rate known as Tibor. Almunia has been in discussions with banks for weeks and the resulting penalty is expected to surpass the record \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.24bn) imposed on a cartel. Each cartel could face combined fines of as much as \u20ac800m, although it was unclear on Tuesday nightwhat the exact penalties would be and how the sums would be divided. Penaltiesfor breaches of antitrust rules can theoretically be as much as 10% of turnover. The fines are the latest to be levied on banks and financial firms for manipulating key benchmark rates. Five firms have already been fined by market regulators on both sides of Atlantic in an ongoing investigation into the manpulation of the rates, used to set interest rates on loans granted around the world. Barclays was fined \u00a3290m in June 2012 in a move that led to the resignation of its chairman, Sir Marcus Agius, chief executive, Bob Diamond, and other senior managers. Other banks who have since been fined by US or UK regulators RBS, UBS of Switzerland and the Dutch bank Rabobank. The money broker Icap has also been fined and the FCA&apos;s investigations are ongoing. The Libor investigation has sparked interest in a number of other benchmarks used to price financial products, particularly the foreign exchange markets, which are now being investigated by a number of regulators around the world, including the UK&apos;s Financial Conduct Authority. Reuters reported that UBS had alerted the European Commission to the yen interest rate manipulation and would not be penalised. The Financial Times said Barclays would avoid a fine for Euribor rigging for similar reasons. Between six and ten banks are reported to befacing fines, including Citigroup, which would be the first US bank to become embroiled in such high-profile penalties for manipulation of key rates. Deutsche Bank and RBS will be penalised for rigging the benchmark eurozone interest rates known as Euribor. French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is also part of the group facing sanctions for alleged Euribor rigging, according to Reuters. The news agency said HSBC and the French bank Cr\u00e9dit Agricole had not reached a settlement, while the FT said the US bank JPMorgan had also failed to do. They may face fines later. Reuters said Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, RBS, JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment and HSBC and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole were not immediately available to comment."}, {"sentences": ["Speaking on Tuesday from Tokyo, the first stop on his six-day north-east Asia tour, Biden said the US and Japan would work together to prevent any attempt by China to change the status quo in the Asia-Pacific region.", "The English language China Daily \u2013 often used to communicate messages to the outside world \u2013 added in its editorial: &quot;If the US is truly committed to lowering tensions in the region it must first stop acquiescing to Tokyo&apos;s dangerous brinkmanship.", "Other parties concerned should also mind their words and actions \u2026 Other parties should not be incited, or send wrong signals to make a very few countries go further on the wrong track.&quot; The long-running dispute between Tokyo and Beijing over islands in the East China Sea that are known as the Senkaku to the Japanese and Diaoyu to China intensified in late November when Beijing announced it had created the air defence zone, which takes in skies over the islands.", "Earlier in the day Biden told reporters in Tokyo that the US-Japanese security arrangement was &quot;the cornerstone of security not merely in the Pacific basic but the cornerstone upon which our security is built for the next 20 years or more&quot;.", "Speaking in Tokyo, Biden said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about China&apos;s abrupt imposition of the zone, saying it would raise regional tensions and increase the risk of accidents and miscalculation.", "The US raised hackles in Tokyo when it emerged that three US civilian airlines, acting on government advice, were complying with Chinese regulations and identifying their aircraft before flying through the zone."], "tags": ["Joe Biden", "US foreign policy", "China", "Japan", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-04T07:23:00Z", "title": "Joe Biden arrives in China amid air zone tensions", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/joe-biden-arrives-china-air-zone-tensions", "article": "The US vice-president, Joe Biden, has arrived in Beijing to meet senior leaders and attempt to reduce regional frictions sparked by China&apos;s new air defence zone.

He will meet the premier, Li Keqiang, on Thursday, in what was originally supposed to be a trip focusing on economic issues before flying on to Seoul. Speaking on Tuesday from Tokyo, the first stop on his six-day north-east Asia tour, Biden said the US and Japan would work together to prevent any attempt by China to change the status quo in the Asia-Pacific region.

He added that China&apos;s military was &quot;fully capable of exercising effective control&quot; over the area.

Washington has been downplaying reports of disagreements between the US and Japan over the issue; a senior administration official travelling with Biden insisted there was &quot;no daylight&quot; between the two countries. Earlier in the day Biden told reporters in Tokyo that the US-Japanese security arrangement was &quot;the cornerstone of security not merely in the Pacific basic but the cornerstone upon which our security is built for the next 20 years or more&quot;. A second senior official said the US intended to call on China to &quot;exercise restraint&quot; and &quot;avoid any other destabilising actions&quot;, including new declarations of air defence zones. However Biden and officials travelling with him have stopped short of calling on Beijing to &quot;rescind&quot; its declaration \u2013 a demand made by the state department on Monday. Speaking in Tokyo, Biden said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about China&apos;s abrupt imposition of the zone, saying it would raise regional tensions and increase the risk of accidents and miscalculation. Biden said he would raise US concerns with &quot;great specificity&quot; when he met the Chinese president.China has rebuffed US calls to rescind the procedures governing the air defence zone. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, described the Chinese announcement of the zone as &quot;a provocative attempt to unilaterally change the status quo&quot; that increased the risk of\u00a0inadvertent confrontation. But on Tuesday the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, told reporters: &quot;It is not China that has escalated the regional tensions. It is that some countries keep playing on the issue for their selfish gains, and China is firmly opposed to them doing that.&quot;\u00a0Hong urged other countries to respect China&apos;s actions, which he described as &quot;justifiable and lawful&quot;. He added: &quot;China established it [the zone] to safeguard sovereignty and the freedom and order of flight in the related airspace.&quot; Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he and Biden had &quot;confirmed we should not tolerate any attempt by China to change the status quo unilaterally by force&quot;. The US raised hackles in Tokyo when it emerged that three US civilian airlines, acting on government advice, were complying with Chinese regulations and identifying their aircraft before flying through the zone. Japan, by contrast, has urged Japanese airlines to ignore China&apos;s demands to submit flight plans in advance. US officials have insisted the move does not indicate &quot;US government acceptance of China&apos;s requirements&quot;. To underline Washington&apos;s opposition two B-52 bombers flew into the area last week without notifying Chinese authorities. Japanese and South Korean military jets also flew through the zone in defiance of Chinese regulations. &quot;China&apos;s declaration of an air defence identification zone is an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo, which can invite unexpected situations and is an extremely dangerous act,&quot; Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters before Biden&apos;s meeting with Abe.

In this remarkable, self-published book, though, William Solesbury explores other aspects of urban life \u2013 every possible aspect, in fact, within frames of analogy that he defines in his subtitle as Metaphors, Icons and Perspectives. Does it sound daunting? Have no fear, World Cities, City Worlds resolves itself into an altogether fascinating ramble through the entire Matter of Cityness. Solesbury, a one-time town planner and Economic and Social Research Council secretary, who is now a visiting fellow at King&apos;s College, London, chooses six cities as principal markers on a fairly wayward route: Venice, Mumbai, New York, Tokyo, Paris and Los Angeles. He takes us to many, many more, though. He has been to them all, he tells us, and despite first impressions his book is a very personal production. In form it owes something to Norman Davies&apos;s ground-breaking Europe: A History (1996), because it abounds in curious and revealing asides, set within boxes apart from the text. In technique it could, to be frank, do with some cutting. Never mind: if you find yourself skipping a box or two there is always a fascinatng Icon over the page. Every conceivable source is grist to Solesbury&apos;s mill. From film noir as from soap opera, from Canaletto as from Cartier-Bresson, from science fiction and showbusiness and street-marketing and travel-writing and memoir and academe he trawls his extraordinary mass of evidence about the meaning and the influence of cities. Each of his chosen examples gets its careful historical analysis, and each is illustrated with relevant glimpses and allusions. For instance: Malabar Hill in Mumbai has been a fashionable quarter of town since the days of the East India Company: today its grandest private home has nine elevators, three helicopter pads and parking for 160 vehicles, while nearby a million citizens sleep in the streets outside. The city plan of Manhattan is particularly rich in metonyms (if you know what they are) \u2013 surely nowhere can match Wall Street, Broadway, Fifth Avenue, Coney Island and Tin Pan Alley for universal metonymic recognition. In 1889 Isabella Bird called Tokyo a mere &quot;aggregation of villages&quot;. Today the Tokyo Metropolitan Government oversees the administrations of 63 subsidiary cities, towns and villages, and the main airport is 41 miles from the city centre. &quot;We protest with all our force&quot;, wrote the Parisian Committee of Three Hundred in the 1880s, &quot;with all our indignation, in the name of menaced French art and history, against the erection in the very heart of our capital of the useless and monstrous Eiffel tower&quot; Venice as a performance: &quot;Deprive Venice of its spectators, its extras&quot;, wrote Regis D\u00e9bray in 1995 &quot;and it would decline and collapse within a week, its text dissolving, lost, haggard, like a great star forced to play nightly to an empty house&quot;. As it is, some 12 million spectators go to Venice every year, and on an average day nine out of 10 of the people in the city are visitors. Los Angeles \u2013 &quot;LA&quot; \u2013 is one of the few great cities with a nickname, and one of the few with a suburb - Hollywood \u2013 just as famous as it is itself. More than 200 different languages are spoken there, and the word &quot;smog&quot; was invented for it. Of course Solesbury&apos;s repertoire goes much wider than that (even going as far, I ought to say, as several quotations from me), and includes a Cavafy poem about Alexandria, the script of the opening scene of Carol Reed&apos;s The Third Man, a register of detectives with associated cities (eg Morse in Oxford, Marlowe in LA) together with lists of smart Manhattan neighbourhoods, seminal urban uprisings, urban disasters in films (including the 1978 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers), types of Venetian boats, international street foods, novel methods of urban transport. Enough, enough! Even Mrs Solesbury, one gathers from the book&apos;s acknowlegements, has to restrain its author&apos;s tendency to make lists.

The US vice-president&apos;s week-long visit to Japan, China and South Korea \u2013 originally intended to focus on economic issues \u2013 has been overtaken by the row over the air zone. He spent five and a half hours, longer than scheduled, in talks with Xi at Beijing&apos;s Great Hall of the People. Their discussions - which comprised a small meeting, a broader bilateral meeting and dinner - also covered the two countries&apos; concerns about North Korea and whether lessons could be learned from last month&apos;s deal with Iran, which placed constraints on its nuclear programme in exchange for partial relief from sanctions. &quot;They talked at some length about what the Iran example means for North Korea,&quot; a senior US official said. With attention in the region focusing on China&apos;s new air zone, the official said Biden had laid out the US position in detail, indicating that it did not recognise the designated area and had deep concerns. He said Biden told Xi: &quot;We are looking to China to take steps to reduce tensions.&quot; The US has described the move as a provocative attempt to change the status quo in the region. Many countries have similar zones, but there is concern at the rules set out by Beijing and the inclusion of airspace over islands that are also claimed and administered by Japan. But while the US has flown B52s through the zone, it has stopped short of calling for China to roll back the measure. Analysts say a more realistic aspiration is persuading China not to react aggressively to unidentified aircraft in the zone; so far, it has scrambled jets to monitor Japanese and US military flights but kept a distance. China has said it established the zone to safeguard sovereignty and the order of flight in the area. The US official said Xi had been &quot;equally clear in laying out their view&quot; and took on board Biden&apos;s words, adding: &quot;It&apos;s up to China, and we&apos;ll see how things will unfold.&quot; He described the conversation as one of &quot;casual candour&quot; which covered every issue in the bilateral relationship, including economics. Biden made brief comments to reporters following his first meeting with Xi, praising the president&apos;s straightforward and constructive approach. He did not discuss the air defence zone or take questions. &quot;Candour generates trust,&quot; he said. &quot;Trust is the basis on which real change, constructive change is made.&quot; Speaking before their meeting began, Xi said the bilateral relationship &quot;has generally maintained a momentum of positive development&quot;. But he noted that the international landscape was changing: &quot;Regional hot spot issues keep cropping up.&quot; He added: &quot;The world as a whole is not tranquil \u2026 To strengthen dialogue and co-operation is the only right choice facing both of our countries.&quot; The state-run English language newspaper China Daily warned ahead of Biden&apos;s arrival in Beijing: &quot;If the US is truly committed to lowering tensions in the region, it must first stop acquiescing to Tokyo&apos;s dangerous brinkmanship. It must stop emboldening belligerent Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to constantly push the envelope of Japan&apos;s encroachments and provocations.&quot; Earlier on Wednesday, Biden met Chinese vice-president Li Yuanchao. He will meet the premier, Li Keqiang, on Thursday, before flying to Seoul. He also encouraged young Chinese citizens to challenge authority during a visit to the visa section of the US embassy. He thanked those waiting for wanting to visit the US and said he hoped they would learn that &quot;innovation can only occur where you can breathe free, challenge the government, challenge religious leaders.&quot; He added: &quot;Children in America are rewarded, not punished, for challenging the status quo \u2026 The only way you make something totally new is to break the mould of what was old.&quot; Speaking a day after global education rankings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed Shanghai taking the top position in maths, reading and science, with Americans lagging behind many of their Asian and European peers, he added: &quot;Even though some countries&apos; educational systems are better than America&apos;s, particularly in grade school, there is one thing that&apos;s stamped in the DNA of every American, whether they are naturalised citizens or natural-born: it&apos;s an inherent rejection of orthodoxy.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["And on a whirlwind modelling trip to Tokyo, Harriet would trade in everything she&apos;s ever learnt for just the faintest idea of what she&apos;s supposed to do next..."], "tags": ["Teen books", "Children and teenagers", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-05T12:00:00Z", "title": "Geek Girl: Model Misfit by Holly Smale - review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/05/review-geek-girl-model-misfit-holly-smale", "article": " Harriet Manners knows a lot of facts.Humans have 70,000 thoughts per day.Caterpillars have four thousand muscles.The average person eats a ton of food a year.Being a Geek + Model = a whole new set of graffiti on your belongings.

And on a whirlwind modelling trip to Tokyo, Harriet would trade in everything she&apos;s ever learnt for just the faintest idea of what she&apos;s supposed to do next...  I am so disappointed with the Geek Girl series. They sound so good when you read the description, but when you read the actual book they are so different - in ways I don&apos;t like. I was so hoping to have a girl-y book I could just lose myself in for awhile, but that didn&apos;t happen with Geek Girl.  I think it&apos;s written very annoyingly; I don&apos;t know why but I don&apos;t like the way in which Holly Smale writes Geek Girl at all. I sometimes found all the quotes really fascinating and eventually it became really annoying. They&apos;re facts I can imagine telling my friends but you never know whether facts like that are true or not. So I found it a bit annoying because I eventually had to try and decide whether they were true facts or just fictional facts and I went with the latter.  It was much like the first one; it was a bit like deja vu but with a few blurry bits that didn&apos;t seem to go with the original memory. And I lost interest around a quarter of the way through it. And I found it hard to pick back up... but when I did pick it back up I had to force myself to try and enjoy it because I didn&apos;t want to give up on it because originally it had sounded really good and I was just keeping my fingers crossed that it would finally have that break through I was hoping for - but it didn&apos;t.  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be reading the next one in the series, due to come out in 2014.  It was a big disappointment. But I do think if it had been published a few years back when I was young and it was the sort of thing I read - which it wasn&apos;t - but if it had been I think I definitely would have enjoyed it!  If you are about 9-12 I think you might enjoy it. But any older you might be pushing it unless you still enjoy books for younger readers. I stopped reading books for younger readers a long time ago so it doesn&apos;t interest me. I originally found this book in the Teen section of Waterstones but it should be in the 9-12 section. If you are a teenager looking for a girl-y book with a bit of romance, fun facts, and just a book to relate to, I either suggest trying to find something else or doing a bit of research on the Geek Girl series to confirm that it is definitely your sort of thing. And if you are 9-12 and looking for a girl-y book with a bit of romance, fun facts, and just a book to relate to too, then I suggest you read the first chapter or so in the shop (the chapters aren&apos;t very long) and just flick through it and read a few bits every now and then; if you still think it&apos;s the book for you then go for it! But I didn&apos;t enjoy it and wished I had been reading something else the whole time I was reading Model Misfit and more than once thought of giving up on it. I would rate it 3 stars. 9-14 but only if the 13 and 14 year olds do the research and still think that they are going to like it and even then I can&apos;t guarantee that they will enjoy it.

Photograph: Kimimasa Mayama/EPA    Whistleblowers and journalists in Japan could soon find themselves facing long spells in prison for divulging and reporting state secrets, possibly including sensitive information about the Fukushima nuclear disaster and the country&apos;s souring relations with China. Under a special state secrets bill expected to pass on Friday, public officials and private citizens who leak &quot;special state secrets&quot; face prison terms of up to 10 years, while journalists who seek to obtain the classified information could get up to five years. Critics of the new law say it marks a return to the days of prewar and wartime Japanese militarism, when the state used the Peace Preservation Act to arrest and imprison political opponents. &quot;It is a threat to democracy,&quot; said Keiichi Kiriyama, an editorial writer for the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper, adding that the legislation would &quot;have a chilling effect on public servants, who could become wary about giving the information&quot; to journalists.     The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, speaks during the debate on the state secrets bill. Photograph: Aflo/Barcroft Media    In the aftermath of the Edward Snowden leaks, Japan has come under pressure from Washington to better protect state secrets \u2013 including intelligence shared by the US \u2013 at a time of rising regional tensions. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, says the law is crucial if his US-style national security council, approved this week, is to function properly. The law is seen as part of his conservative project to bolster Japan&apos;s security in response to escalating tensions with China and concern over North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme.     The state minister in charge of the bill has denied that it would affect the release of information about radiation leaks at Fukushima Daiichi. Photograph: Kyodo/Reuters    Abe, who does not have to fight an election for another three years, is expected to push ahead with his nationalist agenda, including constitutional reforms that would end the military&apos;s purely defensive role. The secrecy bill&apos;s hasty passage through the lower house has been marked by noisy public demonstrations and opposition from journalists, lawyers, politicians, academics and scientists, as well as film directors and manga artists concerned about freedom of expression. They say the prospect of prison terms will deter whistleblowers from leaking sensitive or embarrassing information in the public interest, and journalists from trying to obtain it. The upper house of Japan&apos;s parliament is expected to approve the bill before the end of the current parliamentary session on Friday, possibly later on Thursday. The chief criticism of the bill is its vague definition of what constitutes a state secret, potentially giving officials carte blanche to block the release of information on a vast range of subjects, including measures to counterbalance China&apos;s growing military influence in the region, and the safety of the country&apos;s nuclear reactors. &quot;There are few specifics in the law, which means it can be used to hide whatever the government wishes to keep away from public scrutiny,&quot; said Mizuho Fukushima, an opposition MP. &quot;In its current form, the prime minister can decide by himself what constitutes a secret.&quot; The law would apply to four areas \u2013 defence, diplomacy, counter-terrorism and counter-espionage \u2013 and gives officials the power to keep sensitive information out of the public domain indefinitely. Senior politicians insist the law will not be used to gag the press or restrict the public&apos;s right to know. But the justice minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki, refused to rule out police raids of newspapers suspected of breaking the law. Masako Mori, the state minister in charge of the bill, said the law could be applied to Japan&apos;s nuclear power industry, because it is a potential target for terrorists. But she denied the legislation would affect the release of information about radiation leaks at Fukushima Daiichi. Last week, the secretary general of the governing Liberal Democratic party, Shigeru Ishiba, angered many when he likened people protesting against the bill to terrorists. He later apologised for the remarks. &quot;There is a demand by the established political forces for greater control over the people,&quot; said Lawrence Repeta, a law professor at Meiji University. &quot;This fits with the notion that the state should have broad authority to act in secret. It seems very clear that the law would have a chilling effect on journalism in Japan.&quot; Widespread opposition to the law is testing Abe&apos;s popularity. A recent poll by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper found public support for Abe has dropped to below 50% for the first time since he took office last December. More than 60% of those polled expressed concern that the bill was being rushed into law. In response, Abe this week attempted to dismiss claims that officials would abuse the law to prevent the disclosure of information that is in the public interest. &quot;There is a misunderstanding,&quot; he said. &quot;It is obvious that normal reporting activity of journalists must not be a subject to punishment.&quot; Abe said the government would set clearer definitions of state secrets and appoint a third party to oversee possible violations. Critics point out that the proposed body, comprising senior officials from the foreign and defence ministries and the national police agency, is far from independent. &quot;What we need is a third party, not a quasi-third-party system that can check,&quot; said Banri Kaieda, leader of the main opposition Democratic party of Japan. &quot;I can say with certainty now that the bill is created by bureaucrats for the bureaucrats to hide information.&quot; The prospect of harsh penalties for Snowden-style whistleblowers and their reporter associates has prompted concern outside Japan. Reporters Without Borders accused Japan of &quot;making investigative journalism illegal&quot;. It said in a statement: &quot;How can the government respond to growing demands for transparency from a public outraged by the consequences of the Fukushima nuclear accident if it enacts a law that gives it a free hand to classify any information considered too sensitive as a state secret?&quot; Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner for human rights, accused Japan&apos;s government of imposing the legislation with little public debate. &quot;They should not rush through the law without first putting in proper safeguards for access of information and freedom of expression as guaranteed in Japan&apos;s constitution and international human rights law,&quot; she said. The law reflects a decline in Japan&apos;s standing as a protector of the free press. In the Reporters Without Borders press freedom index for 2013, it dropped 31 places from 2012 to a new low of 53rd out of 179 countries."}, {"sentences": ["Aintree 12.00 Villoresi 12.30 Mystery Drama 1.00 Lieutentant Miller 1.30 Keel Haul 2.05 Swing Bill 2.40 Katenko (nap) 3.15 Dunowen Point (nb) Chepstow 12.25 Gunner Fifteen 12.55 Midnight Prayer 1.25 Sausalito Sunrise 2.00 The Druids Nephew 2.35 Lookout Mountain 3.10 Renard 3.45 Tara Road Sandown 12.20 Champagne At Tara 12.50 Tigresse Bleue 1.20 Upswing 1.50 Balder Success 2.25 Deep Trouble 3.00 Sire De Grugy 3.35 Court By Surprise Wetherby 12.10 Mysteree 12.40 Dreams Of Milan 1.10 Ballyben 1.40 Imjoeking 2.15 Alavian 2.50 Basford Ben 3.25 Lola Wolverhampton 6.20 George Fenton 6.50 Dansili Dutch 7.20 Summer School 7.50 Best Tamayuz 8.20 Litigant 8.50 Corncockle 9.20 Tokyo Brown"], "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-06T18:54:15Z", "title": "Horse racing tips: Saturday 7 December", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/dec/06/horse-racing-tips-saturday-7-december", "article": "Aintree 12.00 Villoresi 12.30 Mystery Drama 1.00 Lieutentant Miller 1.30 Keel Haul 2.05 Swing Bill 2.40 Katenko (nap) 3.15 Dunowen Point (nb) Chepstow 12.25 Gunner Fifteen 12.55 Midnight Prayer 1.25 Sausalito Sunrise 2.00 The Druids Nephew 2.35 Lookout Mountain 3.10 Renard 3.45 Tara Road Sandown 12.20 Champagne At Tara 12.50 Tigresse Bleue 1.20 Upswing 1.50 Balder Success 2.25 Deep Trouble 3.00 Sire De Grugy 3.35 Court By Surprise Wetherby 12.10 Mysteree 12.40 Dreams Of Milan 1.10 Ballyben 1.40 Imjoeking 2.15 Alavian 2.50 Basford Ben 3.25 Lola Wolverhampton 6.20 George Fenton 6.50 Dansili Dutch 7.20 Summer School 7.50 Best Tamayuz 8.20 Litigant 8.50 Corncockle 9.20 Tokyo Brown"}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo Sexwale, the former Robben islander and now leading member of the ANC&apos;s national executive committee (NEC), remembered vividly the mood at the meeting during Mandela&apos;s absence."], "tags": ["Nelson Mandela", "South Africa", "World news", "Africa", "ANC (African National Congress)"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-07T10:00:00Z", "title": "Nelson Mandela: the freedom fighter who embraced his enemies", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/07/nelson-mandela-freedom-fighter-john-carlin", "article": "Nelson Mandela arrived early for work on 11\u00a0May 1994, the day after his inauguration as the first black president of South Africa. As he walked down the deserted corridors, past framed watercolours celebrating the derring-do of white settlers at the time of the Great Trek, he paused outside a door and knocked. A voice said &quot;Come in&quot; and Mandela, who was 6ft, found himself looking up at a vast, second-row forward of a man, an Afrikaner by the name of John Reinders, chief of presidential protocol during the tenure both of the last white president, FW de Klerk, and his predecessor, PW Botha. &quot;Good morning, how are you?&quot; said Mandela, with a cheery grin. &quot;Very well, Mr President, and you?&quot; &quot;Very well, ve-ry well \u2026&quot; Mandela replied. &quot;But, ah \u2026 may I ask, what are you doing?&quot; Reinders, who was packing away his belongings into cardboard boxes, replied: &quot;I am taking away my things, Mr President. I am moving to another job.&quot; &quot;Ah, very good. Where is it you are going?&quot; &quot;Back to the prisons department. I served there as a major before coming to work here in the presidency.&quot; &quot;Ah, no,&quot; Mandela grinned. &quot;No, no, no. I know that department ve-ry well. I would not recommend doing that.&quot; Turning serious, Mandela proceeded to persuade Reinders to stay. &quot;You see, we people, we are from the bush. We do not know how to administer a body as complex as the presidency of South Africa. We need the help of experienced people such as yourself. I would ask you, please, to stay at your post. I intend only to serve for one presidential term and then, of course, you would be free to do as you wish.&quot; Reinders, as astonished as he was charmed, needed no further explanations. Slowly, shaking his head in wonder, he began to empty his boxes. Reinders, whose eyes filled with tears as he recalled that story some time later, told me that during the five years he had served at Mandela&apos;s side, travelling far and wide with him, he had received nothing but courtesy and kindness. Mandela treated him with the same respect, he said, as he showed the president of the United States, the pope or Britain&apos;s Queen, who, incidentally, adored him. Mandela must have been the only person in the world, with the possible exception of the Duke of Edinburgh, who always called her &quot;Elizabeth&quot; \u2013 or at least who was able to do so without drawing even a shadow of a rebuke. (A friend of mine who was having dinner with him once at his home in Johannesburg recalled how a servant came in with a portable phone. It was the Queen on the line. Smiling broadly, Mandela put the phone to his ear and exclaimed: &quot;Ah, Elizabeth! How are you? How are the children?&quot;) What Mandela&apos;s relationship with Reinders \u2013 the same as it was with all his staff, however humble their position \u2013 reveals is the secret of his success as a political leader. If politics is about winning people over, Mandela, as numerous other politicians have attested, was the master of the game. He had at his command an irresistibly seductive cocktail that combined boundless charm born of a vast self-confidence with inflexible principle, strategic vision and the canniest pragmatism. The attitude he adopted towards Reinders was the same one he displayed to his interlocutors in the apartheid government when he first met them in secret talks during the last five years of the 27-and-a-half he spent in prison; it was the one he showed the white population as a whole in eventually convincing practically the totality of them that, far from being a fearful terrorist, as they had been programmed to believe during his captivity, he was as much their rightful president as he was black South Africa&apos;s uncrowned king. It would have been much harder for him to prevail on white South Africa to abandon apartheid and relinquish power before he went to prison, in 1962, and harder still 20 years earlier, when he signed up for the black freedom struggle. The man responsible for recruiting him was Walter Sisulu, a shrewd labour activist who at the time of that fateful meeting (Mandela would later joke that he would have spared himself a great deal of trouble had he never met Sisulu) was a labour activist with more than 10 years behind him in the movement that would eventually spearhead black South Africa&apos;s liberation, the African National Congress (ANC). Back then, Mandela was a young man on the make, freshly arrived in Johannesburg from rural Transkei, where he had been born and raised in what passed, amid the general squalor of his surroundings, for tribal privilege. That he had also received a solid secondary education did not disguise the fact that, standing there in the labour activist&apos;s office, he was the country bumpkin to Sisulu the city slicker. Yet it was Sisulu, 30 years old to Mandela&apos;s 24, who was impressed, glimpsing in Mandela the seed of a talent for politics that would take many years of struggle and sacrifice to mature. Recalling five decades later how he had sized up the young man standing tall before him in his office, Sisulu said: &quot;He happened to strike me more than any person I had met. His demeanour, his warmth \u2026 I was looking for people of calibre to fill positions of leadership and he was a godsend to me.&quot; It took little time for Sisulu to convince Mandela, then working towards a degree in law, to join his cause. Mandela succeeded on both counts, going on to set up a law firm with another ANC leader, Oliver Tambo. But he was especially successful in politics. To the charisma Sisulu had spotted in him Mandela added an impetuous courage that during the 1940s and 1950s, before he went to prison, derived partly from his indignant sense of the injustice black South Africans were obliged to endure, but also from the boisterousness of his character. He quickly rose to become president of the ANC Youth League, from which position he led a nationwide defiance campaign against a regime whose apartheid laws constitutionally entrenched the humiliation and condition of de facto slavery to which black people on the southern tip of Africa had been reduced since the arrival of the first white settlers in 1652. It was during this campaign that Mandela revealed a histrionic talent (his official biographer, Anthony Sampson, described him as &quot;a master of political imagery&quot;) that would serve him in good stead much later, when he emerged from prison into the globalised television age. He made a point of ensuring that press photographers were amply in attendance when he launched the campaign in 1952 by setting fire to his pass book, badge of apartheid ignominy, wearing a big mischievous smile on his face. The photograph, published far and wide, electrified the black population, who followed his example in their tens of thousands. The young Mandela&apos;s self-confidence bordered on the brash. At a meeting of the ANC&apos;s executive committee in the mid-1950s he upset the organisation&apos;s elders when he gave a speech in which he predicted \u2013 with outrageous clairvoyance \u2013 that one day he would become the first black president of South Africa. Always visibly on the frontline of resistance to apartheid in those days, he dressed like a million dollars. He had his suits made by the same tailor as South Africa&apos;s gold and diamond king, Harry Oppenheimer, and never cut a less than dandyish figure on the Johannesburg night scene. Photographs of the 1950s show a man with the confident air of a Hollywood matin\u00e9e idol. The women fell for him, Winnie Madikizela among them. And he \u2013 though he was married, with children \u2013 fell for her too. She was Soweto&apos;s Ava Gardner to his Clark Gable. Mandela divorced his first wife, Evelyn, and wed Winnie, with whom he had two daughters but, as Winnie would later complain, they saw little of each other, especially after he became commander in chief of the ANC&apos;s newly founded military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, Spear of the Nation, in 1961, and was obliged to go underground. That seam of vanity worked against him now. Determined to play the part of Che Guevara, embracing a slogan popular at the time \u2013 &quot;We&apos;ll take power the Castro way&quot; \u2013 he insisted, despite warnings from his friends, on sporting revolutionary green fatigues in public even after the police had declared him South Africa&apos;s most wanted man. Partly because of his failure to keep the very low profile his circumstances demanded, he was arrested in 1962, remaining behind bars for the next 27-and-a-half years. Prison tamed him, taught him to hone his theatrical talents, his seducer&apos;s arts, towards realistic political goals. He went in angry and came out wise, yet always driven by the heroic conviction that the respite he won at his trial in 1964 \u2013 life imprisonment instead of an expected death sentence \u2013 had destined him to emerge one day as his people&apos;s redeemer. The big lesson he assimilated was that the enemy was not going to be defeated by force of arms; that white South Africans would one day have to be persuaded to surrender power voluntarily, to kill off apartheid by themselves. Prison, the tiny cell he inhabited on Robben Island for 18 years, became his practice ground for the grand game that would await him outside. Lesson one, he resolved, had to be &quot;know your enemy&quot;. To the dismay of some of his fellow prisoners, he set about learning Afrikaans \u2013 &quot;the oppressors&apos; language&quot; \u2013 and reading books on Afrikaner history. Then he set out to win his jailers&apos; hearts, figuring this was the way to get to know the vanities, strengths and weaknesses of the white population at large, the better to be prepared, when the time came, to attempt to bend them to his will. The trick consisted of never losing his principled dignity, in refusing to be bullied and in treating all around him with respect \u2013 with the &quot;ordinary respect&quot; that Sisulu once defined as the prize for which he fought during his 60 years in politics. These qualities, adorned by his regal manners, were to win over the first two members of the white government that he, or any other black leader, ever had contact with. During his last five years in prison he held more than 70 secret meetings with the justice minister, Kobie Coetsee, and national intelligence chief, Niel Barnard; the meetings&apos; purpose to explore the possibility of a political accommodation between blacks and whites. As he insinuated himself into these two dubious personages&apos; trust (each was regarded as a monster by the world at large during the fraught 1980s), he consolidated his authority over his fellow political prisoners, as he would later over the black population. I interviewed Coetsee about those meetings and, as Reinders had done, he wept at the recollection of Mandela, whom he defined as &quot;the incarnation of the great Roman virtues \u2013 dignitas, gravitas, honestas&quot;. Barnard was incapable of weeping but he came close, referring to Mandela always during the seven hours that we spoke as &quot;the old man&quot;, as if he were talking about his own father. Released from prison on 11 February 1990, Mandela went on a triumphant progress around South Africa, preaching a finely tuned message of reconciliation and defiance. No Gandhi, he refused to call off the &quot;armed struggle&quot;, symbolic as it had largely been, until the government gave unequivocal signs of committing itself to one-person, one-vote democracy. He had no choice, for President FW de Klerk, whom he graciously (and shrewdly) described as &quot;a man of integrity&quot;, initially imagined he would get away with some sort of sui generis, semi-democratic, &quot;minority rights&quot; formula that would secure and perpetuate white privilege. The negotiations that went on over the next four years were tough, but not nearly as tough as what was going on out in the townships, especially those on the periphery of Johannesburg. The last kicks of the apartheid beast expressed themselves in a concerted attempt to derail the transition by shadowy forces in the security establishment in alliance with the conservative black organisation Inkatha, whose rightwing Zulu leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a beneficiary of apartheid&apos;s Bantustan &quot;homeland&quot; system, was as fearful of ANC rule as any white man. The slaughter in Soweto and elsewhere reached a scale not seen in South Africa since the Boer war, nearly 100 years earlier. Mandela railed publicly, raged at De Klerk in private and had to be restrained by colleagues in the ANC national executive from not calling off talks altogether; from resorting \u2013 hot anger at times getting the better of his judgment \u2013 to all-out confrontation. Yet when the supreme test came he kept his cool and gave his blessing to a breakthrough compromise whereby the country&apos;s first democratically elected government would be a coalition, with ministries dispensed in proportion to the percentage of votes each party won. He reached out to, and to a large degree pacified, the white population by persuading his own people to make another major compromise on a matter close to all South African hearts. It was at a meeting of the ANC&apos;s national executive four months before the historic elections of April 1994. There was never any doubt that the ANC would win the poll; the issue on the table was what should be the position of the new government on the delicate question of the national anthem? The old anthem was clearly unacceptable. Die Stem was a sombre martial tune that praised God and celebrated the triumphs of Boer leaders Piet Retief, Andries Pretorius and the rest of the &quot;trekkers&quot; as they drove upwards through South Africa in the 19th century, crushing black resistance. The unofficial anthem of black South Africa, Nkosi Sikelel&apos; iAfrika, was the richly soulful expression of a long-suffering people yearning to be free. The meeting had just got started when an assistant walked in to tell Mandela that he had a phone call from a head of state. He left the room and the 30 or so men and women of the ANC&apos;s supreme decision-making body carried on without him. The consensus was overwhelmingly in favour of scrapping Die Stem and replacing it with Nkosi Sikelel&apos; iAfrika. Tokyo Sexwale, the former Robben islander and now leading member of the ANC&apos;s national executive committee (NEC), remembered vividly the mood at the meeting during Mandela&apos;s absence. &quot;We were enjoying ourselves,&quot; he said. &quot;It is the end for that Die Stem song, we said. The end. No more. We are singing Nkosi Sikelel&apos; iAfrika in this country and that is that. We were having a great time!&quot; Then Mandela walked in. &quot;We were all like small primary schoolchildren,&quot; recalled Sexwale, a big powerful man, with a rich orator&apos;s voice. &quot;He asked us how our discussions were going and we told him we had already reached a decision. He said, &apos;Well, I am sorry. I don&apos;t want to be rude, but \u2026&apos; \u2013 my God, we all wanted to hide \u2013 &apos;I think I should express myself on this motion. I never thought seasoned people such as yourselves would take a decision of such magnitude on such an important matter without even waiting for the president of your organisation&apos;.&quot; And then Mandela, as sternly schoolmasterish as his fellow ANC leaders had ever seen him, put across his point of view. &quot;This song that you treat so easily holds the emotions of many people who you don&apos;t represent yet. With the stroke of a pen, you would take a decision to destroy the very \u2013 the only \u2013 basis that we are building upon: reconciliation.&quot; The men and women of the national executive of the ANC, many of them household names in South Africa, regarded as heroes and heroines of the struggle, cringed with embarrassment. Mandela proposed instead that, for the foreseeable future, South Africa should have two anthems, to be played one immediately after the other at official ceremonies, from presidential inaugurations to international rugby matches: Die Stem and Nkosi Sikelel&apos; iAfrika. Morally defeated, overwhelmed by the logic of Mandela&apos;s argument, the freedom fighters unanimously caved in. Sexwale laughed out aloud years later at the discomfiture he had felt, at the manner in which Mandela had outmanoeuvred them all. &quot;Jacob Zuma, who had been chairing the meeting said, &apos;Well, I \u2026 I \u2026 I think the matter is clear, comrades. I think the matter is clear \u2026&apos; Nobody raised a finger to object.&quot; The national executive capitulated in the face of Mandela&apos;s wrath because they understood immediately that their vindictiveness on the white anthem had been childish, that the far-sighted political response to the dilemma was the mature generous one Mandela advocated. But they deferred to his judgment also because ever since the masterly performances he delivered immediately after leaving prison they had come to accept that &quot;the old man&quot; was far more skilful than any of them in the modern craft of political symbolism. The issue of the anthem was all about the creation of a national mood, of persuading politically by moving people&apos;s emotions. That, as his fellow ANC leaders had come to see, was the essence of his political genius, where he outclassed them all. He himself told me during one of our conversations in his home that he had lectured the NEC on winning over the Afrikaners, on showing respect for their symbols, on going out of your way to employ a few words of Afrikaans at the beginning of a speech. &quot;You don&apos;t address their brains,&quot; he said. &quot;You address their hearts.&quot; He did the same, with even more spectacular success, one year into his presidency at the rugby World Cup, staged in South Africa for the first time. Here he managed the unlikely feat of persuading his own people to back the South African Springboks, transforming one of the most hated symbols of apartheid oppression into an instrument of unity. Despite the fact that only one of the players in the national team was not white, the black population, at Mandela&apos;s bidding, accepted the Springboks as their own, as fitting representatives of the new national flag. Unforgettably, at the final in Johannesburg, which South Africa won, the almost entirely white crowd (the rugby set had hardly been in the vanguard of racial enlightenment during the apartheid years) rose to bellow out his name, &quot;Nelson! Nelson! Nelson!&quot; When Mandela handed over the cup to the captain Francois Pienaar, a big blond son of apartheid, he said to him: &quot;Thank you, Francois, for what you have done for our country.&quot; &quot;No, Mr President,&quot; replied Pienaar, with enormous presence of mind. &quot;Thank you for what you have done for our country!&quot; On that day, probably the happiest \u2013 and certainly the most patriotically united \u2013 in South African history, Mandela achieved his twin mission impossible of political leadership. He persuaded a whole people, in this case the most racially divided people on Earth, to change their minds. Mandela&apos;s chief purpose during his five years as president was to cement the foundations of the new democrac and banish the prospect of a terrorist counter-revolution by the heavily armed far right. This he managed. South Africa, for all the problems it faces today (problems which it shares with dozens of other countries, having shed the epic and awful singularity that once set it apart from the rest of the world), is a stable democracy, far more observant of the rule of law and freedom of speech than, say, Russia, another country that put paid to years of tyranny at more or less the same time. It has been said, and will be for a long time probably, that he might have done more to redress the economic injustices of apartheid. Perhaps, but in a country with a high birthrate and no economic growth figures to match, it was a practically impossible challenge. The best that could be said was that Mandela&apos;s presidency saw the emergence of a potent new social phenomenon, unimaginable in the apartheid years \u2013 a flourishing black middle class. He could have set about a wholesale redistribution of the nation&apos;s wealth, but that would almost certainly have provoked what he most feared, a racial civil war. The economy left from that would have been an economy of the graveyard. It was democracy that Mandela fought for during the better part of his life and, once that was achieved, his priority became peace. The sort of peace he brokered with John Reinders, whose treatment by Mandela shines a light on the great lesson he teaches all people everywhere, whether in political leadership or in less ambitious spheres of life. He was utterly consistent in what he practised and what he preached. He spoke of justice and of respect and he treated all people, however lowly their condition or however irrelevant to his political or personal objectives, with equal consideration. A year after Mandela had left the presidency, Reinders, who continued serving his successor Thabo Mbeki, received a phone call from his former boss. Would he and his family be available to come to lunch at Mandela&apos;s home the following Sunday? Reinders turned up with his wife and two sons expecting to be part of a large gathering. But it was only his family that Mandela expected. At the beginning of the lunch Mandela raised a glass and, addressing himself to Reinders&apos;s wife and children, apologised for having deprived them for so long of the company of their husband and father: &quot;But he was magnificent in the performance of his duties. Magnificent!&quot; Reinders, who once again wept recalling the story, said that after lunch Mandela accompanied them outside and, as their car left, stood and waved them goodbye. I once asked Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a Nobel peace prize winner like Mandela, and one of the people who knew him most intimately, if he could define Mandela&apos;s greatest quality. Tutu thought for a moment and then \u2013 triumphantly \u2013 uttered one word: magnanimity. &quot;Yes,&quot; he repeated, more solemnly the second time, almost in a whisper. &quot;Magnanimity!&quot;There is no better word to define Mandela. No leader more big-hearted, more regal, more generously wise. Not now and, quite possibly, not ever.

He loves skating so he wants Vans or Nikes \u2013 he won&apos;t wear another kind of sneaker.&quot; Nothing could be more antithetical to Marant&apos;s own style, which prides itself on an eclectic individualism. Her clothes, a combination of androgynous chic and bohemian nonchalance, have been worn for years by in-the-know magazine editors and celebrities including Sienna Miller, Victoria Beckham and Alexa Chung. Since the establishment of her label in 1994, her sales have increased 30% each year \u2013 quite a feat in the notoriously fickle world of fashion. But her collections remained beyond the price range of many ordinary consumers until this year when Marant&apos;s collaboration with high-street chain H&amp;M sold out within minutes of launching in November. Shoppers queued throughout the night outside stores from London to Tokyo. The H&amp;M website crashed under the demand. In the High Street Kensington branch, staff handed out wristbands that allowed customers to shop for 10 minutes only. Soon, the most desirable items from the collection \u2013 fringed ankle boots, printed skinny jeans and textured sweaters \u2013 were making their way on to eBay at eye-watering mark-ups. The ankle boots, which retailed at \u00a3149, went for more than \u00a3400 online. Was Marant surprised by the reaction? She takes a drag on her roll-up and shakes her head. &quot;Not so surprised because my label is more approachable than some of the other labels they have done collaborations with.&quot; But the eBay phenomenon, she concedes, is &quot;crazy! I think people are mad with fashion.&quot; She talks in a great gust of energy, her English precise but heavily accented, her unmade-up face frequently breaking into a wide grin. In person, Marant is both elegant and unstuffy. Today she is wearing flat ankle boots, grey woollen leggings and the oversized grey jacket from the H&amp;M range. She notices immediately that I am sporting one of her \u00a369.99 silk snakeskin-print skirts \u2013 one of the only items left in stock. &quot;We used exactly the same fabric for this skirt that I use for my own collection,&quot; she says. &quot;The nice thing with H&amp;M is they don&apos;t want to try to do a cheap version of your own collection\u2026 They really respect the DNA of designers.&quot; At 46, Marant is at the peak of her success, yet she never intended to become a designer. She was born in a Paris suburb in 1967 to a French father who worked in advertising and a German mother who was a model and later a director of the Elite model agency. Her parents divorced when she was six and Marant was &quot;very rebellious&quot;, partly as a result of having &quot;a very beautiful brother. I was not beautiful and I had this kind of reaction, a way of showing myself I was existing, and very early on, at the age of nine or 10, I knew what I wanted to wear.&quot; She started restyling her parents&apos; cast-offs \u2013 dressing gowns, check slippers, old sweaters \u2013 and discovered her friends liked what she was making. At 17, she began to sell her designs to a local shop. Then she did a degree at the Studio Bercot fashion school. In 1995, she showed her first collection at Paris fashion week, using friends as models. Her accidental route into fashion has left her with a healthy distaste for the industry&apos;s absurdities. &quot;Sometimes we give an image of life that will never exist, using models who are 15 and pretending they are 35 or 40, and when you are 35 or 40 you want to look like this when you will never be able to. So there&apos;s a bit of a disconnect.&quot; Does Marant try to use real women in her catwalk show? She sighs. &quot;I can&apos;t \u2013 most of the girls [the model agencies send] are 15 years old. I try to use girls who have personality. When they walk in a room, I&apos;ll think: &apos;Ah! There&apos;s something to this girl.&apos; It&apos;s more a way of moving or being that means something to me.&quot; It is clear Marant loves women. Her inspiration comes from &quot;tiny details\u2026 Sometimes it can be the gesture of a woman who does this [she sweeps her long grey hair away from her neck]\u2026 And I see her neck, her shoulder, and I think: &apos;That&apos;s beautiful, I want to show that.&apos; So I start from that point.&quot; She has a habit of working with trusted friends \u2013 the CEO of her business is a former girlfriend of her brother&apos;s whom Marant met at the age of 14. She likes being surrounded by people who will talk to her honestly&quot;. Her partner, Jerome Dreyfuss, is an accessories designer. Does she ever ask for his opinion? &quot;No, never,&quot; she grins. &quot;Sometimes he will say &apos;I hate that&apos; and I&apos;ll say &apos;I don&apos;t care&apos;.&quot; After an extremely busy 12 months, Marant says her new year&apos;s resolution will be &quot;to be more lazy&quot;. Her fans will be hoping she doesn&apos;t stick to it."}, {"sentences": ["But South Korea&apos;s reaction to Beijing has been more measured than the sharp rebukes delivered from Tokyo and Washington, reflecting a sensitivity towards Seoul&apos;s largest trading partner.", "Washington takes no position on the sovereignty of the islands, but recognises Tokyo&apos;s administrative control and says a US-Japan security pact applies to them."], "tags": ["China", "Japan", "South Korea", "Asia Pacific", "Australia news", "Philippines"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-08T05:41:01Z", "title": "South Korea extends its air defence zone to overlap with China's", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/08/south-korea-air-defence-zone-overlap-chinas", "article": "South Korea says it has extended its air defence zone to partially overlap with a similar zone declared by China two weeks ago that has sharply raised regional tensions. Beijing&apos;s declaration of an air defence identification zone in an area that includes islands at the heart of a territorial dispute with Japan has triggered protests from the United States, Japan, South Korea and Australia. Announcing the expansion of its own zone to include two territorial islands to the south and a submerged rock also claimed by China, South Korea&apos;s defence ministry said the move would not infringe on neighbouring countries&apos; sovereignty. &quot;We believe this will not significantly impact our relationships with China and with Japan as we try to work for peace and co-operation in north-east Asia,&quot; defence ministry head of policy Jang Hyuk told a briefing. &quot;We have explained our position to related countries and overall they are in agreement that this move complies with international regulations and is not an excessive measure,&quot; he said, adding the ministry&apos;s top priority was to work with neighbouring countries to prevent military confrontation. South Korea had objected to last month&apos;s move by China as unacceptable because its new zone includes a maritime rock named Ieodo, which Seoul controls, with a research station platform built on it. China also claims the submerged rock. But South Korea&apos;s reaction to Beijing has been more measured than the sharp rebukes delivered from Tokyo and Washington, reflecting a sensitivity towards Seoul&apos;s largest trading partner. The extension of South Korea&apos;s zone will not apply any restrictions to the operation of commercial flights, the defence ministry said separately in a statement. The move would take effect on 15 December, it said. It will also overlap with Japan&apos;s air defence zone, Jang said. There was no immediate reaction from China, although Beijing&apos;s response to news last week that South Korea was reviewing its options on the air defence zone was relatively low key. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Friday that any move by South Korea must &quot;accord with international law and norms&quot;, but added: &quot;China is willing to maintain communications with South Korea on the basis of equality and mutual respect.&quot; The decision by China that kicked off the latest spat was the subject of a tense disagreement as the US vice-president, Joe Biden, visited China last week, stressing Washington&apos;s objections to the move that he said caused &quot;significant apprehension&quot; in the region.  Japan&apos;s defence minister, on a visit to the Philippines on Sunday, called on the international community to oppose China&apos;s zone and any move to establish a similar zone over the disputed South China Sea. Itsunori Onodera discussed Japan&apos;s concern over China&apos;s action separately with the Philippines defence secretary, Voltaire Gazmin, and Australia&apos;s foreign minister, Julie Bishop. In his meeting with Bishop, Onodera said he mentioned that the international community &quot;should meet to deal with this matter together&quot; and that any unilateral action by coercive means should be opposed. &quot;If any country would establish a similar air zone in the South China Sea, that would bring up tension in the region and I mentioned that should be stopped,&quot; he told reporters in Tacloban, where he visited a school serving as a shelter for villagers who lost their homes in last month&apos;s typhoon. He said that the issue should be resolved by dialogue. China&apos;s ambassador to the Philippines, Ma Keqing, said last week it was Beijing&apos;s right to decide &quot;where and when to set up&quot; an air identification zone. She was asked about a possibility that China might set up a similar zone over the South China Sea. Ma did not say if China would set up such a zone. Onodera said China&apos;s unilateral action violated the spirit of the International Civil Aviation Organization treaty. Ties between China and Japan have been strained for months by the dispute over the islands in the East China Sea, called the Diaoyu by China and the Senkaku by Japan. Washington takes no position on the sovereignty of the islands, but recognises Tokyo&apos;s administrative control and says a US-Japan security pact applies to them. Beijing says its zone is in accordance with international law and Washington and others should respect it. Under the Chinese zone&apos;s rules, all aircraft have to report flight plans to Chinese authorities, maintain radio contact and reply promptly to identification inquiries. US, Japanese and South Korean military aircraft have breached the zone without informing Beijing since it was announced. South Korean and Japanese commercial planes have also been advised by their governments not to follow the rules."}, {"sentences": ["The England international Rachel Williams almost inspired a dramatic comeback in the final of the International Women&apos;s Club Championship in Tokyo, only for Chelsea Ladies to fall just short and lose 4-2.", "The Tokyo-based side then had a chance to wrap things up as a long ball bounced kindly for Goebel-Yanez, but the striker&apos;s chip sailed over."], "tags": ["Women's football", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-08T12:53:20Z", "title": "Inac Kobe Leonessa 4-2 Chelsea Ladies | International Women's Club Championship match report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/08/chelsea-ladies-inac-kobe-lionessa-international-womens-club-championship-match-report", "article": "The England international Rachel Williams almost inspired a dramatic comeback in the final of the International Women&apos;s Club Championship in Tokyo, only for Chelsea Ladies to fall just short and lose 4-2. Despite having numerous chances Chelsea trailed 3-0 to Inac Kobe Leonessa, the Japanese league and cup holders, with only 10 minutes to go before Williams scored one and made one as the Blues almost pulled off the impossible to force the game into extra time. But it was not to be and, with Chelsea throwing caution to the wind, Inac broke and Emi Nakajima found space in the penalty area to secure the Mobcast Cup. Inac broke the deadlock in the 10th minute as a precise passing move cut open the Chelsea defence and Nakajima&apos;s cut-back was tapped in by Megumi Takase. A minute later, a swift counterattack almost led to an equaliser as Eniola Aluko&apos;s cross found Williams only for the England international&apos;s shot to be blocked on the line after she had rounded the keeper. Inac&apos;s second goal arrived from the penalty spot as Beverly Goebel-Yanez stumbled in the box under pressure from Laura Bassett and Emma Wilhelmsson, with the American dusting herself down to send the Chelsea keeper, Marie Hourihan, the wrong way. The half ended with Chelsea on the front foot and they almost got their reward in the final minute but Williams&apos; header from a Yuki Ogimi corner hit the bar. Chelsea started the second half positively and a precise through-ball from Williams found Ogimi in space but the Japan World Cup winner fired tamely. The Tokyo-based side then had a chance to wrap things up as a long ball bounced kindly for Goebel-Yanez, but the striker&apos;s chip sailed over. With Chelsea desperate to get back into the game it was end-to-end action with the Blues full-back Dani Buet drilling the ball agonisingly wide, and Hourihan had to be at her best to deny Kawasumi. Chelsea should have pulled one back after 70 minutes as Williams once again found Ogimi, who rounded the keeper Ayumi Kaihori only for the Inac defence to clear her shot off the line. And that miss proved costly moments later when Inac punished the Londoners with a goal of pure class as the South Korea international Ji So-Yun smashed home from the edge of the area after a patient passing move. But the Blues refused to throw in the towel and with 10 minutes left they were given a lifeline as Williams towered above the Inac defence to head home an Aluko corner. And it was 3-2 in the 83rd minute as Hannah Blundell&apos;s cross was flicked on by Williams and, despite Ogimi&apos;s effort being scrambled clear, Blundell tapped the ball home. But there was to be no dream comeback and the impressive Nakajima rounded off another neat move to ensure the trophy would remain in Japan."}, {"sentences": ["Akira \u2013 Katsuhiro Otomo      Otomo&apos;s arresting and vivid portrayal of gang warfare on the streets of a post-apocalyptic Tokyo ran throughout the &apos;80s, drawing in influences from both the West (Star Wars) and the East (Japanese author Seishi Yokomizo), to dazzling effect."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "PC", "Xbox", "PlayStation", "Indie games", "Books", "Games consoles", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-11T07:00:00Z", "title": "10 books every gamer should read", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/dec/11/ten-books-every-gamer-should-read", "article": "In the 17 years I&apos;ve spent writing about technology, I have had the good fortune to meet, interview and chat with hundreds of game designers from all over the world. I have visited studios throughout the US, in Russia, in Japan, in France, Denmark and, heck, even Britain. And although the cultural references can often be hugely diverse, there are certain books and movies that come up in conversation over and over again.  Here, then, are the 10 books that game designers and developers have cited to me most often as influences on their work. There is a lot of science fiction and fantasy, of course \u2013 these being the predominant genres in the realm of mainstream narrative gaming. In some ways the list could be seen as evidence of the industry&apos;s cultural homogeneity \u2013 the way in which big franchises like Mass Effect, Elder Scrolls and Halo all draw from similar influences. I think they will certainly give you a better idea of the concepts and conventions driving the games industry \u2013 perhaps they will tell you why we have the games we have. I should stress, however, that these aren&apos;t the only books ever referenced to me in development studios.  Indeed there are no doubt ridiculous omissions \u2013 it was never going to be possible to capture all facets of game design inspiration. Also, I chose to stick with fiction to narrow things down a little. I&apos;d invite readers to add their own suggestions in the comments section. For now, here are the 10 books that developers from Osaka to Ohio have most commonly referenced to me. Each entry also has a few alternate titles (all of them also mentioned by developers) which I&apos;ve sneakily added so fewer people would shout at me.  Whatever else, all of these are worth reading. Akira \u2013 Katsuhiro Otomo      Otomo&apos;s arresting and vivid portrayal of gang warfare on the streets of a post-apocalyptic Tokyo ran throughout the &apos;80s, drawing in influences from both the West (Star Wars) and the East (Japanese author Seishi Yokomizo), to dazzling effect. Widely credited with introducing both manga, and though its animated movie translation, anime, to Western audiences, Akira explores ideas of mutation, psychokinesis, military corruption and terrorism, all the while exhibiting the nuclear paranoia that flooded Japanese culture after 1945. Every Armageddon-obsessed adventure from Final Fantasy to Infamous has ideas that can be traced back here. Alternatively: Another classic 80s manga, Fist of the North Star, has been influential. And from the west, Frank Miller&apos;s The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore&apos;s Watchmen are two works dealing in similar areas of warped heroism, mutated humanity and future-noir paranoia.  Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories \u2013 HP Lovecraft      Through a selection of interconnected stories written throughout the twenties and thirties, American writer HP Lovecraft created a new horror mythology, blending the supernatural and science fiction and imagining a universe of dank oppressive dread in which humanity is at the mercy of gigantically powerful monsters. Lovecraft&apos;s bestiary was a huge influence on the makers of seminal tabletop role-playing game, Dungeons and Dragons, thereby working its way into most video game RPGs ever since. And the Cthulhu Mythos that emerged from his works has had an enormous influence on games designers in other genres: indeed, the entire concept of &apos;end of level bosses&apos; practically percolates Lovecraft&apos;s entire philosophy into one game convention. Alternatively: other writers whose own complex fantasy/horror mythologies have inspired game designers include Michael Moorcock (especially the Elric books) and Stephen King (The Dark Tower). Lovecraft was also an influence on another provider of video game set texts, Robert Bloch. Dragon Ball \u2013 Akira Toriyama      Originally serialised in the weekly Japanese comic, Sh\u014dnen Jump, Dragon Ball is widely considered to be one of the greatest mangas of all-time, its volumes selling over 230m copies worldwide. Based around the Chinese novel Journey to the West (the source for the cult TV series Monkey), the epic work combines exciting martial arts action and a Picaresque narrative heaving with eccentric and fascinating characters. There have been dozens of video game conversions of the original works, but Toriyama&apos;s mix of combat, mythology and comedy has inspired hundreds more beat-&apos;em-ups and action adventures. There are also dozens of games that make use of the &quot;over 9000&quot; meme, originating from Dragon Ball Z.Alternatively: Any of the &apos;big three&apos; manga \u2013 Naruto, Bleach or One Piece, all hugely influential to game designers. The Greek Myths - Robert Graves      Video games are utterly crammed with conventions, ideas and archetypes ripped from world mythologies, but Ancient Greece has provided many of the key inspirations. The idea of the heroic quest, a central element in almost every role-playing game, is symbolised in the adventures of Odysseus, Perseus and Theseus, as are the underlying concepts of prophesy, destiny and of &apos;the chosen one&apos; who is born to vanquish evil. This inspiration is obvious in titles like God of War and Altered Beast, but every time a character reaches for a magic item or feels as though they are at the mercy of vengeful gods, it is likely the source goes back to Ancient Greece. I have opted for Robert Graves&apos; much-respected analysis here, but there are plenty of other options, including Bullfinch&apos;s Mythology.Alternatively: the Norse and Celtic mythologies have also been a huge influence on game designers, adding their own slants on iconic concepts such as magical items, warring gods and heroic journeys. There&apos;s also the Bible, of course, which is filled with war, heroism and wrathful deities.  The Hero With a Thousand Faces \u2013 Joseph Campbell      This is a slight cheat as it&apos;s obviously not a novel, but Joseph Campbell&apos;s exhaustive study of world mythologies and the concept of the heroic archetype has been named as an inspiration by countless developers I have spoken to over the last two decades. Campbell&apos;s central argument, that all mythological tales spring from a single monomyth in which a hero defeats a series of challenges to attain a life-changing gift, is central to both video game and movie structure. This is the core stuff of story-telling, later refined into a writing guide by Christopher Vogler in his similarly much-cited work, The Writer&apos;s Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers. Alternatively: Sir James George Frazer&apos;s classic study of archetypal religious beliefs and practices, The Golden Bough, is another oft-named source for video game ideas. House of Leaves - Mark Z. Danielewski      There was a time in the early 2000s when it seemed every studio I visited had a well-thumbed copy of this challenging but fascinating novel left on a desk somewhere. Here, though, it&apos;s as much about form as it is about content \u2013 House of Leaves is a cybertext, a work of &quot;ergodic&quot; literature in which the formatting of the text becomes a puzzle the reader must solve. Through footnotes, blank pages, interviews and codes, Danielewski creates a sort of dynamic experience, that reflected a lot of the experiments into interactive fiction and alternative reality gaming taking place on the web at the time. In essence its a story about how to tell stories in the digital age. Alternatively: Fictions by Jorge Luis Borges is another surreal and playful text that creates meaning in obtuse layers \u2013 it has been name-checked by many developers I&apos;ve spoken to. A couple also mentioned Theodore Roszak&apos;s Flicker, a slightly more conventional take on Danielewski&apos;s use of fictionalised historical writing. King Solomon&apos;s Mines - H. Rider Haggard      Published in 1885, Haggard&apos;s colonialist romp through the deserts and mountains of Africa, brought us Allan Quartermain, the archetypal flawed adventure hero, and introduced the Lost World genre of fiction. These elements, modernised through the Indiana Jones trilogy (don&apos;t... just don&apos;t mention the fourth film), has gone on to inspire everything from Pitfall to Tomb Raider. Any game in which a hero and his bickering team locate a lost temple filled with fabled treasures probably has its roots in Haggard&apos;s novel. Alternatively: Along with Robert Louis Stevenson (Treasure Island) and Edgar Rice Burroughs (Tarzan), Haggard no doubt influenced the heroic fantasy works of authors like Robert E. Howard, whose Conan books have spawned a hundred monosyllabic video game warriors as well shaping the whole sword and sorcery sub-genre. Lord of the Rings \u2013 J.R.R Tolkien      Well, it had to be in here. Although Dungeons and Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax claimed not to have been a fan of Tolkien&apos;s sprawling masterpiece, he conceded its huge influence on his legendary tabletop RPG, specially in the fantastical races that inhabited the rule set. And through D&amp;D, the trilogy has exerted its influence on just about every fantasy video game ever created, from the earliest straight D&amp;D and AD&amp;D conversions to the formative Japanese role-playing games such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, and on into the massively multiplayer era of World of Warcraft. Informed by mythology and folklore, Tolkien established a vast all-encompassing reality to Middle Earth, including a far-reaching sense of history. Arguably, it is Tolkien who taught fantasy game designers about the importance of mythological backstory, of establishing aeons of conflict and lore, lending authenticity to entirely imagined worlds. If a game narrative begins, &quot;after 3,000 years of war...&quot; you can probably blame this guy.Alternatively: Michael Moorcock again, as well as the more playful and parodic Terry Pratchett who subverts all of those supernatural systems for comic effect. And of course, there is a new generation of designers who will grow up on the likes of Brandon Sanderson and Steven Erikson. Mervyn Peake&apos;s Gormenghast books should not be overlooked either.  Neuromancer \u2013 William Gibson      Certainly not the first cyberpunk novel, but possibly the most influential. Gibson&apos;s post-modern tale of hackers, criminal corporations and sentient AIs worked alongside Bladerunner to instil in game designers a new aesthetic of the future. No shiny spaceships and helpful robots, just noirish paranoia, busted up computer hardware, hard-drinking renegades and drugs. The anarchic, counter-culture feel of Gibson&apos;s works appealed to the bedroom programmers of the 80s and early 90s who identified with the author&apos;s damaged, technically brilliant protagonists, and with the assimilation of biological and computer organisms. Games like Syndicate, Beneath as Steel Sky and later Deus Ex, .hack// and Metal Gear Solid caught the vibe perfectly. Alternatively: pretty much anything by Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson or Pat Cadigan. And from manga, Bubblegum Crisis, Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed. Starship Troopers - Robert A. Heinlein      Gears of War, Halo, Killzone, Quake... all of them owe a debt to the concept of the space marine brilliantly realised in Heinlein&apos;s future war epic. He wasn&apos;t the first to write about the concept of a mechanised military defending humanity from invading aliens, but Heinlein captured many of the key elements that would go into the biggest sci-fi games. A troubled hero advancing through the ranks, an insect-like extra-terrestrial threat, a factional military... whatever you think about the archetypal video game space soldier, with his buzz cut, tribal tattoos and immense metallic body armour, it is one of the key images of this console generation, and his family tree goes back to this novel and its contemporaries.Alternatively: Ender&apos;s Game by Orson Scott Card, EE Smith&apos;s Lensman series and Iain M Banks&apos; Culture novels also deal with galactic war, mega weaponry and vicious aliens/AIs. And where would games be without those?"}, {"sentences": ["One of the advisers who worked on the Button plant, Nick Gruen, has argued that Australia should look to China and India to develop the auto know-how that Detroit and Tokyo were unable (or unwilling) to fully utilise."], "tags": ["Holden", "Business", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "Automotive industry"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-12T03:28:49Z", "title": "Holden: Australian to the core, despite Detroit being in the driver's seat", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/12/holden-australian-to-the-core", "article": "Holden is one of the world&apos;s oldest transport brands, being established by James Alexander Holden as an Adelaide saddlery business in 1856 before going into coach building. The family business shifted into the new form of horsepower from 1908 and began large-scale local production of car bodies for General Motors of the US in 1917. Its famous emblem of a lion rolling a stone was an art deco-style fable of man inventing the wheel, even though the symbolism was possibly lost on later generations of petrol heads. Holden has been owned by General Motors of the US since 1931 but has retained its image of Australianness to the end. Maybe it came from Holden being the first company to mass-produce a car in Australia in 1948, at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne. The then prime minister, Ben Chifley, was on hand to exclaim: &quot;She&apos;s a beauty!&quot; even though the first model, the FX, was in fact rather bulbous and plain apart from a shark-toothed chrome grille at the front. The early Holdens came amid the rapid growth of suburbia after the second world war and local car production was fostered by bipartisan policies of protectionism for strategic local industries. Other Holden models drove into Australian folklore. The FJ was the subject and title of a 1977 film about young men in Bankstown in western Sydney. Australian boys, and many girls, could tell the difference between an EH or an EJ, along with the HR and HD. A book explored the social history of the Kingswood (Up for Rego, by Richard Strauss), which also supplied the name for a homegrown sitcom. There were epic racetrack battles at Bathurst between the late driving legend Peter Brock and Alan Moffatt in a Falcon. Customised panel vans such as the Sandman were turned into fetish symbols and their &quot;meaning&quot; was later studied in the era of pop semiotics. But the Puberty Blues surfie generation was more blunt, dubbing them shaggin&apos; wagons, and the vans sometimes had a sticker that warned passersby not to bother knocking if they were rocking. Then there was the Torana, which started out as a skinny little thing, but muscled up. There was the Monaro, which was always a big fast-back bruiser. And there was the Commodore, a workhorse which was first produced in 1978 and went on to be Australia&apos;s best-selling car for 15 years in row. But the evolution of the Commodore also pointed to the reasons for the eventual demise of Holden as a local manufacturer. The quality of the Commodore improved markedly but the 2006 VE model \u2013 the first designed wholly in Australia \u2013 reportedly cost more than $1bn to develop. The Commodore and the Falcon (produced by its great rival, Ford) were &quot;orphans&quot; \u2013 cars that were mostly developed and sold in a single country. The big car makers switched to so-called &quot;global platforms&quot; (essentially everything under the body skin such as the chassis, engine and transmission). These global platforms could underpin the production of multiple models and the development costs could be shared. For a while, Holden did well with exports of the Commodore to the US, where it was rebadged as a Pontiac. But the global financial crisis and the costs of retiree health schemes in the US almost sank the parent company, General Motors, and a cull of its US brands included the Pontiac. The woes of GM were a reminder that, while Holden and Ford were big wheels in Australia, they were small, branch offices of huge, multinational corporations. Head office in Detroit dictated the local production lineup up and the Australian chiefs of Holden and Ford were typically shifted after several years to other roles within the corporate empires. Consumers switched to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. The families who used to buy Commodores and Falcons bought sports utility vehicles instead. The old tariff walls that protected the local producers have now been cut to 5%, while free trade agreements have cut the effective tariff rate to 3.5%. The tariff rate will shrink further after the signing of the FTA with Korea, and other planned trade deals with China and Japan. The local car maker was criticised for not making smaller cars, but big production runs are needed to make a profit. Car plants usually need to have annual output of at least 100,000 cars to be viable and Holden will make about 75,000 this year. The top selling car in Australia last year, the Mazda3, sold 44,128. One reason for this fragmentation is that Australia has one of the most competitive new car markets in the world. For example, China has annual car sales of 28 million (47 makes and 379 models) while Australia has annual sales of 1 million with 51 makes and 344 models.This competition has been compounded by the resources boom pushing the Australian dollar beyond parity with the US. Imports were cheaper and exports dearer. Recession-struck European car makers looked to increase exports to Australia; and, more recently, the devaluation of the yen has pushed down the price of Japanese cars. The car plan introduced in the mid-1980s by Labor\u2019s industry minister John Button sought to force the rationalisation of car makers and the number of models produced through lower tariffs and easing of import quotas. The aim was to improve local vehicles and boost exports as well. As the then treasurer Paul Keating famously noted: &quot;The shoe is designed to pinch.&quot; Indeed, and Nissan shut its Melbourne plant in 1991. Mitsubishi shut its Adelaide factory in 2008. Yet Australia still has very advanced automotive skills, being one of only a dozen or so countries which can design a modern car from the ground up and then build it. Holden, Ford and Toyota all have advanced research and design centres in Australia, but these operations are usually located alongside manufacturing plants. Ford has said it will keep this work in Australia \u2013 which employs about 1100 engineers and designers \u2013 but it needs to have access to industry assistance which is now limited to car makers. One of the advisers who worked on the Button plant, Nick Gruen, has argued that Australia should look to China and India to develop the auto know-how that Detroit and Tokyo were unable (or unwilling) to fully utilise. A London-based author and consultant, John Wormald, has cited the Indian-owned Jaguar Land Rover as a possible model (Chinese interests now own the collapsed Volvo group). A journalist who has specialised in manufacturing, Peter Roberts, has argued that globalisation has delivered Australia an industry that suits the needs of foreign capital, rather than the nation. &quot;The end-game is a de-industrialised country reliant on finance, services industries and resources extraction.&quot; Academic Roy Green has called an end to the blame game and to get on with a new strategy for manufacturing in the 21st century. However there remains a lot of emotion swirling around the end of Holden. Its cars helped give many Australians mobility, when petrol was cheaper and times seemed freer. Its demise is an economic and political milestone, but a psychological one as well."}, {"sentences": ["Japan now has 129 inmates on death row, including Shoko Asahara, leader of the doomsday cult behind the 1995 sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway in which 13 people died and thousands were injured."], "tags": ["Japan", "Capital punishment", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Amnesty International"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-12T08:31:58Z", "title": "Japan condemned for 'secret' executions", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/12/japan-condemned-secret-executions", "article": "Japan has carried out another round of &quot;secret&quot; executions, bringing to eight the number of inmates sent to the gallows under the year-old administration of Shinzo Abe. Media reports said two men had been hanged in the fourth round of executions since Abe took office last December. Previous hangings took place in February, April and September, suggesting that the government plans to carry them out every few months. On Thursday, Mitsuo Fujishima, 55, was hanged for two murders in 1986, while Ryoji Kagayama, 63, had been convicted of killing two people in 2000 and 2008, media reports said. Japan has brushed aside calls by Amnesty and the European Union to abolish the death penalty, citing strong public support for the punishment. Opinion polls regularly put support for capital punishment at over 80%. Thursday&apos;s hangings came just after the parliamentary recess began, and as Abe&apos;s approval ratings began to tumble following the passage last week of a controversial secrecy law. The justice minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki, who signed the execution orders, said the two executed men had been guilty of brutal crimes. &quot;The executions were carried out after careful consideration of their cases,&quot; Tanigaki told reporters, adding that he saw no need to respond to calls to review the opaque way Japan administers capital punishment. Prisoners, who spend years, even decades, on death row, typically are not told of their execution until hours before they are led to the gallows. Their lawyers and relatives are informed only after the execution has been carried out. In a report published in 2008, Amnesty said inmates in Japan were being driven insane and exposed to &quot;cruel, inhuman and degrading&quot; punishment. The executions in February this year were the first since September 2012. The previous government, led by the centre-left Democratic party of Japan, executed nine people during its three years and three months in office. That included an 18-month period in which no one was hanged. The resumption of executions in March 2012 angered campaigners, who believed Japan was moving toward abolition. On Thursday, Amnesty said Japan was increasingly out of step with the international community. &quot;The fast pace at which the Abe administration is conducting executions goes directly against the international community&apos;s repeated calls to abolish capital punishment,&quot; the group&apos;s Japan branch said in a statement. Japan now has 129 inmates on death row, including Shoko Asahara, leader of the doomsday cult behind the 1995 sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway in which 13 people died and thousands were injured. Japan and the US are the only G7 countries to retain capital punishment, along with more than 50 other countries, including China and Iran. More than two-thirds of countries, including all EU member states, have ended executions in law or practice."}, {"sentences": ["She moved to the United States from Tokyo five years ago in order to pursue her dream of becoming a cake designer.", "I am originally from Tokyo, Japan, and moved here to learn American cake decorating and pastry arts."], "tags": ["Cake", "Weddings", "Food & drink", "Dessert", "Careers", "US news", "New York", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-12T12:45:00Z", "title": "Sugar high: I am a professional cake designer. Have any questions for me? | Alisa Suzuki", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/12/my-life-as-a-cake-designer", "article": "Alisa Suzuki has quite a &quot;yummy life&quot;. She moved to the United States from Tokyo five years ago in order to pursue her dream of becoming a cake designer. It was such an unusual goal that Japanese TV and media did special programs about her experience. After graduating from the Culinary Institute of America, she joined a cake studio in New York City. Alisa is sharing some of the secrets of her trade for the Guardian&apos;s A day&apos;s work series. Post more questions for her in the comments below and she&apos;ll respond later today. 1. What is your typical day like? There is no typical day. Distinct from storefront bakeries, we work at a decorating studio \u2013 every single cake we create is totally original. Depending on upcoming events, our schedule changes continuously day by day. Sometimes we work on sugar art pieces all day for a wedding cake that is three months later. Other times we get last minute orders and the entire team will work on it.  First thing in the morning, my boss and the artististic team have a brief meeting to review strategy and make sure everyone knows their individual tasks. This is really important for us because from designing to finishing, so many people get involved on one cake. Everyone needs to be on the same page. Then, I start making sugar decorations, which we have to make in advance, because the drying time is so long. We always have an exquisitely designed sketch, which is already confirmed by the client, so my job is to duplicate the sketch, only transformed into sugar paste. When it&apos;s close to the day of delivery, I am often working in the kitchen baking cakes, making buttercream or crumbcoating. 2. What&apos;s the craziest/most unexpected thing that&apos;s ever happened to you while on the job? I am originally from Tokyo, Japan, and moved here to learn American cake decorating and pastry arts. Since I started this job, I have been interviewed by the Japanese media because it&apos;s a very interesting career for a Japanese person. I would have never expected that I would be on Japanese TV shows for my profession. I have even taught celebrities how to decorate cakes! 3. What advice do you have for novice bakers? I would say, by all means, planning. Planning is very important for baking and cake decorating. You should always have a clear vision of the final product before you begin. I always leave plenty of time to plan and sketch any project. Our customers not only expect exquisite visual results but also a fresh-tasting product. Hence, we try to finish cakes as close as possible to delivery. Given the complicated designs we do, this requires a tight schedule, careful planning and efficiency. I always pay attention to anything in my life that inspires me. For example, I love collecting photographs from wedding and fashion magazines, flower books, jewelry images, pieces of fabric or even decorative wrapping paper. Those things are a great inspiration for my art. I rarely search other cake decorator&apos;s images except when I want to learn new techniques by observing. There are infinite possibilities to one&apos;s creativity. 4. Do you watch reality TV shows like Cake Boss? Are they at all realistic? I am not really a TV person, so I don&apos;t follow them much. I have watched several episodes of Cake Boss, Ace of Cakes, and Sweet Genius. I have to say some scenes are obviously exaggerated, because it&apos;s a show a certain element of drama is expected. For instance, it is true that we are awfully careful when we deliver intricately assembled cakes, but they are constructed very well, so thankfully I have never had the experience of having to fix a destroyed cake. I really hope that won&apos;t ever happen to me. I do have a great respect for those &quot;cake stars&quot; on TV. They are the ones who inspired me to start this career. One of them even taught me in person, and I am so grateful that now I make my living out of this dream job like they do. 5. What&apos;s your annual salary? Do you get benefits? We don&apos;t have a fixed annual salary. Generally cake designers work by hours because making specialty cakes is labor intensive. Which means we work overtime if needed. Usually we work about 40 hours on weekdays. The pay varies greatly. A designer cake studio is different than a production bakery. Specialty cake designers often make between $21,000 and $42,000. We do not get healthcare benefits. Cake delivery is one of my favorite parts of the job because we get to see beautifully decorated party venues, and above all, we get to see the client&apos;s reaction. One of the greatest benefits is that I will be able to have my wedding cake! Our teamwork is incredible, and I trust them so much. I wouldn&apos;t want to let anyone make my own wedding cake besides my teammates. So we often talk that we will make a perfect wedding cake for each other when the time comes \u2026hopefully soon. 6. What&apos;s the biggest mistake you&apos;ve ever made while working? Surprisingly, this question was the hardest one to answer. Although I think it was part of my learning process, I originally undercharged for my cakes after leaving culinary school. I started cake decorating as a hobby when I was 13, and my purpose was simply to make my family and friends happy. When I started this as a profession, it was very hard for me to determine a price for my cakes. Since I am an artist by nature, I can spend hours and hours going into detail. I was terrible at knowing when to finish. As I mentioned before, having a sketch of the cake ahead of time really helps to solve this problem. It therefore becomes easier for me to estimate the required hours and labor cost."}, {"sentences": ["The islands are claimed by Beijing as the Diaoyus and by Tokyo as the Senkakus.", "Abe and leaders of the Association of South-east Asian Nations agreed at a summit in Tokyo on Saturday for the need for freedom of the high seas and skies and called for the peaceful resolution of disputes."], "tags": ["Shinzo Abe", "Senkaku Islands", "China", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-15T05:02:18Z", "title": "China bitterly attacks Japanese prime minister over air zone remarks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/15/china-attacks-japan-prime-minister-air-zone", "article": "China has condemned Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, for &quot;maliciously slandering&quot; its self-proclaimed air defence zone, ratcheting up the war of words between the neighbours over Beijing&apos;s annexation of the skies over a group of disputed islands. Abe told a news conference that China&apos;s recent announcement of the air defence identification zone over disputed islands in the East China Sea was &quot;unjustly violating the freedom of aviation over the high seas&quot; and demanded Beijing rescind it. In the most bitter remarks so far in the dispute, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei defended the zone, which has triggered protests from Japan, the United States and South Korea. &quot;We express strong dissatisfaction with Japan&apos;s leader using an international occasion to maliciously slander China,&quot; Hong said in a statement seen on the ministry website on Sunday. The islands are claimed by Beijing as the Diaoyus and by Tokyo as the Senkakus. &quot;The Diaoyus are an inherent territory of China. Japan&apos;s seizure and occupation of the islands are illegal and invalid,&quot; Hong said, arguing that the air zone was in line with international laws and practices, and did not affect aviation freedom. &quot;The Chinese side took necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is totally legitimate and irreproachable. Japan&apos;s attempt to play tricks with concept \u2026 and mislead world opinion is doomed to failure.&quot; China&apos;s air defence zone and its territorial claims in the South China Sea have raised concerns of an escalation in the area. On Saturday the US navy said one of its warships monitoring a Chinese aircraft carrier was nearly hit by another Chinese military vessel and had to take evasive action.  China and several nations that are members of the Asean group have competing territorial claims in the energy-rich South China Sea. Abe and leaders of the Association of South-east Asian Nations agreed at a summit in Tokyo on Saturday for the need for freedom of the high seas and skies and called for the peaceful resolution of disputes. The statement did not criticise China&apos;s air zone. Many Asean members have deep economic ties with China. Sino-Japanese tensions have risen over the past year in a long-running dispute over the Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea. Both countries have scrambled aircraft and conducted naval patrols in the area."}, {"sentences": ["As Hailo, which launched in 2011 in London, looks to expand its global reach to cities like Tokyo and Osaka, we caught up with Bregman\u00a0to talk about what it takes to run and grow company globally."], "tags": ["Entrepreneurs", "Business", "Sharing economy", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-15T14:00:41Z", "title": "Hailo: the taxi app that gets people off the streets", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/15/hailo-taxi-hailing-app-global-growth", "article": "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the guy that everyone around the world knows,\u201d Jay Bregman, founder and CEO of Hailo, says as we begin our interview. Bregman, a New Yorker by birth who now lives in London, knows how to humblebrag. He scoffs at the idea of seeking exposure and says he has no interest in gracing the covers of techie magazines. He has chosen a quietly populist path: getting masses of people to find yellow cabs without waiting on street corners in the rain. Bregman&apos;s\u00a0e-hailing app Hailo is available in 11 cities, including New York, where yellow cabs sometimes outnumber regular cars. It&apos;s not surprising he turned his talents to fixing the sometimes uncivilized scrum for transportation on his hometown&apos;s street corners; there are few cities where cabs are as cheap and plentiful as they are in New York. \u201cNew Yorkers will, like people in London, and Dublin, and Toronto, and Chicago, Boston, find e-hailing a cab to be a natural evolution to compliment the way they get home,\u201d Bregman\u00a0said earlier this year when Hailo was approved to run in New York. Months later, New Yorkers can both hail and pay for a cab with their phone\u00a0\u2013 no wallet required. Like many creators of successful companies, Bregman\u00a0looks back on his journey with surprise.  One day you are sitting at your kitchen and sketching out this idea for something you passionately care about \u2026 then you come back to London and it&apos;s everywhere. People are using it everywhere.  Unlike its rival, Uber, which works with fleets of sleek black Town Cars, Hailo works with taxi companies to connect cabbies with customers. As Hailo, which launched in 2011 in London, looks to expand its global reach to cities like Tokyo and Osaka, we caught up with Bregman\u00a0to talk about what it takes to run and grow company globally.     Hailo Executive Team (Left to Right): Ron Zeghibe, chairman, Jay Bregman, CEO, and Caspar Woolley, COO. Photograph: Courtesy of Hailo    Often entrepreneurs say that the first year is the hardest time for a new business due to funding, hiring and getting the product to the market. What does it take to get a company like Hailo off the ground? The key is the same as with most things, you need the idea and you need considerable effort. I am driven by my desire to rid inefficiencies where they exist. I love it when things work better and love it when I can help drive that improvement. Success is the byproduct of our real main effort, which is creating change. With Hailo and our technology, we introduced thought and the ability for an entire industry to evolve \u2013 after it has been static practically since its inception. Do you have any advice based on your experience? Details matter. The world today moves so fast and consumers are not interested in giving second or third chances [to companies]. We aim to get it right first and when we have a problem, we own it. We try to cultivate an accessible organization on every level. Loyalty needs to be built and when there is a steady and sustained level of care, people really respond. Clearly, Hailo has grown a lot over the past few years. Has your leadership changed as the company grew? My main goal is to enhance the experience of those in the company. Really that means trying to stay out of people&apos;s way. As a company grows, there is a maturation process, and that includes letting the people you recruit do what it is they do. I want to be a resource as much as anything else to them, to help them help the company and the customers \u2013 meaning both our drivers and passengers. What would you say is the most difficult part about managing a global company? I don\u2019t generally think in terms of difficult. We have a worldwide apparatus that continues to grow. Nothing could be more exciting. Wherever we expand, our ideal is to leverage our internal expertise with local super talent. We find great driver partners and build teams with smart people who know and understand the lay of the land. Take Japan for instance. We were lucky enough to hire Kiyotaka Fujii as President, Japan and Asia Pacific. Fujii&apos;s experience in Asia with McKinsey and Louis Vuitton make him the ideal person to roll out Hailo there. With individual market knowledge, we can augment with the Hailo understanding and experience internally \u2013 starting with our board but also with our engineering teams and units like marketing and operations. There is a ton of internal knowledge that gets called upon in every new city we enter.     Founders of Hailo (Left to Right): Terry Runham, Caspar Woolley, Russell Hall, Jay Bregman, Ron Zeghibe, Gary Jackson Photograph: Courtesy of Hailo    What qualities do you look for when hiring? Smarts always count, but there also needs to be passion. I like a certain level of fearlessness. Not reckless, mind you, but individuals who can break free from convention and really see and feel and taste the next thing. I want people who can&apos;t even see the box. What&apos;s a typical interview/hiring process at Hailo like? It is varied. Great people tend to beget great people so personal recommendations from members of the team are appreciated. I like to stay close to the tech community and you will hear about a hot talented person \u2013 and I am always interested in talking to those people. Sometimes it leads to a job and sometimes it means just growing the company&apos;s network and making friends. We also like to find people with specific hands-on expertise.\u00a0We hired Tom Barr early this year. As president of coffee, Tom spent 12 years making Starbucks ubiquitous. The guy is a tremendous talent, just an operational, show-running legend. As soon as he got on our radar, we knew he was the right person to take Hailo to the next level. You have previously said that Hailo is a mission-driven business: do you find that having a mission at the core of your business helps you inspire your employees? Of course. There is nothing like a defined ethos to galvanize a team. We are bringing real tangible change. We get mail from customers who literally love the service we provide. That type of thing is extremely validating and motivating. Who can ask for more? What&apos;s your approach to experimenting and failure? You cannot win if you do not play. Life is finite and to bring real meaningful change often means venturing into the unknown. That can be scary, but it is also exhilarating. You have to be mindful of who you take that journey with and I am so lucky to have the partners I do and so lucky to have assembled a team of true dynamic thinkers and dynamic doers. When something does not go as planned, it is important to recognize that early, cut your losses, regroup and fix it. Learning from mistakes is not optional; it is a lifestyle."}, {"sentences": ["The fights rarely lasted long and, in keeping with this, the era of Tyson&apos;s indomitability \u2013 brought to an end when journeyman Buster Douglas floored him in Tokyo in 1990 \u2013 flashes quickly past in the book."], "tags": ["Autobiography and memoir", "Mike Tyson", "Boxing", "Sport", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-16T08:30:00Z", "title": "Undisputed Truth: My Autobiography by Mike Tyson \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/16/undisputed-truth-mike-tyson-autobiography-review", "article": "Nothing in his subsequent exchanges with Paul Holdengr\u00e4ber could quite live up to the moment when Mike Tyson took to the stage last month at Madison Square Garden \u2013 sorry, I mean the New York Public Library.

A collective gasp and we were on our feet \u2013 not as an expression of admiration, more a recoil from sheer physical and psychic proximity. This would never happen with the writers and intellectuals who usually grace this august stage. They are interesting, admired or even loved on the basis of stuff they have created, that is external to them. But everything\u00a0that had made Tyson famous and infamous \u2013 the fact of his body and its capacity for violence \u2013 was\u00a0there in the room. Among the living only Diego Maradona (whom I also saw once, in an equally improbable setting, as he emerged from the Oxford Union) has risen to comparable heights from such depths \u2013 and then plummeted back down again. Paul Gascoigne was an amazing footballer and Ben Johnson ran extremely fast but Maradona&apos;s and Tyson&apos;s life stories place them in a different realm. In Naples there are still shrines to Diego. When Tyson, at the library, said that he had been a god this seemed a self-definition that even Richard Dawkins might allow. Holdengr\u00e4ber begins his interviews by asking guests to define themselves in seven words. Tyson&apos;s were &quot;Came, saw, conquered, got conquered, bounced back.&quot; The ungodly twist is all in the last two. Maradona and Tyson fell \u2013 and fell prey to pretty similar temptations \u2013 while avoiding a fatal Senna-esque collision with destiny. And so, after being a god, Tyson has ended up like thousands of other literary contenders: on the promo circuit with product to hustle. Undisputed Truth is the latest and biggest bounce in a bills-to-pay comeback that began with James Toback&apos;s intimate documentary, Tyson, and continued with an acting role in The Hangover. Tyson played himself, naturally, a role he reprised for a one-man Broadway show that was then filmed by Spike Lee. The autobiography grew directly out of that show and even if it is not, as Holdengr\u00e4ber claimed, up there with St Augustine&apos;s Confessions, it&apos;s got a lot more fighting. That it&apos;s also addictive is down in part to Tyson&apos;s co-author, Larry Sloman. Tyson claims he &quot;inherited Cus&apos;s ability to tell stories&quot; but as he regaled the audience with lispy anecdotes \u2013 growing up in Brooklyn, breaking into houses and being on the roof with his pigeons \u2013 it rapidly became as interesting as hearing a celebrity recount a dream. Tyson is a history nut, and a prompted digression on the Visigoths was as dull as \u2013 if slightly more confusing than \u2013 a lecture by a Cambridge don. Things only really got going when he burst into invective and profanity. I missed the one-man show but a friend reported that the best moment came when Tyson spotted a guy asleep in the front row. Mike went up to him and yelled in his face that he was gonna stick his dick in his mouth. It wasn&apos;t quite on a par with the pre-fight/post-brawl press conference with Lennox Lewis \u2013 &quot;I&apos;ll fuck you in your ass in front of everybody,&quot; Tyson screamed at a reporter. &quot;I&apos;ll fuck you till you love me, faggot!&quot; \u2013 but the sleeper in the front row went home persuaded that he&apos;d got his money&apos;s worth. Having encouraged Tyson to ramble through his past, Sloman shaped the mass of material into a narrative that opens with the most vehemently disputed part of the story: the conviction for raping Desiree Washington in 1991. Adamant that he did no such thing, Tyson goes into graphic detail, later, to explain how he didn&apos;t (he went down on her while she was menstruating, apparently unaware that he was &quot;gargling blood&quot;). The conviction might have been shaky but so is the defence that it&apos;s impossible to &quot;rape someone when they come to your hotel at two in the morning. There&apos;s nothing open that late but legs.&quot; Bear in mind also that any charm Tyson possessed was inseparable from the &quot;bad intentions&quot; manifest in the ring: &quot;My social skills consisted of putting a guy in a coma.&quot; But remember, also, that his capacity for brute intimidation did nothing to staunch the flow of women eager to have sex with him, not just after the conviction but while he was in prison. Out of jail after three years, he became an easy mark for claims of assault and sexual harassment even when he was trying to keep some of these women at bay \u2013 not because, as a convert to the Nation of Islam, he was newly abstemious, but because they were skanky hos. It got to the point where he &quot;was hardly seen out in public. One reason for that was that I spent a lot of time indoors at strip clubs.&quot; More time, certainly, then he spent at his mansion in Connecticut with its 5,000 sq ft master bedroom and the 19 other bedrooms he aimed to fill with different girls at the same time. He had a palace in Vegas, too, but his true home was what Conrad called &quot;the destructive element&quot;. Throw in an annual income that was often in excess of $50m (enough to ensure that, like the former champions he idolised, he&apos;d wind up flat broke), a titanic coke habit (he&apos;d wander round with his stash in a big bag, &quot;a straw coming out of it like it was a milkshake&quot;) and you have a young man in the unusual position of being both gladiator and emperor, &quot;a sewage rat with delusions of grandeur&quot;, a ghetto kid with zero self-esteem and an ego borne of the knowledge that, in a fair fight, he could beat everyone on the planet to a pulp.            Unconvinced that he had been fairly beaten, one of those opponents, Mitch Green, high on angel dust, starts taunting Tyson who beats him up again in the street. Bloodied \u2013 &quot;I had crushed his eye socket, broken his nose, cracked some ribs&quot; \u2013 but unbowed, Mitch comes back for another helping a few pages later when Mike is &quot;on a date with some exotic hot Afrocentric chick named Egypt or Somalia or some other country like that&quot;. She stops him carving Mitch up with a steak knife (&quot;I wasn&apos;t a vegan then&quot;) but being with Tyson or working for him could turn bad almost as quickly as fighting against him. One feels zero sympathy for Don King (&quot;a wretched, slimy reptilian motherfucker&quot;) or Frank Warren, both of whom get richly stomped, but spare a thought for the bodyguard who &quot;actually began to think his name was &apos;Motherfucker&apos; because all he&apos;d hear was &apos;Motherfucker. Get me this.&quot;&apos; As will be clear by now, Sloman brings Tyson&apos;s voice springing off the page with its often hilarious combo of street and shrink, pimp profanity and the &quot;prisony pseudo-intellectual modern mack rap&quot; of the autodidact. Training for the Lewis fight in Hawaii \u2013 &quot;epicentre of some of the baddest weed in the world&quot; \u2013 was not a great idea, boxing-wise, but just as all that &quot;Maui Wowie made for some interesting press conferences&quot; so his &quot;stupid un-fucking-legible English&quot; makes for some surprising prose. There&apos;s a moment of flat-out brilliance when he gets the Maori tattoo on his face: &quot;I hated my face and I literally wanted to deface myself.&quot; The later journey to sobriety sees him leaning harder on cliche \u2013 he&apos;s particularly fond of the idea that relapse is part of recovery \u2013 but the sense of threat, to himself and others, is constant. Which makes you wonder if one of the regrettable things about the years of substance abuse involved a drug he didn&apos;t take. A dealer (called Chance, appropriately enough) is ordered to get Tyson a Scarface quantity of coke even though &quot;all he did was sissy drugs like ecstasy&quot;. Would MDMA have got him all loved up (a state and place he now longs to be) or had the iron been forged too deeply in his soul? The commonly understood narrative \u2013 one with an undeniable chronological truth \u2013 is that Tyson only began to go off the rails after the death of goodly Cus D&apos;Amato. Cus had taken this kid from the ghetto under his wing and trained him to be a champion, dying before the ambition was realised. After that, Mike had no one to guide him. But D&apos;Amato, who didn&apos;t have &quot;a happy muscle in his face&quot;, didn&apos;t just want Tyson to be &quot;totally ferocious&quot; in the ring; he trained him to be fearsome outside it as well. D&apos;Amato might have been able to restrain some of the later excesses, would have stopped him getting cheated, but he helped incubate the toxins that coursed freely through Tyson&apos;s system and world after he became champion. As for the boxing, Tyson was a great fighter who never fought any great fights. Either because he beat his opponents too easily \u2013 he was too good \u2013 or, with the possible exception of the first, toothless encounter with Evander Holyfield, because he was beaten too easily (as a result of failing to prepare properly, of losing his earlier\u00a0hunger). He never went toe-to-toe with greatness, as Ali and Frazier did repeatedly, was never fully tested while fully committed to passing that test. As Cus intended, many of Tyson&apos;s\u00a0opponents were out on their feet before a punch was thrown. The fights rarely lasted long and, in keeping with this, the era of Tyson&apos;s indomitability \u2013 brought to an end when journeyman Buster Douglas floored him in Tokyo in 1990 \u2013 flashes quickly past in the book. After that, victories and defeats in the ring become almost irrelevant in the chaos and swirling mania that surround and consume him. He burns his way through an unbelievable fortune and never, not once in almost 600 pages, expresses any regret on that score. Apparently Sloman&apos;s opening move in tempting Tyson into this collaboration was to send a copy of Nietzsche&apos;s Ecce Homo to him while he was in prison. Nietzsche&apos;s notion of greatness was the capacity to embrace your fate wholesale: if you enjoy one divine moment then you say yes to all others, however hellish. Tyson, with his jailed grasp of momentary immortality, got this right away, probably knew it already: &quot;Just to have one year of living Mike Tyson, the champ&apos;s life, I would be a bum sucking rat piss in the gutter. Shit, yeah.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Abe is very rightwing by traditional measures,&quot; said Akio Takahara, professor of international relations and law at Tokyo University, which makes him a potentially dangerous figure.", "The research director of a leading Tokyo thinktank offered a third perspective: &quot;I would call him one of a new kind of very conservative, patriotic politicians who are not always happy with postwar Japan&apos;s traditional, leftwing internationalists and their strong tendency towards irresponsible pacifism.&quot; In short, he said, Abe was saying it was time for Japan to stand up for itself, that it was &quot;OK to be proud&quot; again.", "Abe argued that &quot;class-A&quot; war criminals charged by the Tokyo tribunal after the 1945 capitulation were not criminals under domestic law.", "In October last year Abe courted more region-wide controversy by visiting the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which commemorates Japan&apos;s war dead (including some convicted war criminals).", "The silent majority&apos;s support for Shinzo is still there and it&apos;s real,&quot; the Tokyo research analyst said.", "Last weekend he hosted an Asean summit in Tokyo marking 40 years of diplomatic ties.", "He scored another, personal triumph when he flew to Buenos Aires in September and, Blair-like, helped to secure the 2020 Olympic Games for Tokyo.", "He later moved to Tokyo.", "Education: Seikei elementary school and Seikei high school, Tokyo.", "What they say: &quot;Abe is one of a new kind of very conservative, patriotic politicians who are not always happy with postwar Japan&apos;s traditional, leftwing internationalists and their strong tendency towards irresponsible pacifism.&quot; \u2013 research director of a leading Tokyo thinktank."], "tags": ["Shinzo Abe", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Senkaku Islands"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-16T12:57:49Z", "title": "Shinzo Abe: is Japan's PM a dangerous militarist or modernising reformer?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/16/shinzo-abe-japan-pm", "article": "The escalating battle of nerves between Japan and China over a disputed island chain has focused the international spotlight on Shinzo Abe, Japan&apos;s pugnaciously conservative prime minister, who is carrying the heavy responsibility of war and peace on his hunched shoulders. As east Asia&apos;s leading nations talk tensely of war and peace, Abe&apos;s critics say it is his brand of unrepentant, rightwing nationalism that has helped push the region to the brink. His supporters say Abe is rightly, finally standing up for Japan. How Abe might react if China&apos;s unilaterally imposed &quot;air defence zone&quot; over the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea triggers armed clashes is a serious international concern. The US is pledged to come to Japan&apos;s aid should it be attacked, while hardliners in China&apos;s military leadership would welcome a fight over what they call &quot;core interests&quot;. There is potential for a head-on superpower collision. Since taking office as prime minister for the second time a year ago, stocky, tousle-haired Abe, 59, has avoided hotheaded actions and kept his political powder dry. But he is no patsy, either. Nobody knows for sure which way he may jump, if push comes to shove. &quot;Abe is very rightwing by traditional measures,&quot; said Akio Takahara, professor of international relations and law at Tokyo University, which makes him a potentially dangerous figure. &quot;He is a historical revisionist at heart \u2026 He is a nationalist [pursuing] his &apos;new nationalism&apos;.&quot; In this sense, Takahara suggested, Abe was a throwback to Japan&apos;s past, and thus an obstacle to the sort of calm dialogue needed in dealing with China. Not so, said Yoshiji Nogami, a former Japanese ambassador to Britain who has known Abe personally for many years. &quot;He is, first and foremost, a politician and a politician&apos;s instinct is to survive. As his first premiership ended in such a disastrous way, he is determined to stay this time.     China's threats over the disputed Senkaku islands have served Shinzo Abe well, analysts believe. Photograph: Kyodo/Reuters    &quot;In order to stay in power for a long period of time, I believe he can be flexible. He is not an ideologue. He is certainly a conservative, a nationalist and right of centre, but he is not an ideological rightwinger,&quot; Nogami said. The research director of a leading Tokyo thinktank offered a third perspective: &quot;I would call him one of a new kind of very conservative, patriotic politicians who are not always happy with postwar Japan&apos;s traditional, leftwing internationalists and their strong tendency towards irresponsible pacifism.&quot; In short, he said, Abe was saying it was time for Japan to stand up for itself, that it was &quot;OK to be proud&quot; again. Dangerous militarist or modernising reformer, Abe&apos;s career has rarely lacked controversy. Born in September 1954 to an affluent and influential family, he became Japan&apos;s youngest-ever prime minister in 2006 and the first to be born after the end of the second world war. Abe&apos;s late father, Shintaro Abe, was foreign minister and his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister in the 1950s. Kishi was also a cabinet member during the war and was once suspected of war crimes by the allied forces. The case was thrown out. Elected to parliament in 1993, Abe was later selected to work for the popular prime minister Junichiro Koizumi. He gained public notice by taking a tough stance on North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens and took a big political risk when he travelled to meet the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il in 2002. Abe&apos;s old-fashioned, some would say regressive, views on social issues began to take shape when he helped sponsor an education bill initially entitled Love for One&apos;s Country. He became deeply involved in the incendiary issue of how Japanese school textbooks talk about recent history, favouring a more benign, sanitised view of imperial Japan&apos;s past actions. In 2006 he published what became a patriotic bestseller, Towards a Beautiful Country, which was viewed as his personal testament. Abe argued that &quot;class-A&quot; war criminals charged by the Tokyo tribunal after the 1945 capitulation were not criminals under domestic law. From early on, Abe the alpha-male traditionalist appears to have had a woman problem. He frequently became embroiled in rows about the so-called wartime Korean comfort women, who were prostituted by Japanese troops, claiming at one point that coercion was not involved. His remarks caused outrage in South Korea and elsewhere. &quot;He&apos;s passionate about Japanese victims of North Korea \u2013 and blind to Japan&apos;s own war crimes,&quot; complained the Washington Post in a 2007 editorial. In October last year Abe courted more region-wide controversy by visiting the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which commemorates Japan&apos;s war dead (including some convicted war criminals). He has not visited again since taking office, but has suggested he would like to do so. His continuing interest in reinterpreting article 9 of Japan&apos;s pacifist constitution, to allow the country to develop its military might unchecked, is seen as similarly inflammatory by the Chinese and Koreans, and further proof of his revisionist views. So, too, is his creation of a Restoration of Sovereignty Day, an annual event to mark the end of the American occupation. Abe would doubtless like to suggest that, like Japan, he has changed as time has passed. His first term, 2006-7, was marred by Liberal Democratic party scandals, including a ministerial suicide, leading to his forced resignation on health grounds. This time around, he has eschewed social policy controversies and moved cannily to broaden his base support while pursuing a radical economic plan and an ambitious foreign policy agenda.     Shinzo Abe bows to Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko during a national memorial service for the victims of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Photograph: Reuters    At home, his main focus is on economic recovery upon which, he argues, the success of Japan&apos;s other aspirations depend. Labelled &quot;Abenomics&quot;, his approach comprises the three arrows: monetary easing, fiscal stimulus, and structural reform. In the short term, at least, the policy has boosted economic activity and GDP growth and produced a big lift in the financial markets, enabling Abe to declare in Washington: &quot;Japan is back.&quot; The yen is down, inflation is up, and share prices have risen by roughly two-thirds. Growth of 4% in the first half of 2013 easily out-distanced other G7 economies. Predictably, economists in recession-hit Europe and the US have suggested they follow Japan&apos;s example. A little modesty might be in order, Nogami said. &quot;Abe will face a series of difficult issues in coming months, including the negative impact of the planned consumption tax increase and the failure of what we are calling the &apos;spring offensive&apos; to raise wages \u2026 &quot;Third, there are the nuclear power plants. &quot;Next July some of the plants are due to restart. There is a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in Japan [following the 2011 Fukushima disaster] but in view of the overall energy mix, those plants are needed. How he can manage this divisive issue definitely affects his tenure.&quot; For the time being, Abe looks secure. Twelve months in, with the economy improving and his LDP in firm control of both houses of parliament, he remains unusually popular in a country where prime ministers have come and gone with startling rapidity in recent years. &quot;An opinion poll taken on 3-4 November showed Shinzo&apos;s approval rating at 68.5% with very few negative views on his personality. The silent majority&apos;s support for Shinzo is still there and it&apos;s real,&quot; the Tokyo research analyst said. Abe&apos;s initial success in boosting Japan&apos;s economic fortunes after decades in the doldrums, and the enormous damage caused by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, has proven a necessary precondition for advancing his autonomous global agenda. It also underpins his ambition to strengthen political, military and economic alliances with south-east Asia, Australia and India while reinforcing treaty ties with Washington. In a speech to the UN general assembly in September, Abe vowed to make a revitalised Japan &quot;a force for peace and stability&quot; in the world, while putting China on notice that coercion would not work. China&apos;s threats over the Senkakus, its leadership&apos;s continued snubbing of Abe and Beijing&apos;s longstanding tendency to whip up anti-Japanese, nationalist sentiment to distract attention from domestic problems had served Abe well, in terms of propelling him into power and keeping him there, analysts and officials said. Abe has also skilfully exploited the China problem to woo less-powerful neighbours. Since taking office Abe has visited all 10 members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), an unprecedented piece of outreach by a Japanese leader. Last weekend he hosted an Asean summit in Tokyo marking 40 years of diplomatic ties. In a classic soft-power exercise that totally outflanked Beijing, Abe ordered the biggest overseas deployment of Japanese armed forces since 1945, backed by generous donations, to assist the Philippines after last month&apos;s super-typhoon disaster. He scored another, personal triumph when he flew to Buenos Aires in September and, Blair-like, helped to secure the 2020 Olympic Games for Tokyo. Abe&apos;s expansive agenda, part of his attempt to reassert Japan&apos;s leading role in the world, includes strong emphasis on supporting women&apos;s rights \u2013 an apparent attempt to fix his &quot;woman problem&quot;. About 40% of his UN speech was devoted to the subject. He wanted to produce a &quot;society in which women shine&quot; in Japan, he said. &quot;Japan respects the activities of UN Women and intends to become one of its leading contributors and thus an exemplary country,&quot; he said. Scarred by his first experience as prime minister, Abe seems determined to stick to a cautious line, avoid repeating past mistakes and stay the course to 2015. Economic recovery remains his top priority. But for a man of strong and passionate views, this restraint seems unnatural and may not be sustainable. International tensions may yet stir his blood and force his hand. Just how long he can \u2013 and wants to \u2013 keep a lid on the confrontation with Beijing, as China inexorably ups the ante, is east Asia&apos;s big unanswered question of 2014. Potted profile Born: 21 September 1954 (age 59), Nagato, Yamaguchi prefecture, Japan. He later moved to Tokyo. Education: Seikei elementary school and Seikei high school, Tokyo. He studied political science at Seikei University, graduating in 1977and later at the University of Southern California&apos;s school of public policy, Los Angeles. Career: Abe began work for Kobe Steel in 1979. In 1982, he left Kobe and held a succession of government positions, including executive assistant to the foreign minister, Shintaro Abe, his father. He moved from there to work for the ruling Liberal Democratic party, and subsequently for the LDP prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. In 1993, he was elected as an MP for the Yamaguchi prefecture. In 1999, he became director of the social affairs division and deputy chief cabinet secretary in the Yoshiro Mori and Junichiro Koizumi cabinets from 2000 to 2003. In 2002, as chief government negotiator on the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea, he accompanied Koizumi on a surprise visit to meet the late North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang. In 2003, Abe was appointed secretary general of the Liberal Democratic party. In 2006, Koizumi was forced to stand down (due to term limits) and was succeeded as prime minister and LDP leader by Abe. In 2007, after a series of scandals, the LDP lost its majority in the upper house, and Abe announced that he was resigning on grounds of ill health. In 2012, apparently fully recovered, he was re-elected LDP leader. Later that year, he was elected prime minister for a second time. What they say: &quot;Abe is one of a new kind of very conservative, patriotic politicians who are not always happy with postwar Japan&apos;s traditional, leftwing internationalists and their strong tendency towards irresponsible pacifism.&quot; \u2013 research director of a leading Tokyo thinktank."}, {"sentences": ["She was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland to British parents \u2013 Walter, a lawyer, and Lillian, an actor \u2013 in Tokyo, where her father was working."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Alfred Hitchcock", "US news", "World news", "Theatre", "Stage", "Rebecca", "Oscars 2015"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-16T14:49:20Z", "title": "Joan Fontaine obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/16/joan-fontaine", "article": "It was hard to cast the lead in Daphne du Maurier&apos;s Rebecca, filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1939. The female fans of the bestseller were very protective of the naive woman whom the widower Max de Winter marries and transports to his ancestral home of Manderley. None of the contenders \u2013 including Vivien Leigh, Anne Baxter and Loretta Young \u2013 felt right for the second Mrs de Winter, who was every lending-library reader&apos;s dream self. To play opposite Laurence Olivier in the film, the producer David O Selznick suggested instead a 21-year-old actor with whom he was smitten: Joan Fontaine. The prolonged casting process made Fontaine anxious. Vulnerability was central to the part, and you can see that vulnerability, that inability to trust her own judgment, in every frame of the film. The performance brought Fontaine, who has died aged 96, the first of three Oscar nominations. She was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland to British parents \u2013 Walter, a lawyer, and Lillian, an actor \u2013 in Tokyo, where her father was working. Her parents divorced when she was two and, along with her older sister, Olivia de Havilland, she grew up in California. Olivia&apos;s beauty won her lead roles on the arm of Errol Flynn, while Fontaine \u2013 who took her professional name from her mother&apos;s remarriage, to George Fontaine \u2013 lagged behind. No less fine-boned but more tentative, Fontaine seemed somehow more British than her sister. She tried out on the West Coast stage and took small movie parts, advancing gradually in 1939 to be the dewy thing sighed over by Douglas Fairbanks Jr in Gunga Din and the dopiest of The Women in George Cukor&apos;s film of Clare Boothe Luce&apos;s Broadway play. Meanwhile, De Havilland had been nominated for an Oscar for her performance in that year&apos;s Gone With the Wind. Selznick seems to have intuited that Fontaine&apos;s envy and distress about her more glamorous sibling would inform her playing of the chatelaine of Manderley.     Joan Fontaine in Letter from An Unknown Woman. Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features    The period from the late 1930s to the end of the second world war is usually seen as an era of ever stronger movie women: career gals, swell dames and tough cookies. But there was a genre of threatened-women films, too: not the physical threat of modern stalker/slasher films, but something subtler, where a woman is destroyed by her fears and insecurities about men and her social competence. In Rebecca and in Suspicion (1941), Fontaine&apos;s next film for Hitchcock, the heroines \u2013 although that&apos;s rather too active a noun for them \u2013 marry men more exciting and worldly than they believe they are entitled to. In Rebecca, Fontaine is tempted to take her own life because she is made to feel unworthy of her husband (although he proves to be a lying murderer); in Suspicion she comes near to a breakdown because she believes that her husband (Cary Grant) is trying to murder her. Fontaine had deserved an Oscar for Rebecca (she lost to Ginger Rogers for Kitty Foyle), but she won for Suspicion, beating De Havilland (nominated for Hold Back the Dawn). Rebecca had updated Charlotte Bront\u00eb, so it seemed fitting that Fontaine was cast as Jane Eyre, opposite Orson Welles as Mr Rochester, in a 1943 film directed by Robert Stevenson. She has the wary stubbornness all right, but not the soul afire under the alpaca frock. There was another Oscar nomination (for The Constant Nymph, 1943) and another Du Maurier adaptation, Frenchman&apos;s Creek (1944). Her onscreen tension appealed to audience sympathy when she was young, and it could also be used, with skill, to suggest sinful scheming, as in Ivy (1947), in which she played a poisoner. But the best film she made was Max Oph\u00fcls&apos;s Letter from An Unknown Woman (1948), in which her nervous romanticism was heightened into heroism. Her character had once adored a concert pianist neighbour and become one of his many conquests (and pregnant by him). She abandons her safe marriage and child for one more assignation with the weary creep \u2013 only to find he does not remember her. She is just another lovely face. If, at this point, Fontaine had moved to, say, France she might have had 10 or 20 good years and films, clad in couture to flatter the physical sophistication she had achieved by her 30s. Instead, she was indifferent in Hollywood films by directors who should have made better \u2013 The Emperor Waltz (Billy Wilder, 1948), Born to Be Bad (Nicholas Ray, 1950), Serenade (Anthony Mann, 1956), Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (Fritz Lang, 1956) and Until They Sail (Robert Wise, 1957). There was a rather pearls-and-twinset Lady Rowena in the glum Ivanhoe (1952) \u2013 did she take the part to prove she could do what her sister had done so well in swashbucklers? \u2013 and a then shocking suggestion of an interracial affair with Harry Belafonte in Island in the Sun (1957). In her last major film she was the support \u2013 significantly, the sister \u2013 in F Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s Tender Is the Night (1962). Fontaine appeared twice on Broadway as a replacement for current stars, in lieu of Deborah Kerr in Tea and Sympathy, in 1954, and succeeding Julie Harris in Forty Carats, in 1968, both parts closely linked to her introverted screen roles. She continued on stage, though never Broadway again, until she was in her 70s, and worked in television (most successfully a soap, Ryan&apos;s Hope, in 1980) and TV movies, her last appearance being in Good King Wenceslas, on the Family Channel, in 1994. In her autobiography, No Bed of Roses (1978), she was fearlessly honest about the fearfulness that had dominated all of Hollywood in her prime. Yet in her own life, Fontaine was a brave pilot of planes and balloons, and a deep-sea diver. She married and divorced four husbands: the actor Brian Aherne, the film producer William Dozier, the screenwriter Collier Young and the journalist Alfred Wright. She is survived by her daughter, Deborah, from her second marriage, a grandson, and her sister. \u2022 Joan Fontaine, actor, born 22 October 1917; died 15 December 2013"}, {"sentences": ["Battleblock Theatre (The Behemoth Xbox 360)            The first time we encountered the latest adventure from the makers of Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers, we were at the Tokyo Game Show a couple of years ago."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "PlayStation", "Xbox", "PC", "Indie games", "Nintendo", "Games consoles", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-17T10:23:00Z", "title": "Top 25 games of 2013: 25-16", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/dec/17/top-25-games-of-2013-25-16", "article": "It&apos;s that time of year again, when all sense deserts us and we try to distil 12 months of gaming into one list of 25 spectacular titles.

Nowhere else in this often somber universe are you able to leap from incoming missile to incoming missile before, in a streaking somersault, slicing and dicing an attacking helicopter into a thousand pieces with your blade. Certainly no other Metal Gear game concludes in a fistfight with the American president. Both sublime and ridiculous, which is Platinum Games embodied.  \u2022 Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance review 24. Pikmin 3 (Wii U, Nintendo)            There are better strategy video games, with more rounded edges, a more precise focus and, usually, a balanced competitive mode. But no other strategy game has quite the character and urgency of Shigeru Miyamoto&apos;s Pikmin 3, a study of life at ankle level, where you must guide obedient herds of bright alien ant-like creatures to help you flee a planet. It&apos;s a game that gives us both the juvenile thrill of seeing the childlike Pikmins&apos; usefulness to grown-ups, and the parental burden of protecting these dependents in the role of the three spacemen and women who guide them. Within its colourful foliage then, ancient instincts can be found in us and drawn back to the surface, much like the buried treasures the Pikmin salvage from the dirt. \u2022 Pikmin 3 review 23. Saint&apos;s Row IV (Dee Silver, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)            Once little more than a Grand Theft Auto wannabe, with this fourth release Saint&apos;s Row makes clear it&apos;s playing an altogether different game to Rockstar&apos;s billion-dollar series. The frat-boy humour is present and, at times, politically incorrect (although there&apos;s more subtlety here than you might expect) but, more often than not, the satire is aimed at video games themselves, rather than any particular surrounding culture. The designers have enormous fun subverting their rivals and influences, quickly granting the player outrageous abilities with which to traverse and disrupt the world, distorting all the usual logic systems of gaming. This is a game without pretensions, a bloated, boisterous and inappropriate joyride. \u2022 Saints Row IV review 22. Wolf Among Us (Telltale Games, PC, Xbox 360)             To those who saw Walking Dead as a Telltale&apos;s fluke masterpiece, this masterful rendition of the Fables comic book universe must have come as quite a shock. Steeped in folkloric mystery, brimming with hard-boiled violence and stuffed with the sorts of complex moral decisions that characterised the studio&apos;s previous series, it is bravado stuff and we have only seen the opening episode. There have been some truly excellent adventure titles this year \u2013 Kentucky Route Zero among them \u2013 but Telltale is now positioning itself as this generation&apos;s LucasArts or Sierra: its games are becoming essential signifiers of a genre. 21. Gunpoint (Suspicious Developments, PC)            A puzzle game dressed in a noir overcoat and staged in the sleeting rain, Gunpoint matches its powerful ambiance with thrilling, memorable play. Conway, a private investigator who can scale building with startling agility but who crumples to the floor when struck by a bullet, is the owner of the year&apos;s most useful video game tool: the crosslink. The device allows you to rewire buildings by drawing links between light switches, lifts, security cameras and doors in order to shut down security or produce other effects. It&apos;s an ingenious idea, built from elegant, easily understood logic but blossomed out to allow for endless strategies as you attempt to break into ever more secure buildings. It&apos;s an endlessly stylish game but, more importantly, one that allows its players to express their own ingenuity and flair. 20. Fire Emblem: Awakening (Nintendo, 3DS)            The latest in Intelligent Systems&apos; long-running series of strategy role-playing games is one of this great developer&apos;s finest moments. Combining deep tactical play with rounded characters and an engrossing story, Awakening grips you almost immediately and then retains your interest and emotional attachment for many, many hours. And although the basic recipe is familiar, the developer has dared to add new systems and features, providing genuine surprises for long-term fans. If you haven&apos;t touched a handheld strategy adventure since Advance Wars, this is the time to re-awaken your addiction. 19. State of Decay (Undead Labs, PC, Xbox 360)            The voice acting is laughable, the visuals glitchy and unrefined, but State of Decay manages to pack more tension and atmosphere into its open-world zombie adventure than many more expensive and polished undead offerings. The emphasis is very much on survival rather than combat, and the complex, often bewildering RPG mechanics force you to consider every raid, every character, every action in forensic detail. Amid the suspense, there is much comic relief as zombies are splattered across car bonnets and characters struggle with basic tasks, but the sheer panic that sets in as a horde suddenly appears is real. Terror and death are constant companions, reviving a peculiar sense of vulnerability that we haven&apos;t really felt since the first Resident Evil titles. 18. Tomb Raider (Square Enix, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)            Sure, Lara&apos;s transition from scared teen to action hero was poorly handled and the obsession with trinket collection became wearisome to many, but Crystal Dynamics&apos; reinvention of the Tomb Raider concept was a pleasing revelation. The story is robust and sympathetic, the combat mechanics greatly improved, and although the actual tomb sections are rather marginalised, there are still some excellent puzzles to get stuck into. Croft will perhaps never again be the icon she once was, but there is clearly life in the old archeologist yet. \u2022 Tomb Raider \u2013 review 17. Battlefield 4 (EA, PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One            The combination of Frostbite 3&apos;s graphical might and a powerful physics system have brought us some astonishing experiences in this latest iteration of the EA DICE FPS staple. Parachuting from a collapsing building straight into the midst of an enemy held Conquest point is the stuff of Commando comics, but away from the bombast, the large maps and re-worked load-out systems allow a strategic and measured approach that never bores. The campaign mode is still a waste of disc space and the teething troubles at launch were utterly frustrating (my PS4 version crashes regularly even now) \u2013 these factors have somewhat taken the shine of the series&apos; next-gen console debut. But Battlefield clearly has much left to offer. \u2022 Battlefield 4 \u2013 review 16. Battleblock Theatre (The Behemoth Xbox 360)            The first time we encountered the latest adventure from the makers of Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers, we were at the Tokyo Game Show a couple of years ago. The Bohemoth had a tiny stand just behind the enormous edifice Capcom had constructed for Dragon&apos;s Dogma \u2013 and yet the game&apos;s surreal charm shone through. This is a platform puzzler in which your friends have been kidnapped by evil cats who are forcing you to perform deadly acts of bravery in an old theatre. It sounds silly. It is silly. But for several hours of laughter and challenge, you are its prisoner. It is a lovely jailor. \u2022 Top 25 games of 2012: 5-1 (plus the ones that didn&apos;t quite make it)"}, {"sentences": ["After a report on Japan&apos;s economy from BBC chief business correspondent Linda Yueh was shown in Tuesday&apos;s Newsnight, Jeremy Paxman made it clear he was unimpressed by its final package, in which she interviewed someone in a Tokyo restaurant where a monkey is a waiter."], "tags": ["Jeremy Paxman", "Newsnight", "BBC", "TV news", "Television industry", "Media", "The news on TV", "Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-18T10:53:31Z", "title": "Jeremy Paxman can't resist monkey business on Newsnight | Media Monkey", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2013/dec/18/jeremy-paxman-newsnight-monkey-business", "article": "After a report on Japan&apos;s economy from BBC chief business correspondent Linda Yueh was shown in Tuesday&apos;s Newsnight, Jeremy Paxman made it clear he was unimpressed by its final package, in which she interviewed someone in a Tokyo restaurant where a monkey is a waiter. &quot;That monkey will be reporting for us next week,&quot; naughtily confided Paxo, who may also have been subtly voicing dissatisfaction with Yueh and her package, which was very American in style and full of distracting touristy images of sumo wrestlers, archery and sushi being made."}, {"sentences": ["Philippe Parreno: Anywhere, Anywhere Out of the World, Palais de Tokyo, Paris This enormous ensemble of video, robots, ghosts and apparitions is orchestrated by Igor Stravinsky&apos;s Petrushka, replayed on four Disklavier pianos, and includes the artist&apos;s collaborations with Douglas Gordon and Tino Sehgal."], "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Steve McQueen", "Culture", "Philippe Parreno", "Sarah Lucas", "Marcel Duchamp"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-18T16:14:00Z", "title": "Adrian Searle's top 10 art shows of 2013", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/dec/18/adrian-searle-top-10-art-shows-2013", "article": "Every year there are instant enthusiasms that fade, and things that grow bigger in the memory. It is the critic&apos;s lot to often have too little time to reflect before setting down an opinion, and too much time to regret later. The best shows open a door. Some make you rethink what you thought you knew about an artist, a moment or a movement. Others just lodge in the mind and make you look at the world differently. These are the shows that have meant the most to me in 2013. 1. Steve McQueen, Schaulager, Basel Beautifully installed on a scale no British institution could match, this mid-career survey was filled with ideas and very different ways of presenting images, narratives and filmed situations. McQueen&apos;s career has been a lesson in trusting your instincts and following where they lead. For him, commercial film is just one more opportunity, a different register. While hoping 12 Years a Slave garners the Oscars, this spectacular, intimate and visceral exhibition is my show of the year. 2. Philippe Parreno: Anywhere, Anywhere Out of the World, Palais de Tokyo, Paris This enormous ensemble of video, robots, ghosts and apparitions is orchestrated by Igor Stravinsky&apos;s Petrushka, replayed on four Disklavier pianos, and includes the artist&apos;s collaborations with Douglas Gordon and Tino Sehgal. Filled with surprises (the snowdrift! The secret show behind the bookcase!) and continuing to 6 January, Parreno&apos;s show has a strange and cumulative pathos. 3. Sarah Lucas: Situation, Whitechapel Gallery, London     Photograph: David Levene     Lucas goes from bad girl to terrific sculptor in this rumbustious, raunchy and inventive tour of old works and new. Her show went from the bawdy and abject to the delicate and the monumental. Vulnerability, sensitivity, humour \u2013 she&apos;s got the lot. 4. The Bride and the Bachelors, Barbican Centre, London     The Bride and the Bachelors: Duchamp with Cage, Cunningham, Rauschenberg and Johns    With Marcel Duchamp as presiding genius and Philippe Parreno \u2013 again \u2013 as orchestrator, this lively look at the friendships, love affairs and artistic alliances between Merce Cunningham, John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns was a delight. It also showed how, far from closing things down, Duchamp remains such a generative influence. 5. Rosemarie Trockel: A Cosmos, Serpentine Gallery, London Trockel went her own way in this strange exhibition that also included the work of other artists and craftspeople both past and present. Proceeding by way of interruptions and asides, via the woven works that made the German artist&apos;s name during the 1980s, this uncategorisable show was both cabinet of curiosities and an exercise in self-examination. 6. Juergen Teller: Woo!, ICA, London     Photograph: Juergen Teller    A riot of fashion shoots and landscape shots, public parade and private moments. Teller treated his back catalogue as material in this cascade of portraits and situations, a collision of people and worlds. The images keep on coming. 7. When Attitudes Become Form, Fondazione Prada, Venice     When Attitudes Become Form: Bern 1969/Venice 2013    This reconstruction of the seminal 1969 Bern Kunsthalle exhibition of arte povera and conceptualism, relocated inside a Venetian palace, played games with time and space. I was swept away by the art itself \u2013 from Mario Merz to Bruce Nauman \u2013 and by Thomas Demand and Rem Koolhaas&apos;s restaging of the original show. 8. Alexandra Pirici and Manuel Pelmu\u015f: An Immaterial Retrospective of the Venice Biennale, Romanian Pavilion, Venice Biennale A game of charades in which live participants performed 100 key works from the biennale&apos;s history, all day, every day. Paintings by Munch, Pollock and Picasso, a performance by Marina Abramovi\u0107, a sculpture by Henry Moore and photographs by Cindy Sherman were all in the mix. 9. Manchester International festival The flawed magnificence of Adam Curtis vs Massive Attack&apos;s paranoia-inducing concert-come-video-installation; the exhibition Do It, that gathers together artists&apos; instructions and a live vulture; Shakespeare&apos;s sonnets directed by Peter Sellars, works by Tino Sehgal and the smallest gig in the world by the XX were some of the highlights of the best crossover arts festival in Europe, or just about anywhere. 10. Heather Phillipson: Yes, Surprising is Existence in the Post-Vegetal Cosmorama, Baltic, Gateshead Among a number of artists working with installation, video and wordplay (Bedwyr Williams&apos;s The Starry Messenger in the Welsh Pavilion at Venice was a great example), Heather Phillipson&apos;s installations in which we were rebirthed, got confused between French kissing and cuisine, and given a guided tour of Gateshead and Newcastle, was a standout. Using wry humour, her work is much more than a slippery language game. Poet as well as artist, Phillipson got into my head and just won&apos;t leave."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;The decision to provisionally suspend this rider was made in response to a report from the Wada-accredited laboratory in Tokyo indicating an adverse analytical finding of clenbuterol in a urine sample collected from him in a test during the Japan Cup Cycle Road Race on 20 October 2013.&quot; Rogers&apos;s team, Saxo-Tinkoff, said the Australian feared the positive result was due to a contaminated food source."], "tags": ["Cycling", "UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale)", "Drugs in sport", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-18T16:58:17Z", "title": "Former Sky rider Michael Rogers suspended after failed dope test", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/dec/18/michael-rogers-suspended-failed-dope-test-cycling", "article": "Michael Rogers, the former Team Sky road captain who played a key role in Bradley Wiggins&apos;s 2012 Tour de France victory, has been provisionally suspended following a positive test for the banned anabolic agent clenbuterol dating back to his win in the Japan Cup in late October, the International Cycling Union (UCI) said on Wednesday . Rogers has been told his A sample is positive and he has the right to request examination of the B sample. &quot;The UCI advised Australian rider Michael Rogers that he is provisionally suspended,&quot; the governing body said in a statement. &quot;The decision to provisionally suspend this rider was made in response to a report from the Wada-accredited laboratory in Tokyo indicating an adverse analytical finding of clenbuterol in a urine sample collected from him in a test during the Japan Cup Cycle Road Race on 20 October 2013.&quot; Rogers&apos;s team, Saxo-Tinkoff, said the Australian feared the positive result was due to a contaminated food source. A statement from the team read: &quot;Michael Rogers immediately informed Saxo-Tinkoff&apos;s management about the notification from the UCI. The Australian explained to the team management that he never ingested the substance knowingly nor deliberately and fears that the adverse analytical finding origins from a contaminated food source.&quot; Clenbuterol, which helps build muscle and burn fat, is the substance for which Alberto Contador tested positive at the 2010 Tour de France, leading to a two-year backdated ban and his disqualification from victory in that year&apos;s Tour. Contador fought the ban to the bitter end, but the Court for Arbitration in Sport concluded that although he had probably ingested the drug unknowingly through a contaminated supplement, the law of strict liability should apply. Rogers joined Contador at Team Saxo-Tinkoff last season from Team Sky after being named in evidence in the Lance Armstrong case as working with the American&apos;s doctor Michele Ferrari in 2005 and 2006. The Australian had acknowledged in the past that he worked with Ferrari - something which he admitted was a mistake - but the reasons for his leaving Sky were never made explicit. The question was raised, however, whether his departure was related to the team&apos;s restatement of its commitment to a zero-tolerance recruitment policy and its re-examination of all riders and staff and their backgrounds. Others who left Sky at the same time included the American trainer Bobby Julich and the Dutch directeur sportif Steven de Jongh, both of whom confessed to using banned drugs in the past. The news comes a day after the UCI formally opened disciplinary proceedings against the Team Sky rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke over a possible anti-doping violation detected through his biological passport. Rogers, 33, has been a professional since 2001 with spells at leading teams including Mapei, Quickstep and T-Mobile. He is a former triple world time-trial champion and was upgraded to bronze in the time trial at the 2004 Olympics when Tyler Hamilton was disqualified, and to the gold medal in the 2003 world time-trial championships after the Scot David Millar was deprived of the title following his confession of EPO use.

The moment I began to\u00a0understand why was in Tokyo, in the strangeness of my first book tour. A strikingly glamorous, thin, beautiful, successful news presenter told me that she totally identified with feeling fat and not good enough. She seemed so perfect \u2013 and clearly only existed on little bits of fish.\u00a0It&apos;s possible that something may have got lost in translation. (After all, a\u00a0reviewer of the Italian translation of\u00a0Bridget Jones&apos;s Diary described it as &quot;a\u00a0transcendental study\u00a0of existential despair&quot;.) But I\u00a0suspected that what Bridget had unwittingly tapped into was the gap between how people feel they are expected to be on the outside and how\u00a0they actually feel inside. I didn&apos;t start writing Bridget with any grand scheme or social themes in mind. She wasn&apos;t supposed to be the secretary of state for women, or anything. I was struggling with my second unreadable novel about cultural divides in the Caribbean and trying to get freelance articles accepted by various newspapers. The Independent asked me to write a column as myself, which was great, as I was broke. But, being quite a\u00a0private person, I thought it would be hopelessly embarrassing and exposing. I agreed, instead, to make up a character and write the column anonymously. I told no one at first, and assumed it\u00a0would be nixed after six weeks for being too silly. The people sitting on the desk with me were writing about politics and Chechenyaaaaa. I was writing about how many more calories there were in an olive than a Malteser (it depends on the size and type of the olive). But interest grew. Letters began to arrive for the editor, one of them \u2013 rather formal \u2013 saying: &quot;Dear Sir,I would quite like to shag Bridget Jones. Could you let me have her phone number please?&quot;Many thanks,Yours faithfully \u2026 My publishers decided Bridget Jones\u00a0might be a better bet than the unreadable second novel, and then things slowly began to snowball and bestsellerdom, movies and book tours followed. Talk about being exposed! I\u00a0spent years and years denying that Bridget had anything to do with me, quipping self-defensively: &quot;I don&apos;t drink or smoke and I am a virgin.&quot; A lot of books in a similar vein followed Bridget, mainly with pink covers, to the point where I was dubbed by Barbara Walters the &quot;grandmother&quot; of chick-lit. I assume she meant to say &quot;godmother&quot;. But I don&apos;t think it was imitation: it\u00a0was zeitgeist. Back in the mid-1990s the way single\u00a0women in their 30s were presented socially \u2013 and certainly in books and films \u2013 hadn&apos;t caught up with reality. The air of Miss Havisham and the tragic barren spinster left on the shelf was still hanging around us. The film Fatal Attraction presented the single 36-year-old as a desperate bunny boiler. Friends of one&apos;s parents would whisper: &quot;Why aren&apos;t you married?&quot; in\u00a0tones of appalled dismay. We weren&apos;t Miss Havisham or bunny boilers. We were products of a new generation, with our own flats, cars, incomes and expectations. We weren&apos;t single because \u2013 as Bridget joked \u2013 &quot;underneath our clothes our entire bodies are covered in scales&quot;: we just didn&apos;t need to settle for someone who wasn&apos;t right, simply to keep life afloat. I think it&apos;s still very hard for women in their 30s to figure out the career/dating/babies issues \u2013 no one has fixed\u00a0the biological clock yet. And embarrassingly, after I&apos;d boasted about\u00a0it, it turned out it wasn&apos;t me who\u00a0had coined the term &quot;singleton&quot;, but PG\u00a0Wodehouse. But at least, since Bridget, thirtysomething singletons are no longer saddled with Miss Havisham as\u00a0a role model. It went beyond the singleton issue, though. The thing about writing anonymously is that it frees you up to be honest. Details that I thought were just unique to me \u2013 such as seeing if you weighed less without your watch on, or\u00a0having a very confused knowledge about what was going on in\u00a0Chechenyaaaaa (and how to spell it) in\u00a0spite of being a professional woman, or deciding you were going to end up dying alone and being eaten by a dog because somebody hadn&apos;t called \u2013 turned out to\u00a0be the sort of thing that millions of other women identified with. It was strange, yet reassuring. When I was doing the publicity, I still thought I was fat and saying the wrong thing, and somehow as if I was wearing wellingtons on the red carpet. But I\u00a0knew I wasn&apos;t the only person infected with the idea that I should look like someone out of a magazine. I\u00a0knew that what the fans of Bridget were really responding to, amid the inundation of\u00a0images of perfection, was that it&apos;s actually alright to be human, just to sort of muddle along, try to do things right, be nice to your friends, and laugh about what goes wrong on the way. There was a certain amount of indignation among anxious feminists. One of my favourite lines from the first book was &quot;There is nothing so unattractive to a man as strident feminism&quot; \u2013 and I could see how this sort of thing would annoy you, if you\u00a0weren&apos;t a fan of irony. But my feeling was, and is, if\u00a0women aren&apos;t allowed to laugh at themselves, they haven&apos;t got very far on the equality front, have they? I wrote the bulk of Mad About the Boy, the new Bridget book, in the same armchair in which I wrote the first one, and in much the same position, with the laptop on my knee. With the first book, I was unselfconscious because no one was particularly interested; with Mad About the Boy it was because I hadn&apos;t told anyone I was writing it. That was the only way I could write it, so I could be honest about what I felt was going on, without worrying what everyone would think. It happened quite organically. There were new things that were making me laugh in London and new\u00a0things I wanted to write about: unexploded email box bombs, tweeting, Botox, over-stuffed lives, online dating, how to lose your born-again virginity, juggling work and parenthood, the way the image of (ugh) the &quot;middle-aged&quot; woman is as outdated and mean as the tragic barren spinster was when Bridget was first struggling with it. I didn&apos;t intend it to be a Bridget book\u00a0at first, but I started to realise I\u00a0was writing in her voice. And just as a\u00a0thirtysomething Bridget felt a huge gap between how she was expected to be and how she was, an older Bridget was\u00a0finding that, with all the losses, sadnesses and wonderful surprises of\u00a0life, there&apos;s a big gap between how you expect life to be and how it actually turns out. People were wildly indignant at first that Bridget had grown older and things had changed. I was startled when watching the BBC news in my PJs, during\u00a0reporting on the Syrian crisis I\u00a0saw the headline &quot;Mark Darcy is Dead!&quot; But I\u00a0was also very touched. How many writers create characters that people still care about after so long and feel such ownership of? I couldn&apos;t have just churned out a watered-down version of the same thing. The world changes, people have tough stuff to deal with in life. There are dark notes and light notes, we all get through by supporting each other and laughing when we can. That&apos;s how Bridget operates \u2013 like one of your friends. The jokes in Bridget Jones must have their roots in honesty and truth. And the fact that the book is, after 10 weeks, No 1 in the hardback fiction bestseller lists shows that when people actually read it, they understand and care about her still. I never expected an anonymous column to turn out as it did, and it was a wonderful thing to happen to a freelance journalist. It&apos;s more wonderful still if Bridget has done something to counteract the culture of\u00a0perfection and make people feel it&apos;s\u00a0alright just to be alright. I wonder where the perfect Japanese news presenter is. I bet her life didn&apos;t turn out like she expected, any more than Bridget&apos;s \u2013 and I hope that, like Bridget, she will be managing to keep buggering on, play with the cards she is dealt, and\u00a0laughing with her friends, who will\u00a0tell her that she&apos;s absolutely fine \u2013 just as she is."}, {"sentences": ["The revamped Palais de Tokyo near the Trocad\u00e9ro, looks like a Tom Ford version of Bladerunner.", "I would recommend both the vegetable couscous in the Tokyo Eat cafe, and the exhibition of Philippe Parreno installations (until 12 January): Parreno is one of the most thought-provoking figures in modern art."], "tags": ["Paris holidays", "Travel", "Gavin Turk"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-20T21:00:00Z", "title": "Artist Gavin Turk on Paris", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/dec/20/gavin-turk-paris-marais", "article": "The historic Marais area of Paris is very close to my heart. The views across the rooftops are like something out of The Aristocats. I lived in an aparment there for three months during the late 1980s, while I was studying for my MA: the Royal College of Art has a studio there, and I always go back \u2013 I love going to all those archives and conservatoires and collections of great cultural stuff. When I first lived there, in the 80s, Paris was trying to understand what it might be again. Lots of grand Mitterand projets were happening \u2013 such as Jean Nouvel&apos;s Institut du Monde Arabe \u2013 and the Pompidou Centre was really being used a lot. I love the Pierre Huyghe exhibition at the Pompidou. It&apos;s very experiential. There are three machines that throw water, steam and ice on you, and a white dog with one purple leg walks around the exhibition. There used to be a hip scene out in the 13th [arrondissement, south-east of the centre]. They tried to develop the area by getting all the young, happening galleries in. But it got expensive and felt far away and now the galleries have mostly moved back to the Marais, around Rue Louise Weiss. Make sure you visit the GB Agency which has some really interesting young artists, such as [video artist] Omer Fast and Pratchaya Phinthong from Bangkok; it&apos;s full of energy. Try to come for the annual Nuit Blanche in October, when all the galleries stay open late \u2013 until at least 9pm. Walk into any gallery in the Marais and ask for a gallery map \u2013 you can then run from one to another and grab a glass of wine in each. It&apos;s fantastic fun. The revamped Palais de Tokyo near the Trocad\u00e9ro, looks like a Tom Ford version of Bladerunner. I would recommend both the vegetable couscous in the Tokyo Eat cafe, and the exhibition of Philippe Parreno installations (until 12 January): Parreno is one of the most thought-provoking figures in modern art. Paris nightlife isn&apos;t that good. Well, it enjoyed a flamboyant and exotic heyday, but it seems more private these days. It&apos;s a difficult place to luck into. I used to drink at a bar called the Madame Deux, on rue de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. It wasn&apos;t arty but was where all the firemen went; the crowd was effervescent and didn&apos;t mind a &quot;rosbif&quot; drinking with them. I wouldn&apos;t want the place filling up with Guardian readers, but the food at Chez Marie Louise in the 10th arrondissement is delicious. It&apos;s a tiny restaurant with just two waiters who know so much about the food and wine, you feel they&apos;re the ones who put the menu together. If you&apos;re a vegetarian, people look at you as if you&apos;re ill. They&apos;re shocked that a ham omelette isn&apos;t considered a vegetarian meal. There&apos;s only so much height in Paris. You can see the Eiffel Tower from everywhere. When I come back to London, I take a deep breath because we&apos;re getting all these skyscrapers. I know it&apos;s a cliche but Paris is actually very romantic, in a relationshippy way. Maybe people there are just more keen on expressing themselves outwardly. For a day trip outside Paris, head to Senlis, a medieval town that&apos;s home to the Fondation Franc\u00e9s. It&apos;s a perfectly formed private art museum where I&apos;m showing and part-curating a show called Vestige\u00a0next February. It deals with waste, both human and material, and features pieces by Florian S\u00fcssmayr, Jake and Dinos Chapman and Subodh Gupta. \u00a0 If I spent Christmas in Paris, I would like to spend my time visiting graves in the P\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery. I&apos;d look out for Modigliani&apos;s grave.

If there was any lingering doubt of the country\u2019s clout as a global retail and fashion destination, that will be dismissed when the latest influx of major international fast fashion players \u2013 Sweden\u2019s H&amp;M and Japan\u2019s Uniqlo \u2013 hit our shores early next year. While unconfirmed, the whispers continue to get louder that Forever 21 from the US and iconic British department store Marks &amp; Spencer are also Australia-bound. M&amp;S Leasing Executives are reportedly eyeing a site in a planned $72m redevelopment on George Street in Sydney&apos;s CBD that will see a soaring office and retail precinct, tram and pedestrian walkway. This all comes hot on the heels of the hyped and highly successful 2011 and 2012 launches of Zara and Topshop (from Spain and the UK respectively), which signaled the beginning of the high street revolution. H&amp;M, the world\u2019s second biggest retailer (behind Zara) with annual sales of $18.13bn (US) will open its doors in Melbourne\u2019s GPO building in the first half of 2014. The brand is famed for its collaborations with hot right-now-designers \u2013 the latest Isabel Marant for H&amp;M line which launched in November saw customers camping out the previous evening with coveted items sold out in minutes. A three-level 3000 square metre site on Sydney&apos;s George Street is set to follow Melbourne, and a Brisbane site is also being considered. The Sydney branch will complete what experts have dubbed the Golden Triangle \u2013 a reference both to its prime CBD location and proximity to Zara and Top Shop. Also intent on shaking up the local fashion landscape is Japanese retailer Uniqlo, purveyor of colourful denim and cashmere sweaters at cheap and cheerful prices. A branch is opening in Melbourne in early 2014 with a Sydney store to follow. What Uniqlo lacks in design direction it makes up for in covetable simplicity, which experts predict will be a welcome addition to Aussie wardrobes. Ditto California\u2019s Forever 21, the fast fashion juggernaut aimed at the youth market, which generates annual revenue of $3.7bn (US). The company is believed to be scouting for a site on Pitt Street Mall, which underwent a $1.2bn overhaul in 2010 to become Westfield Sydney, enticing the big guns of Zara and Gap in the process. The availability of expansive multilevel flagship stores in Westfield meant the international brands could finally open stores in Australia. Indeed such has been the success of our first designer mega-mall that the likes of Chanel, Gucci, Prada and Miu Miu have all happily taken up residence behind the churn-and-burn high street brands. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more and more retailers coming to Australia and why wouldn\u2019t they? We\u2019ve got a very stable market and economy and nothing like the 25% unemployment rate of somewhere like Spain,&quot; says Russell Zimmermann, executive director of Australian Retailers Association. \u201cAustralian consumers today travel regularly overseas to the UK, US, Europe and Asia and they only have to walk down the streets of somewhere like New York or Singapore to see all the big brands. They understand it, they love it and they want it.&quot;     Customers at the Isabel Marant sale at H&amp;M in Regent St, London. Photograph: David Levene    The Aussie consumer, the undisputed winner in all this, is driving international demand. Where once Australians had to travel overseas to buy the latest catwalk-inspired pieces, today that can be fulfilled by the likes of Zara, Topshop and Muji (which opened its first Australian store in Chadstone Melbourne last month). Even chains that have not yet opened bricks and mortar stores have still descended online \u2013 fashion retailers Net-A-Porter, Asos, JCrew and Next have all launched Australian sites in response to demand. What impact will heavyweight international brands will have on the local market? Zimmermann believes the competition has forced Australia&apos;s long-established homegrown brands to reinvigorate. \u201cBefore Zara many retailers were complacent in Australia, plodding along with just four seasons. But Zara offering new stock and freshness every two to four weeks has taught us a lot, \u201d says Zimmermann. He cites Forever New, Country Road and Cotton On as \u201cfantastic examples of Aussie brands\u201d who have helped raise the high street bar. Founded in 1974, a decade ago Country Road was in the doldrums but has emerged in recent years as a fully-fledged fashion and lifestyle brand, praised for consistently good, on-trend pieces. In August, Seed (the nearest Australia has to J Crew) rebranded as Seed Heritage in a bid to expand into Asia. Portmans and Kookai, meanwhile, have anointed Australian supermodels Jess Hart and Catherine McNeil as their glamorous faces to maintain kudos in an increasingly competitive market. But what will the arrival of M&amp;S mean for David Jones and Myer \u2013 already embroiled in their own store wars? Zimmermann believes there is room in the market for another department store. \u201cIt would be a challenge but our department stores have to reinvent themselves and both are working hard to get their model right and provided they do they will both be great retailers.\u201d As for whether the future is refined to a mega mall, Zimmermann says shoppers still crave a shopping strip. \u201cPitt Street is one of the best examples of a retail precinct getting it right. George Street will experience turmoil from 2015 to 2017 when they build the tram line, but what better way to get people moving through the CBD? It\u2019s going to be wonderful for the city and I don\u2019t buy the criticism about narrow streets. I\u2019ve stood on the sidewalk in Istanbul and literally touched the tram on one side and the store window on the other and that didn\u2019t stop anyone shopping.\u201d And Australians do continue to shop, to the tune of $42.2bn in pre-Christmas sales according to ARA, on booming high streets that experts predict will soon rival the likes of Fifth Avenue. \u201cOver the next five years I believe Australia will stand very proudly against the major cities of New York, Tokyo and Europe with a retail environment that is as good, if not better,\u201d says Zimmermann."}, {"sentences": ["Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has made a visit to a controversial war shrine in Tokyo, prompting a furious response from China and concern in the US.", "In a statement carried on the website of the US embassy in Tokyo, the state department said: \u201cJapan is a valued ally and friend.", "We take note of [Abe\u2019s] expression of remorse for the past and his reaffirmation of Japan\u2019s commitment to peace.\u201d Japan\u2019s foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, later explained Abe\u2019s reasoning for the visit in a telephone conversation with Washington\u2019s new ambassador to Tokyo, Caroline Kennedy.", "\u201c[Abe] probably thinks that it\u2019s OK, that he\u2019s relatively popular and it\u2019s a matter of conviction,\u201d said Koichi Nakano, a professor of politics at Sophia University in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-26T06:22:46Z", "title": "Japan's Shinzo Abe angers neighbours and US by visiting war dead shrine", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/26/japan-shinzo-abe-tension-neighbours-shrine", "article": "Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has made a visit to a controversial war shrine in Tokyo, prompting a furious response from China and concern in the US. Abe, who became prime minister for a second time exactly a year ago, is the first Japanese leader to have visited the Yasu\u00adkuni shrine since Junichiro Koizumi just over seven years ago. A conservative who has spoken of the need for Japan to end its \u201cmasochistic\u201d feelings of guilt over its wartime conduct in Asia, Abe had voiced regret that he did not make the pilgrimage during his first, year-long term as prime minister from September 2006. Thursday\u2019s visit sparked predictable outrage from China and South Korea, which view Yasukuni as a potent symbol of Japanese militarism, and visits by politicians as evidence that Japan has yet to atone for atrocities committed in parts of China and on the Korean peninsula in the first half of the 20th century. \u201cThe Chinese government expresses strong indignation at the Japanese leader\u2019s trampling on the feelings of the people of China and the other war victim nations, and the open challenge to historical justice \u2026 and expresses strong protest and serious condemnation to Japan,\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. Qin Gang, a foreign ministry spokesman, added: \u201cWe strongly protest and seriously condemn the Japanese leader\u2019s acts. The essence of Japanese leaders\u2019 visits to Yasukuni shrine is to beautify Japan\u2019s history of militaristic aggression and colonial rule.\u201d China later stepped up its response by summoning Japan\u2019s ambassador in Beijing, Masato Kitera, to lodge a \u201cstrong protest\u201d. South Korea\u2019s culture minister, Yoo Jin-ryong, said Abe\u2019s visit was \u201can anachronistic act\u201d that \u201churts not only the ties between South Korea and Japan, but also fundamentally damages the stability and co-operation in north-east Asia.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t help deploring and expressing anger at the prime minister\u2019s visit to the Yasukuni shrine \u2026 despite concerns and warnings by neighbouring countries,\u201d Yoo said. Yasukuni honours about 2.5 million Japanese who have died in wars since the late 19th century, including several wartime leaders convicted as class-A war criminals by the allied tribunal. Abe insisted he had \u201cno intention\u201d of hurting the feelings of the Chinese or South Korean people. \u201cThere is criticism based on the misconception that this is an act to worship war criminals, but I visited Yasukuni shrine to report to the souls of the war dead on the progress made this year and to convey my resolve that people never again suffer the horrors of war,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI prayed to pay respect for the war dead who sacrificed their precious lives and hoped that they rest in peace. Unfortunately, a Yasukuni visit has largely turned into a political and diplomatic issue. I have no intention to neglect the feelings of the people in China and South Korea.\u201d He attempted to strike a conciliatory note, saying his pilgrimage had been made in light of his \u201csevere remorse\u201d over the past, although he did not make specific mention of Japan\u2019s brutal occupation of parts of China and the Korean peninsula. \u201cJapan must never wage war again,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my conviction based on severe remorse for the past.\u201d Abe would have expected strong words from Beijing and Seoul, but not the US\u2019s rare public expression of concern. In a statement carried on the website of the US embassy in Tokyo, the state department said: \u201cJapan is a valued ally and friend. Nevertheless, the United States is disappointed that Japan\u2019s leadership has taken an action that will exacerbate tensions with Japan\u2019s neighbours. \u201cThe United States hopes that both Japan and its neighbours will find constructive ways to deal with sensitive issues from the past, to improve their relations, and to promote co-operation in advancing our shared goals of regional peace and stability. We take note of [Abe\u2019s] expression of remorse for the past and his reaffirmation of Japan\u2019s commitment to peace.\u201d Japan\u2019s foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, later explained Abe\u2019s reasoning for the visit in a telephone conversation with Washington\u2019s new ambassador to Tokyo, Caroline Kennedy. The visit is expected to inflict more damage on Japan\u2019s ties with its neighbours. Japan is embroiled in a long-running standoff with China over a group of islands in a strategically important area of the East China Sea, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, and with South Korea over sovereignty of the Takeshima islands, known as Dokdo by South Koreans. Some analysts believe Abe\u2019s visit will add to concern overseas that he is a nationalist with revisionist views of history. \u201c[Abe] probably thinks that it\u2019s OK, that he\u2019s relatively popular and it\u2019s a matter of conviction,\u201d said Koichi Nakano, a professor of politics at Sophia University in Tokyo. \u201cBut everyone knew with Koizumi \u2026 he wasn\u2019t a revisionist nationalist. But with Abe, that is precisely the question some people were asking. Now we know the answer.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei Dow has just topped the 16,000 level for the first time in six years following a 50% increase since the start of the year."], "tags": ["Shinzo Abe", "Japan", "Deflation", "Nikkei", "Inflation", "Global recession", "Quantitative easing"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-27T11:34:51Z", "title": "Japan's deflation era is not yet a thing of the past | Larry Elliott", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/dec/27/japan-deflation-nikkei-shinzo-abe", "article": "Is deflation in Japan a thing of the past? The financial markets certainly think so. Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei Dow has just topped the 16,000 level for the first time in six years following a 50% increase since the start of the year. That&apos;s an impressive performance, even though the Nikkei has still lost more than half its value since its peak at the end of the 1990s. But two lost decades and innumerable policy errors later, there is now hope that the anti-deflationary package dubbed &quot;Abenomics&quot; has finally done the trick. It is a bit early to claim final victory. The main reason the headline consumer price index was 1.2% higher in November than a year earlier was that the yen has fallen by 40% since late 2011, raising the cost of imports. While a weaker currency was a central aim of Abenomics, it is noteworthy that core inflation \u2013 which strips out movements in food and energy prices and is much less sensitive to the level of the yen \u2013 rose by 0.6% in the year to November. That suggests the economy could easily slide back into deflation. There are two significant risks looming in 2014. The bigger of the two is the planned increase in consumption tax in April, which is deemed necessary to tackle a budget deficit in excess of 200% of national output. In the short run, consumer spending will be strong as households race to get their purchases in before the tax hike, but there is the chance the economy could &quot;hit the wall&quot; in the spring. The second threat comes from the global economy. In the past, any slowdown in the rest of the world has tended to result in investment flowing into the yen, pushing up the value of the Japanese currency, thus reducing import prices and adding to deflationary pressure. At present, this looks unlikely but events since the financial crisis began in the summer or 2007 have taught policy makers to expect the unexpected. What all this means is that Shinzo Abe&apos;s government will be taking no chances in the months ahead. There will be additional quantitative easing in an attempt to keep the yen low and extra spending on public works to ensure that growth does not slacken and that inflation continues to rise towards its 2% target."}, {"sentences": ["Britain is up there, we say, fighting for culinary supremacy with New York and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-28T09:01:00Z", "title": "What we liked in 2013: food chains", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/dec/28/what-we-liked-2013-food-chains", "article": "If you spend any time with metrocentric food pundits \u2013 or southern foodie ponces as we&apos;re also known \u2013 you might be forgiven for thinking the restaurant scene has come a long way.

Each time I go there I marvel at the eccentricities: the taxi and bus drivers with their gloves, the ritual of the onsen bath house and the incessant bowing. Nowhere else induces in me such feelings of amused amazement. David Pilling is an Anglo expert on Japan. Some might say that&apos;s an oxymoron, but he is at least one of those foreign correspondents who doesn&apos;t have to try very hard to show his knowledge. He spent most of the first decade of the 21st century based in Tokyo and went back to cover the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake. The result is an authoritative and entertaining attempt to explain the mysteries of the shimaguni, the island nation, and its centuries-old determination to withstand outside influences. The story begins and ends with the disaster that struck the coastal city of Sendai and destroyed the Fukushima nuclear station, with consequences for hundreds of miles around. The author points to systemic failures in the nuclear industry, a combination of the use of casual labour and a management culture that encouraged unquestioning loyalty over robust risk-assessment. Some still struggle to take in the idea that Japan could be anything but efficient. But Pilling helps to explain the extent to which a business model that served the country so well during the great recovery after the second world war has also been at the heart of its more recent economic stagnation. The postwar Japanese company was modelled as a social organisation and most continue to be this to this day. Teams of graduates are recruited each year on the assumption that they will stay with the same firm until retirement. It is, the author suggests, a form of indoctrination, turning them into obedient employees. &quot;It was a career escalator determined not by merit but by length of service, a system that encouraged loyalty and co-operation, not a battle among employees to prove who was most worthy of advancement.&quot; For women, the prospect of promotion or even meaningful employment remains slim. Women still single at 25 have long been referred to disparagingly as &quot;Christmas cake&quot;, an item that plummets in value after 25 December. Home and hearth are assumed, the wife to wait quietly each weekday night until the &quot;salary man&quot; gets home after a heavy evening&apos;s drinking. The after-party drink, niji kai, often involves the boss and his team going to a massage parlour, discussing corporate strategy while being entertained carnally by hostesses. This might give a new meaning to the term bonding exercise. Suffice to say, it is not easy, Pilling notes, for female employees to be on the inside track. The author deftly manages the trick of illustrating grand sweep with small anecdote. Thus during the earthquake, the first response in one supermarket of neatly uniformed staff was to use their hands, arms and bodies to prevent bottles of soy sauce and packets of miso soup from toppling to the floor. For months after the quake, the electricity grid in Tokyo was kept low, to prevent blackouts. Office workers might have been sweltering in the summer without air conditioning, but the lavatory seats were still heated. &quot;Where else in the world?&quot; you might well ask. The answer lies in history. For centuries, Japan cut itself off; it was sakoku, a closed country. Another useful word is nihonjinron, the concept of a racially homogenous society. Only two million out of a population of 127m are descended from a different ethnicity, most of them Koreans. This statistic is important when considering Japan&apos;s terrible war record. Pilling points out that Japan received a slight similar to Germany at Versailles. During the Paris peace conference of 1919, Japan pressed for the principle of racial equality to be made part of the founding covenant of the League of Nations. The western powers refused; they had their colonies and had established their control over the world&apos;s natural resources. Their aim was to shut out latecomers. As for Japan&apos;s refusal to face up to its war record, the author says the Americans are partly to blame. In order to re-establish order, US occupying forces restored the power of the emperor. They also imposed strict censorship, to keep discussion of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to a minimum. This in turn made it harder to discuss the terrible actions of Japanese forces in China, Singapore and elsewhere. From the early 1950s until the late 1980s, Japan was the economy to fear. It is easy to forget, however, how dire it looked in 1945. Starving Tokyo residents would clamber on trains to the countryside to forage for food, eating the leaves off potato plants. Girls lined up to sleep with American GIs in return for nylon stockings or canned food. Then it all took off, corporate giants unleashing Honda cars and Sony stereos on a western world that responded in awe and fear. The Japanese scoffed at the &quot;British disease&quot;, feckless and workshy nation, and the &quot;American disease&quot;, a society riddled with violent crime, drugs and divorce. In the mid-80s, hubris reached a peak. Some of the stories might have been apocryphal, but in this land of the high yen, restaurant diners would sprinkle gold leaf on their food like salt and pepper. Then came the slowdown, years of no growth or slow growth. Korea overtook Japan with its cool tech products; China usurped it with its global power and influence. So what is left? The notion of Japan in crisis is a strange one. Little of the old confidence remains; a succession of weak and unimaginative governments has made little impact. There is much head scratching about a corporate culture that is long past its sell-by date. Yet this is not a country afflicted by overt poverty or social dislocation. Crime remains extremely low, as do prison rates. Pilling is optimistic about Japan&apos;s future. He puts faith in a younger generation trying to break the shackles and a relatively new and dynamic government under Shinzo Abe. Hopes are high that Abenomics will propel Japan back into sunnier uplands. No matter how speedy or sluggish the growth, the most remarkable aspect of Japan is its refusal to embrace globalisation beyond a veneer of McDonalds and Krispy Kremes (where the queue stretches round the block). Like many uninitiated travellers to the country, I remain enthralled and disconcerted in equal measure. This book makes a good fist of disentangling the curious charms of the Japanese and for helping outsiders to understand them a little better. John Kampfner&apos;s latest book, The Rich: A History, will be published in autumn 2014.

Still hanging on then?&quot; Rachel Cooke interviews Margaret Hodge     Margaret Hodge Photograph: Shamil Tanna for the Observer    &quot;I really don&apos;t think about my performance,&quot; she tells me in her grand office \u2013 two sofas, Pugin wallpaper, river views \u2013 at the Palace of Westminster. &quot;It works best if I&apos;m authentic.&quot; But then she adds: &quot;We do think about the theatre, of course. We always work out what our first question will be, and what the key questions are after that.&quot; Her colleagues have been known to urge her to play things straight, but sometimes instinct gets the better of her all the same. When Matt Brittin, Google&apos;s boss in northern Europe, was recalled by the [public accounts] committee after being accused of misleading it over the company&apos;s tax affairs, one of Hodge&apos;s fellow members told her not to do anything over the top. &quot;So I was completely calm right the way through. Only then, at the end, I was too tempted. I couldn&apos;t resist.&quot; It was at this point \u2013 by way of making reference to Google&apos;s &quot;do no evil&quot; company motto \u2013 that she famously told Brittin that his company did &quot;do evil&quot;. She coughs. &quot;I don&apos;t know what the other members felt about that. They&apos;re too kind. But that became the headline. A bit unfortunate.&quot; The voice is a touch sheepish, but the expression on her face is, it has to be said, gleeful. Hodge, it is clear, loves her job. She tells me with some pride that she is up every morning at six, and doesn&apos;t go to bed until midnight (and boy, she looks good on it, all shiny-eyed and perky, like a squirrel). And she is grateful for the distraction the huge workload provides too: her husband, Henry, a high court judge, died of leukaemia in 2009, and she misses him dreadfully. &quot;I&apos;m on my own,&quot; she says, in a flat voice. &quot;If my husband were alive it would be a different kettle of fish.&quot; Jay Rayner on why he hates picnics It&apos;s impossible to look elegant while sitting on a sloping hillside or beach, especially at my age. Bits of me are always trying to make a bid for freedom. Sod muffin tops; I&apos;m packing half the cake counter at Greggs. The kids are either punching each other or poking a dead, maggot-infested bird with a stick, and granny&apos;s going into advance stages of anaphylactic shock having been stung by the wasp that got bored of divebombing the last mulched-up strawberries that didn&apos;t fall out of the picnic bag when it opened accidentally.  Gethin Chamberlain on India&apos;s child slave workers When the trafficker came knocking on the door of Elaina Kujar&apos;s hut on a tea plantation at the north-eastern end of Assam, she had just got back from school. Elaina was 14 and wanted to be a nurse. Instead, she was about to lose four years of her life as a child slave. She sits on a low chair inside the hut, playing with her long dark hair as she recalls how her owner would sit next to her watching porn in the living room of his Delhi house, while she waited to sleep on the floor. &quot;Then he raped me,&quot; she says, looking down at her hands, then out of the door. Outside, the monsoon rain is falling on the tin roof and against the mud-rendered bamboo strip walls, on which her parents have pinned a church calendar bearing the slogan &quot;The Lord is Good to All&quot;. Elaina was in that Delhi house for one reason: her parents, who picked Assam tea on an estate in Lakhimpur district, were paid so little they could not afford to keep her. There are thousands like her, taken to Delhi from the tea plantations in the north-east Indian state by a trafficker, sold to an agent for as little as \u00a345, sold on again to an employer for up to \u00a3650, then kept as slaves, raped, abused. It is a 21st-century slave trade. There are thought to be 100,000 girls as young as 12 under lock and key in Delhi alone: others are sold on to the Middle East and some are even thought to have reached the UK. Every tea plantation pays the same wages. Every leaf of every box of Assam tea sold by Tetley and Lipton and Twinings and the supermarket own brands \u2013 Asda, Waitrose, Tesco, Sainsbury&apos;s and the rest \u2013 is picked by workers who earn a basic 12p an hour.  Victoria Coren on Justin Bieber Justin Bieber&apos;s problem is that he is a children&apos;s entertainer. That&apos;s a different job from &quot;rock star&quot;. Justin Bieber is, at all times, wearing an implied fez covered in spangles. He might as well be called Mr Magic. When he goes on stage two hours late (as he did to much parental rage in London last week), it&apos;s like being two hours late to shout: &quot;Who&apos;s the birthday girl?&quot; and pretend that a felt monkey is too shy to emerge from a suitcase. It&apos;s no good being two hours late for a children&apos;s party. The window has closed. The kids have all drunk too much orange squash, run around screaming, had a wee on the floor, pushed a sausage into someone&apos;s eye, burst into tears and fallen asleep.  Miranda Sawyer interviews Lady Gaga     Lady Gaga in London. Photograph: Rex Features    We spoke for 40 minutes and, around halfway, she stopped completely, holding a pose for 30 seconds, saying absolutely nothing at all. The room, still full of people, froze with her. In the end, it was an encounter, not an interview. She controlled it all, and her mood \u2013 tired, overly intellectual; full of art, rather than pop \u2013 was what dominated. Despite this, I liked her. She was clever and thoughtful. She just wasn&apos;t at all like any of the interviews that I&apos;d researched: she didn&apos;t gush, she was serious and still. &quot;I might sound total shit,&quot; she said.   Andrew Rawnsley on social mobility Children from disadvantaged backgrounds don&apos;t fall behind at school. They start behind. If birth is too often destiny, the best place to start tackling inequalities is the very earliest years of children&apos;s lives. It is no guarantee of closing the gap, but it can narrow it. There&apos;s an innovative American programme called Learning Dreams. Its insight is that the most effective way to encourage children to thrive in schools is to focus first on the parents. When parents are motivated to love learning as the route to attaining life goals, they are much more likely to pass that on to their children and inspire them to engage with education. Behind it all is a giant question about the economy. We&apos;ve seen a dramatic polarisation between highly rewarding work for those with the right skills and connections and badly paid work and little chance of social advancement for those without. Whether we can re-energise social mobility depends hugely on how Britain is going to earn its living in the future and what sort of jobs we are going to create. Living standards are not just about the size of energy bills. That is a trivial, passing spat between politicians compared with the question that really matters. Britain and the US come bottom of the league table for social fluidity among developed nations. They are also the countries with the starkest inequalities. The best engine of social mobility is a high-value economy that creates many quality jobs across diverse sectors, spreading prosperity and opportunity more evenly. The alternative is the nightmarish future projected by the Milburn report: one in which even in economic recovery only the top slice of society prospers, the middle and bottom stagnate or fall even more behind and the rungs of the social ladder grow even further apart.  David Simon on modern-day capitalism America is a country that is now utterly divided when it comes to its society, its economy, its politics. There are definitely two Americas. I live in one, on one block in Baltimore that is part of the viable America, the America that is connected to its own economy, where there is a plausible future for the people born into it. About 20 blocks away is another America entirely. It&apos;s astonishing how little we have to do with each other and yet we are living in such proximity. There&apos;s no barbed wire around West Baltimore or around East Baltimore, around Pimlico, the areas in my city that have been utterly divorced from the American experience that I know. But there might as well be. We&apos;ve somehow managed to march on to two separate futures and I think you&apos;re seeing this more and more in the west. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s unique to America.   Lord Howe on Europe and the Tories Last week has shown that the Conservative party&apos;s long, nervous breakdown over Europe continues, and what is essentially a Tory problem is now, once again, becoming a national problem. Serious mistakes have been made, but the situation is not irretrievable. In the complex and interdependent world we inhabit today, to walk away from the European Union into the unknown would be a very dangerous choice indeed.   Suzanne Moore on how to be a good mother If you want a life, make your children portable. Teach them to sit at tables in restaurants, sleep in airports, talk to strangers, pass out in buggies in pub gardens. Do not let them express their feelings at all times. This is manners. Please, thank you and knocking on a door before they go in will open doors for them for the rest of their lives. Put a lock on your bedroom door if you want sex. Ever again. Introduce them to new partners only if something going on is more than sex. Understand that however many times they have seen you naked and &quot;putting blue worms up her bottom&quot; \u2013 this news was given to the playgroup by my youngest; she meant tampons, before you call social services \u2013 understand you are essentially disgusting. Too late now, but I wish I had kept a little more mystery, so I now let them keep theirs. Education. You think your child is gifted? Amazing how all middle-class children are. If you think education is exams and networking with people exactly like you, please don&apos;t drone on to me about it. Education is about connecting ideas and people, in my book. As Tagore said: &quot;Don&apos;t limit a child to your own learning, for he was born in another time.&quot;  Mark Townsend on life in the Central African Republic     Families fleeing conflict arrive at a displaced persons camp in the Central African Republic. Photograph: Matthieu Alexandre/AFP/Getty Images    It was dusk when armed Seleka rebels dragged the teenager from the road leading north towards Kobe. They pulled her into the jungle and raped her for several hours. She was abandoned near Route Nationale 10 and, after stumbling into the town of Kaga-Bandoro, was taken to hospital. &quot;There were five of them raping her until they tore her vagina. Her family paid the [hospital] expenses until she got well,&quot; said her friend, Lisa Moussa, 17. Moussa was more fortunate. As soon as she saw the rebels, she began running. They tried to kill her, shooting until she stumbled and fell. The gang caught her and frogmarched her to a police station and threatened to rape her until her father paid 6,000 Central African francs (\u00a37.90) for her release. Moussa lives in the Camp Fleur district of Kaga-Bandoro, a town deep in the jungle of the CAR, which was tipped into anarchy when the Seleka rebels overthrew the government and seized power four months ago. The UN has declared the entire 4.6 million population to be victims and the country among its most dangerous destinations.

M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res warns that the country had been effectively &quot;abandoned to its fate&quot;.   Yvgeny Morozov on democracy in a digital age I use Google products all the time. People who are building a service which I pay for with my privacy or money I&apos;m quite OK with. But as time goes by they aspire to do many things that go beyond their business and their initial set of commercial concerns. We don&apos;t treat them with the level of criticism and scrutiny that they deserve; we assume they are in the business of information, which is a benign business and they are part of the enlightenment project. We tend not to think they have shareholders, commercial agendas and are run by people who might not have a very deep appreciation of the human condition and the world around us. I have a lot of respect for these people as engineers, but they are being asked to take on tasks that go far beyond engineering. Tasks that have to do with human and social engineering rather than technical engineering. Those are the kind of tasks I would prefer were taken on by human beings who are more well-rounded, who know about philosophy and ethics, and know something about things other than efficiency, because it will not end well. We did not elect them to help us solve our problems. Once Google is selected to run the infrastructure on which we are changing the world, Google will be there forever. Democratic accountability will not be prevalent. You cannot file a public information request about Google. We are abandoning all the checks and balances we have built to keep our public officials in check for these cleaner, neater, more efficient technological solutions. Imperfection might be the price for democracy.   Catherine Deveney on Cardinal Keith O&apos;Brien Three priests and one former priest in Scotland have reported the most senior Catholic clergyman in Britain, Cardinal Keith O&apos;Brien, to the Vatican. The four, from the diocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh, have complained to nuncio Antonio Mennini, the Vatican&apos;s ambassador to Britain, and demanded O&apos;Brien&apos;s immediate resignation. A spokesman for the cardinal said the claims were contested. Cardinal Keith O&apos;Brien resigned as head of the Scottish Catholic church the next day.   Barbara Ellen on Princess Kate&apos;s hair It&apos;s as if a whole female body is so disturbing and overwhelming, it has to be criticised one bit at a time. Muffin tops, fat arses, double chins, no thigh gap, bulging hips, bingo wings, sagging knees, bushy brows, non-designer vaginas and, my personal favourite, overlong toes! These days, The Female Eunuch&apos;s cover would not feature a suit of the female torso, rather several chopped-up female body parts, resembling a serial killer&apos;s dumping ground. Now there&apos;s hair, preferably thinning in some devastating fashion. Does this matter, beyond celebrities? I&apos;d say so. What happens to people in the public eye has a trickle-down effect until you come inevitably to a 14-year-old schoolgirl crying alone in her bedroom, wondering which part of her body to despise next, the result of a culture that encourages her to think of herself not as a whole person, but as a series of flesh-and-blood problem zones.   Daniel Taylor on Sir Alex Ferguson The most innocuous remark can have Alex Ferguson empurpled, releasing everything two or three inches from his victim&apos;s face, but then the torrent will be done, he will be asking if there are any more questions and it&apos;s as if nothing has happened. It can be disconcerting, to say the least. Ferguson marched over to a reporter on one foreign excursion with Manchester United and, after the usual hot blast of invective, told him point-blank to find alternative arrangements to get back to England (he later relented, in fairness). As for the mother of all eruptions, that was probably the time he was asked about the FA charging Wayne Rooney for slapping Tal Ben Haim, then at Bolton Wanderers. Ferguson worked himself into such a state he ended up swinging his arm at the tape recorders on his desk and sent them flying into a wall 10 feet away. One belonging to his press officer smashed open, with batteries and various bits scattering across the floor. &quot;Marvellous,&quot; he yelled. &quot;You&apos;ve got me to lose my temper.&quot;   John Naughton on the &apos;free&apos; services of internet giants When the history of our time comes to be written, people will marvel at the way that billions of people were seduced into the kind of one-sided agreements they have struck with outfits such as Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple. In the case of Facebook, the historical analogy that comes immediately to mind is sharecropping \u2013 the agricultural system in which a landowner allowed tenants to use his land in return for a share of the crops produced on it and which was once a staple of the southern states of the US. Its virtual equivalent is the Facebook system: a billion people till Master Zuckerberg&apos;s land, creating all the content that is then harvested by him and his advertiser buddies. The only difference is that on Facebook the sharecroppers don&apos;t get any share of the proceeds. They&apos;re just croppers. And here&apos;s the really weird bit: the croppers are absurdly pleased with their lot. They get to post photographs of themselves drunk, sober, recumbent and upside-down. They get to &quot;like&quot; their friends&apos; jokes and status updates and to organise parties and social events without having to use obsolete media such as email. And in the process they &quot;pay&quot; for this entertainment with their privacy and their personal data, apparently without batting an eyelid. Like I said: weird.   Abigail Haworth on Japan&apos;s new &apos;grass-eating men&apos;     Young Japanese people in a Tokyo nightclub. Photograph: Eric Rechsteiner    Satoru Kishino, 31, belongs to a large tribe of men under 40 who are engaging in a kind of passive rebellion against traditional Japanese masculinity. Amid the recession and unsteady wages, men like Kishino feel that the pressure on them to be breadwinning economic warriors for a wife and family is unrealistic. They are rejecting the pursuit of both career and romantic success. &quot;It&apos;s too troublesome,&quot; says Kishino, when I ask why he&apos;s not interested in having a girlfriend. &quot;I don&apos;t earn a huge salary to go on dates and I don&apos;t want the responsibility of a woman hoping it might lead to marriage.&quot; Japan&apos;s media, which has a name for every social kink, refers to men like Kishino as &quot;herbivores&quot; or soshoku danshi (literally, &quot;grass-eating men&quot;). Kishino says he doesn&apos;t mind the label because it&apos;s become so commonplace. He defines it as &quot;a heterosexual man for whom relationships and sex are unimportant&quot;. This was 2013&apos;s most read Observer article on theguardian.com.   Robin McKie on Golden Rice Scientists say they have seen the future of genetically modified foods and have concluded that it is orange or, more precisely, golden. Next year, golden rice \u2013 normal rice that has been genetically modified to provide vitamin A to counter blindness and other diseases in children in the developing world \u2013 could be given to farmers in the Philippines for planting in paddy fields. Thirty years after scientists first revealed they had created the world&apos;s first GM crop, hopes that their potential to ease global malnutrition problems may be realised at last. Bangladesh and Indonesia have indicated they are ready to accept golden rice, and other nations, including India, have also said that they are considering planting it. &quot;Vitamin A deficiency is deadly,&quot; said Adrian Dubock, a member of the Golden Rice project. &quot;It affects children&apos;s immune systems and kills around two million every year in developing countries. It is also a major cause of blindness in the third world. Boosting levels of vitamin A in rice provides a simple, straightforward way to put that right.&quot;   Nigel Slater&apos;s diary of a working week Above anything in my working week, the trip to market, and to the Fern Verrow stall in Bermondsey in particular, is the bit I love. Despite our well-laid plans, shopping is really where it all starts. It has done so since that first week, 20 years ago, when, if I remember rightly, the recipes [for Slater&apos;s first Observer column] were roasted peppers and a damson compote. There are ingredients I must have, and others I&apos;m hoping will be there. But there is also many an inspirational buy. The gold and ruby plums, the tiny fuzzy-skinned peaches, the extraordinary spotted trevise; all these will have a home either on the table or for the column. Often for both. It is here, among the new potatoes, flowering chives and courgettes and scarlet, tangerine and black-skinned tomatoes that everything can turn on a sixpence. Just as it can at the fishmonger or the butcher, the cheese shop or the greengrocer. Shopping lists are, to me, just wish lists: they are rarely adhered to, and I will often add a recipe simply because I have been tempted by a particular ingredient. I reserve the right to change my ideas on a whim. We deal with it.   Robert McCrum interviews Andrew Marr &quot;In hospital I remember thinking,&quot; Andrew Marr says, &quot;that I have gobbled life too much. I have gone racing from one thing to the next and never enjoyed the moment.

It was two years after the Daily Mail ran a graph charting &quot;the ups and downs of her ever-changing figure&quot;, one year since she&apos;d publicly discussed her bulimia and the recent loss of her child, and months since she&apos;d given birth to her first daughter. She was feeling fat. She had gone for a consultation about laser liposuction and, after advice from the surgeon, booked in for more \u2013 as well as her thighs, her arse, he recommended she reshape her ankles, her belly, her knees and her back. Except, four days before her operation, she found out she was pregnant again. And so \u2013 she&apos;s Lily Allen \u2013 she wrote a song. On a bright cold day on an industrial estate outside Wimbledon, near a dusty Chinese takeaway called the Charisma Caf\u00e9, a caf\u00e9 that appears to have been built out of chips and irony, Lily Allen is standing on a sound stage, being a pop star again. Her new song booms through air fragrant with the fresh-paint smell of things going right. This is not just a pop song. This is a feminist text with a really catchy drum beat. This is not just a pop song. This is an open letter to the Mail Online, and this is a cackling wink at modern misogyny, at women&apos;s roles in 2013, at bloody Robin Thicke&apos;s Blurred Lines, even. While his video, for one of the biggest hits of the year, featured balloons that coyly spelled out &quot;Robin Thicke has a big dick,&quot; her balloons say &quot;Lily Allen has a baggy pussy.&quot;Could this be the first chart hit containing the word &quot;objectifies&quot;? It&apos;s good to have her back.   Alex Renton on the basking shark&apos;s return to Britain     A basking shark feeding on plankton off the Cornwall coast. Photograph: Alex Mustard/naturepl.com    The basking sharks (or the cearban, the muldoan, hoe-mother, the brigdie\u2026 every Atlantic coast has its name for them) were back. They were late this year because the sea was colder than usual. They usually appear from May in the south-west, June in the Isle of Man and July in the Hebrides. But when they did turn up it was in great numbers. By August the sharks were swarming up the Scottish coast. Fishing boats and rigid inflatables reported near misses. On the Oban-to- Barra run, the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry had to keep a special lookout so the ship could avoid schools of giants cruising the seas at a sedate 3mph. The Shark Trust, which logs sightings, announced record-breaking numbers for Scotland. Basking sharks are Britain&apos;s elephants, our biggest animals. They are also our most mysterious. They arrive in herds and then all but disappear for decades. \u00a0  Tim Adams interviews Julie Bailey Right from the start of the campaign in 2008, [whistleblower] Julie Bailey was getting anonymous hate mail. Mid-Staffordshire hospital is Stafford&apos;s biggest employer, and her exposure of its culture of neglect and harm was profoundly unpopular in some quarters. After the emergency department was closed at night pending review, she says, the abuse got worse. &quot;I was getting cards saying, &apos;I hope you die in an ambulance on the way to hospital now you have closed this one&apos; \u2026 I had my car tyres slashed, &apos;Bitch&apos; written on my windows, and &apos;Shut your effing mouth&apos;.&quot; Bailey, a mother of two who lives alone, was understandably worried for her safety. She finally decided to move out when her mother&apos;s grave was vandalised. &quot;I would go up each Sunday to put fresh flowers out, and when I went up on a Tuesday to water them the flowers would be out and the vase smashed and the pieces stamped into the earth so I would have to dig them out,&quot; she says. She thought it might just be kids, but then she got another thank-you card, this one saying: &quot;Isn&apos;t it about time you started looking after your mum&apos;s grave? Ha ha ha\u2026&quot; She says: &quot;I don&apos;t really know how you deal with that.&quot; Carole Cadwalladr as a shift worker     Carole Cadwalladr outside the large Amazon distribution wharehouse Photograph: Stephen Shepherd for the Observer    Right now, in Swansea, four shifts will be working at least a 50-hour week, hand-picking and packing each item, or, as the Daily Mail put it in an article a few weeks ago, being &quot;Amazon&apos;s elves&quot; in the &quot;21st-century Santa&apos;s grotto&quot;. If Santa had a track record in paying his temporary elves the minimum wage while pushing them to the limits of the EU working time directive, and sacking them if they take three sick breaks in any three-month period, this would be an apt comparison. It is probably reasonable to assume that tax avoidance is not &quot;constitutionally&quot; a part of the Santa business model, as Brad Stone, the author of a new book on Amazon, The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon, tells me it is in Amazon&apos;s case. Neither does Santa attempt to bully his competitors, as Mark Constantine, the founder of Lush cosmetics, who last week took Amazon to the high court, accuses it of doing. Santa was not called before the Commons public accounts committee and called &quot;immoral&quot; by MPs.   Ed Vulliamy interviews author Anabel Hern\u00e1ndez Narcoland: The Mexican Drug Lords and their Godfathers is a book about, to use one of its author Anabel Hern\u00e1ndez&apos;s best words, the &quot;mafiocracy&quot;, rather than the mafia \u2013 about the mafia state. It is about how the old Guadalajara cartel of the 1980s was protected by the Mexican government just as its heir, Guzm\u00e1n&apos;s Sinaloa syndicate, is now. It is about the rise of Genaro Garc\u00eda Luna, whom Hern\u00e1ndez accuses of being El Chapo&apos;s protector at the apex of government. &quot;At first, I thought it would be difficult,&quot; she says. &quot;I didn&apos;t think people would be ready to believe that the government is lying.

He had shown himself to be so capable that the bank he was working for was preparing to offer him a full-time job as a \u00a345,000-a-year analyst after graduation. Keen to impress to the last, he worked three nights in a row. Over a 72-hour period, he got a taxi back from the office to his flat in Bethnal Green, east London, at around 5am each day. He would then shower briefly before returning to his desk. This exhausting ritual is known in banking circles as the &quot;magic roundabout&quot; \u2013 so called because the taxi driver will sometimes wait outside while an intern washes, puts on a fresh shirt and re-emerges blinking in the dawn light. On Thursday 15 August, Moritz was caught on CCTV entering the Claredale House block of student flats, rented to hundreds of City interns during the summer.

Mochi \u2013 glutinous cakes of pounded rice \u2013 kill several people in Japan each January after they become lodged in the throats of their mainly elderly victims. Eager to keep the death toll as low as possible over the first few days of the New Year, when mochi are traditionally eaten in vast quantities, a firm in Osaka recently unveiled a safer alternative. Fukunao Medical Foods says its mochi rice cakes form part of easy-to-swallow new year feasts the company has made available for pre-order, the Japan Times reported. Other companies have followed suit in an attempt to corner Japan\u2019s huge population of elderly people, for whom chewing on an innocent-looking mochi can mean taking their lives in their hands. Five traditional confectionery firms in Kyoto say their &quot;safe&quot; mochi include an enzyme that makes them less sticky, while retaining their familiar starchy taste. The product won\u2019t be ready until next year, but the confectioners say they are encouraged by tasting sessions held this year. \u201cIt still has the flavour of sticky rice, but without the firmness,\u201d Takahiro Ueda, one of the firms involved, told the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. Last new year two deaths were reported from choking on sticky rice cakes and a further 15 people were rushed to hospital in mochi-related incidents. In 2011, at least eight people died, most of whom were over 70, and another 18 were taken to hospital. Between 2006 and 2009, 18 people died from mochi choking in Tokyo alone, according to fire department figures. Every year emergency services remind people of all ages to cut their mochi into bite-sized pieces before eating them, to chew each morsel into submission before attempting to swallow, and never to eat them alone. In 2010, Japan\u2019s food safety commission ranked mochi among the top causes of food-related choking incidents, and found that more than 80% of victims were elderly. Methods for dislodging trapped mochi include a sharp slap on the back, the Heimlich manoeuvre and \u2013 a less conventional method that makes an appearance in the 1985 Juzo Itami film Tampopo \u2013 sucking it out with a vacuum-cleaner pipe. One medical equipment firm sells a nozzle to be attached to a vacuum cleaner, which it claims can remove the offending piece of rice cake without damaging the victim&apos;s throat.

But the recent formation of an island off the country&apos;s Pacific coast, after weeks of volcanic activity, has prompted more enchantment than fear at nature&apos;s volatility. In the weeks since it rose from the sea 620 miles (1,000km) south of Tokyo, the island expanded amid continued volcanic activity, before merging with an existing island to create a new landmass with a remarkable resemblance to a cartoon dog \u2013 Snoopy. The publication of aerial photos of Nishinoshima island and its new addition prompted an outpouring of delight online. The Kotaku blog noted that @tekken8810, one of many Twitter users who posted visual comparisons, called the island and its canine likeness a &quot;complete match&quot;. User @etienneeshrdlu joked: &quot;Exactly as Nostradamus predicted. A new Snoopy-shaped island rises from the sea near Tokyo,&quot; while @astralpouch declared: &quot;Holy crap \u2026 Snoopy island \u2026 I don&apos;t care what they say I&apos;m going over there.&quot; Henceforth, the Japan-based Twitter-sphere deemed, the as-yet officially unnamed landmass would be known as Snoopy island. Some speculated how long it would be before China claimed sovereignty over the island \u2013 a reference to a longstanding dispute over ownership of the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea. Though meant as a joke, the comments did not entirely miss the mark: Japan plans to build port facilities and transplant fast-growing coral fragments onto Okinotorishima, a pair of tropical islets located even farther south of Tokyo in a resource-rich area of ocean coveted by China. And Japan&apos;s chief government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, welcomed the prospect that Japan&apos;s borders could stretch, if only by a few hundred metres. &quot;If it becomes an island, our country&apos;s territorial waters will expand,&quot; he told reporters after the island was discovered last month. By Christmas Eve, the island had expanded to about eight times its size when it was discovered, according to studies by Prof Fukashi Maeno of Tokyo University&apos;s earthquake research institute. A massive undersea volcanic eruption had resulted in the new island linking with Nishinoshima at its two southern corners. In between sits of a pool of reddish seawater \u2013 Snoopy&apos;s perfectly positioned collar. Experts said that volcano remains highly active, as red magma continued to rise, raising the possibility that it will lose its endearing shape as it expands. Uncertainty surrounds the long-term future of the new island, which for now forms part of the Ogasawara chain, also known as the Bonin islands, that are administered by Tokyo despite their distance from the Japanese capital. Hiroshi Ito, a volcanologist with the Japanese coastguard, said the island could erode after the eruptions cease. &quot;But it could also remain permanently,&quot; he told the FNN news network. The last recorded volcanic eruption in the area occurred in 1974, according to the meteorological agency. Much of the volcanic activity happens under the sea, which is thousands of metres deep at the site of the Izu-Ogasawara-Marianas Trench. No doubt aware of the media buzz surrounding Snoopy island, Japan&apos;s coastguard warned that the area was still very dangerous and told would-be tourists to stay away."}, {"sentences": ["The move, which comes after many years of negotiations between Washington, Tokyo, and the Okinawa authorities, has been hailed as a &quot;critical milestone&quot; by US Secretary of State Chuck Hagel.", "It particularly infuriated Beijing and Seoul, which have repeatedly asserted that Tokyo has done too little to atone for its wartime abuses.", "In the broader context of current tensions in Asia, it is also possible that Abe anticipated there was little to lose, diplomatically, by making the visit now, especially with Beijing having recently made provocations towards Tokyo.", "Already, Seoul has cancelled a series of proposed bilateral defence and military exchange programmes with Tokyo, while Beijing has strongly condemned the trip and is under pressure to retaliate."], "tags": ["Asia Pacific", "Japan", "US news", "World news", "US foreign policy", "US national security", "US military", "China", "South Korea"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-30T15:40:00Z", "title": "Japan: land of the rising foreign relation tensions | Andrew Hammond", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/30/japan-war-shrine-visit-us-china", "article": "In a key announcement on Friday, Okinawa Governor Hirokazu Nakaima agreed to the relocation of the US military base at Futenma to nearby Henoko. The move, which comes after many years of negotiations between Washington, Tokyo, and the Okinawa authorities, has been hailed as a &quot;critical milestone&quot; by US Secretary of State Chuck Hagel. The development is valuable to the Obama administration as it provides a key missing piece in its pivot to Asia Pacific: a replacement base for Futenma which is scheduled to close within a decade. Japan and other allies are crucial to the success of this US strategy, both by enhancing the country&apos;s military presence in Asia Pacific, and by increasing burden sharing of the costs of a US-led security order in the region. Simultaneously, Friday&apos;s decision represents a political win for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as it underpins the country&apos;s US alliance at a moment of major tension in Asia. Abe met personally with Nakaima only last Wednesday to discuss the base decision, which will draw considerable opposition from people in Okinawa for whom continued US military presence is already controversial. The timing of Nakaima&apos;s announcement seems to have been choreographed with Abe, especially coming just 24 hours after the prime minister&apos;s controversial visit to the Yasukuni shrine. The shrine, where 14 high ranking military leaders convicted as war criminals are honoured along with around 2.5 million other Japanese men, women and children who died in wars, is perceived by many domestic and foreign critics as symbolic of the Japan&apos;s wartime excesses. Abe&apos;s visit, the first by any sitting Japanese prime minister for seven years, predictably drew foreign criticism, though Abe depicted it as an anti-war gesture intended not to hurt feelings in neighbouring countries. It particularly infuriated Beijing and Seoul, which have repeatedly asserted that Tokyo has done too little to atone for its wartime abuses. The Obama administration also expressed &quot;disappointment&quot; after previous proclamations from US officials that visits to Yasukuni by senior Japanese politicians should be avoided. Despite this relatively mild criticism, there is no disguising Washington&apos;s frustration at the prime minister&apos;s trip, especially in the context of pre-existing, major regional stress. Knowing this would be the case, it appears likely that Abe calculated that the base decision would at least partially blunt Washington&apos;s reprimand and give him the political space to make the visit. For the prime minister, this was an important trip on the one year anniversary of his election, which will have pleased many Japanese nationalists, a vital political constituency for him. This underlines the importance to Abe&apos;s conservative agenda of emphasizing Japanese pride in its past, of which his shrine visit is a part. And, relatedly, he also wishes to overturn the remaining legal and political underpinning of the country&apos;s post-war pacifist security identity, so that it can become more actively engaged internationally. In the broader context of current tensions in Asia, it is also possible that Abe anticipated there was little to lose, diplomatically, by making the visit now, especially with Beijing having recently made provocations towards Tokyo. From this calculus, the marginal diplomatic costs of the shrine trip are low with bilateral relations with China (and, to a lesser extent, South Korea) already in a deep freeze. Nonetheless, there is real danger that the episode will make the regional atmosphere even more unpredictable. Already, Seoul has cancelled a series of proposed bilateral defence and military exchange programmes with Tokyo, while Beijing has strongly condemned the trip and is under pressure to retaliate. Diplomatic temperature is so high at the moment is, in large part, due to the succession of incidents in recent weeks, including Abe&apos;s visit to Yasukuni; China&apos;s unilateral declaration of an air &quot;self-defence identification zone&quot;, and a counter-move from South Korea; China&apos;s refusal to participate in a UN arbitration process over a territorial conflict with the Philippines; and the near-miss of a Chinese naval vessel and a US warship in the South China Sea. These developments come in a context of significant change in the region, including a once-in-a-generation transition of leadership in Beijing; Abe&apos;s election; and the US Asia pivot. In this fluid environment, the geopolitical landscape is shifting as all countries manoeuvre for advantage. A clear danger, at this heated moment, is therefore serious misjudgement by one or more parties. And this point was emphasised by Hagel on 19 Decemember following the China-US near-collision at sea: the most serious bilateral encounter in the South China Sea for several years. The US defence secretary accused Beijing of acting in a &quot;very incendiary [way] that could be a trigger or a spark that could set off some eventual miscalculation&quot;. While China claims that its vessel was conducting &quot;normal patrols&quot; and adhered to proper and &quot;strict protocol&quot;, Hagel asserts it cut in front of the US ship. With numerous potential flashpoints in 2014, key external parties, including the European Union, are understandably urging calm and restraint on all sides. Unless this caution is heeded, there is a growing possibility of an incident triggering an explosive further escalation of tension."}, {"sentences": ["The Dow Jones was trading at a record level of 16,483 on Monday and the FTSE 100 has staged a recovery from an autumn slowdown, but neither can match the 57% gain in the Tokyo market since January.", "The mood in Tokyo is cautious, but after more than 20 years of torpor, Japan is once more a hive of activity.", "At the heart of Tokyo&apos;s recent success is a 40% fall in the yen&apos;s value against the dollar, which has made exports cheaper and brought with it a much needed boost to import prices and consequently inflation.", "As in the west, the Tokyo version of QE involved printing billions in extra currency to offset the weakness of banks and over-indebted households following the financial crash of 2008.", "While it may seem counterintuitive to want higher inflation, Tokyo desperately needed a sustained and steady rise in prices to encourage consumption at home."], "tags": ["Nikkei", "Business", "Stock markets", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Shinzo Abe", "Money", "Investing", "Investments"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-30T18:26:31Z", "title": "Japan's Nikkei beats Dow Jones and FTSE 100 with 57% rise in 2013", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/30/japan-stock-market-nikkei-rises-57-percent", "article": "A turnaround in Japan&apos;s economic fortunes over the last year has given the Nikkei index of leading shares its biggest annual rise since 1972. The Dow Jones was trading at a record level of 16,483 on Monday and the FTSE 100 has staged a recovery from an autumn slowdown, but neither can match the 57% gain in the Tokyo market since January. Japanese exports are up and much of the industrial sector has returned to health. Industrial giants such as Sony, Panasonic and Sharp have seen a turnaround in sales after several years of heavy losses. Adding to the generally upbeat tone, many employers have put the brakes on redundancies and begun opening factories again. The mood in Tokyo is cautious, but after more than 20 years of torpor, Japan is once more a hive of activity. The government elected in 2012, led by prime minister Shinzo Abe, has proved to be a catalyst, injecting life into a debt-ridden economy many had written off as moribund. The newfound economic success has emboldened Abe in the political sphere. He has challenged China over the disputed Senkaku islands (known as the Diaoyu islands in China) and talked about reviving Japan&apos;s military machine. In the aftermath of the Philippines hurricane disaster, Abe pledged aid worth five times the total committed by China. At the heart of Tokyo&apos;s recent success is a 40% fall in the yen&apos;s value against the dollar, which has made exports cheaper and brought with it a much needed boost to import prices and consequently inflation. The yen began falling within weeks of Abe&apos;s election and his promise to mimic the loose monetary policies adopted by the US and Britain. To push through reforms, he appointed a new central bank boss who threw off the conservative garb of his predecessors. Most importantly from Abe&apos;s standpoint, Haruhiko Kuroda embraced quantitative easing (QE). As in the west, the Tokyo version of QE involved printing billions in extra currency to offset the weakness of banks and over-indebted households following the financial crash of 2008. Printing extra yen was a signal to investors to sell their government bonds, further devaluing the currency. A fall in the yen also brought with it higher inflation, which was another key aim of the Abe administration. While it may seem counterintuitive to want higher inflation, Tokyo desperately needed a sustained and steady rise in prices to encourage consumption at home. After more than two decades of falling prices, consumers were accustomed to goods being cheaper next year and thus put off buying decisions. Inflation encourages expenditure now. In a speech earlier this month, Kuroda said: &quot;For the Japanese economy, now is a golden opportunity to break away from deflation, as signs of a favourable turn are being widely observed in the real economy, in the financial market and in people&apos;s minds and expectations. The Bank of Japan promises to achieve the price stability target of 2% as early as possible.&quot; Takuji Aida, Japan analyst at the investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said: &quot;The implications of using the expressions &apos;golden opportunity&apos; and &apos;as early as possible&apos; are strong, and it seems more likely that the Bank of Japan will use the logic of launching additional QE to make the realisation of its view more certain, even if the economic outlook and prices are progressing in line with the central bank&apos;s assumptions.&quot; But there are several question marks over how long the latest Japanese miracle can be sustained. Analysts are concerned that the recovery depends on a currency value that could climb when success appears assured and investors come racing back. Without a low currency, the nascent export boom will come to an abrupt end, they argue, and politicians will face mounting problems stemming from a declining population and a lack of energy self-sufficiency now that almost all the country&apos;s nuclear reactors have been decommissioned. The yen is likely to remain low while the Bank of Japan keeps the printing presses rolling and the US and UK keep QE on hold. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve cut its monthly QE programme from $85bn to $75bn (\u00a352bn to \u00a346bn) and it is likely to mothball the printing presses later in 2014. The Bank of England has already signalled that a rise in QE is unlikely without another crisis to resolve. There is also a question mark hanging over companies such as Sony and Panasonic, which ruled the electronics era of the 1980s and 90s, but have lost ground to Apple of the US and Samsung of Korea in the digital age. Officials in the Abe administration believe the boost to lending through QE, and the knock-on effect of a lower currency and a return to moderate inflation, have bought much-needed time for corporate Japan to challenge the US in the digital race and leave China to be the low-end workshop of the world. But some fear cheap money could dissuade firms, still overburdened with &quot;jobs for life&quot; workers, from investing and innovating to keep pace with rivals."}], "docs": 609}
