Tens of thousands of people lined the banks of the River Thames as the chimes of Big Ben rang in the new year in the capital, while an estimated 80,000 descended on Edinburgh for its famous Hogmanay street party. Fireworks events also took place in Cardiff and Belfast, while Londonderry marked its final few hours as the UK City of Culture in 2013 with a cathedral service. Some 50,000 revellers in London braved the threat of rain to enjoy what was billed as &quot;the world&apos;s first multi-sensory fireworks display&quot;, when peach snow and orange-scented bubbles descend on a section of the crowd. Partygoers queued for hours to get a prime spot near the London Eye, where an enormous fireworks display lit up the skyline.  Up to 100,000 are thought to have enjoyed the display, during which people were given LED wristbands and fruit-flavoured sweets that linked to the tastes and smells of the multi-sensory display to bring something different to the new year festivities. After watching the fireworks, revellers joined in a traditional rendition of Auld Lang Syne. London mayor Boris Johnson said there was &quot;no better way to celebrate the highs of 2013 and the start of an exciting new year&quot; than enjoying one of the world&apos;s most dazzling fireworks displays&quot;. The Metropolitan police said it had 3,800 officers on duty for the event, while London Ambulance Service received 1,100 calls between 7pm and midnight, and 469 in the first hour of 2014. Travel on buses, the Tube, trams, Docklands Light Railway and the London Overground remained free until 4.30am. In Edinburgh thousands of people counted down the last moments of 2013 before fireworks over Edinburgh Castle and Calton Hill marked the start of the new year. The Pet Shop Boys headlined a concert in Princes Street Gardens, while there was also a Keilidh playing traditional Scottish music. Today around half a million people are expected to attend the annual New Year&apos;s Day Parade in London, which could be hit by rain and strong winds. The celebration parade will feature music from around the globe, leaving the Ritz Hotel at noon and winding through Piccadilly, Pall Mall and Trafalgar Square before ending in Parliament Square. In New York a sea of horn-tooting, hat-wearing revellers cheered and kissed as the famed crystal ball dropped in a freezing New York City Times Square to ring in 2014, capping a worldwide wave of celebrations that included a dazzling 30-minute fireworks show in Dubai.

Michael Bloomberg, on his last day in office, was sitting the celebration out after 12 years on the job, while newly elected mayor Bill de Blasio took the oath of office just after midnight at his Brooklyn home. The New York celebration featured performances from artists such as Miley Cyrus, Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis and Blondie There were spectacular displays in Rio, Brazil, where thousands watched as fireworks lit up the skies over Copacabana Beach. In Russia, where two suicide bombings in two days killed 34 people, eerily empty buses lumbered through the streets of Volgograd, where authorities canceled mass events for New Year&apos;s Eve and asked residents not to set off fireworks. President Vladimir Putin, in his New Year&apos;s Eve address to the nation, vowed that the fight against terrorists will continue &quot;until their destruction is complete&quot;, Russian news agencies reported. In Dubai on the Persian Gulf officials sought to break another record by creating the largest fireworks show. The skyline was a canvas for a dazzling 30-minute show. The display capped off with six minutes of fireworks that engulfed the city&apos;s manmade, palm-shaped island, with its fronds and trunk shimmering in thousands of lights. In Ukraine anti-government protesters hoped to set their own record for the most people to sing a national anthem at the same time. On Kiev&apos;s main square at least 100,000 Ukrainians sang their national anthem in a sign of support for integration with Europe. The square has been the scene of massive pro-European protests for more than a month, triggered by President Viktor Yanukovych&apos;s decision to ditch a key deal with the European Union. In the Philippines two people were killed and around 600 injured by firecracker blasts and celebratory gunfire as the nation marked the end of a year of tragic disasters, including an 8 November typhoon that left more than 6,100 dead and nearly 1,800 missing.     Fireworks explode over Sydney Harbour at midnight, ushering in the new year, in Sydney January 1, 2014 Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters    In Sydney there was a fireworks display that sprayed from the sails of the Sydney Opera House and the city&apos;s harbor bridge. New Zealand concluded 2013 with its own fireworks that erupted from Auckland&apos;s Sky Tower while cheering crowds danced in the streets. In Tokyo five priests at the Zojoji temple used ropes to swing a wooden pole against a large bell, sounding the first of 108 gongs to mark the new year. Simultaneously, &quot;2014&quot; lit up in white lights on the modern Tokyo Tower in the background. China had light shows at part of the Great Wall near Beijing and at the Bund waterfront in Shanghai. The city of Wuhan in central Hubei province called off its fireworks show and banned fireworks downtown to avoid worsening its smog. Pope Francis used his year-end prayer service of thanksgiving to urge people to ask themselves: fid they spend 2013 to further their own interests or to help others? The pontiff asked people to reflect if they used the past year to make the places where they live more livable and welcoming. Citing Rome as an example, Francis said the city is full of tourists, but also refugees."}, {"sentences": ["Nearly three years after a major earthquake, tsunami and nuclear radiation leak devastated coastal and inland areas of Japan&apos;s Fukushima prefecture, 175 miles north-east of Tokyo, Namie has become a silent town of ghosts and absent lives.", "There is little or no trust in official pronouncements, given the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), to take adequate measures to protect the plant against the tsunami and the company&apos;s unimpressive post-disaster record.", "Politicians in Tokyo say if Fukushima does not recover, Japan will not recover, but I&apos;m not sure they really mean that."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "World news", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-01T16:21:01Z", "title": "Fukushima ghost towns struggle to recover amid high radiation levels", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/01/fukushima-ghost-towns-high-radiation-levels-tsunami", "article": "Nearly three years after a major earthquake, tsunami and nuclear radiation leak devastated coastal and inland areas of Japan&apos;s Fukushima prefecture, 175 miles north-east of Tokyo, Namie has become a silent town of ghosts and absent lives. Namie&apos;s 21,000 residents remain evacuated because of continuing high radiation levels, the product of the March 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, six miles to the south. Homes, shops and streets are deserted except for the occasional police patrol or checkpoint. Like the setting for a Hollywood post-apocalypse movie, grass and weeds poke up through cracked pavements. At an abandoned garage, a rusting car sits on a raised ramp, waiting for a repair that will never be completed. A feral dog peers from a wild, untended garden. Namie is nobody&apos;s town now. Nobody lives here, and nobody visits for long. Even the looters have stopped bothering, and no one knows exactly when the inhabitants may be allowed to return permanently \u2013 or whether they will want to. The 2011 catastrophe faded from world headlines long ago, but in Namie, Tomioka, Okuma, Futaba and other blighted towns in the 20-mile evacuation zone around the Fukushima plant, it is a disaster that never ends. At the plant itself, recent leaks of contaminated water into the sea and a fraught operation to remove fuel rods from one of the damaged reactors have shown how critical the situation still is \u2013 and will remain during a decommissioning process that could take up to 40 years. For Fukushima&apos;s displaced population, the effects of the disaster continue to be deeply felt. The evacuation area was subdivided earlier this year into three zones of higher or lower radiation risk. In the worst affected zone, return will not be allowed before 2017 at the earliest. In other areas, families and businesses face difficult decisions about whether or not to go back. At present, no one is even allowed to stay overnight. Locals say that whatever happens, many younger people will not return. There is little or no trust in official pronouncements, given the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), to take adequate measures to protect the plant against the tsunami and the company&apos;s unimpressive post-disaster record. There are suspicions that the government knows some towns may never be safe to live in again, but refuses to admit it in order to protect Japan&apos;s unpopular nuclear power industry. There is also a sense that Fukushima&apos;s victims have been forgotten. That said, the painstaking cleanup continues and there has been some progress in adjoining, less badly affected areas, according to Hiroshi Murata, the head of the Odaka ward of Minamisoma City, close to Namie. As many as 18,000 people died or were declared missing in Fukushima prefecture after the tsunami struck. The radiation plumes caused the forced evacuation of a further 154,000, according to the Japan Reconstruction Agency. In Odaka, 148 people died, and there were more than 300 fatalities in Minamisoma as a whole. But now around 53% of Odaka residents have returned home, a total of 6,800 out of a pre-disaster population of 12,800, Murata said. Nobody has died directly as a result of the nuclear disaster, but a close eye is being kept on the incidence of thyroid cancer in children, following the experience of Chernobyl. The biggest issues the local administration now faces, following the rehousing of residents in temporary accommodation, are the demolition of unsafe houses, replacement of infrastructure and services, including roads and school playgrounds, and the decontamination and desalination of buildings and land. &quot;To decontaminate one house and garden takes 10 to 14 days,&quot; Murata said. &quot;We have to remove surface soil, cut the trees, wash the roofs, clean the rain gutters. The house owners are responsible for cleaning inside. The city and the government help with the rest.&quot; At least in Odaka there is something to clean and repair. In Ukedo, the part of Namie municipality closest to the Pacific ocean, the devastation is total. Hardly a single house was left standing by the tsunami, which reached 17m in height in some places, Murata said \u2013 a vast wall of water that devoured all in its path. Wrecked fishing boats still lie stranded miles inland and there are vast piles of scrap metal, smashed cars, bits of concrete bridges and broken wooden house frames where once a thriving village stood. An abandoned elementary school, 500m from the sea, looks as though it has been bombed. But even in Ukedo, a long line of displaced local resident volunteers can be seen picking up and sorting debris on a wintry afternoon, gradually clearing the land where homes formerly stood. With impressive organisation, the local authorities are recycling everything they can, bagging it up in vast compounds erected amid the bleak, salty flatlands that were once rice paddy fields. Tetsurou Eguchi, the deputy mayor of Minamisoma City, said the radiation-related cleanup was likely to take another five to six years and could cost as much as \u00a5350bn (\u00a32bn), much of which would come from the national government. Post-tsunami reconstruction would take up to 10 years. But something intangible had been permanently lost, he said. &quot;When it comes to the economy, and individual and social life, it is very difficult to recover this, compared with how it used to be.&quot; The most challenging problem, he said, was decontamination. &quot;Basically [the radioactive fallout] is not in the air any more. It&apos;s in the soil.&quot; The area was dependent economically on small businesses, agriculture, fishing and tourism, including the famous annual Soma Nomaoi samurai festival, he said. All had been seriously affected. &quot;People don&apos;t believe it is safe to visit here. They won&apos;t believe our produce, our livestock, our fish are safe. There is a blight. This will take a long time to change.&quot; Much had been said by the national government about supporting Fukushima prefecture in its efforts to get back on its feet, but the reality is different, Eguchi said. &quot;It is a fact that we have received quite a lot of support, but is it sufficient? That is difficult, because it&apos;s not just a question of reconstruction. Politicians in Tokyo say if Fukushima does not recover, Japan will not recover, but I&apos;m not sure they really mean that. &quot;I don&apos;t think Fukushima is fully supported by the whole country. And that&apos;s what the citizens here think.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["So when a senior government insider in Tokyo, speaking off the record, recently compared the deteriorating security situation in East Asia to Europe in the 1930s amid the rise of fascism, it was time to sit up and take notice.", "Some analysts claim it has long been in Tokyo&apos;s interests to play up the China &quot;threat&quot;.", "Tellingly, the Japanese official&apos;s warning came days before China unexpectedly declared a new air-defence zone in the East China sea, covering the Senkaku islands (Diaoyu to China) that are viewed in Tokyo as sovereign Japanese territory.", "The lack of a regional security organisation, the absence of a hotline between Beijing and Tokyo, and the ever-present menace represented by the nuclear-armed, Chinese-backed regime in North Korea all add to the inherent dangers of the current situation."], "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "Japan", "Xi Jinping", "Barack Obama", "US foreign policy", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-01T19:00:00Z", "title": "China's military presence is growing. Does a superpower collision loom?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/01/china-military-presence-superpower-collision-japan", "article": "Generally speaking, Japanese bureaucrats are not much given to exaggeration. So when a senior government insider in Tokyo, speaking off the record, recently compared the deteriorating security situation in East Asia to Europe in the 1930s amid the rise of fascism, it was time to sit up and take notice. &quot;Tensions are getting very high in this part of the world,&quot; the official said. &quot;The security position is extremely severe. There are huge arms sales from Russia, the US and Europe. China&apos;s defence spending has seen double-digit growth each year since 1989. They [Beijing] are not a responsible partner. US influence in the region is receding.&quot; Bad blood between Japan and China runs deep and, in the modern era, dates from the 1931 invasion of Manchuria. Following its defeat in 1945 and its adoption of a pacifist constitution, Japan became wholly dependent on the US for its defence. Some analysts claim it has long been in Tokyo&apos;s interests to play up the China &quot;threat&quot;. But objectively speaking, the threat is real, and it becomes tangibly more worrying by the day. Extraordinarily rapid economic growth in China in recent decades, which has seen it overtake Japan as the world&apos;s second-largest economy, and the concomitant expansion of Beijing&apos;s political, diplomatic and military might have set alarm bells clanging across the region as never before. Today the talk at embassy cocktail parties is not so much about how to &quot;contain&quot; China \u2013 the great, lost conceit of hawkish American geostrategists \u2013 as how to appease it. Tellingly, the Japanese official&apos;s warning came days before China unexpectedly declared a new air-defence zone in the East China sea, covering the Senkaku islands (Diaoyu to China) that are viewed in Tokyo as sovereign Japanese territory. The ensuing row saw Japan, the US and South Korea send fighter aircraft into the zone in open, dangerous defiance of Beijing&apos;s strictures. A subsequent mediation mission by US vice-president Joe Biden failed to resolve the stand-off, in effect leaving a powder keg smouldering and untended. Nobody is talking openly about a third world war, not yet at least. But there is a growing awareness that the seeds of a possible future superpower collision are being sown around the islands, rocks and shoals, and in the overpopulated sea lanes and airspace beyond China&apos;s historic borders, to which Beijing lays claim with growing political robustness and ever-improving military capacity. The lack of a regional security organisation, the absence of a hotline between Beijing and Tokyo, and the ever-present menace represented by the nuclear-armed, Chinese-backed regime in North Korea all add to the inherent dangers of the current situation. Like any empire in the past, as China&apos;s power grows, that power is ineluctably projected to encompass immediate neighbours and, in time, geographical regions and even whole continents. For Beijing, the final frontier in this reverse engineering of manifest destiny is the Pacific basin itself. But to achieve dominance, it must first displace the US, the world&apos;s most militarily powerful nation. This contest has years to run. But it is now kicking off, hence the whispers of war. Three men currently hold the key to what may happen in 2014. One is Xi Jinping, paramount leader of the Chinese Communist party and People&apos;s Liberation Army, who succeeded Hu Jintao as president last March. In a sharp change of tone, Xi has dropped Hu&apos;s talk of a magnanimous China&apos;s peaceful rise and substituted a tougher, nationalist-sounding message stressing pride in one&apos;s country at home and asserting China&apos;s rights on the international stage with &quot;indomitable will&quot;. The ideological underpinning for this approach was set out in Xi&apos;s &quot;China dream&quot; inaugural speech, an obvious attempt to provide an alternative to the American dream. As the People&apos;s Daily commented, his idea was &quot;to construct a more open and charismatic Communism that makes people excited to be Chinese&quot;. At a recent party plenum, Xi successfully pushed through an ambitious reform programme while strengthening his grip on power. &quot;Xi emerged from the plenum as the most powerful Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping,&quot; said analyst William Pesek. &quot;Xi may be especially willing to risk a confrontation with Japan right now in order to distract opponents of his proposed reforms, as well as ordinary Chinese who are growing restless over pollution, income inequality and official corruption. Nothing brings China&apos;s 1.3 billion people together so easily as hating the Japanese.&quot; Xi&apos;s rise to power has coincided with the emergence of a similarly hard-headed individual as Japan&apos;s prime minister. Shinzo Abe, who took office around the same time as Xi, has his own agenda for dealing with China. It sometimes makes his American allies and the 10 members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) \u2013 China&apos;s smaller neighbours \u2013 wince with anxiety. An unrepentant nationalist, Abe says it is past time for Japan to drop its pacifist laws, recognise the many threats to its security, and stand up boldly for its interests and values. To this end he has increased defence spending, created a new national security council, strengthened alliances with countries such as the Philippines (which has its own territorial dispute with China), and plans to buy advanced new US weaponry. &quot;Japan is back,&quot; Abe declared during a visit to Washington last year. For this and other reasons, Xi has refused to meet him, as has South Korea&apos;s president. Official media denounce Abe as a revisionist and militarist. This chilly impasse has worsened the strains over China&apos;s new air zone. The third key player in this unfolding drama is Barack Obama, who has bigger guns and more ships and planes than the other two combined. Like the rest of the world, the US administration can think of a thousand reasons why a war in East Asia would be disastrously self-defeating for all concerned, starting with the negative impact on international trade, finance and American debt. But aware of the perception that US regional influence is receding, and that the smallest spark could cause a conflagration, Obama has shifted his approach. His so-called &quot;pivot&quot; to Asia, giving the area a higher foreign policy priority, is principally aimed (despite denials) at countering Chinese blue-water navy ambitions in the Pacific and other unsettling manifestations of Chinese power projection. Regional observers question how serious Obama is about the China &quot;threat&quot; and whether, for example, he would really come to Japan&apos;s defence if the Senkaku dispute degenerated into a shooting war.

Liu Xiaoming said Abe, who has challenged the widely held view that Japan was an aggressor in the second world war, had contributed to a dramatic rise in tensions in north-east Asia with his hawkish policies and a recent visit to a controversial war shrine. The international community, Liu warned, should remain on a \u201chigh alert\u201d. Relations between China and Japan \u2013 which enjoy expansive trade ties \u2013 have reached their lowest point in decades over competing claims to the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea, which are administered by Japan but also claimed by China, where the islets are known as the Diaoyu. Tensions increased towards the end of last year when China declared an air-defence identification zone in an area of the East China Sea that includes the Senkakus. Soon after Japan unveiled an ambitious five-year defence plan that included the purchase of amphibious assault vehicles and unmanned spy drones that would be used to defend and, if necessary, retake outlying Japanese islands. Japan raised its defence budget for the first time in 13 years last year, although officials in Tokyo point out that it remains about 1% of nominal GDP and pales next to China\u2019s huge rise in military spending over the past 20 years. Already testy relations between the world\u2019s second- and third-biggest economies deteriorated again last month when Abe marked his first year in office with a visit to the Yasukuni shrine. Many Chinese and South Koreans regard Yasukuni, in central Tokyo, as a potent symbol of Japanese militarism; among the 2.5 million Japanese war dead honoured there are several former leaders convicted of class-A war crimes by the Allies after the end of the war. In a combative column for the Telegraph in Britain, Liu said it was \u201cdeeply offensive to witness convicted war criminals being venerated\u201d. He continued: \u201cDeep down, paying this kind of homage reveals whether Japan is trustworthy. It raises serious questions about attitudes in Japan and its record of militarism, aggression and colonial rule.\u201d Japanese politicians\u2019 tributes to class-A war criminals cause particular offence in China, parts of which were ruled by Japan from the 1930s until the end of the war, and on the Korean peninsula, where Japan was a colonial power from 1910 to 1945. But Abe insisted he had \u201cno intention\u201d of hurting the feelings of the Chinese or South Korean people in paying his respects at Yasukuni. \u201cThere is criticism based on the misconception that this is an act to worship war criminals, but I visited Yasukuni shrine to report to the souls of the war dead on the progress made this year and to convey my resolve that people never again suffer the horrors of war,\u201d he said. \u201cI prayed to pay respect for the war dead who sacrificed their precious lives and hoped that they rest in peace. Unfortunately a Yasukuni visit has largely turned into a political and diplomatic issue. I have no intention to neglect the feelings of the people in China and South Korea.\u201d In comments that were scathing even by Chinese standards, Liu said Abe had shown \u201cflagrant disregard\u201d for his Asian neighbours and the Yasukuni pilgrimage had spoken volumes about his intentions for the region. \u201cIt is a choice between aggression and non-aggression, between good and evil and between light and dark,\u201d Liu wrote. \u201cRegrettably what Mr Abe did has raised the spectre of militarism rising again in Japan.\u201d He added: \u201cThe other option is to deny past aggression, allow militarism to rise and raise the threat of war. Unfortunately Mr Abe\u2019s actions confirm that he favours the second option: he seems determined to lead Japan on to a perilous path. The international community should be on high alert.\u201d Attempts to arrange official talks between Abe and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, have made no progress. Officials close to the Japanese prime minister concede privately that, for now, a summit is off the agenda. Attempts to arrange talks between Abe and the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, have also proved futile. Officials in Beijing have said Abe is \u201cnot welcome\u201d in China following his visit to Yasukuni. The Japanese leader had \u201cfully exposed his hypocrisy by saying that he pays attention to the development of the relationship with China and is hoping to carry out dialogue with Chinese leaders\u201d, foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said. \u201cIn fact Abe himself closes a door of dialogue with Chinese leaders.

Xu Shuaijun, a 35-year-old cook from northern China&apos;s Hebei province, departed from coastal Fujian province on Wednesday and flew for nearly seven- and-a-half hours before his balloon hit turbulence and suffered a mechanical breakdown. According to the Japanese coastguard, he crashed about 14 miles (22km) from the uninhabited islands, called the Diaoyu by China and the Senkaku by Japan. Soon afterwards Taiwanese officials received a missing person report and relayed it to the Japanese coastguard, which rescued him by helicopter and handed him over to a Chinese patrol ship. &quot;The Chinese vessel thanked the coastguard via radio for the rescue operation,&quot; according to the Japan Times. China and Japan&apos;s competing claims to the islands stretch back decades, but the dispute has repeatedly veered perilously close to armed conflict since 2012, when the Japanese government purchased the islands from a private owner.     Balloon crash    China has stepped up maritime patrols in the waters surrounding the islands; perceived intrusions into the disputed territory are common and both sides have scrambled fighter jets in response. Diplomatic relations between the world&apos;s second- and third-largest economies have soured further in recent weeks, after China unilaterally declared an air-defence identification zone over a large swath of the East China Sea, essentially laying administrative claim to the airspace over the islands. Last Thursday the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, visited Yasukuni, a controversial shrine in Tokyo honouring the country&apos;s war dead including several former Japanese leaders convicted of war crimes. The visit led Chinese leaders to declare Abe persona non grata and freezing top-level diplomatic ties.

His profile picture on Sina Weibo, the country&apos;s most popular microblog site, shows a thin, bespectacled man wearing a grey and blue sweater and a leather jacket. &quot;I&apos;ve returned safely, thank you all for your concern,&quot; Xu posted to his Weibo page on Thursday morning.

He described his voyage as the &quot;hardest flight in history&quot;, involving -40C temperatures and insufficient oxygen. According to his calculations, his target islet was 223 miles from the Chinese coast and, at only 150 metres wide, just a speck of land in the freezing open water of the East China Sea. Nationalist activists from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan have repeatedly tried to land on the disputed islands in recent years. In August 2012 Japanese coastguards arrested eight Chinese activists who sailed to an island from Hong Kong and planted a flag on its shore.

The soldiers whose service is honoured at the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo \u2013 peasant boys and shopkeepers&apos; sons as well as Samurai generals \u2013 died trying to make that idea a reality. Just as the young communist fighters remembered at the Museum of the War of Chinese People&apos;s Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in Beijing died defending their country&apos;s interests. No easy symmetry is intended here. The Japanese were indeed the aggressors and the atrocities for which they were responsible are well known. Yet Chinese self-defence did not stop when the country&apos;s core territory was secure, but went on, over the years since the second world war, to seek to resume control over every scrap of land to which the Chinese empire had ever laid claim. Absolutist notions of what national power should mean have, in other words, not gone away. Attenuated they may be, but they are still not without risk. Thus China&apos;s expressions of outrage over the visit to the Yasukuni shrine by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe have some justification, given the historical record, but they also show China at its most unrelenting. The Chinese speak of provocation, but do not mention that represented by their own military concentration around the islands over which the two countries have been quarrelling. They express anger about plans to increase Japan&apos;s defence capacity and remove restrictions on the use of its military forces, but are not able to see the recent sea trials of their own new aircraft carrier in the same light. There is on both sides, but particularly on the Chinese side, a reluctance to grasp that the insecurities of their countries spring out of the same historical context, and that the solution is to abandon absolutist ideas about who should control eastern Asia and its waters, ideas which by their nature are irreconcilable."}, {"sentences": ["In a similar vein, Tokyo&apos;s DJ Krush makes boom-bap hip-hop instrumentals that could have come from DJ Premier."], "tags": ["Clubbing", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-04T06:00:00Z", "title": "Clubs picks of the week", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/04/clubs-picks-of-the-week", "article": "Stop Making Sense, Manchester It&apos;s difficult to find much of note going down on Britain&apos;s dancefloors through the notoriously tepid, post-Christmas slump of January when music lovers tend to focus more on box sets than bangers.

The Australian government has been urged to lodge a formal protest with Japan after activists said they chased the Japanese whaling fleet from a designated whale sanctuary in the Southern Ocean. Anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd said three of its vessels chased Japanese boats from the area. Sea Shepherd also released video footage that appears to show the butchering of four minke whales on the deck of Japanese factory ship Nisshin Maru. The Greens party said the prime minister, Tony Abbott, should raise the issue of whaling directly with the Japanese government. \u201cAfter six years of rhetoric from [environment minister] Greg Hunt calling on the previous government to stop the blood in the water in the Southern Ocean, it is time for him to act,\u201d Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said. \u201cGreg Hunt must immediately walk into Tony Abbott\u2019s office and get him to call the prime minister of Japan and issue a protest on behalf of the Australian people.\u201d Whish-Wilson said Hunt and Abbott should decide if they \u201cstand on the side of the Australian people or on the side of whale murderers\u201d. The Sea Shepherd fleet \u2013 which includes the vessels the Steve Irwin, the Bob Barker and the Sam Simon \u2013 engaged the Japanese fleet of five ships for the first time during the current whaling season on Sunday. The whaling boats were operating within the whale sanctuary in New Zealand\u2019s territorial waters, located in the Ross Sea in Antarctica, according to Sea Shepherd. Conservationists argue that Australia should enforce its own Antarctic territory by cracking down on whaling, which has been deemed unlawful by the federal court. However, only four nations \u2013 which do not include Japan \u2013 recognise Australia\u2019s claim to Antarctic land and sea territory. Video shot by Sea Shepherd aircraft appears to show three minke whales loaded onto the deck of the Nisshin Maru. Activists say a fourth whale was being cut apart at the time of the filming, with crew members seen mopping up large pools of blood on the deck. Sea Shepherd said the Japanese fleet fled out of the whale sanctuary without violent confrontation. There was no sign of either the HMNZS Otago, which is patrolling New Zealand\u2019s southern waters during whaling season, nor the Australian government aircraft, which was put forward by environment minister Greg Hunt in lieu of the customs vessel he promised before the election. Hunt\u2019s department said it would not discuss the activities of the aircraft for \u201coperational security purposes\u201d but said patrols would be based on \u201congoing assessments\u201d of maritime security threats. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the masters of all vessels operating in the Southern Ocean during the 2013-14 whaling season to ensure that the safety of human life at sea is not endangered,\u201d a Department of Environment spokeswoman said. \u201cWhile the Australian government is committed to meeting its obligations under the Safety of Life at Sea [Solas] convention, the area of the Southern Ocean where this activity takes place is remote. In a Solas incident it could take days for a vessel to travel to the location where assistance is required. \u201cAustralia unreservedly condemns any dangerous, reckless or unlawful behaviour, whether in the Southern Ocean or elsewhere.\u201d Asked what an aircraft could do to deter illegal fishing in Australian-claimed waters or prevent the loss of life during clashes between protestors and whalers, the spokeswoman said: \u201cIt is the responsibility of the masters of all vessels operating in the Southern Ocean during the 2013-14 whaling season to ensure that the safety of human life at sea is not endangered. \u201cAny further course of action by Australia would occur in accordance with the international and domestic laws applicable to the specific circumstances of the incident.&quot; Jeff Hansen, the managing director of Sea Shepherd Australia, told Guardian Australia that the Japanese fleet was \u201con the run\u201d. \u201cWe are keeping on their tail and they aren\u2019t whaling at the moment so we\u2019re happy about that, at least,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no need for confrontation, the number one priority is the protection of whales.\u201d Hansen said the minke whales killed could include some that were tagged by Australian scientists last year to measure their progress from the Great Barrier Reef down the east coast to Victoria. \u201cWe are disappointed but not surprised we didn\u2019t see any other vessel from Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cIn opposition, political parties say they will have the guts to stand up to the whalers, but when it comes to it we are the only ones who do. They just don\u2019t want to do it. \u201cThere\u2019s an Australian federal court order banning the slaughter of whales. The government doesn\u2019t want to see the whalers breaking the law and have to arrest them. They just don\u2019t want the headache with Tokyo, simple as that.\u201d Hansen said the aerial monitoring was a \u201cwaste of taxpayer money\u201d, adding that he had already sent images and video to Hunt to show what the Japanese fleet had been doing.

One is to seek dialogue, and abide by the rule of law. The other is to play the role of Voldemort in the region by letting loose the evil of an arms race and escalation of tensions, although Japan will not escalate the situation from its side. &quot;The answer seems obvious. Although China has so far refused to enable dialogue between our leaders, I sincerely hope that it will come forward, rather than keep invoking the ghost of militarism of seven decades ago, which no longer exists.&quot; Hayashi&apos;s broadside, made in response to a scathing op-ed in the same newspaper by his Chinese counterpart in London, Liu Xiaoming, was published as Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, called for dialogue with the leaders of China and South Korea. Abe angered Japan&apos;s neighbours last month with a visit to a controversial shrine that honours the country&apos;s war dead, including several former leaders convicted of war crimes. To many Chinese and South Koreans, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a potent symbol of Japanese militarism; pilgrimages by politicians are seen as evidence that Japan has yet to atone for its wartime conduct on the Asian mainland. While there is little prospect of summit talks, Abe said he wanted to explain the reasons behind his visit to the shrine to Chinese leader Xi Jinping and South Korean president Park Geun-hye. &quot;Seeking dialogue with China and South Korea is extremely important for the peace and security of this region,&quot; Abe told reporters on Monday. &quot;I would like to explain my true intentions regarding my visit to Yasukuni. There aren&apos;t any direct approaches being made to set up such meetings at present, but the door for dialogue is always open. I would like to hold Japan-China and Japan-South Korea summit meetings. &quot;I am sure that I will be able to obtain the understanding of nearby nations about my administration&apos;s pursuit of peace if I explain it thoroughly.&quot; Abe insisted that he did not visit Yasukuni to honour war criminals or to promote militarism, but to remember the 2.5 million Japanese war dead and to reaffirm his determination that Japan should never again go to war. His explanation did nothing to calm tempers in Beijing, whose envoy to London accused Abe of &quot;raising the spectre of militarism&quot; and putting the world on a &quot;perilous path&quot;.

Opium farming in Afghanistan, the world&apos;s main producer of the drug, hit a record high last year, with farmers harvesting a crop worth nearly $1bn (\u00a3610m) to them, and far more to the traffickers who take about four-fifths of the profit. There are no miracle cures. A transformation of the corrupt economy could take up to two decades, and opium production is likely to climb beyond 2013&apos;s worrying levels before it falls again, said Jean-Luc Lemahieu, outgoing head of the UN office on drugs and crime in Afghanistan. But he still sees cause for hope in the transformation of the narcotics police into a disciplined and relatively well respected force, an increase in treatment for Afghan addicts, and the government&apos;s recent crackdown on powerful officials linked to the drugs trade including the arrest of a top police officer. &quot;If no appropriate action is taken, then Afghanistan runs the risk of becoming a fragmented criminal state, ruled by an illicit economy,&quot; Lemahieu told the Guardian after five years grappling with Afghanistan&apos;s narcotics problem, as well as interlinked issues from government corruption to other criminal enterprises like illegal logging. &quot;It is not too late, but we need to act decisively.&quot; Feverish concerns about the future are helping keep prices high despite a glut. Negotiations over a deal to keep US forces here after 2014 have been stalled by tensions between Kabul and Washington, and no one knows who will be running the country after a presidential poll set for April, which the incumbent President Hamid Karzai is barred from contesting. &quot;At this moment there is more opium being produced in Afghanistan than is required for the outside market,&quot; Lemahieu said. &quot;It is domestic speculation coping with uncertain times and compensating for declining international money flows within the country.&quot; The cash is vital for all the officials and their supporters counting on the drugs for unorthodox campaign finance during presidential elections this year and parliamentary ones in 2015. When those are over, and there is more certainty about what Afghanistan might look like after foreign troops have left and Karzai has been replaced, prices may finally start to come down to levels justified by demand, he said. But the trade will not end even with prices at half current levels, until the international community reverses years of neglect and marginalisation and treats counter-narcotics as a problem that runs across all development efforts. &quot;The security agenda and short-term ideas of success didn&apos;t go well with the ideas of counter-narcotics work,&quot; Lemaheiu said, pointing out that in some areas the military event blocked counter-narcotics efforts, worried that they could alienate local power brokers or drive farmers into the arms of insurgents. &quot;For the international military, counter-narcotics went against their aim of winning hearts and minds,&quot; he added. The drugs trade ties together the Taliban and many of the corrupt officials inside Afghanistan, whose bank accounts were swollen by the tide of western dollars poured into efforts to pacify and rebuild the country. As foreign cash dries up on the back of the troop withdrawal, businessmen and the officials they paid off are looking for other sources of cash. The government recently arrested the police chief of western Nimroz province on suspicion of ties to the drug trade; a long and porous border with Iran makes the sparsely populated desert province one of the main smuggling routes out of the country. The Taliban are also more reliant on poppies for financing than ever before, as conflict in the Middle East sucks away some of the donations from rich sympathisers that once poured into their coffers. &quot;Not all in the Taliban are happy about the drug business, but undeniably too many of them are involved. Not all connected to the government applaud the corruption and the drug business, but no doubt too many have their hands in the pot,&quot; Lemahieu said. &quot;And the ones who are involved on both sides know each others&apos; phone numbers, they find each other.&quot; Despite opium&apos;s duel role fuelling the insurgency and a large portion of much-resented government corruption, poppy eradication still does not feature on a list of national priorities drawn up by Kabul. Major donors show little more interest; counter-narcotics is barely mentioned in a pact detailing aid priorities for the government and its backers over the next decade that was drawn up in Tokyo two years ago. &quot;We have to understand that doing nothing on the illicit economy will defeat the security and development agendas,&quot; Lemahieu said. &quot;If the governance system would work properly, then external threats might be easier to cope with.&quot; Change must involve slow work with communities that grow opium, offering them improvements in quality of life to compensate for the drop-off in income that is an inevitable result of ending drug production, said Lemahieu, who helped coordinate a successful reduction in opium cultivation in Burma before moving to Afghanistan. No other crop can match the financial returns from poppies, but in a possible sign that development and curbing the trade are linked, far more children are in school in areas where there is no poppy than in farming communities that cultivate the drug. &quot;If you can work on other factors you can prepare a community to have less income but still a similar or better quality of life: access to agricultural services and markets, food security, other income within the extended family, clinics, schools, irrigation,&quot; Lemaheiu said. However any change will be slow, not least because of the impact of ending opium cultivation on rural jobs. The crop employs five times as many people as wheat farming, in a country with hundreds of thousands of young people flooding out of school to look for jobs each year. &quot;We need to be persistent. Political courage is required and supporting those who want to make a change \u2026 understanding that real solutions are feasible,&quot; Lemahieu said. &quot;Yet if one moves too fast, in the belief that fast-track immediate solutions are within reach, one may end up doing more harm than good. One cannot pull the rug from under an employment market that already has to absorb up to half a million new entrants each year.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 6 January to include updated quotes after an editing error"}, {"sentences": ["Each January for the last several, we have celebrated the New Year with unlimited excess\u2014not only the gluttonous, gammony kind, but the excess which heralds the year&apos;s first auction of a gargantuan bluefin tuna at the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo, Japan."], "tags": ["Environment"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-06T10:33:00Z", "title": "Why bluefin tuna have no 'fair' price", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2014/jan/06/pacific-bluefin-tuna-auction-overfishing-sushi", "article": "Each January for the last several, we have celebrated the New Year with unlimited excess\u2014not only the gluttonous, gammony kind, but the excess which heralds the year&apos;s first auction of a gargantuan bluefin tuna at the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo, Japan.

Either way, as before, this particular price reflects nothing about the conservation status of Pacific bluefin tuna\u2014a population that was found recently to have dropped to less than four percent of its unfished levels\u2014because the auction is too separated from reality to ever function as a yardstick.  Last year, the auction came under critical fire for attaching the excessive price tag to the prize tuna, as conservation groups drew attention to the danger of heightening demand for a creature that is already being overfished. But this latest number, so dramatically lowered, cannot be used to quell fears. The wildly fluctuating price demonstrates only that the auction is subjective and distorted, dictated almost entirely by the bidders&apos; wealth and whims. And even despite this dramatic dip in price, which inches the fish a little closer to its actual market value, conservationists say it cannot begin to reflect the priceless nature of the fish population overall. So how are we to feel about someone slapping a strip of otoro\u2014the bluefin tuna&apos;s most prized belly meat\u2014on a plate and serving it to a few thousand lucky sushi connoisseurs? &quot;We don&apos;t talk about whether you should eat it or not, we talk about whether it&apos;s overfished or not,&quot; says Sarah Shoffler, fishery biologist and coordinator for the US delegation to the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC). This was the organisation that showed in January last year that Pacific bluefin tuna populations have dropped 96.4% from their unfished levels, with a striking 90% of the catch made up of younger, smaller specimens that might not yet have reproduced.  These findings focused the limelight on two international bodies that have the power to regulate the fishery of this species across the Pacific, one of which, called the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, includes members like the United States, and Japan, the world&apos;s largest consumer of Pacific bluefin tuna. Yet the two organizations&apos; 2013 policy response to the ISC&apos;s ominous report was weak, says Amanda Nickson, director of Global Tuna Conservation at the Pew Charitable Trusts. &quot;They both failed [last] year to decrease the catch from current levels,&quot; she says.  The Pacific bluefin is a highly productive fish. &quot;Spawning females can put out millions of eggs each year,&quot; Shoffler says. Currently, scientists have no evidence that this so-called &apos;recruitment&apos; of new fish generations has reduced. However, there&apos;s no doubt that the tuna can be classified as overfished, based on its massive overall population dip. &quot;It&apos;s not just that they&apos;re catching the small [younger] fish, it&apos;s that they&apos;re catching so many of them&quot;\u2014and have been doing this for so long\u2014that is a cause for concern, Shoffler explains.  For stocks to improve, Nickson lists an oft-repeated string of solutions. &quot;There should be a scientifically informed catch limit for this species, and there should be a minimum size limit,&quot; she says, adding that next on the conservation wish list is the establishment of an initial ten-year recovery plan for Pacific bluefin. But with the fish auction becoming such a firm annual fixture, all that is hard to imagine. &quot;There is no doubt that the ongoing demand for the bluefin tuna species is a major factor in challenges to managing the fishery,&quot; Nickson says. The mechanics of the auctions themselves are also subject to speculation, some reporters saying that they are not open bids, but rather prearranged sales that function more as a form of publicity for the market and the associated restaurants. And if the auctions are genuine, even this year&apos;s price is a dramatically elevated version of economic reality. Andrew David Thaler, a deep-sea biologist who wrote about the tuna auction, calculates that the actual market value of this year&apos;s fish would be closer to \u00a35,000.  The conservationist&apos;s reality is that no scenario can work. Inflate the price of bluefin tuna several fold, and you risk spurring demand to a threatening extent. Let the cost dip and fluctuate dramatically, and you create the impression that the price of the fish is purely an artefact, disassociated from the true value of depleted wild stocks. Yet year after year, driven by the value we randomly assign to handsome slabs of meat, the cogs are set in motion. In a way, this year&apos;s lowered price tag serves as a test of ethical resolve. We&apos;re supposed to grasp that everything about this auction scenario is unrepresentative, detached from the real world, and bizarre\u2014so much so that no one should really be eating this fish.  It&apos;s something that few like to hear\u2014especially about the foods we deem so central to our cultural refinement. But no matter how low bidders slip, bluefin tuna can, for now, have no &apos;fair price&apos; attached to its head."}, {"sentences": ["He caught public attention in France in 1989 when he took part in the Magiciens de la Terre show at the Pompidou Centre and La Villette, the first event of this sort to assert that there were artists in places other than New York, Berlin, Paris and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Art and design", "Culture", "Benin", "Africa", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-06T14:00:00Z", "title": "Benin blazes a trail for African modern art with opening of museum in Ouidah", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jan/06/contemporary-art-benin-ouidah-zinsou", "article": "A new museum of contemporary art opened in November 2013. This would hardly count as news in China or the United States, but this one is in Ouidah, Benin, and it is the first museum devoted to African contemporary art to open in sub-Saharan Africa outside of South Africa. These facts mean that the event takes on a different scale and significance. Artists born in Africa are finally making a name in the west, in galleries, and, more slowly, in France&apos;s museums. But until now there was no permanent venue for their exhibition in Africa itself. The credit for this initiative is due to the Fondation Zinsou, launched in 2005 by the Franco-Beninese financier Lionel Zinsou, 59. A graduate of the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris and the London School of Economics, he started his career as an adviser to Laurent Fabius, then prime minister of France, subsequently becoming a partner at the Rothschild bank. Since 2008 he has headed the investment fund PAI Partners. His foundation initially established itself in Cotonou, the largest city in Benin, and turned a well-placed, modern building into an exhibition centre that soon became a lively hub of education. Over the next eight years it welcomed 4 million visitors, starting with schoolchildren and followed by their parents. At the same time the foundation built up a collection of African art, past but above all contemporary. About a 10th of this trove now occupies the museum for its inaugural show. It is located in the historic city of Ouidah. A coastal town in the Abomey kingdom, it was one of the main ports of departure for the slave trade in the 16th and 17th century, which brought prosperity to its rulers. Several European powers, including France and Portugal, built forts here to protect their commercial interests. Also a religious centre, it has long been associated with Vodun \u2013 and subsequently voodoo \u2013 beliefs. Indeed some see it as their global capital. Following the defeat of King Behanzin and colonisation by the French, the town became a seat of local government. The past has left its mark on the landscape and architecture, including the museum, which has taken over the Villa Ajavon, a fine example of the Afro-Brazilian style built in 1922. The term refers to the return to Benin of Brazilian descendants of slaves, who imported the idea of villas with a pagoda roof, opening on to the outside and with a very high ceiling to catch the breeze and make the heat more bearable. It took a year to renovate the Villa Ajavon, which was in poor repair, and turn it into a museum up to contemporary standards. Works by 14 artists are currently on show, with plans for regular changes drawing on the foundation&apos;s reserves. Two generations appear side-by-side for the opening exhibition. Among the former group, which won international recognition more than 20 years ago, are the Ivorian artist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bruly Bouabr\u00e9 (born 1923), known for his drawings depicting myths and fables, the Malian photographer Seydou Keita (born 1921), his colleague and compatriot Malick Sidib\u00e9 (born 1935) and the Beninese painter and sculptor, Cyprien Tokoudagba (born 1939). Tokoudagba, who died in 2012, is well represented at Ouidah, with several spectacular large, multicoloured sculptures recalling Vodun myths in the streets of the town or its sacred forest. He caught public attention in France in 1989 when he took part in the Magiciens de la Terre show at the Pompidou Centre and La Villette, the first event of this sort to assert that there were artists in places other than New York, Berlin, Paris and Tokyo. It also featured Bouabr\u00e9&apos;s works. Since then all of the above have been invited to gatherings worldwide, from the Venice Biennale to its S\u00e3o Paulo counterpart, through Dakar. The museum has set aside a substantial amount of space for these &quot;founding&quot; artists. The second generation emerged in the 1960s. Three Beninese artists \u2013 Aston, Kifouli Dossou and Romuald Hazoum\u00e9 \u2013 are joined by the Congolese painter Ch\u00e9ri Samba, the Cameroonian photographer Samuel Fosso and the Senegalese painter and sketcher Soly Ciss\u00e9. Most are known internationally. Hazoum\u00e9&apos;s photographs and jerry-can masks have appeared in museums and books worldwide, much as Samba&apos;s canvases and Fosso&apos;s cruelly burlesque pictures. They share two key characteristics, which work together: the sharpness of their social and political criticism, and their decision to work in Africa, unlike their fellows who have opted to settle in Britain, France or Belgium. The spectacle that confronts them day after day \u2013 crime, poverty, corruption, disease and the memory of slavery \u2013 leaves an explicit or coded mark on their work. Aston, for instance, has created an allegorical installation, Solution Finale (final solution), made of cigarette butts, matches and lighters. Also apparent in many of the works is the complex relationship between contemporary artists and traditional art forms, giving rise to copying but also ridicule and diversion. They all know that African art was long seen as primitive in the west. Hazoum\u00e9&apos;s pseudo-masks play subtly on this idea. Dossou&apos;s masks do too, but in a quite different way. An astoundingly gifted sculptor, he has reworked an ancient model, the Guelede mask which belongs to Yoruba and Nora tradition. The head proper is topped by an often elaborate crest, but Dossou brings in scenes from everyday life such as road accidents, gangsters settling scores and farming. The wooden figures are painted in bright colours. Seen at a distance they look pretty, but closer up they reveal their crude realism. The foundation exhibited these sculptures in Cotonou in 2011. It is now showing paintings by G\u00e9rard Quenum, a Beninese artist born in 1971 previously known for his sculptures \u2013 assemblages made using discarded European dolls. These are remarkable works, but so are his recent paintings, taking stark black-and-white purism to new extremes. Quenum started painting after the Jean-Michel Basquiat retrospective, staged in 2008, and will feature in the museum&apos;s next show. His career sums up the important role the two establishments are playing raising awareness and disseminating contemporary art in Africa.

Democratic institutions such as those in the US and most western political systems are designed to prevent maverick leaders from exercising untrammelled power through the checks and balances of the parliamentary system. As long as the parliament does its job properly, this works OK, but if it becomes dysfunctional or corrupted, there is no way that the leader can override it. If subsequent elections fail to produce a government that works any better, radicalisation often occurs and the most extreme form of this is a military coup. This usually leads to even worse consequences, as we have seen in Chile, Greece, Egypt and others over the last century; in fact, the only beneficial military coup in this period was that led by Ataturk almost 100 years ago. Most of the blame for our current woes is being directed at the leaders in both Australia and US, but I suggest that both our parliamentary systems are in very poor shape and should carry the major responsibility for our problems. Evolution works through both gradual adaptation and through traumatic cataclysm. Let&apos;s hope we have the sense to develop our institutions of government through the former rather than have to suffer the latter.David BarkerBunbury, Western Australia Dangers of surveillance Alan Rusbridger&apos;s missive Inside the surveillance state (20 December) fills one with despair for the English-speaking Christian countries that comprise the total surveillance states: namely, the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It took 800 years from the date of the Magna Carta to the present for democratic principles based on the freedom of the individual to grow and mature among the same people. It is a great irony that the creators of democracy have become its executioners. Until the collapse of the Soviet Union, visitors to that country came back with scare stories of how the KGB was following them continuously, watching and noting down their utterances and activities. Now our governments have CCTV cameras, telephones, internet and emails to do the same job with meticulous efficiency, without causing us any concern or pain. When a country loses its self-confidence, no matter how powerful it may be, it resorts to total surveillance, as with the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany in the past. Who thought that surveillance was the harbinger of destruction for those political systems at their height of power? The total surveillance state that our political leaders have created with the intention of safeguarding our freedom and security brings to mind a verse from the Hindu holy book, the Bhagavad Gita: I have become death, the destroyer of worlds.Bill MathewMelbourne, Australia Tensions in east Asia Your coverage of the current situation in the East China Sea (Escalating tensions leave Japan depending on US support more than ever, 6 December, and Unapologetic Japan squares up to China, 13 December) downplays a few important points that may affect the outcome. First, it is worth remembering that the current escalation really began when Shintaro Ishihara, then governor of Tokyo, now co-leader of the Japan Restoration party, bounced the previous government into buying the Senkakus from their private owner. As such, the current situation is as much down to the behaviour of the slow-witted nationalists now running Japan as it is to Chinese &quot;aggression&quot;. Second, when China established its Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ), all airlines in the region complied with the Chinese demand to file flight plans and to identify all aircraft to Chinese military air traffic control. A week after the ADIZ was imposed, the Japanese government instructed Japan&apos;s major carriers to cease filing flight plans and to tell their pilots to cease identifying their flights to the Chinese authorities. Given the tensions in this region, such action represents the height of irresponsibility, as airline passengers may be used as guinea pigs to test Chinese intentions. The real risk factor here is conflict starting by accident. The danger is the hot-shot Chinese fighter pilot, a little hung-over, having a bad day, and then sent to intercept an &quot;unidentified&quot; aircraft leaving Japanese airspace. Should such a tragedy befall a Japanese commercial flight in the present era of tension, I have little faith in the Japanese government&apos;s ability, or even intention, to contain the situation.David LayfieldOkinawa, Japan Hungarians are not extremists If Andr\u00e1s Schiff is that worried about the imminent resurgence of fascism in Hungary (20 December) why doesn&apos;t he come home and get his hands dirty? The answer perhaps, is that there is no prospect of one actually occurring. Yes, there is Jobbik, recently down from 16% to 13% in the Tarki poll, and yes, Jobbik thugs occasionally do nasty, stupid things in public. But one wonders what public soul-searching of the kind Schiff proposes would actually achieve \u2013 apart from giving a heady dash of oxygen to the fascists. In fact one could argue that Viktor Orb\u00e1n&apos;s current policy of letting them self-combust is actually proving quite successful. Hungary has its problems: near-starvation in some rural areas, little prospect of a quick escape from its economic straitjacket and the absence of a credible opposition. But its long-suffering people are resigned and, some might say, overly tolerant, not extremist.David NorthNagykov\u00e1csi, Hungary The dilemma of austerity Austerity is never a popular word and stimulating an economy in recession with easy monetary policy and fiscal deficits is usually good economic policy (US takes a welcome step away from austerity, 20 December). Unfortunately, the resulting increase in the public debt is not always possible because, in many cases, this debt is already considered to be too high by the financial sector. As a result, further borrowing may become impossible or so costly that it becomes too much of a burden, as Greece, Italy and a few other countries have discovered. Many governments face a dilemma between increasing their deficits to stimulate growth and reducing their debt to avoid the dangerous risk of insolvency. Harry Stein is mistaken when he suggests that the choice is between austerity and economic growth. The reality is that some countries have no choice but to follow austerity. Stein is right to suggest that tax changes would have been better than sequestration to reduce both government expenses and the public debt, but his claim that sequestration caused terrible damage in 2013 is exaggerated, at least at the global level. The reality is that the US economy has performed better than the year before and unemployment has declined. Admittedly, the recovery has been weaker than in previous cases but the recession was also sharper. In fact, the real surprise has been the very limited impact of these blunt austerity measures on the global US economy in 2013.Francois P JeanjeanOttawa, Canada Tensions in Singapore Your report on rioting arising from tension between Singaporeans and migrant workers in the city&apos;s Little India district is a reminder that we need to understand the way in which class and ethnicity interact with one another as part of the social dynamic making Singapore what it is today (13 December). Beneath the surface of Singapore&apos;s authoritarian democracy is, and always has been, a measure of social tension, which came to the surface [through race riots] in 1964 and which, like the current disturbance, had a class as well as a communal dimension. It is in large measure in response to this mostly subterranean tension that Singapore&apos;s national unity has always relied on a high degree of state coercion to hold its society together. That tension, and the state coercion that holds it in check, is reflected in the city&apos;s ill-fated Speakers&apos; Corner in Hong Lim Park. That spacious and very well-organised speaking venue, modelled on the London equivalent in Hyde Park, has no speakers because its potential orators are too afraid of arrest. Class and race are, in effect, among the proscribed topics for discussion at this venue because they are, perhaps understandably given what happened in 1964, considered too destabilising.Terry HewtonAdelaide, South Australia Briefly \u2022 The &quot;newly discovered gas&quot; that is more than &quot;7,000 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at warming the Earth&quot; (Dispatches, 20 December) certainly deserves to be monitored closely. It becomes a little less scary, though, when you consider that it is actually a liquid, not a gas: Perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA) has a boiling point of 178C at atmospheric pressure, which should make it relatively easy to contain the substance in a closed system. Moreover, a rough estimate based on the figure of 7,000 and established chemical calculations leads me to conclude that one gram of PFTBA released into the atmosphere is equivalent in destructive potential to the carbon dioxide that results from burning around 250ml of petrol \u2013 or from driving an average car for about 8km.Egbert von SteuberLingen, Germany \u2022 That Claire Armitstead should have characterised Dogmatix as &quot;evil-tempered&quot; may be a bit unfair to the cuddly and mild-mannered mascot (3 January). Only under the influence of a wee drop of potion does he transmogrify to unleash his inner beserker \u2013 reminiscent of the Hulk&apos;s rage. And like the latter he swells his girth (or maybe just puffs himself up) and rampages in dogged pursuit of Roman popinjays.R M FranssonDenver, Colorado, US \u2022 I enjoyed Ian Jack&apos;s article on the coverage of the (undoubtedly great) man&apos;s death (20 December).

All this at 7am on a bank holiday. Meanwhile, in homes across the country, millions are tuning in for the start of two days of wall-to-wall television coverage of what can genuinely stake a claim to be the greatest race on Earth: the Hakone Ekiden. With a 30% TV audience share over two days, this long-distance relay race, 200km long and featuring 23 university teams all from one region, is Japan&apos;s biggest sporting event of the year. Nike, Mizuno, Oakley and other sports companies all release special Hakone-branded products, while for months I&apos;ve been receiving Hakone junk mail through my door in Japan, selling me everything from Hakone towels to jackets. This is big business. At the centre of it all, with 90 years of the race&apos;s history breathing down their necks, are 23 teams of 10 students aged between 18 and 22. It&apos;s a big responsibility, but once the starting pistol goes, they rise to the challenge with some brilliant racing. The course starts in central Tokyo and runs out of the city, up the mountains to the foot of Mount Fuji. The next day, it turns around and runs back again. All of the 10 stages are very close to a half marathon in distance, and over the two days an incredible 30 students run a half-marathon equivalent time of under 63 minutes \u2013 and that&apos;s excluding the times on the race&apos;s fastest sixth stage, which is mostly downhill. For comparison, among British runners, only one man ran a half marathon in under 63 minutes in the whole of 2013, and that was Mo Farah. One reason the race is so compelling is because the whole dynamic changes every time the teams hand over the baton \u2013 or as they are called in ekiden, the tasuki. A team that was trailing finds its star man on top form and suddenly it&apos;s back in the race. Or a runner starting with a big lead falters, the chasers hunt him down, and it&apos;s game on again. It&apos;s like someone takes the race at every changeover and gives it a big shake, before settling it down again to see what happens. The lead ebbs and flows, but in the end, the 2014 winners are Toyo University, spurred on by their twin-brother stars Yuta and Keita Shitara, who both win their stages just short of course records. After the race, crowds of fans, mostly young women, gather to catch a glimpse of their heroes. When one of the Shintara twins bashfully stops so they can take his picture, they scream with excitement. I see at least one fan crying. I ask her what she likes so much about the Hakone Ekiden. &quot;It&apos;s so moving,&quot; she says, unable to say more. I have to agree. I leave feeling as though I&apos;ve witnessed something epic.

For the record, a team of North Korean basketball players were leading Dennis Rodman&apos;s band of ageing former NBA stars after the first two quarters of an exhibition game in Pyongyang, before the players divided into mixed teams for the second half in the spirit of friendship. There were suspicions the ex-NBA players would have thrown the match had it been a straight contest, both as a birthday gift to North Korea&apos;s leader, Kim Jong-un, and perhaps to spare their opponents from possible punishment for letting down the home side. But ever since Rodman and his 10-member All Star team arrived in Pyongyang this week, the real sport has been had off the basketball court. The visit, an exercise in what some have optimistically termed &quot;basketball diplomacy&quot;, has been marked by Rodman&apos;s ill-tempered, incoherent response to accusations that his presence lends legitimacy to a singularly brutal regime. One wonders what his host \u2013 reportedly a basketball fan since his days being expensively educated in Switzerland \u2013 made of the spectacle. In a strange echo of Marilyn Monroe&apos;s birthday tribute to JFK, Rodman serenaded Kim with a rendition of Happy Birthday, to wild applause \u2013 what else? \u2013 from the capacity crowd of 14,000, while the &quot;dear young general&quot;, his wife, Ri Sol-ju, and other senior figures in the regime watched from a special seating area. &quot;It started out as surreal, then people joined in and it sort of faded a bit, but it seemed pretty heartfelt from Rodman&apos;s side,&quot; Simon Cockerell, a tour guide who attended the game, told Reuters. &quot;It was unexpected, and probably unplanned. Kim Jong-un appeared to smile, but he didn&apos;t appear to expect it.&quot; Rodman, who described Kim as his &quot;best friend&quot;, went on to deliver &quot;a charmingly shambolic speech where he thanked Kim Jong-un and his wife for showing up, along with the other players for being brave enough to come with him and join in his engagement effort&quot;, Cockerell added. But how many candles were on Kim&apos;s cake? It says much about the world&apos;s curious relationship with the secretive North that for insights into its leader we must rely on Rodman, and for a detail as innocuous as his date of birth we must rely on his father&apos;s former sushi chef Kenji Fujimoto, who revealed in Tokyo last year that Kim was born on 8 January 1983 \u2013 making him 31 on Wednesday. What is quickly turning into a public relations nightmare for the irascible Rodman \u2013 whose fellow players looked like they would rather be anywhere but Pyongyang during his tetchy pre-game interview with CNN on Tuesday \u2013 can only have helped burnish Kim&apos;s reputation, at least at home. Now he can add being feted by household names in a sport beloved of his country&apos;s nemesis to a list of achievements over the past year that have horrified observers and induced grudging admiration. In late 2012 Kim reportedly became a father, possibly for a second time. There was no official word on the happy event, only speculation sparked by the sudden absence of his wife&apos;s swollen tummy at a public appearance on New Year&apos;s Day. In February Kim oversaw the North&apos;s third nuclear test, and then made threats to launch nuclear strikes against the US, South Korea and Japan. It was an orgy of calculated aggression intended to enhance his domestic standing and put pressure on a clearly rattled Washington. Last year ended with the disturbing news that Kim, possibly under pressure from other members of the North Korean elite, had had his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, arrested and executed for a long list of alleged crimes, including treason. Jang, whose fate was quickly confirmed in excruciating detail by the North&apos;s official news agency, KCNA, was commonly believed to be the regime&apos;s No 2, guiding Kim through his first two years in power. Kim&apos;s longevity as leader will surprise North Korea watchers who predicted a quick end to the third incarnation of the communist dynasty as he stood sobbing beside the corpse of his recently deceased father, Kim Jong-il, in December 2011. Two years on, Kim has assembled a seemingly impregnable coterie around him. Jang&apos;s absence, so the consensus view goes, will only enhance his position. As for Rodman, he is likely \u2013 as he predicted \u2013 to receive a cool welcome on his return to the US. He may yet achieve swift redemption in the eyes of the administration in Washington if his powerful friend reciprocates his show of goodwill by releasing Kenneth Bae, an American who has been detained in North Korea for 14 months. That gesture looks a near impossibility, though, after Rodman, despite his insistence that this was a strictly apolitical event, appeared to suggest that the missionary \u2013 sentenced to 15 years&apos; hard labour for &quot;crimes against the state&quot; \u2013 was to blame for his captivity. In Rodman&apos;s great cultural adventure in North Korea, the diplomatic gains, it seems, are all Kim&apos;s."}, {"sentences": ["A robot prepares to pick a ripe strawberry for a demonstration at an expo in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Farming", "Environment", "Technology", "Agriculture", "Science", "Robots", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-09T06:00:00Z", "title": "Robot farmers are the future of agriculture, says government", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/09/robots-farm-future", "article": "Will robot feet in near-future time walk upon England&apos;s mountains green?

Owen Paterson, the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, enthusiastically embraced the prospect at the Oxford Farming Conference this week, saying: &quot;I want our farmers and food producers to have access to the widest possible range of technologies, from new applications of robotics and sensor technology to new LED lighting in greenhouses and cancer-fighting broccoli.&quot; The government has set out for the first time an &quot;agri-tech&quot; strategy, with \u00a3160m in public funding. Of this cash, about \u00a370m will go to commercialising new agricultural technologies \u2013 including robots, and \u00a390m will be spent on setting up centres for agricultural innovation that will seek to develop farm technology for export, with the help of a new unit within UK Trade and Investment. There will even be a new &quot;agri-tech business ambassador&quot;, Paterson boasted, charged with driving forward exports of new technologies. It is not just on the ground that technology promises to transform farming. Unmanned air vehicles, or drones, are also coming into play on farms. In South America, with its vast ranches, drones are being used for the surveillance of widely dispersed herds and crop monitoring, and in Japan smaller models are programmed to spray pesticide on crops. In the US, there are experiments under way to use drones for surveillance and perhaps even herding.     A 'lettuce bot' is tested in Salinas, California. Photograph: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP    In the UK, there is likely to be less scope for drones \u2013 our farms are smaller and easier to manage on the ground, and the prospect of filling the sky with a profusion of small aircraft is likely to raise safety concerns. Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers Union, said technology had been key to raising farm productivity, and this would continue with more &quot;futuristic&quot; appliances such as robots. He pointed out that automated &quot;robotic&quot; milking machines are becoming increasingly common on large dairy farms. These can milk many cows at a time, sometimes on a revolving platform that lifts the cows to the milking station. Some research suggests this could be better for the cows and improve yield. Arable and vegetable farmers have also made great use of GPS for mapping their crops, he added, and monitoring yield, weed incidence and other vital data, leading to &quot;real rewards&quot;. Kendall said: &quot;The use of unmanned robots is rather more futuristic but people are working on it. As well as field operations, there is potential in fruit harvesting and even livestock management. It is certainly an exciting time to be involved in farming.&quot; But there is also scepticism over how likely it is that new robot technology will take off. Emma Hockridge, head of policy at the Soil Association, said: &quot;The potential use of robots on farms has been discussed for years, but we haven&apos;t yet seen anything practical close to reaching the market.&quot; While the prospect of replacing seasonal workers with robots may be attractive for farm bosses looking to consolidate into bigger units, farm workers may be less keen. Hockridge said the government and farmers should concentrate on the better use of existing technologies: &quot;In food and farming, which is now our biggest manufacturing industry, we think the priority should be creating more and good quality meaningful jobs. Organic farms provide almost 50% more jobs per hectare and over 30% more jobs than non-organic farms.&quot; Even enthusiasts for such technology acknowledge that the advanced robots now being drawn up will take years and probably decades to reach the commercial stage. Prof Simon Blackmore, head of engineering at Harper Adams University, told the Oxford conference on Wednesday that his vision was for &quot;farming with robots in 2050&quot;, by which time he believes this should be practical. Some may never catch on. Perhaps the oddest robot yet under development \u2013 and most unsettling for anyone attached to traditional farming practices \u2013 is the development of a robot for herding livestock. The bot wheels around pastures on remote control, drawing stragglers back to the herd, though without actually having to nip at their heels. Presumably the dogbot dreams of electric sheep.

Money, adulation and marketing are the key tenets of a well-planned, well-publicised pre-season visit. Sporting gains are usually far outweighed by financial ones. What, then, would the Premier League bean counters have made of Dallas Tornado, and their extraordinary world tour of 1967-68? Playing 32 games, across five continents and 26 countries over a seven-month period, Dallas, in just about every sense, took on the world. From Spain in August to Honduras in March, via Christmas in Tokyo and New Year in Manila, this was genuine football globetrotting. And long before it was fashionable, too. No product-placement, milking the market or &quot;expanding the brand&quot; here. Dallas&apos; journey saw them cheat death, Final Destination style, at the hands of Greek-Cypriot terrorists, visit Vietnam whilst war raged around them, and survive an on-pitch riot in Singapore. The football, at times, must have felt like a sideshow. Some sideshow, mind. During the tour, Tornado played in front of crowds of up to 50,000, and against sides of the calibre of Real Oviedo, Fenerbahce and the Japanese national team. &quot;An amazing trip that will never be repeated again,&quot; is how Bill Crosbie, one of the players involved, describes the tour. Even that hardly seems to do it justice. This was a plot worthy of Hollywood. Crosbie was a 19-year-old bus conductor when he answered an advert in the Liverpool Echo, looking for &quot;top-class amateur footballers&quot;. Soon afterwards, he was asked to attend an interview at the city&apos;s Adelphi Hotel. There, he found a man named Bob Kap. Serbian by birth, Kap \u2013 real name Bo\u017eidar Kapu\u0161to \u2013 had studied alongside Ferenc Puskas at the Hungarian national football academy, but was forced to flee Europe during the 1956 uprising. He moved to Toronto, Canada, where he worked briefly as a reporter for a local football magazine. His true passion, though, was always for coaching. So when Dallas, looking for someone to prepare a team for the inaugural North American Soccer League, came calling, he jumped at the chance. Kap used his contacts to recruit from across Europe. Eight of the touring side were English, and seven of those were Merseysiders. They were supplemented by five Norwegians, two Dutchmen, two Swedes and, improbably, just one American, Jay Moore. Crosbie remembers his initial meeting with Kap well: &quot;I was asked a lot of questions, about the amateur teams I had played for, how fast a runner I was, why I wanted to join his team, things like that.&quot; Flanking the coach was Dave Moorcroft, a local amateur player of some pedigree. Moorcroft had played for Skelmersdale United at Wembley in the FA Amateur Cup final, and would go on to play more than 100 times for Tranmere Rovers. &quot;He was there to vet the players,&quot; remembers Crosbie. &quot;I remember leaving thinking that was the last I would hear on that.&quot; He was wrong. A month later, a telegram arrived at his home, asking him to a second meeting, this time at the Regent Hotel. It was the message that would change his life. &quot;He asked me how much notice I would have to give at work,&quot; says Crosbie. &quot;I said two weeks, but in extreme circumstances one week. He told me if I wanted to join his team then I would have to fly to the South of France the following morning!&quot; Crosbie, who had he been on duty that night would have missed Kap&apos;s telegram, agreed, only to be told there was a further condition from his new manager. &quot;Bob told me that the next time he saw me, I had better have had a haircut!&quot; he remembers. &quot;My hair was shoulder-length at the time, very much like The Beatles, but Bob wanted an All American look, crew cuts for everyone. It had to go.&quot; Luckily, one of Crosbie&apos;s neighbours was a hairdresser, and so was summoned to an emergency 10pm appointment. Bill&apos;s brother was given a resignation letter to hand in to his bosses, and that was that. He was on the first train out of Lime Street the following morning. &quot;We did not have a phone, so I could not even contact my girlfriend to say goodbye!&quot; Crosbie laughs. Together with another Scouser, Bobby Roach, Crosbie flew to Nice to join up with the side. Tornado had already played five games by that point, visiting both Spain and Morocco. The last was a 4-0 defeat to Real Oviedo, then playing in the Segunda Division. With Crosbie and Bobby Roach on board, and with the players instructed to wear club suits complete with Stetson hats wherever they went, Dallas travelled to Istanbul, drawing 2-2 with the Turkish champions Fenerbahce, having led 2-0 at one stage, in front of a crowd of 25,000. Crosbie missed the game with a virus, which doctors believed was caused by undergoing too many injections within a short space of time. Their next game was to take place in Cyprus, though fate would rear its head before then. After a day sightseeing at the Acropolis, the team were delayed heading to the airport and missed their flight from Athens to Nicosia by half an hour. Lucky them. Flight BEA CY284 exploded at 29,000ft after a bomb was detonated under a seat, killing 63 people. Its intended target, the Greek army general Georgios Grivas, had also missed the flight, and later travelled to Nicosia on the same plane as the Tornado team. &quot;Missing that plane was the best thing we ever did,&quot; says Crosbie, with grim understatement. &quot;But that second flight was the longest two hours of my life!&quot; Two defeats in Cyprus, including one in 95 degree heat, were followed by a trip, via Beirut, to Tehran, where they took on an Iranian Air Force team containing seven internationals, losing 2-1. Draws with a Tehran Select XI and a Governors&apos; XI in Shiraz followed. Kap, though, was preparing to shake up his squad. Crosbie remembers: &quot;A new player called Graham Stirland had joined the tour in France. He was a winger, a fantastic player who was always getting back to help his fullback out. &quot;We arrived in Tehran for our next flight and Graham was asked to follow Frank Randorf, Bob Kap&apos;s assistant, to the toilets. Ten minutes later, Frank returned alone. When we asked where Graham was, we were told that Mr Kap did not think he was mixing with the other players and he was sent home to England. We were not even allowed to say goodbye and that was the last we saw of him.&quot; From Tehran, the squad embarked upon a mammoth tour of the Iranian mountains, taking in games in Rasht and Shahi, as well as three seven-hour coach journeys. With the squad preparing to leave Iran for Pakistan, the Norwegian defender Tom Weinholdt returned home to undergo knee surgery, reducing Kap&apos;s numbers to just 16, of which two were goalkeepers. Nonetheless, Tornado saw off the Pakistan national team 2-0 in front of 35,000 spectators in Karachi. The following day, in Lahore, a new Pakistani side gained revenge, winning the &apos;Second Test&apos; 4-2 in front of 25,000. Games in Lahore, Dhaka and Chittagong followed, before the side headed to India. &quot;We took a four-hour ride on a rickety old bus to the border,&quot; says Crosbie. &quot;Then when we got to the border, we had to take our suitcases off the bus and walk the last 400 yards. &quot;There were local rioters screaming and hurling abuse because the country we were walking to was India. We got through passport control and walked 400 yards to our next bus, and the people were laying garlands at our feet!&quot; To make matters worse, a number of non-Commonwealth players had been denied entry to India, and were forced to spend two days waiting for their visas in a run-down hotel near to the border. &quot;They told us the only thing they had to eat in those days was a small chicken,&quot; says Crosbie, whose British passport ensured he made it through without a hitch. Dallas played seven games in India, winning only one, before heading to Sri Lanka. Having lost two games against the national team, they were off to Burma but, typically, their journey was not without danger. &quot;We should have flown via Madras and Calcutta on the 25th of November,&quot; says Crosbie. &quot;But when we got to Calcutta there were political riots going on and all flights were cancelled. We had to hide in our hotel for two days, playing billiards and cards, and left on the 28th at 4am to sneak out of India.&quot; From Burma, and a defeat to the national team in front of 47,000, it was on to Singapore, and a hostile reception from locals angered at the arrival of &quot;Yankee Imperialists&quot;. That hostility extended from the stands to the pitch. Crosbie remembers: &quot;When one of our players, Per Larsen, fouled one of theirs, they started throwing stones and other things onto the pitch. Per then further annoyed them by bowing. We had to be escorted from the pitch and stayed in the dressing room for two hours after the game.&quot; A re-match the following day was, wisely, cancelled, and the team travelled to Jakarta for two games, before moving on to Saigon. This was a critical juncture in the Vietnam War. The Tet offensive, seen by many as the turning point of the conflict, began a month after Tornado&apos;s last game, a 2-2 draw with Club Saigon. &quot;We were well-protected, with a police escort from the airport to hotel,&quot; says Crosbie. &quot;But we were allowed to walk around Saigon on our own as sightseers!&quot; Despite a telling off from American Military Police for standing still on a Saigon street corner \u2013 a dangerous move with locals patrolling the area on scooters armed with hand grenades \u2013 Crosbie and the team left Vietnam unscathed and unbeaten, and travelled via Hong Kong to Taiwan, where they beat the national team in front of 43,000. Christmas was spent in Tokyo. The players were each given portable Panasonic radios as gifts from the management, and sampled the delights of sushi for the first time before losing 3-2 to Japan in Osaka on Boxing Day. They had already lost 2-1 in Tokyo&apos;s Olympic Stadium, used for the 1964 Games, on Christmas Eve. Next stop was Manila, and a 7-0 win over a Select XI on New Year&apos;s Day. A defeat to the Philippines National team followed, before an 18-hour journey to Australia for what was to be the home stretch of the tour. Nine games, spread across Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tahiti, saw a tiring team, minus the goalkeeper Odd Linberg who had returned home ill, win just three times. By the time they headed back to Dallas on 15 February, they were given two weeks to &quot;set up their lives&quot; ahead of the NASL season, before a four-game &quot;mini-tour&quot; of Central America. &quot;We were exhausted, both mentally and physically,&quot; says Crosbie, and his assessment would appear to have been spot on. Dallas lost their first league game 6-0 to Houston Stars, and won just four of their 32 NASL fixtures that season, losing 26. Their goal difference, minus 81, told its own story. Kap, unsurprisingly, was replaced by Keith Spurgeon early in the campaign. Crosbie, too, would depart early. Having snapped ankle ligaments in a game on a baseball pitch at St Louis, he would eventually leave the squad after playing just six matches. &quot;I enjoyed my time in the USA,&quot; he says. &quot;But my work Visa only allowed me to play soccer. This was the time of Vietnam, and foreign nationals who were not using their work visas could be drafted to the US army. The risk was too great, so I went back to England.&quot; Dallas would play a key role in the NASL until their dissolution in 1981. They were championship winners in 1971, and finished runners up two years later. The likes of Alex Stepney, Alan Hinton and the Liverpool duo Kevin Kewley and Brian Kettle would all represent the club at various points. Their World Tour, however, is easily the greatest, most incredible tale in their history. As Crosbie, who hopes to organise a reunion for the players next year, says, we will never see its kind again. Kap&apos;s legacy, meanwhile, remains. He is widely credited with changing the face of NFL by introducing &quot;soccer-style&quot; kickers to the game in the early 1970s. One of his recommendations, an Austrian named Toni Fritsch, was the first European-trained soccer player to play in the NFL, and Kap would directly introduce eight more in the next three years. Ever the innovator, Kap would attract headlines in 1978 when fronting a &quot;business syndicate&quot; that attempted to acquire the Argentine World Cup star Ricky Villa. The bid, audacious in the extreme, failed. Villa, along with Ossie Ardiles, moved to Tottenham instead. In later years, Kap would become an accomplished painter. Some of his work, Gridiron-themed, can be found in the NFL Hall of Fame building in Canton, Ohio. Kap died in his sleep in Ontario, Ottawa in March 2010, aged 87. His role in the Dallas Tornado World Tour, however, should ensure his place in football history is assured. You might not have heard of him until today, but nobody who went on that tour will ever forget Bob Kap. \u2022 A shorter version of this article appeared in the Liverpool Echo on December 20, 2013.

Speaking at Salford&apos;s Lowry Theatre, where War Horse is currently playing on its first UK tour, Hytner confirmed that he would continue his partnership with executive director Nick Starr, who leaves the NT later this year. &quot;I will make theatre for a new company that will, we hope, find new ways of making commercial theatre,&quot; he said. &quot;Plans are not finished and set in stone. I&apos;m going to continue working with Nick Starr and we will continue, we hope, to produce theatre in the commercial sector.&quot; Hytner and Starr&apos;s decade-long tenure at the National Theatre is widely seen as one of the most creative in the organisation&apos;s history. The pair pioneered initiatives such as the Travelex cheap ticket scheme and live broadcasts with NT Live. Last April, Hytner signaled signalled his intent to continue innovating, telling told the Guardian that he and Starr had no intentions to &quot;run something that already exists&quot;. He said: &quot;We want to create something and it will probably be in London. There are no jobs currently in existence that we covet.&quot; Their tenure at the NT has also yielded unprecedented financial success. In Hytner&apos;s first year in charge, the National generated an additional \u00a322.9m on top of its Arts Council grant. Last year, that figure stood at \u00a369.6m \u2013 more than \u00a350m of which came from the box office on National Theatre productions. Several of the projects programmed by Hytner, including War Horse and One Man, Two Guvnors, went on to significant success in the West End and abroad. Before taking the National&apos;s top job, Hytner had built a strong reputation in the commercial sector, with work in the West End including Miss Saigon, The Importance of Being Earnest and Alan Bennett&apos;s The Lady In the Van, which starred Maggie Smith. Hytner said he would not be just a director. &quot;I have too much of a taste for producing work that I don&apos;t direct, which of course is the bulk of my work at the National, and I want to continue doing that.&quot;,&quot; he said, adding that he believed live broadcasts would become a big part of theatre&apos;s future. &quot;It won&apos;t be very long before you in Manchester will be able to see not just work from the National but work from Broadway, work from Sydney, work from Tokyo, Berlin, Vienna, Paris,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m sure that&apos;s one of the things that is going to happen, because the technology will go on getting cheaper and the cinemas have discovered that their best source of income is special events.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["5) Three by three When the Olympics reach Tokyo in 2020, there may be a new sport on show: 3x3 basketball.", "Alexander Wolff has researched the new sport, and its chances of making a show in Tokyo, for Sports Illustrated."], "tags": ["Sport", "Football", "US sports", "Baseball", "Sir Alex Ferguson", "Manchester United", "NFL", "Tennis", "Basketball", "Muhammad Ali"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-10T16:19:45Z", "title": "From tennis talkers to street soccer: our favourite things online this week", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jan/10/tennis-talkers-street-soccer-favourite-things-online-ferguson", "article": "Thanks for all your comments and suggestions on our last blog. 1) The best of all games Arguing about which sports are better than others is a bit silly, but when one of the greatest minds of the last century has a stab at picking the best of all games, we should probably listen. John Rawls, who set out a system for creating a fair society in his remarkable book A Theory of Justice, thought that baseball is the fairest of them all \u2013 and, naturally enough, he had his reasons.  According to Rawls, the rules of baseball have remained constant and have not not required tinkering over time; the game does not discriminate against certain body types; it requires players to use their whole anatomy; spectators and referees can see every action on the field, making the sport fairer and more engaging; scoring is done without the ball, so viewers can concentrate on two different pieces of the action at once; and, like tennis, time never runs out in baseball, so there is always the possibility of a comeback. Aaron Gordon of The Classical respects Rawls as a political philosopher and an intellectual genius, but he disagrees with almost all of his sporting analysis, which makes this article superb. 2) Fergie Time When Sir Alex Ferguson released his autobiography last October, a plethora of reviews were published. The speed with which they were written suggested that most of the reviewers had skipped the book&apos;s 416 pages and jumped into the index to find the big names: Keane, Roy; Beckham, David; Rooney, Wayne; Gibraltar, Rock of; and so on.  David Runciman, who has reviewed the autobiography for the London Review of Books does not fall into the trap of looking for controversy. He has read the whole thing and written a fully formed impression of the text, without being seduced by newsworthy squabbles. Not that he enjoyed every page: &quot;My Autobiography is not an easy read. It is a hectoring, petty, repetitive book. Ferguson returns again and again to the things that nag him: players who let him down, deals that came unstuck, people who should have known better. He will take up a subject, drop it, then come back to it a page later, not because he has anything to add, but simply because it&apos;s still bugging him. It&apos;s like being stuck in a room with the man himself as his mind whirrs away through its grudges and grievances and no one else gets a chance to put a word in.&quot; Runciman was not transfixed by the style of the book, but he writes persuasively about the man who wrote it. He notes that Ferguson was obsessed by control, but never turned into a control freak; he trusted his instincts but never forgot the importance of luck; and, unlike Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, whose professorial manner, background and linguistic ability make him seem more cultivated than he is, Ferguson has a wide range of interests away from football. If you&apos;re not sick of reading about Ferguson already, this review is the place to go. 3) What makes a football player smart? Roy Keane liked the mantra &quot;fail to prepare; prepare to fail&quot;. Knute Rockne, the legendary University of Notre Dame football coach, put it differently: &quot;I never ask if a player has the will to win; I ask if he has to the will to prepare.&quot; The point is the same: sportsmen may be rewarded for what they do on the pitch, but their success is secured long before they take to the field.  The need to prepare is obvious enough, but less is written about the intelligence needed to prepare well. The best footballers in the NFL all have a natural aptitude for patterns, shapes, sequences and logic, and the very best quarterbacks are masters of detail. As Nicholas Dawidoff puts it in this piece for the New Yorker, quarterbacks have to weigh up a multitude of options in a few seconds &quot;while staring at 11 large people eager to break your face&quot;. In short, they&apos;re smarter than they look. 4) Norman Mailer, sportswriter When the Observer compiled a list of the greatest sports books ever written in 2005, The Fight by Norman Mailer came second (to Nick Hornby&apos;s Fever Pitch). As Allen Barra points out in this Atlantic article, Mailer was never convinced by the book. He looked back and wondered if spending six months on a sports biography had been a waste of time. Mailer lived his life fully \u2013\u00a0he went to Harvard aged 16, won two Pulitzer Prizes, co-founded the Village Voice magazine, married six women and fathered nine children \u2013 but he didn&apos;t write about sport enough. Mailer loved baseball and was an early supporter of Bill James, the sabermetrics pioneer made famous in the Moneyball boom, but he never wrote an article about the sport. The same goes for American football and bullfighting, which he followed dearly. Fiction&apos;s gain was sport&apos;s loss.  5) Three by three When the Olympics reach Tokyo in 2020, there may be a new sport on show: 3x3 basketball. The International Basketball Federation think the sport is &quot;an exciting and spectacular discipline which offers a unique cocktail of sports and urban culture and would perfectly fit within the Olympic Games&quot;. Alexander Wolff has researched the new sport, and its chances of making a show in Tokyo, for Sports Illustrated.  6) Tennis is the sport in which you talk to yourself In this short note on his website, Clive Davis considers the loneliness of the tennis player. More than any other athletes, tennis players are on their own. They compete for hours, with only a few short breaks with their kitbags, Robinsons drinks and bananas to break up the long stretches on the court. No wonder they start talking to themselves. And umpires. 7) Football is too risky for footballers It&apos;s difficult to muster much sympathy for professional footballers, but according to this intriguing piece of research by Ouriel Daskal in Soccer Issue, their work is fairly perilous. Football is 1,000 times riskier than your average &quot;high risk&quot; career, which might explain why a quarter of Premier League players are currently injured. Still, it could be worse...  8) Dutch prostitutes seek same tax deal as footballers ... On the topic of young people who do dangerous physical work over short careers that can be very rewarding financially, here is Peter Cluskey of the Irish Times writing about the pension rights of Dutch professionals.  9) The best of football writing in 2013 We tip our hats and raise our glasses to A Football Report, whose compilation of the best football writing from 2013 goes above and beyond anything this column managed at the turn of the year. We went on holiday for two weeks and they provided the best list of the year. Go get lost in it. 10) Insane street football skills Nutmegging people on the street looks like great fun.

Ninety minutes away in Hakone, you can venture underground in pursuit of works by Monet, Renoir, Chagall and Picasso. Both are outstanding examples of corporate art collections, the sort that are the subject of a book published on Monday and of a new show running at the auction house Bonhams in London for two weeks. The show will include works lent by companies including HSBC France, Statoil in Norway, E.ON in Germany and the law firm Clifford Chance in the UK. Among the artists on display are Tracey Emin, Otto Dix, Cornelia Parker and Richard Hamilton. What both the exhibition and the book reveal is the remarkable scale and breadth of the art that has been collected by corporations since the Renaissance, when the Monte dei Paschi bank in Siena decided it needed nice things for its walls and established what is thought to be the first corporate art collection, in 1472. Peter Harris, who co-authored A Celebration of Corporate Art Programmes Worldwide with Shirley Reiff Howarth, said: &quot;What I thought was amazing \u2013 and bear in mind I saw hundreds of arts programmes \u2013 was that each one was different. They&apos;ve all got a different rationale, different ideas, different ways, which makes it really interesting.&quot; Japanese companies seem particularly keen for the great art they collect to be seen. As well as the museum run by Sompo insurance group in Shinjuka and the Pola Group&apos;s subterranean galleries, there is Panasonic&apos;s Shiodome museum in Tokyo \u2013 the place to go for anyone interested in the French fauvist Georges Rouault (it has 230 works by him) \u2013 and the Shiseido gallery, which has a fine collection of Japanese contemporary art. Harris is a longtime advocate of the benefits of corporate art. &quot;The company wins because it promotes itself to the world and its employees; the artist wins because he or she has a new audience.&quot; An example in Britain is the Fleming-Wyfold art foundation, which emerged from the family-run Flemings bank, sold to Chase Manhattan in 2000. The foundation has around 800 works of Scottish art in its collection, from Samuel Peploe to Elizabeth Blackadder, which can be seen free of charge in its London gallery from Tuesday to Saturday. There are other British firms in the book, but not many. &quot;We certainly aren&apos;t up there among the Japanese and the Germans and the Spanish and the Americans,&quot; Harris said. &quot;Germany has this great tradition of supporting contemporary art and music. We&apos;re just not quite there, I&apos;m afraid.&quot; Harris believes an art collection says something about a company. &quot;It&apos;s for image. It is to tell the world and their employees things about them. If you go into any office before the staff arrives these days, they all look roughly the same: rows and rows of computers \u2013 and you think, what is this company all about? The answer is, it&apos;s on the walls.&quot; Or sometimes on the floor. The Swiss bank Pictet &amp; Cie has a collection of large, brightly coloured fibreglass mushrooms by Sylvie Fleury on one of its office floors; and the Belgacom Group in Belgium has a splendid Sol LeWitt geometric wooden sculpture in front of one of its windows. Much of a corporate art collection will often not be seen by the public but many now offer virtual tours, such as Saxo Bank in Denmark, which has a fine collection of contemporary art including an Elmgreen and Dragset sculpture of a young boy about to leap from a diving board in the company HQ atrium. Harris says that if the art they explore were found in one museum, it would be the finest in the world. All proceeds from the book will go to the Wapping Arts Trust, chaired by Harris, which is celebrating 25 years of rewarding companies that promote art in the workplace.

So it was something of a surprise when he appeared on K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen, the annual end of the year music program on Japan\u2019s NHK channel. The program has been a long tradition of Japanese New Years Eve, bringing together the year\u2019s hottest acts.

The performance was a fantastic finale to an extraordinary year for \u014ctomo, who received significant mainstream attention for providing the theme song and score for the extremely popular NHK daytime drama, Amachan. The show revolves around a school girl from Tokyo who moves to the Tohoku region where she becomes a local idol.

Paul Robson, a Briton, Paul Thompson, an Australian, Tetsuya Motomura of Japan were charged on Monday with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, as well as two counts of wire fraud, according to a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court. None of the men are in US custody, a court official said. From about May 2006 to January 2011, it is alleged that the three men and unidentified \u201cothers\u201d at the Dutch bank \u201cagreed to make false and fraudulent yen Libor submissions for the benefit of their trading positions&apos;&apos;, according to the government. If convicted, each of the three defendants faces as long as 30 years in prison. Robson worked as a senior trader on Rabobank\u2019s money markets desk in London; Thompson was the bank&apos;s head of money market and derivatives trading in Singapore; while Motomura was a senior trader at Rabobank\u2019s Tokyo desk, according to court papers. \u201cThese three traders \u2014 working from Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom \u2014 deliberately submitted what they called \u2018obscenely high\u2019 or \u2018silly low\u2019 Libor rates in order to benefit their own trading positions,\u201d acting assistant US attorney general Mythili Raman said in a statement. Global fines on companies including Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc reached $US6bn in December, and authorities around the world are investigating the alleged abuse of financial benchmarks by companies that play a central role in setting them. Regulators are still examining traders at half a dozen more firms. Robson coordinated his yen Libor submission with the trader responsible for making the Libor position at another bank on behalf of co-defendants, the US alleged. The US also said the unidentified trader who conspired with the three defendants was a \u201csenior trader\u201d for Rabobank\u2019s money market unit in Tokyo. The US said Robson made a higher or lower yen Libor submission \u201cconsistent with the direction requested by a defendant and consistent with the co-defendant\u2019s trading position\u201d. These manipulated Libor submissions were frequently to the detriment of Rabobank\u2019s counterparties to derivative contracts, as alleged by the US. The US complaint includes excerpts of e-mails, instant messages and calls that were recorded by the bank which the three defendants exchanged. In one exchange on May 10, 2006, Robson said in an e-mail \u201cit must be pretty embarrassing to set such a low libor. I was very embarrassed to set my 6 mth--but wanted to help thomo\u201d in what the US prosecutors says was a reference to Thompson. In a May 19, 2006, email, Thompson informed Robson that his net exposure for his three-month fixes was 125bn yen and stated \u201csneak your 3 m libor down a cheeky 1 or 2 bp\u201d because \u201cit will make a bit of diff for me.\u201d Robson responded that same day stating, \u201cNo prob mate I mark it low.\u201d In an exchange on August 4, 2008, Motomura asked Robson, \u201cPlease set today\u2019s 6mth LIBOR at 0.96 I have a chunky fixing\u201d. In an telephone call on 30 October, 2007, that was recorded by the bank, Robson asked Motomura: \u201cDo you want me to set anything for you?,\u201d to which Motomura replied that same day, \u201cif it is lower, it\u2019s better for me\u201d asking for a \u201clow 6\u2019s please&apos;&apos;. Rates under investigation include the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and ISDAfix, used to determine the value of interest-rate derivatives. The rates are used by banks to determine the cost of borrowing for businesses, home-buyers and students. European regulators also have reviewed allegations of collusion in crude oil and biofuels markets. Regulators from Switzerland to Washington are examining evidence reported by Bloomberg News in June that currency traders have been manipulating spot foreign-exchange rates for at least a decade, affecting the value of funds and derivatives. Those inquiries look at benchmark WM/Reuters rates, which are determined by trades executed in a minute-long period called \u201cthe fix\u201d at 4 p.m. in London each day. Probes of benchmark rates are prompting financial firms to overhaul internal controls and business practices, such as by reining their employees\u2019 use of electronic chat rooms. In November, foreign-exchange dealers from the world\u2019s biggest banks told the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that inquiries in their market could prompt an overhaul of the way they handle customer orders. The US alleged the three former Rabobank employees traded in derivative products that referenced yen Libor. Rabobank on 29 October entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the US justice department as part of its investigation in benchmarks including Libor and agreed to pay a $325m penalty. A spokeswoman for Rabobank declined to comment on Monday. The US Libor probe has led to criminal charges against eight individuals and resulted in more than $3.7bn in penalties paid to law enforcement and regulatory agencies."}, {"sentences": ["The last clip of Liu Xia&apos;s life, a video published before her house arrest, was a record of her speech and reading presented at an event for the 50th anniversary of Writers in Prison Committee of PEN International during its Congress in Tokyo."], "tags": ["China", "Nobel peace prize", "World news", "Human rights", "Liu Xiaobo"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-15T12:30:00Z", "title": "This is how China treats the wife of a Nobel peace prize winner | Bei Ling, Peter Englund, Per Wastberg", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/15/liu-xiaobo-china-nobel-prize-prison-wife-liu-xia-mistreat", "article": "     Is Liu Xia&apos;s misfortune a result of her husband Liu Xiaobo winning the Nobel peace prize on 8 October 2010? The answer to that question is obviously yes. The Chinese government has put her under house arrest in Beijing since that night. Her phone and cell phone were disconnected, and she cannot send or receive emails. For more than three years, Chinese authorities have deprived Liu Xia&apos;s basic human rights, freedom of movement, communication and speech.  Liu Xia&apos;s last public appearance was memorable. A friend of the Liu family said that she attempted to visit Liu Xia at #9 South Yuyuantan Road in the Haidian District of Beijing, in the afternoon in October 2013. As usual, Liu Xia&apos;s apartment was being patrolled and under surveillance by plainclothes police. Without thinking further, her friend called &quot;Liu Xia&quot; from outside the apartment. The familiar voice must have aroused Liu Xia&apos;s attention, so she opened her window and looked out. Her friend waved her hands and asked, &quot;How&apos;s Xiaobo?&quot; Liu Xia cried and responded, &quot;Xiaobo is the best in our family.&quot; She continued to sob at the window, and her friend was prohibited from entering her apartment. Liu Xia&apos;s brief but heartbreaking response is rather meaningful. Liu Xiaobo, her husband, is one of the most well-known political prisoners today. Since he was transferred from the Beijing No 1 Public Security Bureau Detention Center to Jinzhou Prison in Liaoning Province in May 2010, Liu Xia made a long trip by train from Beijing to Jinzhou Prison and took a lot of trouble in order to visit her husband each month. The police officers accompanied her during her trip. Prison authorities permitted her to meet her husband for a half hour at most.  As far as we have learned, before Liu Xiaobo won the Nobel Peace Prize, Liu Xia could hug him at their meetings, even holding hands across the table during conversations under the surveillance of prison guards. Over the past three years, Liu Xia&apos;s visits, though still once a month, have been strictly monitored by the police. The prison guards frequently interrupt the couple&apos;s conversations. Besides general greetings and personal health, Liu Xia is permitted to talk little of other matters. During most of their meetings, they may just stare at each other through the barred window separating them. In the past three years, Liu Xia has not been allowed to deliver her letters to her husband when visiting him. Liu Xiaobo used to be able to receive his wife&apos;s letters from his lawyers through her younger brother Liu Hui. Now, the prison simply returns the unread letters to her. During the past three months, his lawyer has even been refused visits with him. In a visit a year ago, Liu Xia wanted to tell Liu Xiaobo that Mo Yan won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2012. As the words &quot;Mo Yan&quot; slipped out, the prison guards broke up the conversation. Hence, Liu Xia cannot know whether or not Liu Xiaobo has learned about Mo Yan&apos;s win or not. He also does not know that Chinese authorities sentenced Liu Xia&apos;s younger brother, Liu Hui, to eleven years in prison for charges of &quot;financial fraud&quot; in June, 2013.  Chinese authorities allow Liu Xia only very limited privileges, such as a meal once a week at her parents&apos; home. Besides her parents, it&apos;s hard for Liu Xia to face any other family because Liu Hui&apos;s imprisonment is widely understood as retaliation against him for helping Liu Xia and Liu Xiaobo.  Liu Xia&apos;s younger brother, Liu Hui, had financially supported Liu Xia and been a messenger between Liu Xia and Liu Xiaobo&apos;s lawyers for limited communication with Liu Xiaobo in prison over the last three years. The Chinese government&apos;s prosecution and imprisonment of Liu Hui made Liu Xia&apos;s situation worse and worse. She lost not only the financial support, but also the chance of connecting with her husband.  Last June, the Beijing Public Security Bureau issued an official notice forbidding Liu Xia from organizing photography and painting exhibitions in China. Liu Xia, an artist and poet, produced over 20 paintings, which are now in her friends&apos; possession secretly. In 1998, Liu Xia wrote this poem to describe her journey of reaching her second-time imprisoned husband at Dalian in northeast China: The train runs to the concentration camp over my body, sobbing,but I could not reach your hand  Liu Xia once described herself as &quot;a person of few tears&quot;. Although she is &quot;extremely fragile&quot;, as she acknowledges, outsiders cannot easily detect such a quality from her. &quot;Xiaobo is the best in our family&quot; is Liu Xia&apos;s stoic reply. But her family reports that Liu Xia is exhausted and depressed after three years of isolation. She has lost her appetite and is totally depressed. Liu Xia is no longer &quot;a person of few tears&quot;.  On 23 April 2013, when Liu Xia went to the court hearing of her younger brother&apos;s first trial in Beijing, she had temporary freedom and an opportunity to speak to journalists and lawyers. She asked them to tell the world, &quot;If people say I&apos;m free, tell them that I am not free.&quot; Since June 2013, Liu Xia has been declining mentally and physically, unable to withstand the extreme isolation of her long-term house arrest. She is losing the ability to describe her situation. The last clip of Liu Xia&apos;s life, a video published before her house arrest, was a record of her speech and reading presented at an event for the 50th anniversary of Writers in Prison Committee of PEN International during its Congress in Tokyo. On 29 September 2010, during the &quot;Free Liu Xiao&quot; event at Waseda University, the video clip was screened to over a thousand audience members. When the light was focused on Liu Xia&apos;s calm and pale face, her voice was low and slow before a quiet conference hall. Liu Xia&apos;s last words brought tears to people&apos;s eyes:  During Xiaobo&apos;s re-education through labour for three years from 8 October 1996 to 8 October 1999, I wrote him more than 300 letters and he wrote me 2-3 million words. After our home was raided several times, his writings generally disappeared. This is our life.  Liu Xia&apos;s situation is extremely worrisome. Her adversity could easily be ignored when the international community has been concerned mainly with her imprisoned husband. Liu Xiaobo, who might be released in 2020, doesn&apos;t know the depth and details of the physical and mental turmoil of his wife. Because of her depression and poor appetite, she lost her will to live on. Her poor health makes people worry for her \u2013 can she hang on till 2020? We believe Liu Xia&apos;s life is at stake. She needs the world to reach out to rescue her. We strongly urge the Chinese government to stop restricting Liu Xia&apos;s freedom. She should have the freedom to call, fax, and email; to shop for herself; to visit her parents and friends; to receive proper medical treatment; to exchange letters with her husband; and to hold photographic exhibitions in China. We are here to plead with the world: raise your voices for Liu Xia and demand that the Chinese government release her from house arrest."}, {"sentences": ["At once earthy and hi-tech, rustic and urban, the homes she built in Tokyo in the 1990s, with her then husband, Eisaku Ushida, were a physical manifesto of her future-primitive style.", "Ushida Findlay's Soft and Hairy House, Tokyo, Japan, 1992-94.", "She moved to Tokyo in 1979 to work for Arata Isozaki, a leader of the Metabolist movement, who had dreamed up fantastical plans for tree-like megastructures of clustered housing, hoisted aloft on great stalks above the city.", "She was appointed associate professor at the University of Tokyo, the first female academic in its department of architecture \u2013 and the first foreigner to teach there since the Meiji period."], "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-15T17:53:29Z", "title": "Kathryn Findlay obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jan/15/kathryn-findlay", "article": "The architect Kathryn Findlay, who has died aged 60 after suffering from a brain tumour, was the creator of surreal space-age houses in Japan and co-designer of the Orbit tower in the London Olympic Park. At once earthy and hi-tech, rustic and urban, the homes she built in Tokyo in the 1990s, with her then husband, Eisaku Ushida, were a physical manifesto of her future-primitive style. Recalling the mud-walled buildings of north Africa and New Mexico, crossed with something straight from the Jetsons, they appeared like otherworldly objects in the city&apos;s suburban streets. Forming a series of cave-like spaces within a sinuous white loop, the Truss Wall House, completed in 1993, performed elaborate feats with concrete long before computer modelling made such curvaceous forms ubiquitous. It was commissioned by the owner of the Truss Wall system, a method of constructing compound curves in concrete, which until then had been used only for decorative applications, such as making rippling concrete curtains and sculptures of dragons.     Elaborate feats with concrete: Ushida Findlay's Truss Wall House, 1993.  Photograph: Ushida Findlay    Findlay and Ushida took the fantastical theme one step further, constructing a beguiling residence that could have been home to the amorphous Barbapapa family, a hollowed-out shell dotted with constellations of circular windows, complete with a terrace made of what looked like pink marshmallows. It felt half alive, and the building has since taken on a life of its own: the small planting bed has grown to engulf the house entirely with a thick cloak of ivy. With its mop of vegetation, it recalls a second project, completed in 1994, for a client who took Salvador Dali&apos;s prophecy that the future of architecture would be &quot;soft and hairy&quot; as their inspiration. The resulting Soft and Hairy House rises out of the ground with pinkish rough-rendered walls, as if extruded from the earth, complete with a shaggy lawn of grass and wild flowers on top. Beneath, the warren of rounded rooms, each lined with swaths of pleated fabric, frame a courtyard where a bright blue egg pokes through the wall like some cosmic bathroom blob.     Ushida Findlay's Soft and Hairy House, Tokyo, Japan, 1992-94.  Photograph: Ushida Findlay    &quot;We earned some disapproval in Japan for not being minimalists,&quot; Findlay told the Guardian last year. &quot;But you just have to keep ploughing the furrow you see ahead of you, and hope that at some point they&apos;ll understand you, and you&apos;ll understand them.&quot; Never one to call on the conventional architectural canon or follow the rules, Findlay likened her design process to a worm eating through an apple: carving spaces out of a solid mass, rather than forming a building from the outside in. &quot;The shape is an outcome of the spaces and movement inside,&quot; she said. The projects were developed through lengthy iterations of model-making and what she called &quot;slimy drawings&quot; \u2013 pre-digital, hand-crafted axonometrics that have more in common with natural history illustrations than the sleek, seamless renderings of today&apos;s parametric modelling software. The daughter of James, an Angus sheep farmer, and Elizabeth, Findlay was born in Finavon, Scotland. She studied at the Architectural Association in London in 1976, where she was taught by Peter Cook, founding member of the radical Archigram group, and Leon van Schaik, who inspired her interest in the idea of space as a solid matter that could be carved and sculpted. She moved to Tokyo in 1979 to work for Arata Isozaki, a leader of the Metabolist movement, who had dreamed up fantastical plans for tree-like megastructures of clustered housing, hoisted aloft on great stalks above the city. There she met Ushida, whom she married in 1983 and with whom she founded the Ushida Findlay Partnership in 1986. She was appointed associate professor at the University of Tokyo, the first female academic in its department of architecture \u2013 and the first foreigner to teach there since the Meiji period.     Rustic high-tech: Kathryn Findlay's Poolhouse 2, 2009    The practice relocated to the UK in 1999, and went bust in 2004 after running up debts working on three big projects in Qatar, including an unbuilt museum of textiles and a villa for the minister of culture \u2013 which was half-built, then demolished to make way for a railway line. A beach palace for the emir&apos;s wife did get completed, its form rising out of the sands like a swirling propeller. With its tendril-like wings extending into the landscape, it had similarities with Findlay&apos;s radical proposal for a country house on a greenbelt site in Cheshire, a stealthy starfish scheme which won planning permission in 2000, but was never realised. Projects for a Maggie&apos;s cancer centre planned for Wishaw hospital, Lanarkshire, and a slug-shaped visitor centre on the beach in Hastings also fell by the wayside. Findlay bounced back in 2008, with a poolhouse project in the Chilterns, which stands as testament to what could be achieved when clients persevered, featuring an undulating thatched rooftop that hovers above the pool in a startling vision of rustic hi-tech.     The ArcelorMittal Orbit tower in the London 2012 Olympic Park, on which Kathryn Findlay collaborated with Anish Kapoor    Her final collaboration, on the ArcelorMittal Orbit in the Olympic Park, London, was one of her most cherished. &quot;I loved working with Anish Kapoor,&quot; she told the Guardian. &quot;He has an incredible sense of pure experience \u2013 of darkness and light, and of how to make an artwork as strong an experience as possible. He doesn&apos;t get caught up in detail. He captures what I try to do in architecture.&quot; The news of Findlay&apos;s death came as the Architects&apos; Journal awarded her the Jane Drew prize &quot;for her outstanding contribution to the status of women in architecture&quot;. &quot;She was one of the most talented people in British architecture,&quot; said Eva Jiricna, one of the jurors. &quot;I hope her work will be discovered by a new generation.&quot; Ushida Findlay Architects is currently working on the remodelling of York Art Gallery, which is due for completion at the end of this year. Findlay and Ushida separated in 1999. She is survived by her two children, Miya and Hugo. \u2022 Kathryn Findlay, architect, born 26 January 1953; died 10 January 2014"}, {"sentences": ["We meet at the Uniqlo headquarters in Tokyo&apos;s tallest office building, looking out over the city of people in bright T-shirts and puffer jackets below."], "tags": ["Education", "Languages", "Higher education", "Guardian Careers", "Fashion industry"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-17T07:00:31Z", "title": "Languages are in vogue in the fashion industry", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jan/17/languages-career-fashion-industry", "article": "Aldo Liguori couldn&apos;t do his job without languages.

Native Russian speaker Jana Reynolds works as the international development manager at the exclusive N\u00b010_Showroom in Paris, where her mother tongue is invaluable: &quot;If I did not speak Russian 98% of my Russian clients would not be my clients.&quot; Yet she has found that speaking fluent French and Italian, as well as English, has been useful when building her international career. &quot;If you speak French or Italian, or you&apos;re a designer showing in France or Italy, you show you belong. Fashion is an industry that survives on symbolic value so heavily.&quot; Just after we speak, she emails to let me know she has just sealed a large deal at a trade show with an elderly Italian customer who owns multiple stores in Udine and speaks zero English, which &quot;would have been a massive opportunity missed if I couldn&apos;t communicate&quot;. The more languages, the better, it would seem, but which to learn? &quot;Most of the trade happens in France and Italy, but the real money is not in Europe \u2013 the buyers are from China and Japan,&quot; says Jana. Patrick agrees, noting that many people working in Milan showrooms speak Russian and Chinese to attract high spenders from the East. This trend has been picked up by Asos, which launched its Chinese site in November, and Topshop, which will soon open its first stores in the country. &quot;There are plenty of times when English isn&apos;t enough for work,&quot; says Timothy Parent, founder of China Fashion Collective. &quot;Many of the designers I work with only speak Chinese. Building relationships and meeting people are incredibly important, and in China you are extremely limited if you don&apos;t speak the language.&quot; Despite the allure of the foreign catwalk, there are currently no joint undergraduate fashion and language courses available in the country. This means students interested in developing their international prospects must arrange to study a language in addition to their main degree, sometimes at an extra cost. Some institutions, such as the University of the Creative Arts, offer no form of language provision whatsoever. This may be due to the demanding nature of practical degrees, says Jason Clapperton, head of careers and student recruitment at London College of Fashion. He does stress that all the college&apos;s courses emphasise the global aspect of the industry. &quot;If you set up your own label, you&apos;re going to have to know how to deal with people in the industry, and they may be from a whole variety of different countries.&quot; London College of Fashion students are encouraged to make use of the university language centre and Erasmus links to study textiles in Lyon or design in Denmark. His colleague Emilie Gautier is keen to point out that learning a new language and going abroad is a form of creative and cultural exchange, which can influence a designer&apos;s visual, as well as verbal, communication skills. Nottingham Trent University claims that languages are &quot;definitely beneficial&quot; for all their fashion students, yet among those from the UK, only around one in 10 choose to study a language on top of their course. This suggests that by making an effort to acquire a different vocabulary, students hoping to work in the industry will indeed stand out from the crowd. Being multilingual can help you make the best of opportunities in the competitive fashion world. Although English remains the industry&apos;s current lingua franca, the flexibility gained by learning another language can take your career to the top. As Jana puts it: &quot;you can get by with English, but it&apos;s more about the quality of communication. Fashion people are very irrational, emotional, neurotic people, and the safer they feel in your company, the further you&apos;re going to get with them.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&apos;In about 1981 I had to give a lecture at the embassy in Tokyo on the subject of English culture.&apos; &apos;Oh really.&apos; I was underwhelmed."], "tags": ["Society", "History", "Essays", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-17T13:30:00Z", "title": "Will Self: The Valley of the Corn Dollies", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/17/will-self-valley-corn-dollies", "article": "We were standing on the beach at Sizewell in Suffolk \u2013 my dad and I. To our right the Kubla Khan dome of the fast-breeder reactor hall gleamed in the wan sunlight. Daddy was expounding. Foolishly I had provided him with an opportunity - I&apos;d admitted that I was writing an article on the state of English culture. &apos;Mmm . . . English culture. Well . . .&apos; he paused, rocking on his heels, a great dolmen of a man. &apos;In about 1981 I had to give a lecture at the embassy in Tokyo on the subject of English culture.&apos; &apos;Oh really.&apos; I was underwhelmed. &apos;And what did you have to say about it?&apos; &apos;Funny thing is I can&apos;t remember . . . Shall we go and get a pint?&apos; Not exactly an epiphanic moment but the truth is that the mention of the words &apos;English culture&apos; prompts more bathetic lines, from more disparate individuals, than anything else I have ever hit on. At times I began to feel that the term &apos;English culture&apos; might conceivably be an oxymoron, or worse, as flimsy a journalistic pretext as Hunter S Thompson&apos;s search for &apos;the American Dream&apos; in Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. Given this, I could imagine the denouement of my quest well enough: Self floundering across a field of rape in pursuit of a toothless, old smock-wearer. Self: What is that in your hand old man? Smock-wearer: Thaat? It be a corn dolly . Self: (capering) At last! At last! I&apos;ve found English culture! Fol-de-rol! Hi-diddley-hey! Self and smock-wearer execute a passable Mexican wavelet and then quit the rape field in a severely truncated conga line. As a fellow-novelist (Irish, of course) put it to me when hearing about my improbable remit: &apos;The English have such a reliable appetite for hearing what shite they are.&apos; Yes, we may not have a culture we can call our own any more, but never let it be said that we&apos;re slow off the mark when putting the boot into it. Indeed, this tendency is now so well advanced that it could reasonably be argued that English culture is entirely constituted by self-loathing. I&apos;m no stranger to this tendency. I always make it clear when talking about the cultural exhaustion of my country, that I do not mean those other thriving, exciting cultures, tacked on to the edges of the land mass. I dissociate the parlous condition of the &apos;English novel&apos; from the rude health of the &apos;English-language novel&apos;. I make damn certain that when I&apos;m in Scotland, Wales, Northern or Southern Ireland, I don&apos;t make the absurd solecism of referring to &apos;British culture&apos;. It would be like a Nazi asking for a cream cheese bagel in Grodzinski&apos;s - would it not? Well no, not exactly. The truth of the matter is that while English culture may be moribund when considered in isolation, suspended like some bisected bovine in the formaldehyde of cultural criticism, the reality is that it positively pullulates with invention and polymorphous perversity. Not all of this is to be desired. Culture cannot be read off from social circumstances in a form of straight equivalence: good society = good culture. The opposite is rather more often the case. Freud, Kraus, Schnitzler, Klimt, Kafka . . . All were working to the full extent of their powers, cradled by the dying limbs of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It&apos;s a bit like this in England. It&apos;s all very well for my co-essayists of the last three weeks to trumpet the triumphs - and the weaknesses - of their respective cultures. They may quote this theatre director, synopsise a writer or two and comment on the odd festival, but let&apos;s call a spade a spade: their cultures exist like satellites, within the gravitational pull of something far bigger, a kind of cultural dark star, capable of sucking all the available Welsh, Scots and Irish deep into the hinterlands of Portland Place Television Centre, Fleet Street and Soho. Yes, send us your poor, your huddled masses and we&apos;ll dress them in Paul Smith, Agnes B, Vivienne Westwood and Jasper Conran. Then we&apos;ll employ them in writing multi-supplement newspapers, filming television retrospectives, Merchant-Ivory films and Carling Black Label commercials. It would be facile to condemn this as &apos;cultural imperialism&apos;. No, contemporary English culture is both coloniser and colonised - and all the stronger for it. It is a culture of profound and productive oppositions. And I believe, personally, the best possible country for someone with a satirical bent to live in. I&apos;d go further: England has the world&apos;s top satirical culture. The English have, in the two and a half centuries since Swift (a man who really knew what a reliable appetite we have for hearing what shite we are) ascended a parabola of facetiousness to achieve the very zenith of irony. We have managed this by fostering a culture of conflict and opposition. Is English culture bigoted or liberal? It is both. Is it hermetic and introverted or expansive and cosmopolitan? It is all of these. One of the recent English cultural events that garnered much attention in the print media was the deathbed interview of Dennis Potter by Melvyn Bragg. Like many other closet Englishmen I felt my capacity for dismissive irony being cauterised and my heart beginning to stir as Potter spoke, saying: &apos;. . . we British in general, English in particular - I find the word British harder and harder to use as time passes - we English tend to deride ourselves far too easily . . . because we&apos;ve lost so much confidence, because we lost so much of our identity, which had been subsumed in this forced Imperial identity which I obviously hate.&apos; I too find the word &apos;British&apos; harder and harder to say. It sounds as implausible a description of where I live as &apos;Airstrip One&apos;. But Potter&apos;s televised leavetaking from us was freighted - predictably enough - with irony. For, while setting up a Utopian socialist, essentially working-class culture in opposition to the Heritage Industry, chocolate boxy pomp and circumstance that the current regime still wishes to hide behind, he was nonetheless acting in a way that is possible only in a post-Imperial culture. His use of television to broadcast the absolute spiritual importance of a &apos;good death&apos; was not far short of being Ciceronian. Only - I would argue - in England could this have taken place. His dryness, his self-possession, his honesty, his caustic wit in the face of extinction. Damn it all - his sang-froid (as with most quintessential English characteristics, only a French tag will do it justice) made me for a wrenching, choking second or two, proud to be English. We&apos;re big on dignified death at the moment - as suits a culture of rich decline. We were treated to Derek Jarman&apos;s expiry in the past year as well. Once again our newspapers, image-hungry and commentful, treated us to photographs of Jarman wasting away with Aids. When he was on the brink of death even the Daily Telegraph carried it as a news item. And this the man reviled for his gayness, his cruising, promiscuous lifestyle and last - but by no means least - his achingly pretentious &apos;arty-farty&apos; films. I&apos;ve been as quick off the mark as the rest of us to dissociate myself from Jarman&apos;s creative excesses. As a gay friend of mine once remarked lovingly: &apos;He just has to put Tilda Swinton in a corner and get her to emote!&apos; There&apos;s a tendency among the chattering classes - another of our great coinages - to trash our own before anyone else can. In this sense we&apos;re like a collective personification of Anthony Blanche in Brideshead Revisited. We loiter by the statue of Mercury in Christchurch&apos;s Peck Quad, desperately frightened lest some gang of vicious hearties come and debag us for our aestheticism. But the truth of the matter is that Jarman was a great English film-maker. And in The Last Of England he offered us a set of discursive and yet plangent images of our own divided nature: its beauty and its brutality, its sensuality and its darkness. Each frame that Jarman contrived in this film appeared to me to be at one and the same time wholly arbitrary and yet exactly right. The sense of frenzied enervation that it produced in me was unmistakably English in character. After all, as I&apos;ve often had occasion to remark, London is a great city, that has genuine edge, and which is still in some ineffable way, terribly dull. So the contradictions pile up. We may bemoan the English for their obsession with class - on some dark days it seems to me that English culture is defined entirely by class preoccupation - yet without this preoccupation it is inconceivable to imagine there being the films of Mike Leigh, Terence Davies or Ken Loach. While there is a conformist tradition of exploiting class division for &apos;light comedy&apos; or bogus satire, that runs in an unbroken line from P G Wodehouse, through Waughs (Evelyn and Auberon) to Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, there is another class-influenced tradition that is surreal, irreverent and genuinely subversive. In the post-war period this begins with Spike Milligan, snags in elements of Alan Bennett and Peter Cook, hooks up the Monty Python team and comes to rest with the alternative comedians of the early Eighties, in particular Alexei Sayle. That much derided Monty Python team. Oh my God! They ended up in Hollywood, they make corporate videos, they sold out big time! But they were also - let&apos;s not forget - good. How good is open to dispute, but they were an Oxbridge gang of bourgeois boys who took on their own class and its preoccupations with a vengeance. They took the piss out of the English ruling class and its mores in a way that hadn&apos;t been done on television before, and I don&apos;t believe has been substantially improved on since. Let us not forget &apos;Upper Class Twit of the Year&apos;. And let us not forget either possibly the most incisive film satire on England in the early Eighties, Terry Gilliam&apos;s Brazil. Made by a Canadian, I grant you, but infused with all the awfulness of the Thatcher regime, its bizarre elision of antimacassars and atomic weaponry, of aspidistras and the absolutely fabulous. Thatcher is, of course, the real bogeywoman of this essay. There was never anything more English than Baroness Thatcher nee Margaret Roberts. She proved once again that anyone in this country who had elocution lessons could aspire to a hereditary title. Thatcher made explicit the peculiar cultural bond that has always existed between the English lower middle class and the English upper middle class, the two groups dancing a gavotte around one another, aping each other&apos;s attitudes. It would have been nice to imagine - what with the monarchy so convincingly working itself via the Method into the mind-set of a tampon - that this quavering chord of snobbery was at any rate being stretched in the present if not snapped altogether. But, of course, nothing could be further from the truth. The English obsession with class is in great shape and over the past 15 years has received a booster course of anabolic steroids in the form of Government-inspired promotion of gross economic inequality. The fact remains that in the past decade and a half in England, the poor have got resolutely poorer while the rich have got resolutely richer. Statistics came out a month ago (rating minimal column inches in newspapers that had more important things to comment upon, such as new trends in advertising), that while the middle classes in England have doubled their wealth in real terms, the least well-off have got progressively poorer. This leaves the bulk of cultural commentators in an uneasy - not to say tendentious - position of having to nip and nibble at the hand that so conspicuously feeds them. Going back to that Potter interview, I think he voiced a sentiment that many of us feel when he said that there was a real demand for radicalism in England in the Eighties - it happened to come from the right wing, but the demand for change was insistent. We got the change - but it wasn&apos;t exactly what we were looking for. But to reprise what I said above, a great culture is not necessarily derived from an egalitarian or socially responsible political and economic culture. In the Eighties we saw rickets and tuberculosis reappear in our cities along with firearms and crack cocaine, and I would argue that as a direct result England came of age as a particular kind of culture. A year or so ago I did an interview with Martin Amis for an American college review. It was at the end of our conversation that Amis inadvertently identified the nub of the cultural exhaustion suffered by the English middle class - and what underlies it, adumbrates it, gives it substance. We were discussing the notion of &apos;cool&apos;. The Americans definitely had it, opined Amis. All Americans? I countered, or perhaps only African-Americans? They did, after all, coin the term in the first place. Well, Amis didn&apos;t know about that, but whatever &apos;cool&apos; was, it was a quality that the English were incapable of possessing. I would like to dissent from this view. Not only do I think that English culture is cool - I also think we have been getting cooler. But this &apos;cool&apos; is a tricky thing. Decidedly double-edged. Cool feeds off poverty and injustice, that&apos;s why the Americans have always had so much of it. Cool produces great dance music, great drug culture, the insistent iconisisation of violence and sensuality. It&apos;s fashionable enough to deride America, and to single out its influence on English culture as being wholly negative. A couple of months ago the literary editor of this newspaper, Richard Gott, wrote that: &apos;There is now no English fiction to speak of, no English theatre, no English art, no English music, no English films, and no English newspapers. What survives is provincial, anecdotal, without reach or significance . . . For years now we have learnt to live with American politics and culture as though they were our own. They are our own for we have no other. We are permanently in a mood to read American writers, see American art, listen to American music . . . etc.&apos; If Gott&apos;s rant (another fine English cultural tradition - we even named a political tendency after it in the 16th century), displays anything, it&apos;s the bogosity and attitudinising of those on the left just as much as those on the right. The willingness to search for culture in terms of some specious purity. Gott is just as guilty as John Major of longing residually for some English arcadia. His may not be defined by the sound of leather on willow, but it&apos;s no more or less asinine. If Gott wishes to deride English culture in this way because of American influence, then he presumably would also wish to deride the influence of the Afro-Caribbean, South Asian and Central European immigrants to this country, let alone all the myriad other peoples who have made their homes here. (He also presumably has a great deal of sympathy for the way in which New York has been &apos;invaded&apos; by legions of English journalists, writers and publishers over the past ten years.) Let us not forget that it was England that found a place for Marx to park his carbuncled bum while he wrote Das Kapital, and for Freud to push his couch when Vienna became a tad too intolerant. And contemporary English culture gifts us the delights of this in the form of: the writings of Ben Okri, Hanif Kureishi, David Dabydeen, Kazuo Ishiguro, Anita Desai, Ruth Prawer-Jhabvala, Caryl Phillips and Salman Rushdie the thoughts of Ernest Gellner, Adam Phillips and Germaine Greer the music of Yehudi Menuhin, Joan Armatrading and UB40 the . . . If you chuck out the bathwater of &apos;pernicious&apos; cultural influences, the baby of exciting and productive ones goes along with it. If you see culture as a one-way street you neglect the fact of just how influential English culture has been on the rest of the world - and America in particular. Forget Four Weddings And A Funeral and remember the Stone Roses, the Orb, Primal Scream and the whole Manchester Rave scene, which has washed up in America in just the way that so many other delirious waves of English dance music culture have before. Yes, you would have to say that, when it comes right down to it, what the English are best at at the moment and have been for some little while - is the synergy of dance, drugs and street fashion. The youth of just about any English provincial city look infinitely cooler - to my mind - than their contemporaries in either Seattle or Turin. We&apos;re also good at something rather numinously termed: &apos;retail services&apos;, by which is meant marketing, advertising and merchandising, as well as franchising. Indeed &apos;retail services&apos; constitutes the largest part of our invisible earnings. You can go to any city in the world and see the influence of English retail services. How pitiful it is to moan about American consumerism and commercialism when we have so enthusiastically pursued it ourselves for many years. When I was last in the States, number six on the MTV video chart was Morrissey, as camply English as they go, warbling irresolutely: &apos;The more you ignore me, the closer I get.&apos; And in truth this is what has been happening with the cool side of English culture, the more the self-appointed elite of cultural critics has ignored it, the closer it has got. Part of the reason for this is the way that the English middle class excels at cultural appropriation. No sooner has something been generated then it can be twisted into a suitable shape for intelligent &apos;comment&apos;. Football has been one of the recent victims of this superior yobbism. A lot of rather etiolated, epicene, middle-class, male intellectuals have discovered a new authenticity when they come to identify themselves as football fans. What are they playing at? After all, it&apos;s one thing to enjoy a bit of a kick-around, or standing on the terraces with a plastic beaker of Bovril, but it&apos;s quite another to churn out newspaper articles and even books - damn it all, that&apos;s culture! And the culture it is is a culture of appropriation. Flagrantly uncool, the English bourgeoisie has gone hunting for new, farouche culture. But it hasn&apos;t ventured very far - just down the social ladder a few rungs to raid the working-class larder. And that&apos;s what this football thing is about: cultural appropriation. It&apos;s really no surprise - because that&apos;s what the English pop culture has been about (in part) for many years: ie sons of Dartford PE teachers wailing that they&apos;re &apos;street fighting men&apos;. There are two nations in England therefore, the cool nation and the undeniably uncool one. It follows that there is a cool culture and an uncool culture. It&apos;s the sort of exercise that a great many English journalists take to with great enthusiasm, separating cultural artifacts and creators into these two categories, or others similar. It won&apos;t be too long before there are magazines in England consisting entirely of lists of what is deemed to be &apos;in&apos; or &apos;out&apos;. Of course the irony here (and please note the frequency with which the word &apos;irony&apos; is recurring in this essay), is that those who undertake such activities are about as far from the notion of cultural cool as it is possible to be, without relocating to EuroDisney. Yes, you&apos;ve guessed it, the arbiters of cool are the least qualified people for the job and further, the vast majority of the people who are responsible for defining the parameters of contemporary English culture are also woefully inadequate for the task. This is not simply a function of the old adage: if you have to ask what rhythm is then you ain&apos;t got it. It&apos;s more to do with the dread influence of the media and in particular the namesake of Dennis Potter&apos;s pancreatic cancer, dear old newly-American Rupert Murdoch. I&apos;m not going to go into yet another a rant about the deadening influence of television or the parlous state of the English novel, or the lack of quality in the quality newspapers, but certain facts about the relationship between the English cultural scape and the media do seem to me to be indisputable. In Raymond Chandler&apos;s novel The Long Goodbye, the multi-millionaire Harlan Potter remarks, &apos;a newspaper is an advertising vehicle predicated upon its circulations, nothing more and nothing less.&apos; In the US this was evident as long ago as the Fifties. Here, we have continued to cling to the cherished delusion that the bulk of good newspapers and periodicals are driven by some &apos;line&apos; or other. But other media - notably television - have now made the same kind of inroads as they have across the Atlantic. English newspapers, magazines and even books now find themselves fighting for a smaller and smaller share of the attention span available. With declining circulations, the only way to bolster profits is by more advertising and cutting editorial costs. You can now have the delicious experience of opening a quality newspaper and finding many many column inches not only filled with extemporised comment, but also lists of the &apos;in&apos; and &apos;out&apos; and most pernicious of all, a vast amount of highly self-reflexive material: journalists writing about journalists, about television programmes, about the way in which certain cultural phenomena have impacted (but not about the phenomena themselves), and about items of such persiflage that you wonder fervently how the subs could bring themselves to key the stuff in. I myself have considered asking all my journalist friends to contribute to a collection of the most facile and meretricious examples of this genre. It would be entitled: The New Glib. J G Ballard has said that the shocking thing about English television is that it treats serious subjects glibly, the Americans only treat glib subjects glibly, which is a far less serious crime against the culture. What is true about television is also true, mutatis mutandis, about other media as well. Another contemporary English cultural shibboleth concerns that word &apos;irony&apos; which I asked you to note earlier. A decade or so ago there was a film scripted by David Hare called The Ploughman&apos;s Lunch. This was a state-of-the-nation type film, a timely comment on how the Thatcher era was beginning to shape up. The eponymous, central irony of the film was that the idea of the ploughman&apos;s lunch, far from being some immemorial component of English agricultural worker&apos;s diet, was in fact the coinage of a Sixties marketing man trying to vitalise pub snacking. Nowadays such a device would be given the ubiquitous - and invariably incorrect - ascription &apos;post-modern&apos;. This has come to refer to almost any example of cultural self-reflexivity. It wouldn&apos;t surprise me in the least to hear some self-appointed &apos;cultural critic&apos; refer to the Carling Black Label advertisements as tremendous examples of English post-modernist irony. They&apos;re not, of course, they&apos;re merely another way that advertising people have hit upon of selling us indifferent lager. What kind of claim is it anyway to say that while our culture may on the face of it be hopelessly decadent we are at least capable of having a good snigger at ourselves? Such a claim opens the door to a peculiarly unEnglish state of mind: despair. And another concomitant to the specious post-modernist contention, is that the old divisions between &apos;high&apos; and &apos;low&apos; culture are somehow being eradicated. The people who advance this view - best summed up by the masthead slogan of the Modern Review: &apos;Low Culture for High Brows&apos; - are, in fact, our old friends the middle-class football fans under a different guise. You note that they aren&apos;t remotely interested in presenting high culture for low brows, by which I mean that they have no intention of regarding their hold on the print media as an opportunity to provide education or enlightenment for anyone. Rather they seem engaged - and I don&apos;t just mean the Modern Review people by this, I think the tendency is far more widespread - in a kind of lower-sixth-form- common-room approach to our culture: it&apos;s all much of a muchness really and a bit of a laugh, so let&apos;s not take it too seriously. What lies behind this is not the professed aim of elevating popular culture, but the urge to drag high culture down to a level where it can be discussed in the same way that Carling Black Label advertisements are. I think that popular culture can be good on its own terms and so can high culture. I don&apos;t see any particular need to mate them with one another in order to produce some exciting new chimera. It merely seems to me to be the result of the despair that afflicts people when they realise that their culture has simply become too amorphous and too large for them to get any kind of grasp on it at all. It was said of Coleridge that he was the last man in England to have read everything. Well, he was none too happy with this feat in the early 19th century - imagine what a horror it would be today. It strikes me that while the business of marginal cultures that have had their cultures denigrated and deracinated, is to preserve and renovate them. The business of cultures like England&apos;s, that have been and continue to be remarkably influential, is to somehow distress the cultural fabric, so that the people aren&apos;t faced with the Coleridgean dilemma. Coming back to newspapers, how many times in the last 10 years have you heard people moan that there is simply too much stuff around for them to read/listen to/watch? Imagine how dreadful this predicament would be if it were really the case that the majority of this material were worth reading/listening to/watching? But of course no nation - not even the English - has a monopoly on the business of cultural self-loathing. Why, even those triumphalists the Americans are no mean practitioners. During a recent book tour of the States if I had been given a dime for every time someone chimed up during the Q &amp; A session at the end of the reading, saying how much better contemporary English writing seemed to be to them than American, I would have become a comparatively wealthy man. When people would say this, there was nothing else to do but point out that most of last year&apos;s reading in the English literary press was about just how dismal our literary outpourings were, particularly when compared to those of contemporary America. But then America is a newcomer to that field of declining cultural self-loathing, and while Americans can attitudinise self-revulsion with the best of us, they still haven&apos;t acquired that distinctly English kind of self-abuse, that thoroughly reliable appetite for hearing what shite they are. But I&apos;m confident they&apos;ll catch up. They&apos;ll catch up because their culture is being changed and compromised in many of the same ways that ours is. Let me tease this out a bit further for you, and in doing so start to resolve the strange conundrum I presented earlier when I claimed that despite all of this negativity, superfluity, and redundancy, English culture was cool and getting cooler. All of what I have said above applies to culture when considered as a passively received phenomenon, it does not apply to culture in the making. It most definitely applies to the self-reflexive nullities of much &apos;cultural criticism&apos; but it certainly does not apply to what these myriad critics are attempting to examine. Let me make it simpler still it applies to the superstructure of our culture, but not to our base. The superstructure of English culture is still overwhelmingly white, middle class and metropolitan. G K Chesterton said that the English love a talented mediocrity and this remains true to this day. The people we are forced to listen to on matters cultural, have by and large seldom actually immersed themselves in the culture they purport to be explaining. They are the cultural PEVists, the Psycho-Empathetic Voyeurs. They no longer need to immerse themselves in culture, they simply need to know that it&apos;s going on somewhere. &apos;Here be culture&apos; reads the map that is attached to almost every publication nowadays in the form of some &apos;what&apos;s on&apos; or events guide. Although these arbiters would seek to distance themselves from the reactionary postures implicit in so much English culture-mongering from the national curriculum on up, the fact remains that they have joined in a silent compact with those people who believe a culture&apos;s strength depends somehow on its purity. They have entered the Valley of the Corn Dollies , and are to be seen there eating ploughman&apos;s lunches voraciously. They come under many guises: anti-American, anti-European, anti-Caribbean, anti-Semitic, homophobic, misogynistic, anti-just about anything. They want to preserve a vision of England that is equally of Lowry and Wodehouse, of dappled afternoons on the croquet lawn at Blandings Castle and be-clogged figures dunking their way across the cobbles of Northern industrial cities. Theirs is a world in which the despair and resentment of Philip Larkin is still the best show in town: It fucks you up your culture/ It doesn&apos;t mean to but it does . . . A pox on all their houses. Last year, along with 19 other unfortunates, I was named as being one of &apos;the best novelists&apos; (under 40) in contemporary Britain. This ushered forth a storm of cultural self-abuse in the press. Pundit after pundit declaimed on the &apos;death&apos; of the English novel. Together with my fellow novelists I was somewhat bemused by this. What exactly was it that we were doing if we weren&apos;t writing English novels? As you can imagine, there was much discussion late into the night. And while we agreed that a particular kind of English novel, a Trollopian (Joanna or otherwise) crudescence of the national persona, was indubitably extinct (and perhaps never really existed except in the minds of members of the Trollope society), the English-language novel was doing just fine, thank you very much. Surely the same is true of English culture? While the old idea of a monocultural scape is impossible to sustain, England as the centre of that great roiling, post-colonial ocean of cultural ferment is alive and kicking.

My involvement dates back to the first awards in 2006 and since its inception a robust and detailed approach has been given to the judging process.

Each year the number and quality of entries increases and I am looking forward to judging the awards again in 2013.&quot;  Prof. Rob Holdway, director Giraffe Innovation Ltd It is always a real pleasure to be involved with the Ethical Awards, alongside such well respected individuals.

Hiroo Onoda, an army intelligence officer, caused a sensation when he was persuaded to come out of hiding in the Philippine jungle in 1974. The native of Wakayama prefecture in western Japan died of heart failure at a hospital in Tokyo on Thursday, his family said. He was 91. Onoda\u2019s three decades spent in the jungle \u2013 initially with three comrades and finally alone \u2013 came to be seen as an example of the extraordinary lengths to which some Japanese soldiers would go to demonstrate their loyalty to the then emperor, in whose name they fought. Refusing to believe that the war had ended with Japan\u2019s defeat in August 1945, Onoda drew on his training in guerilla warfare to kill as many as 30 people whom he mistakenly believed to be enemy soldiers. The world had known of his existence since 1950 when one of his fellow stragglers emerged and returned to Japan. A second member of the group reportedly died in 1950. Onoda, whose sole remaining companion was killed in a shootout with Philippine troops in 1972, held firm until two years later. He was only persuaded to surrender when his former commanding officer travelled to his hideout on the island of Lubang in the north-western Philippines and convinced him that the war had ended. Until then, Onoda would later explain, he believed attempts to persuade him to leave were a plot concocted by the pro-US government in Tokyo. By the time he surrendered he had been on the island since 1944, two years after he was drafted into the Japanese imperial army. Onoda wept uncontrollably as he agreed to lay down his perfectly serviceable rifle. He was later pardoned for the killings by the then Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos. In his formal surrender to Marcos, Onoda wore his 30-year-old imperial army uniform, cap and sword, all of which were in good condition. He returned to Japan in March the same year, but after struggling to adapt to life in his homeland, he emigrated to Brazil in 1975 to become a farmer. He returned to Japan in 1984 and opened nature camps for children across Japan. Japan\u2019s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, praised Onoda\u2019s strong will to live, telling reporters on Friday: &quot;I vividly remember that I was reassured of the end of the war when Mr Onoda returned to Japan.&quot; Onoda was one of several Japanese soldiers who remained holed up in their former battlegrounds long after the war ended. Onoda, like Shoichi Yokoi, a soldier who was found on the island of Guam in 1972, dismissed reports declaring the war\u2019s end as Allied propaganda. On his return to a hero\u2019s welcome in Japan, Yokoi famouslysaid: \u201cIt is with much embarrassment, but I have returned.\u201d In 2005 there were unsubstantiated claims that two former Japanese soldiers in their 80s were still in hiding in the mountains on the Philippine island of Mindanao. The men were reportedly afraid that they would be court-martialled for desertion if they gave themselves up."}, {"sentences": ["Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management in Tokyo, told Bloomberg: &quot;Nintendo needs to expand from their current hardware business model."], "tags": ["Nintendo", "Wii U", "Business", "Games", "Technology", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-17T18:51:22Z", "title": "Wii U's failure to wow leads to Nintendo profit warning", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/17/nintendo-wii-u-sales-profit-warning", "article": "Nintendo&apos;s Wii U video games console, intended to capitalise on the roaring success of 2006&apos;s Wii, has so far flopped \u2013 and is causing problems for the Japanese games company behind Mario the plumber. In an announcement on Friday announcement the company dramatically slashed the number of Wii Us it expects to sell in the 12 months to April from 9m to just 2.8m, and said that it will make an annual loss, with total sales expected to shrink for the second year in a row, rather than growing by one-third. That will mark its third year in a row of making an operating loss. Potential buyers seem to be favouring instead games on smartphones and tablets, a category which has exploded since Nintendo launched its best-selling Wii with the innovative &quot;motion controllers&quot; in December 2006 \u2013 just before the smartphone market began to boom. But now the company has been left adrift as its audience of &quot;casual&quot; gamers has found other outlets. The reduced forecast comes after many observers had said that the 9m sales predicted earlier this year by management for the Wii U was unfeasible following its comparatively small sales of 3.45m in its first year in 2012. Sony and Microsoft have each already outsold that figure with the new PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles released in the autumn. They can rely on committed gamers who will wait for top-end games. Nintendo, by contrast, cannot \u2013 and has declined to make games with characters such as Mario and Zelda available for iPhone, iPad or Android devices. That means it is missing out on a potential market of around a billion users, critics argue. By contrast Sega, a rival Japanese games company which gave up making hardware in 2001, offers games for a range of platforms, including mobile, and has seen revenues and profits grow. Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management in Tokyo, told Bloomberg: &quot;Nintendo needs to expand from their current hardware business model. It&apos;s a structural problem.&quot; Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management, told Reuters: &quot;The fact that the &apos;Wii U strategy&apos; has failed is disappointing and will likely trigger a sell-off as soon as the market opens. The company appears to have failed to differentiate the Wii U from the Wii,&quot; saying that his own 10-year-old son, who owns a Wii and DS handheld console, had shown no interest in the Wii U. Nintendo makes money on sales of both its consoles and the games for them, with franchises involving Mario proving hugely popular. But the revised forecasts pointed to an accelerating weakness in both consoles \u2013 especially handheld ones which compete with phones or tablets \u2013 and the games for them. It halved forecasts for Wii U games, from 38m to 19m, but upped those for the Wii from 2m to 2.6m. For the 3DS handheld, it lowered forecasts from 18m to 13.5m sales, and 3DS games sales from 80m to 66m for the year. Overall, the company has cut its forecast sales by a third, from 920bn yen (\u00a35.4bn) to 590bn, and says it expects to make an operating loss of 35bn yen rather than a profit of 100bn. It had forecast a 55bn net profit, but now says it will make a 25bn yen loss."}, {"sentences": ["Photograph: Dai Kurokawa/epa/Corbis    For those who simply haven&apos;t yet decided what beverage they would most like to bathe in, Yunessun resort in Hakone \u2013 50 miles south of Tokyo \u2013 is the place to find out."], "tags": ["Spa breaks", "Travel", "Health and fitness holidays", "Health & wellbeing"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-17T21:00:00Z", "title": "Spas with a difference: weird baths around the world", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jan/17/spas-weird-baths-around-the-world-beer", "article": "Chodovar beer spa, Czech Republic &quot;Beer wellness land&quot; sounds like the kind of place you try to get to when you&apos;re drowning your sorrows.

The victory by Susumu Inamine, who stood on an anti-base platform in the city of Nago, is a serious setback to efforts by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to move the Futenma marine corps base from a heavily populated part of the island to a more remote site. The base&apos;s uncertain future has been a thorn in the side of relations between Japan and the US, which appeared to have made a breakthrough last month when Okinawa&apos;s governor, Hirokazu Nakaima, ended his opposition to the relocation plan. But the move is opposed by many Okinawans who want it taken off their island altogether. They complain of noise pollution, crime perpetrated by US servicemen and the risk of aircraft accidents. Attempts by Abe to garner support with promises of a huge increase in development aid to Okinawa failed to win over voters. Now, plans to build two new runways on an offshore location in the picturesque Henoko area of Nago will be next to impossible without local consent. Inamine, who was supported by progressive groups opposed to the US military presence on Okinawa, said his victory proved that the city had rejected the plan, which is supposed to begin with land reclamation off Nago&apos;s pristine coastline. Inamine received 19,839 votes, while his pro-base challenger Bunshin Suematsu, who was backed by Abe&apos;s Liberal Democratic party (LDP), got 15,684. &quot;The plan must go back to square one,&quot; Inamine told reporters. &quot;I will reject all procedures that are premised on the landfill project.&quot; The election result leaves the LDP in a difficult position. Further delays will anger the US at a time of rising tensions in the Asia-Pacific, while any attempt to push through construction would provoke more fury in Okinawa. But the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, hinted that the latter option had not been ruled out, citing Inamine&apos;s &quot;limited authority&quot; and support for relocation from Nakaima. &quot;The governor approved the landfill project last year and, while explaining and seeking understanding as much as possible, we want to move ahead,&quot; Suga told reporters. The defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, also said construction would go ahead as planned. &quot;We hope to make steady progress on the relocation plan in order to eliminate risks posed by Futenma,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a local election and I don&apos;t think it will have a direct impact on the relocation issue.&quot; The Futenma question threatens to cast a cloud over US-Japan ties as the allies attempt to address Chinese naval aggression in the region and North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. Senior US officials have voiced irritation that a deal to move the facility, reached in 1996, has made next to no progress. The countries agreed to reduce the US military footprint on the island in the wake of the abduction and rape of a local schoolgirl by three US servicemen a year earlier. In an attempt to further reduce the burden on Okinawa&apos;s civilian population, Washington and Tokyo have agreed to move about 8,000 marines and their dependents to Guam, Hawaii and Australia. Okinawa, which was invaded by US forces at the end of the war and only reverted to Japanese control in 1972, is home to about half the 47,000 US troops stationed in Japan. Although it accounts for just one percent of Japan&apos;s total area, the island hosts about 75% of US bases in Japan. Military facilities take up one-fifth of the island. &quot;Inamine&apos;s victory will give momentum to the anti-base movement and the opposition campaign could spread,&quot; Takashi Kawakami, a professor at Takushoku University, told Reuters. &quot;Abe will probably try to forge ahead but there will probably be an opposition movement \u2026 and if this is reported daily in the media, Abe&apos;s support rates could fall.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["In a rare public intervention by a US official, Washington\u2019s ambassador to Tokyo, Caroline Kennedy, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the dolphin hunt."], "tags": ["Marine life", "Japan", "Environment", "Wildlife", "Food", "Fishing", "Whaling"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-21T03:22:06Z", "title": "Japanese fishermen begin annual slaughter of hundreds of dolphins", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/21/japanese-fishermen-begin-annual-slaughter-of-hundreds-of-dolphins", "article": "Fishermen in Japan began slaughtering hundreds of bottlenose dolphins early on Tuesday morning, campaigners said, despite mounting international calls for the animals to be spared. Members of the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd who are monitoring the annual cull in Taiji, on Japan\u2019s Pacific coast, said local fishermen had started killing an estimated 250 dolphins just before 7.30am. The animals were last week corralled in a cove in the town, which drew international attention in 2009 with the release of the Oscar-winning documentary The Cove. More than 50 of the mammals, including a rare albino calf, were selected and removed from the pod for sale to aquariums and water parks. Together they are expected to fetch millions of dollars. The rest are being slaughtered for their meat, a delicacy that most Japanese shun but which still forms part of the diet in Taiji and other whaling towns. &quot;These dolphins are wrangled and wrestled into the killing cove, where they&apos;ve sustained multiple injuries. Dolphin killers deliberately run over the pod with skiffs, they wrestle them, man-handled them into captive nets before even being slaughtered,&quot; Melissa Sehgal, a Sea Shepherd activist, told Reuters. The methods used to capture and kill the dolphins have attracted widespread condemnation. Fishermen bang metal poles together beneath the water to confuse the animals\u2019 hypersensitive sonar before herding them into shallow water, where they are left for up to several days before being taken to the cove to be slaughtered. Hidden from view beneath tarpaulin covers, the fishermen drive metal rods into the dolphins\u2019 spinal cords and leave them to die. &quot;It takes up to 20 to 30 minutes for these dolphins to die, where they bleed out, suffocate or drown in the process of being dragged to the butcher house,&quot; Sehgal said. They are then taken by boat to a quayside warehouse to be cut up into slabs of meat. \u201cIt is reprehensible that the Taiji dolphin hunters are killing dolphins for human consumption, because all dolphin meat is toxic \u2013 up to 5,000 times more toxic than allowed by the World Health Organisation,\u201d The Cove\u2019s director, Louie Psihoyos, told the Guardian. \u201cThe hunters claim they are poor and need the meat to feed their families, but who would feed poison to their children and parents? The dolphin hunters make up to US$200,000 for each captive dolphin so they are anything but poor. They also claim they are family men, but they have just massacred a whole pod full of families.\u201d The Sea Shepherd activists in Taiji, who call themselves the Cove Guardians, said dozens of animals had been killed by mid-morning, adding that the sea has turned a deep shade of red. \u201cWater of the cove continues to run red with the blood of innocent bottlenose dolphins who have been murdered,\u201d they wrote. In a rare public intervention by a US official, Washington\u2019s ambassador to Tokyo, Caroline Kennedy, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the dolphin hunt. Kennedy tweeted on Saturday: \u201cDeeply concerned by inhumaneness of drive hunt dolphin killing.&quot; She said the US government opposed the practice. In an open letter  to the people of Taiji released Monday, the Japanese artist and peace campaigner Yoko Ono called for an end to the cull. &quot;I understand how you must feel about the one-sidedness of the west to be angry at your traditional capture and slaughter of dolphins,&quot; she wrote. But, Ono added, the slaughter was harming Japan\u2019s international reputation and gave countries such as China and Russia an excuse to \u201cspeak ill of Japan\u201d. She wrote: &quot;The future of Japan and its safety depends on many situations, but what you do with dolphins now can create a very bad relationship with the whole world.&quot;     The annual dolphin hunt in Taiji, Japan Photograph: Seashepherd.org/EPA    On Monday, Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary defended the hunt. &quot;I believe dolphin fishing is one of Japan&apos;s traditional fishing industries and is carried out appropriately in accordance to the law,\u201d Suga told reporters when asked about Kennedy\u2019s comments. \u201cFurthermore, dolphins are not within the management of the International Whaling Commission and it is left to the respective nations to manage this resource. \u201cWe will explain Japan&apos;s position to the American side.&quot; Japanese officials point out that there is no international ban on killing bottlenose dolphins and that the animals are not endangered. Fishermen in Taiji, meanwhile, say the hunt provides a crucial source of income and helps maintain fish stocks in the area. Taiji is regarded as the spiritual home of Japan&apos;s coastal whaling industry. The first hunts took place in the early 1600s, according to the town&apos;s whaling museum, but the industry went into decline after the introduction of a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Dolphins and other small cetaceans are not covered by the ban. But activists questioned Taiji\u2019s claims that dolphin hunting is an important part of the town\u2019s history.\u201cThis claim of \u2018Japanese tradition\u2019 is nonsense,\u201d said Ric O\u2019Barry, a former dolphin trainer who is now director of Earth Island\u2019s dolphin project. \u201cThe dolphin drive hunts, according to the town\u2019s own written history, says a couple of drive hunts occurred in 1936 and 1944, but the current series of hunts only began in 1969. O\u2019Barry said fishermen were killing dolphins for profit under the guise of cultural tradition. \u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThe dolphin hunts are being used by the captivity industry to supply wild dolphins to aquariums in Japan, China, Dubai, and other aquariums all around the world.\u201d Between September and early spring, Japan is permitted to catch up to 20,000 small cetaceans, including pilot whales and porpoises. The meat from a single bottlenose fetches around 50,000 yen, but aquariums and water parks are prepared to pay much more for live specimens. Sea Shepherd says 176 marine mammals have been killed so far this season, including bottlenose, spotted, striped and risso&apos;s dolphins."}, {"sentences": ["The Tokyo-based label began in 1993, was named in homage to Nigo&apos;s favourite film, Planet of the Apes and is\u00a0shortened to &quot;Bape&quot;."], "tags": ["Uniqlo", "Men's fashion", "Life and style", "Fashion", "Pharrell Williams", "Music"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-21T15:21:30Z", "title": "Nigo: 'Uniqlo is streetwear too'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jan/21/nigo-uniqlo-streetwear-bathing-ape", "article": "Fashion is all about names. Everyone knows the ones that have been around for yonks \u2013 Armani, say, or Lagerfeld. The man sitting opposite me might not be quite there but, to some, he&apos;s just as famous. Nigo is the founder of A Bathing Ape. Streetwear nerds \u2013 men who wear limited-edition trainers and oversized slogan T-shirts and make their living designing style magazines \u2013 worship him. As far as this particular faction of fashion goes, I&apos;m in the presence of royalty. For everyone else, here&apos;s the cribsheet. The Tokyo-based label began in 1993, was named in homage to Nigo&apos;s favourite film, Planet of the Apes and is\u00a0shortened to &quot;Bape&quot;. The look was T-shirts, hoodies and caps with prints of apes in various cartoon guises. Stockists were hard to find and customers were only permitted to buy pieces in limited numbers. Growing through word of mouth, it became a global brand that collaborated with Pharrell Williams \u2013 his clothing line Billionaire Boys Club was designed in partnership with Nigo. In Japan, there was a Bape ice-cream parlour and a barber&apos;s shop; a record label was launched, and there were stores in London and New York. So Nigo&apos;s is not a household name, then, but one worshipped within a certain milieu. Bape is in deep with hip-hop \u2013 and its fans. Along with Williams, Kanye West was drenched in the label before he discovered high fashion, and Tyler the Creator still wears it. Their groupies follow suit \u2013 hence the regular queues outside Bape stores worldwide. It&apos;s paid off \u2013 Nigo is sometimes cited as the richest designer in Japan.     Pharrell Williams with Nigo in 2006. Photograph: Evan Agostini/Getty Images    In May 2013, though, he walked away \u2013 in a year when Bape had operating profits of \u00a34.25m. He made the announcement in a typically obtuse way. Posted on his blog (hard to find in itself) was a custom-drawn image by graffiti artist Kaws: a &quot;Bart Simpson&quot; burying a statue of Nigo. &quot;Bape General Nigo (1993-2013)&quot;, it read. Nigo, real name Tomoaki Nagao, is now the general \u2013 or creative director, anyway \u2013 of something else: Uniqlo&apos;s UT line, the T-shirt arm of the Japanese high-street brand. The shirts, in store now, feature familiar brands: Peanuts and Snoopy, Batman and Duff Beer from The Simpsons. It&apos;s an aesthetic that continues Nigo&apos;s trademark graphic, cartoon look. The difference is that it&apos;s now available for the masses. Nigo has changed post-Bape. He was once dwarfed by grills in his mouth, a baseball cap, a Jacob the Jeweller diamond medallion and oversized skate-shaped clothes, but now he has ditched the bling. The 42-year-old wears a trim army-green blazer and jeans. His right wrist is in the kind of brace RSI sufferers use. It doesn&apos;t look as if it is there as a style statement. The badges of cool are no longer so obvious as in his streetwear days. Instead, his look is about function. Softly spoken and talking through an interpretor, the designer is as understated in his answers. &quot;I thought I could be useful,&quot; he says, when asked why working with UT appealed. The ability to work on a mass scale was also a factor. &quot;It was about the global reach of the company,&quot; he says. &quot;UT is streetwear, effectively. It&apos;s what people really wear on the street. It&apos;s interesting for me to be able to influence that.&quot;     A fun retro print by Nigo for Uniqlo. Photograph: Uniqlo    Having expanded in the past decade, Uniqlo&apos;s profits were \u00a31.89bn in the first nine months of 2013 and it now has over 500 stores outside Japan. Most of that profit might come from sales of HeatTech and cashmere jumpers but, as a working environment, it&apos;s a long way from Bape&apos;s beginnings, when it made 30 T-shirts at a time and sold them for \u00a370 a pop. Uniqlo&apos;s red-and-white logo is becoming as familiar as Gap&apos;s navy square and Marks &amp; Spencer&apos;s black and green. A UT T-shirt is priced at less than a tenner. Streetwear as a sphere has changed. Traditionally, it was the slogan-heavy delinquent cousin of tailored menswear, but now the lines are blurring. Much to the chagrin of purists, brands such as Supreme, Palace and Hood by Air are worn as much by the front row as they are by the skate community. Designers including Givenchy&apos;s Riccardo Tisci are turning streetwear shapes such as the basketball vest into four-figure luxury buys. &quot;When I first started out,&quot; says Nigo, &quot;it was almost shocking that the fashion world would pay any attention to street clothing. Now that&apos;s normal, so repeating the same approach seems uninteresting, I think.&quot; He&apos;s moved on. Nigo plays down the cool factor that comes with this kind of instinct but it&apos;s obvious to everyone else. To say that Uniqlo jumped at the chance to work with him would be an understatement. Yuki Katsuta, head of research and design, is like a football manager who has just signed a star striker. &quot;He has a huge knowledge and experience of pop culture,&quot; he says, in raptures. &quot;We believe with [Nigo] that we can move Uniqlo upscale, in a cool way.&quot; This new Nigo is shedding all the bells and whistles of Bape. You get the impression this more low-key incarnation suits him. Asked about his future, he answers with a shy smile. &quot;This is not a one-season thing,&quot; says the interpretor translating his answer. &quot;It&apos;s not a collaboration. It&apos;s my new job.&quot; 5 things that made Nigo an in-the-know legend     Bapesta trainers.    Billionaire Boys ClubLaunched in 2005, Pharrell Williams&apos; clothing line was a collaboration with Bape and greeted with what can only be described as mass hysteria by streetwear enthusiasts. It&apos;s now massive \u2013 with sales in 2013 estimated at between \u00a315m and \u00a318m. The camouflageNigo is obsessed with the Louis Vuitton monogram so he made his own in the form of the now-classic camouflage, with ape heads hidden within it. It&apos;s now everywhere from Rihanna&apos;s trousers to Ferraris. The sports car was camo&apos;d by Bape in 2012. Baby MiloIf the Planet of\u2026 ape stars in Bape&apos;s camo, his cuter cartoon brother Milo has become key too. Reflecting Nigo&apos;s love of characters like Hello Kitty and Mickey Mouse, he simply made his own. The Teriyaki BoyzNigo&apos;s music connections aren&apos;t in name only. Nigo&apos;s band, the Teriyaki Boyz, had a production team for their 2005 debut album that most new bands can only dream of: Daft Punk, the Neptunes and Mark Ronson. The BapestaA sort of hybrid of the Air Force One and the Converse All Star, the Bapesta is a typical Bape concept: nodding to streetwear classics but making something even more desirable.

Earlier, Abe said the frayed relationship between Tokyo and Beijing was similar to the situation in Europe pre-1914. He said a conflict between the two countries would be disastrous, but refused to rule it out. &quot;Trust, not tension, is crucial for peace and prosperity in Asia, and in the rest of the world,&quot; he said. &quot;This can only be achieved through dialogue and the rule of law, and not through force or coercion. &quot;We must restrain military expansion in Asia, which could otherwise go unchecked. We should create a mechanism for crisis management as well as a communication channel between our armed forces.&quot; Relations have soured between Japan and China since Abe became prime minister in 2012, with Beijing irked by what its leaders have seen as a more nationalistic approach to foreign and defence policy. But A flashpoint has been the disputed ownership of islands in the East China Sea but Abe insisted that Japan had no military ambitions. &quot;Japan has sworn an oath never again to wage a war. We have never stopped and will continue to be wishing for the world to be at peace.&quot; Abe&apos;s willingness to take a tougher line with China has accompanied signs that Japan is at last emerging from a 20-year period of sluggish growth. He insisted that a radical new approach to monetary and fiscal policy would be followed by supply-side reforms including a big increase in the number of women working. &quot;Japan&apos;s economy is just about to break free from chronic deflation. This spring, wages will increase. Higher wages, long overdue, will lead to greater consumption. &quot;Pundits used to say Japan was at dusk, or the land of the setting sun. They said that for a country as mature as Japan, growth would be impossible. These arguments were made to sound almost legitimate. &quot;It is not twilight, but a new dawn that is breaking over Japan.&quot; Abe&apos;s critics have said that he was quick to fire the first two &quot;arrows&quot; of Abenomics \u2013 a quantitative easing programme to raise inflation to 2% and increases in public spending to boost growth, followed by tax increases \u2013 but slow to let loose the third arrow of supply-side reform. But Abe said he was taking measures to cut corporate taxes, attract inward investment and increase female participation. He pledged that by 2020 he would ensure that 30% of leading positions in business were occupied by women, a far higher percentage than in either Britain or the US. &quot;Japan is becoming a super-ageing society, even as the number of children is falling. You might find yourself asking, &apos;In such a country, where will you find those innovative and creative human resources?&apos;&quot; Noting that Japan&apos;s GDP could be boosted by 16% if women&apos;s participation in the labour market was raised to the level of men&apos;s, he added that it was time to break the male stranglehold. &quot;Japan&apos;s corporate culture is still one of pinstripes and button-downs. After all, the female labour force in Japan is the most underutilised resource.

The Pan-American route, which as Argentina will qualify through South America will mostly involve working out a way to beat Canada \u2013 a concept so amenable to USA Rugby that last year\u00a0they tried to turn it into a meme \u2013 is the most likely. Hawkins, who\u00a0was appointed coach in August last year, after a long run in the team that he ended as captain, says:  It\u2019s something I think about daily. How can you not? It\u2019s the Olympic Games. It\u2019s the pinnacle.  To aid his attempt to reach that pinnacle \u2013 and once there to re-plant the American flag, given that the Olympic title still belongs to the Americans who won it in 1924 \u2013 Hawkins has secured an expansion of his team&apos;s presence at the Olympic Training Centre, near his San Diego home. In early January, alongside 18 women, a men&apos;s squad of 25 was announced. \u201cFirst and foremost,\u201d Hawkins says, down the phone from Chula Vista, \u201cfor a lot of national sevens programmes, their success is based around the depth of their squad. It\u2019s been tough to build the depth when we\u2019ve only had 14 or 15 names working full-time.\u00a0So our No1 priority is to have true depth. Hopefully at some point we\u2019ll have 30 guys who can fight for a place on that 12-man squad at each World Series event.\u201d Hawkins&apos; selection for Vegas illustrates his point. Key names such as Zack Test, a former University of Oregon wide receiver who was a tournament MVP last year, the prolific try-scorer Nick Edwards and the storied \u201cfastest man in rugby\u201d, Carlin Isles, are present. But few others, whether named to play at the Sam Boyd Stadium or for a Falcons select in the Las Vegas Invitational, could be considered \u201cnames\u201d anywhere outside their own households. \u201cWe want to show progress,\u201d says Hawkins. \u201cI\u2019ve been with the programme for eight years now and I can promise you, three years ago even though there were 22 guys coming into camp before we selected the squads to travel, there were a good few who at the end of the day really shouldn\u2019t have been there.\u201d         Highlights of the 2013 USA Sevens in Las Vegas.    So should the Eagles be there or thereabouts when the reckoning arrives in Vegas on Sunday? Will they? Based on their displays in 2013-14 so far, the answer has to be a resounding \u201cno\u201d. The US are 4-12 from tournaments in Australia, Dubai and South Africa. In the last two events they have won only once, against the less than mighty Spain, and Canada are five points ahead in the series table. Fortunately, in Vegas the Eagles have been drawn with Spain, Argentina and France. Progress to the cup competition \u2013 first-round losers also play on, for lesser prizes \u2013 should not be an impossibility.\u00a0 Hawkins says \u201cthe players are working extremely hard\u201d, and adds:  I guarantee that they are more frustrated than anyone in USA rugby about the way the results have gone so far. But it\u2019s up to them, and the coaches, to make sure that they go out there now and get the job done.  Nonetheless, he says critics of the team&apos;s displays this season \u201chave to look at the big picture\u201d. \u201cIf you look at the USA last year,\u201d Hawkins continues,\u00a0referring to eye-catching performances in Tokyo, Glasgow and London, \u201cwe really had a three-tournament high. We really needed to stay as a core team, we had a fight to stay alive, we knew we had to fight to finish above three other teams and avoid a relegation tournament. So for those three events we played with pressure and we built something really special. \u201cBut then that pressure was released and we went off to the World Cup and we didn\u2019t produce anything close to what we had produced in those three tournaments.\u201d The US slumped in Moscow,\u00a0the last global showpiece before the Olympics, and there has been precious little encouragement since.\u00a0Nonetheless, Hawkins insists:\u00a0  As a programme we are where we need to be.\u00a0Over the last five years we\u2019ve shown pieces of brilliance and we\u2019ve achieved things \u2013 we made a final [in Adelaide in 2010, losing to Samoa], we made a semi-final. So there are the bits and pieces there. But for us it\u2019s about understanding that we\u2019ve got a lot of young guys. The talent is getting better and it\u2019s getting younger, and we\u2019ve got more of an opportunity to get these guys in and work with them.  Among such talent now working at Chula Vista are five members of the military, supported by the World Class Athlete Program, and two players plucked from the college game. One of those,\u00a0Dartmouth&apos;s Madison Hughes\u00a0(the hard-charging\u00a0Danny Barrett, a recent University of California\u00a0graduate\u00a0who has made the squad for Vegas, is the other), is generating some serious buzz. \u201cHe\u2019s produced some great stuff at the college level and he\u2019s spent a little bit of time at the training centre over the past two years,\u201d says Hawkins of Hughes, who was educated at Wellington College, a power in English schools sevens. \u201cWe\u2019re working with him and working with Dartmouth \u2013 he\u2019s taken a semester off so he\u2019ll be with us for a couple of months. Hopefully he fights his way into the top 12. \u201cI think what people need to understand is that yes, he\u2019s a great college player and an exciting talent, but taking that next step is really tough. We have to manage that process as best we can.\u00a0We\u2019ve got a lot of youngsters like him, showing real promise. What they need is the opportunity to train and develop here at the centre, and to be given guidance about what the next level is.\u201d     Carlin Isles fends off a Kenyan defender. Photograph: Matt Roberts/Getty Images    One man who may continue to be given opportunities despite not being based at the OTC is the Seattle-based\u00a0Miles Craigwell, a former Brown linebacker who was briefly with the Miami Dolphins. He will play in the Invitational this weekend, monitored by Eagles coaches for possible involvement in New Zealand next month. Another gridiron-raised player,\u00a0the extraordinarily swift but still rugby raw Carlin Isles, is set to play in the main event, despite having generated headlines by signing a practice contract with the Detroit Lions. \u201cCarlin is with us, he\u2019s full-time,\u201d says Hawkins. \u201cHe went and did some stuff with the Lions and there is an opportunity for him to do something more with them maybe, to get involved in a rookie camp. We had a conversation when we all came back here and started training again. If he wants to go and become a football player, we will support him in that.  His going to the Lions may open doors for us and for rugby, who knows.\u00a0We\u2019re just not big enough to hold on to people like that if they want to go and look at such opportunities.  Nor, as it happens, have the Eagles been able to hold on to two other players who thrived on the world circuit last season. Luke Hulme had a trial with Gloucester and has now signed for Narbonne; the similarly quick\u00a0Blaine Scully is doing well with Leicester. Again, Hawkins puts his best foot forward. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge positive, it really is. For a long time now we\u2019ve been looking to get some of our guys out into European rugby, because they\u2019re playing a lot there and that\u2019s good for them.\u201d\u00a0 Such players may yet come back into the US rugby mix as the Olympics approach. It&apos;s a mix that, World Sevens stutters notwithstanding, is becoming rather interesting. The 15-a-side Eagles ended 2013 with a tremendous display in defeat by the Maori All Blacks and two victories in Europe, and next face a World Cup qualifier against Uruguay in March. Their highly promising young No8, Cam Dolan, has gone to England to play for Northampton. In November, USA Rugby\u00a0announced a deal with a private company, Serevi Rugby, to run talent-spotting camps across the country. The endeavour begins next month and Hawkins, who also works for Serevi, will be fully involved.     Matt Hawkins takes a youth training session. Photograph: Serevi    So much, one might say, for the future. The present, with sevens heavyweights like New Zealand, South Africa, Fiji and England in town, is demanding enough. But in recent seasons the Eagles have competed well with all those teams and more. The potential is undoubtedly there. \u201cDo we want to get wins in the World Series?\u201d Hawkins asks. \u201cAbsolutely.\u00a0A win\u2019s a win, right? We want a winning culture and the more wins the guys can get the more confidence they can get. It all flows. \u201cBut we\u00a0have\u00a0to understand that 18 months from now it will be really, really important. We have to build now, and then we can build this powerhouse and &apos;awaken the giant&apos; and all the things that people like to talk about when it comes to US rugby. We have to do the hard work now.\u201d That hard work starts at 6.12pm Vegas time on Friday (9.12pm ET),\u00a0when the Eagles face the Pumas of Argentina.\u00a0 The USA Sevens will be\u00a0broadcast live on NBC"}, {"sentences": ["From Tokyo, Shanghai, Lagos or Rio \u2013 cities that will have more than 20 million inhabitants by 2030 \u2013 Greater London and Paris Grand, with a combined population of 20 million, may well be seen as a single conurbation."], "tags": ["Paris", "London", "UK news", "France", "World news", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-23T13:40:37Z", "title": "London and Paris: we could soon be part of the same conurbation | Anne Hidalgo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/23/london-paris-soon-same-conurbation", "article": "To Boris Johnson: our two great cities have a special relationship that, in all likelihood, will deepen and strengthen as the world becomes more globalised. So, yes, in many ways, London is a suburb of Paris and Paris is a suburb of London. If one takes a global vision, London and Paris are increasingly close. With Eurostar, London&apos;s St Pancras and the Gare du Nord are just over two hours apart. Ask a Chinese tourist and an American student touring Europe. Ask the numerous professionals who commute several times a week, if not every day. Ask an international investor or an entrepreneur looking for opportunities. Ask our youth who jump on the train to party across the Channel. People are increasingly linked and mobile. This narrows the distance between us. To use the term coined by sociologist Saskia Sassen, London and Paris are &quot;global cities&quot; or &quot;villes-monde&quot;. As such, they have links that go across national borders. These connections are the very source of our common strength. In a globalised world, the winners will be those who build networks. To be successful, let us avoid unnecessary parochialism. While drafting my programme for Paris 2020, I was inspired by the visions of other great cities \u2013 including London, New York, Singapore, Sydney and Vancouver. One striking feature of their visions is that many of the challenges, objectives and strategies are similar, if not identical. Some issues are localised, but we are all dealing with sustainable development, efficient transport systems, energy savings, innovation ecosystems, food supply, resilience ... All those long-term visions are based on pillars for which co-operation is vital. This is not to deny that our market economies are defined by competition \u2013 the City of London is a major financial centre competing with Paris&apos;s \u2013 but the future of our urban systems lies in the collaboration needed to adapt to the 21st century&apos;s challenges. As a parallel, think about the intensity of the entrepreneurial spirit within science parks and business incubators: the attitudes are competitive \u2013 becoming the best, the first, the fastest is a driver for excellence. However, it does not prevent people from collaborating on many issues. Partnership is actually the raison d&apos;\u00eatre of those structures and spaces. I look forward to the same degree of cross-fertilisation between our cities. We need to exchange ideas and best practices better, benchmark our results to see what works in all our majors concerns, from security to housing, through culture and tourism. The attractiveness of our cities ought to be a common goal, beyond slogans. In the competition of an increasingly connected world, the size and diversity of skills and resources will matter. From Tokyo, Shanghai, Lagos or Rio \u2013 cities that will have more than 20 million inhabitants by 2030 \u2013 Greater London and Paris Grand, with a combined population of 20 million, may well be seen as a single conurbation. Indeed, in this not-too-distant future, London and Paris together could be seen from Asia, Latin America or Africa as a solid partner, possessing a critical mass of resources to reckon with. That&apos;s if we can find a way to collaborate effectively."}, {"sentences": ["She won four gold medals, and her attention switched to the 1964 Tokyo Games.", "Even so, she remained part of Australia&apos;s squad for the Tokyo Olympics.", "Tokyo was to prove the final round in the slugging match between Dawn and the AASA."], "tags": ["Swimming", "Fitness", "Life and style", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-24T14:46:00Z", "title": "Heroes of swimming: Dawn Fraser", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-swimming-blog/2014/jan/24/dawn-fraser-heroes-swimming", "article": "How about this for a swimming epitaph to be proud of? It&apos;s from the 1965 International Swimming Hall of Fame entry for Dawn Fraser:  &quot;Her good times were not all in the water. Her rule-breaking has been almost as dramatic as her record-breaking.&quot;  Of course, the idea of rule-breaking by Aussie swimmers won&apos;t be new to anyone who follows the news. In 2008, Nick D&apos;Arcy was booted out of the Olympic squad after assaulting another swimmer, Simon Cowley (who suffered a broken jaw, eye socket, cheekbone and nose in the attack). More recently, stories of sexual harassment and drug-fuelled initiation rites swirled around the underperforming 2012 Olympic squad, after which the head coach resigned and several swimmers were fined. To be mentioned alongside such a crew, Dawn Fraser must have been a wild child indeed, right? Well, no. Not unless you count marching in the Olympic opening ceremony, wearing the wrong swimming costume, or trying (and failing) to steal a souvenir flag as seriously bad behaviour. Fraser was a brilliant swimmer, probably the most dominant in the world during the 1950s and 60s. She was the first ever to win the same event at three consecutive Olympics. She was the first female to swim 100m freestyle in less than a minute, and later set an astounding world record of 58.9secs \u2013 a time that remained the world&apos;s best for 14 years. But her career was marred by clashes with Australia&apos;s swimming authorities, whose response to Fraser&apos;s spirited personality was to try to crush it. Fraser was born in the Sydney suburb of Balmain in 1937. Today it&apos;s a gentrified inner-harbour district, where the renovated homes command prices their original inhabitants wouldn&apos;t have believed. In 1937, though, Balmain was solidly working class, an area of foundries, boilermakers and shipbuilding yards. It hadn&apos;t been long since sooty-faced pit workers walked home through the streets: a nearby coalmine had only closed in 1931. This was where the Australian Labour party formed in 1891, part of its charter &quot;to eliminate exploitation&quot;. Not necessarily, then, a place imbued with respect for the authorities. Legend says that Dawn was talent-spotted bombing up and down a sea pool by Harry Gallagher. Gallagher was manager of the nearby Drummoyne baths, and one of Australia&apos;s best coaches. He persuaded Dawn to join his training group (actually, he followed her home from the pool and knocked on the door \u2013 not something a prospective coach would be advised to do today). Gallagher was so excited by this new talent that he even waived his usual fee of 12 guineas. Soon after, Fraser had her first brush with authority. She was disqualified from an amateur race on the grounds that she had been associated with a professional club. (In those days, professionalism was a bit like ringworm: you could catch it by contact.) Fraser was forced to stay away from racing until it was established that she&apos;d never been paid to swim.     Dawn Fraser swimming freestyle. Photograph: Mondadori via Getty Images    Once she was allowed back in the water, Dawn&apos;s talent began to shine through, and by the time the Olympic trials for the 1956 Games were done, she was world record holder for the 100m, 200m and 220 yards freestyle. At the Games, she led a clean sweep for Australia in the 100m freestyle: Fraser first, Lorraine Crapp second, Faith Leech third. At the next Olympics, in Rome in 1960, Fraser again finished a clear winner. It was a record-equalling performance: only two other swimmers \u2013 previously featured Heroes Duke Kahanamoku and Johnny Weissmuller \u2013 had ever won the same event at successive Olympics. You might think the Australian Amateur Swimming Association (AASA) would have cheered this achievement to the rafters \u2013 but you&apos;d be wrong. Fraser had racked up several minor misdemeanours at the Rome Games, including not wearing the team tracksuit to receive her medal and allegedly taking part in an unauthorised event in Switzerland. The AASA decided to ban her from competition for two years. (Today, a two-year ban is typical for a first-time drugs offence. The penalty for not wearing the team tracksuit is unknown to Heroes of swimming.) Fraser was \u2013 conveniently for the AASA \u2013 back racing in time for the 1962 Commonwealth Games in Perth. She won four gold medals, and her attention switched to the 1964 Tokyo Games. In the lead-up to the Games, though, tragedy struck: Fraser was badly injured in a car wreck that took her mother&apos;s life, and spent nine miserable weeks with her neck and back in a steel brace. Even so, she remained part of Australia&apos;s squad for the Tokyo Olympics. Tokyo was to prove the final round in the slugging match between Dawn and the AASA. She won 100m freestyle gold, the first ever consecutive-Olympics hat-trick \u2013 but that became a side-story. After she&apos;d finished competing, Fraser and a couple of others launched a raid on the avenue leading to the Imperial Palace, hunting for souvenir flags. It&apos;s far from a one-off occurrence among contest swimmers to try and bag an unofficial memento \u2013 but Dawn and her compatriots were unfortunate enough to be nabbed in the act. They were arrested, then released when the police realised whom they&apos;d caught, and finally presented with a flag as a gift the next day. For the AASA, it was the final straw. Already in trouble for marching in the opening ceremony against team orders, then wearing an unofficial swimsuit in her races, Fraser was banned from swimming for 10 years. If that seems a draconian sanction, it&apos;s because it was. It&apos;s hard to imagine any other country handing down such a ban for, essentially, high spirits. But those were the days of the cultural cringe, when many leading Australians feared the critical judgment of the rest of the world. Dawn herself also thought there was an element of class in her treatment. A girl from Balmain was expected to toe the line and show gratitude for her opportunities, not embarrass her benefactors. Fraser got on with her life. She retired from swimming, married, had a daughter, became a publican then a politician, a member of the New South Wales parliament. Her ban had eventually been reduced to four years, leaving her theoretically eligible for the 1972 Games, but by then she&apos;d been too long out of the training pool. Even for one of the 20th century&apos;s greatest swimmers, there could be no way back. Today, Dawn Fraser works with a range of charities and \u2013 as you might expect of someone who so strongly embodies the larrikin spirit \u2013 is one of the most popular sporting figures in Australia."}, {"sentences": ["And, as the economy has turned around, Japan&apos;s people have become more vibrant and upbeat \u2013 a mood reflected in public enthusiasm over the choice of Tokyo to host the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games."], "tags": ["Shinzo Abe", "World news", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-24T15:19:39Z", "title": "Shinzo Abe: a new dawn is breaking over Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/jan/24/shinzo-abe-japan-new-dawn", "article": "For years, pundits called Japan the land of the setting sun. They said that for an economy as mature as Japan&apos;s, growth would be impossible. They said that our public debt was unsustainable. They pointed to our supposed psyche of resignation as a symptom of relative decline. But now such voices are rarely heard. Japan&apos;s economy has swung from negative to positive growth and is on the verge of breaking free from chronic deflation. This spring, wages will increase \u2013 a long overdue development that will lead to greater consumption. Our fiscal position has also improved steadily, with my government on track to consolidate public finances. And, as the economy has turned around, Japan&apos;s people have become more vibrant and upbeat \u2013 a mood reflected in public enthusiasm over the choice of Tokyo to host the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. So it is not twilight, but a new dawn, that is breaking over Japan. And that is because we have overcome the notion that certain reforms could never be carried out. I have maintained that I am willing to act like a drill bit, strong enough to break through the solid rock of vested interests. And so we have. For example, we will completely liberalise Japan&apos;s electricity market. By the time the Olympians arrive in six years, the power sector will be fully competitive, with electricity generation separated from distribution. We will also foster medical care as an industry. Japan is on the forefront of regenerative medicine, and we will make it possible to generate stem cells at private-sector labs. And I have just proposed additional reforms, because we also need large-scale health-care providers in the form of holding companies, much like America&apos;s Mayo Clinic. Moreover, we are eliminating the &quot;rice production adjustment&quot; system, which has been in place for more than 40 years. Barriers to private companies&apos; entry into the agricultural sector will be removed, and farmers will be allowed to grow the crops they want, without official control over supply and demand. Soon, our deregulation package will be set in motion. Over the next two years, in designated areas, no vested interests will remain impervious. For example, in Japanese cities aspiring to world-class status, limits on floor space will become a thing of the past. We will soon see high-quality housing, business complexes, and zero-emissions towns appearing, one after another. Likewise, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will remain a central pillar of my economic policies, and we will press ahead with the Japan-European Union Economic Partnership Agreement. As a result, Japan&apos;s economy will become even more deeply integrated into global flows of knowledge, trade, and investment. Companies and people from abroad will find Japan among the most business-friendly places in the world. Japan&apos;s management of public funds \u2013 such as the Government Pension Investment Fund, which now holds about $1.2 trillion \u2013 will also undergo far-reaching change. We will press ahead with reforms, including a review of the GPIF&apos;s portfolio, to ensure that public funds contribute to growth-nurturing investments. We must also make our corporate taxes internationally competitive. In April, the tax rate on companies will fall by 2.4 percentage points. And we will put in place tax incentives aimed at encouraging companies to use their cash for capital investment, research and investment, and wage increases. At the same time, we will reform labour-market rules that tie workers to old industries. New industries require innovative and creative human resources, and we will redirect our subsidies so that workers without meaningful employment in declining industries can move on and find rewarding work in rising sectors. Of course, given that Japan&apos;s population is rapidly aging, and the number of children is falling, investors find themselves asking an obvious question: &quot;Where will Japan find the innovative and creative human resources that it needs?&quot; Arianna Huffington once quipped that if Lehman Brothers had been &quot;Lehman Brothers and Sisters,&quot; the firm would have survived. Japan&apos;s corporate culture is even more male-dominated \u2013 a world of pinstripes and button-downs. I was greatly encouraged when Hillary Clinton told me that Japan&apos;s GDP could be 16% larger if women participated in the labour market at the same rate as men. Indeed, Japan&apos;s female labour force is the economy&apos;s most underused resource. Japan must become a place where women shine. By 2020, we want women to occupy 30% of leading management positions \u2013 a goal that presupposes a more flexible working environment, as well as support from foreign workers to take over domestic and personal services. A major impetus for change will come in the form of legal reforms, to be introduced at the next parliamentary session, that will increase the number of external directors on corporate boards. Next month, we will also propose a stewardship code that will enable institutional investors to play a greater role in corporate governance. I am confident that the combined effect of these reforms will enable Japan to double its inward direct investment by 2020, rebooting the entire country and changing its economic landscape dramatically. But there is still much to do. Soon, three years will have passed since the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami struck northeastern Japan on 11 March 2011, causing the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. While the recovery is far from complete, the love and compassion reflected in the world&apos;s response touched us deeply, as has the survivors&apos; spirit of perseverance and mutual aid to overcome hardship. It is in the same spirit that Japan is now set to contribute even more positively to world peace and development. In our age, no single country can preserve peace by itself. None of us alone can solve the challenges that the world faces without helping one another. In Cambodia, for example, a Japanese-built hospital for mothers and newborns has helped to reduce the country&apos;s infant-mortality rate. In the Philippines, Japan&apos;s Self-Defense Forces mounted a major relief effort after the devastating typhoon in November. And our servicemen and women based in Djibouti remain on high alert against piracy, protecting ships from around the world. Japan is surrounded by neighbours with unlimited possibilities: China, South Korea, the ASEAN countries, India, Russia, and, across the Pacific Rim, the TPP partner countries. Indeed, with Asia becoming the engine driving the world economy, the need to achieve lasting peace and prosperity has never been greater, because the global knock-on effect of any threat to regional stability would be enormous. The foundation underpinning prosperity is freedom of movement for people and goods. On sea-lanes, in air space, and now in outer space and cyber space, freedom of movement must remain secure. The only way to maintain these indispensable public goods is by rigorously upholding the rule of law and promoting fundamental values like freedom, human rights, and democracy. There is no alternative. Asia&apos;s growth dividend must not be wasted on military expansion. We must use it to invest in innovation and human capital, which will further boost growth in the region. As is true elsewhere, trust among Asian countries is crucial for their peace and prosperity, and this can be achieved only through dialogue and adherence to international law, not through force or intimidation. In order to create a region of trust and order, I would like to appeal to Asia and the world. To prevent unchecked military expansion in Asia, defence budgets should be made completely transparent, with verifiable public disclosure. Moreover, Asian governments should create a mechanism for crisis management and strong communication channels among our armed forces. We must also establish rules that promote behaviour based on international maritime law. Only then can we achieve lasting growth and prosperity in Asia, enabling all of us in the region to realise our great potential. Japan has pledged that it will never again wage war, and we have never stopped working for a world that is at peace. It is my fervent hope that Japan&apos;s economic revival, with its promise of increased global and regional prosperity, will help to bring such a world closer. \u2022 Shinzo Abe is Prime Minister of Japan Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2014."}, {"sentences": ["The three copies are on public display in Amsterdam, Philadelphia and on the 42nd floor of a Tokyo skyscraper."], "tags": ["Van Gogh", "National Gallery", "Exhibitions", "Art and design", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-24T17:18:00Z", "title": "Two Van Gogh sunflower paintings displayed together at National Gallery", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jan/24/two-van-gogh-sunflower-paintings-displayed-together-national-gallery", "article": "&quot;I&apos;ve counted six so far,&quot; said a visitor examining what will be one of the rarest and most stupendous spot the difference challenges imaginable \u2013 two of Van Gogh&apos;s sunflower paintings side by side for a once-in-a-lifetime display at the National Gallery. The two versions of the same subject have gone on public display for three months, reunited in London for the first time since 1947 when they were brought together for a Van Gogh exhibition at what is now Tate Britain. The reuniting is an undeniably special moment. One is owned by the National Gallery and the other by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam and both are among the most popular paintings they own. &quot;It has taken 65 years to happen and will probably take another 65 for it to happen again because both paintings are so central to what our museums do,&quot; said the National Gallery&apos;s curator of post-18th century paintings, Christopher Riopelle. &quot;I&apos;m sure there are people in Amsterdam now swearing because they&apos;ve gone to the museum and Sunflowers isn&apos;t there.&quot; Visitors entering Room 46 of the National Gallery will see the London Sunflowers, one of four that Van Gogh made to decorate a bedroom in his &quot;yellow house&quot; in Arles for his visiting friend Paul Gauguin. On its right is one of the three copies that Van Gogh later made. Martin Bailey, author of the recently published The Sunflowers Are Mine, said people would inevitably compare the two to see what changes he made. The differences are both subtle and obvious: the copy is a bit taller for example, because Van Gogh wanted more of a margin at the top. His Vincent signatures are in slightly different places on the pots, to maybe give a better balance, and the colours in the Amsterdam version are more stylised \u2013 botanically incorrect but perhaps more interesting. Bailey said there was no big revelation in having them side by side &quot;but it is more that people will appreciate them in a deeper and more meaningful way&quot;. Senior conservator at the Van Gogh Museum, Ella Hendricks, knows every millimetre of the paintings but even for her seeing them side by side &quot;was also an eye opener&quot;. She said: &quot;It is almost like a spot the difference game and the differences became obvious.&quot; The National Gallery bought its Sunflowers direct from the artist&apos;s family in 1924 and it has become an integral part of its collection. In the gallery&apos;s shop you can purchase nearly 100 different types of sunflowers merchandise \u2013 from a single handmade chocolate square (\u00a31.25) to a coaster (\u00a36), a cushion (\u00a335) and a pearl bangle (\u00a3125). Of the four original sunflower paintings, only three still exist after one was destroyed in an American bombing raid on Japan during the second world war. The remaining originals are the one in the National Gallery, another in Munich and a third that has been squirrelled away in a private collection since 1948, the last time it was seen in public. The three copies are on public display in Amsterdam, Philadelphia and on the 42nd floor of a Tokyo skyscraper. Getting two together is remarkable. Getting more than that would be &quot;everyone&apos;s dream&quot; but unlikely, said Riopelle. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to happen.&quot; Amsterdam&apos;s loan follows a reciprocal one by London last year, marking the reopening of the Van Gogh Museum after renovation. Also on display are the results of recent scientific research by both institutions giving new insights into how he painted his sunflowers and what materials he used. The gallery is anticipating big demand and, because only so many people can be in the room at one time, will operate a queuing system at busy times. The series come from Van Gogh&apos;s most infamous year \u2013 it was 1888 that he had his nervous breakdown, cut off part of his ear and went into an asylum. People have their own reasons for adoring Sunflowers and it often has something to do with the cycle of life feel to them \u2013 there are buds, flowers in full health and dieing ones. Bailey said: &quot;I hope that people will look afresh at something we all think we know. Superficially it is such a simple image but it has enormous power.&quot; \u2022 The Sunflowers are at the National Gallery from 25 January-27 April.

In a time fractions outside his T44 Paralympic 100m world record of 10.75sec, he explains that he wants to smash the 10-second barrier, be as big a cross-over star as Oscar Pistorius, and leave an everlasting mark on his sport. And he is just warming up. Browne has a reputation for not only stirring the pot but attaching a high-speed blender to it. Yet the 22-year-old American, who competes in the Glasgow British Athletics International Match on Saturday afternoon, says he is more soothsayer than provocateur. &quot;I call it as I see it,&quot; he says. &quot;I got a lot of backlash for saying I was going to break the world record and beat Jonnie Peacock in the Anniversary Games but hey, I did everything I said I was going to do.&quot; Ask him to forecast the year ahead and Browne shoots further into the stratosphere. &quot;I feel like 10.2sec is a possibility,&quot; he says. &quot;After we did the Great City Games in Newcastle, [the American sprinter] Mike Rodgers told me &apos;you can run 10.2 easy&apos;, so that&apos;s the aim. But by 2016 I believe I could be running sub-10, so come Rio there could be an amputee \u2013 myself \u2013 lined up at the Olympic Games in a 4x100m or in the 100m or 200m.&quot; Browne knows most people believe such hyper-accelerated improvement is impossible. He has heard similar sentiments before. It is tinnitus in his ears, something to tune out until he forgets that it is even there. And why should Browne believe the sceptics, given the strides he has taken since losing his right leg in 2010? Attempting to take refuge from a storm he slipped on a mat at a laundromat and crashed through the front-door glass, shredding his leg; 14 surgeries later it had to be removed. Browne overcame that hurdle. Now he wants to clear others. He says he is significantly stronger after months of winter training and in Glasgow intends to show it. &quot;I&apos;ve been working on my technique because I don&apos;t want to run like an amputee,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve been watching people like Asafa Powell run. He is amazing. &quot;He wastes no motion. If I can learn how to move down the track in one direction instead of all this rattling around, my 60m time will be ridiculous. I&apos;m already the first amputee to go sub-seven. I went to 6.9sec last year, so I feel I can even go faster in Glasgow.&quot; Browne&apos;s only disappointment is that his arch-nemesis Jonnie Peacock will not be there, having suffered a minorniggle in training. But he knows there will be other times, and more important duels. &quot;The thing about Jonnie and I is that we&apos;re both so young,&quot; says Browne. &quot;He&apos;s only 20, and I&apos;m 22, so we&apos;ll be doing this going into Rio and possibly on into Tokyo. It&apos;s going to be a fun few years.&quot; Browne is one of the star attractions of Saturday&apos;s meeting which sees a British team take on Scotland, the US and a Commonwealth Select squad. Also competing are the Olympic long jump champion, Greg Rutherford, the high jump bronze medallist Robbie Grabarz and the world 100m finalist James Dasaolu. But while Browne praises British athletics for being bold enough to include able-bodied athletes and Paralympians on the same bill, he feels that the IAAF attitude to Paralympians competing in the Olympics needs clarifying. &quot;The IAAF made the comment that there&apos;s 150 people who ran faster than my world record,&quot; he says. &quot;But we&apos;re going to see times this year that are going to make people change their minds about what is possible in amputee sprinting, whether it&apos;s me, or Alan Oliveira or Jonnie going 10.5, 10.4 or even 10.2 sec. I think IAAF need to get together and get their rules ready for 2016 because, trust me, we are coming.&quot; Few doubt that. It&apos;s just a question of how quickly they arrive. Last year Browne took nearly three-tenths off his 100m PB while Oliveira, the fastest man in the T43 category for double amputees, ran 10.57sec for the 100m and 20.6sec for the 200m. Oliveira&apos;s progress, in particular, has led one prominent sport scientist to predict the Brazilian could win a medal in the 400m in Rio. But while some are concerned that Oliveira gains too much of an advantage because, as a double amputee, his blades give him extra spring and power, Browne is not overly concerned. &quot;I don&apos;t care if you have one leg, two legs, three legs, four legs \u2013 running is running,&quot; he says. &quot;I have to drive my knees and pump my legs with as much force as Usain Bolt, Justin Gatlin or anybody else who is an elite sprinter. Over longer distances Paralympians have an advantage, but not in the sprints.&quot; Gatlin was one of the stars, along with Michael Phelps and Lolo Jones, that Browne met when the US Olympic and Paralympic teams visited the White House after London 2012. At the time Browne was shocked that they knew his name. Come Rio, he expects everyone will.

Our first and main motivation was to keep it visually simple but powerful by iconising the most outstanding buildings in the world. We began by making a list of &quot;the unquestionables&quot;, architects who laid the foundations of modern architecture: Le Corbusier, Mies Van der Rohe, Oscar Niemeyer, Louis Kahn, Philip Johnson, Frank Lloyd Wright. The first problem we encountered was that the list was too long, so we had to find a system for narrowing it down. This is how we came up with the idea of creating an alphabetical list, and thus limiting our selection to 26 architects and their respective buildings, achieving this way the initial simplicity and brevity we had hoped for. During our search we also made some wonderful and unexpected discoveries like the Greek architect, engineer and composer Iannis Xenakis, who designed the Philips Pavilion, which was inspired by the sheet music of one of his musical compositions. Interestingly, he was also Le Corbusier&apos;s engineer. \u00a0 By combining our two professions we realised that we were able to familiarise the general public with the basic principles of modern architecture. That&apos;s why we made a second project to explain the five points for a new architecture proposed by Le Corbusier in 1926 using his masterpiece, The Villa Savoye.      Reading on mobile?

There is no immediate sign of the destruction the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused here and in dozens of other cities, towns and villages. Small groups of Christmas revellers spill out of restaurants on to icy pavements. Every few blocks, the monotony of shuttered shops is broken by statues of cartoon characters \u2013 a nod to a nearby museum dedicated to the works of the manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori. It is only when viewed from a nearby hilltop that the full extent of the destruction wrought on Ishinomaki, in Miyagi prefecture, becomes apparent. The city centre is no more. All that is left is a huge swath of flat land, reduced to rubble by the tsunami that struck on the afternoon of 11 March. More than 4m tonnes of debris left in the tsunami&apos;s wake has been removed. Reaching as high as 20 metres (66ft) in places, the waves destroyed or damaged more than 50,000 buildings. By the time the tsunami receded, 3,162 of Ishinomaki&apos;s residents were dead. Around 430 are still missing. Rebuilding the city, the worst affected of all the tsunami-hit communities, will take at least 10 years and cost more than 1 trillion yen (\u00a35.8bn). That process will begin with repairs to the shattered port, sea walls, roads and bridges and other infrastructure. About Y100bn has been earmarked for new public housing, and Y120bn to relocate the 15,000 residents still living in temporary housing. Almost three years on from one of the worst natural disasters in Japan&apos;s history, it is tempting to conclude that little has changed since then. But there are signs that some semblance of civic life is returning, with the momentum provided by local residents frustrated by bureaucracy and political dawdling.     Tsunami defences are seen amid sea mist, over a painted wall along the coast in Ishinomaki, in 2012. Photograph: Kim Kyung Hoon/Reuters    The Ishinomaki Genki Fukko [happy recovery] Centre opened in June 2012 to provide a handful of shop owners and restaurateurs with temporary premises while they attempt to rebuild their livelihoods. &quot;We lost everything in the tsunami, and this grew out of a determination to get back to work as quickly as possible,&quot; says Yumi Funaoka, whose seafood store sells readymade dishes using locally caught fish. &quot;We were supposed to move out once our permanent premises had been rebuilt, but that is all behind schedule. We receive food orders from Tokyo and other places, but it&apos;s nothing like on the same scale as before the tsunami.&quot; New look, new business Other initiatives include adventure playgrounds, a library, caf\u00e9s and bars, cheap accommodation for visitors, walking tours and a business &quot;laboratory&quot; that serves as a small-scale manufacturing hub. Tadaima [&quot;I&apos;m back&quot;] Ishinomaki sells bags, purses and other items made by women living in temporary housing, many of whom have no other source of income. &quot;We asked the city for help, but we didn&apos;t get much of a response so we decided to go ahead and open the shop ourselves,&quot; says employee Wataru Horikomi. &quot;We didn&apos;t want to rely on handouts, and getting local people involved in the business gives them something to look forward to.&quot; The lack of employment opportunities is a recurring problem along the north-east coast of Japan, a region already in economic decline before the 2011 disaster. The tsunami destroyed thousands of jobs in Ishinomaki, and now there are two jobseekers for every opening in the city. &quot;Young people are leaving because there isn&apos;t enough work,&quot; Horikomi says. &quot;The fishermen have been hit particularly hard. Some have gone back to work, but only a fraction of the number that were here before. They&apos;re doing their best but because of the subsidence caused by the quake, the port goes underwater every time it rains heavily. The disaster broke the people&apos;s connection with the sea.&quot;     A hilltop view of Ishinomaki through a Shinto torii gate. Photograph: Justin McCurry for the Guardian    The scale of the task facing Ishinomaki&apos;s planners becomes apparent as soon as Kenichi Horiuchi spreads out a map detailing the city&apos;s decade-long revival plan. Horiuchi, deputy head in the reconstruction division of the Ishinomaki municipal government, points to a long strip of land \u2013 once home to about 7,500 people \u2013 nearest the sea that has been condemned as too dangerous to rebuild on. Farther inland are areas where new houses have been built, though only enough for a small proportion of the thousands of residents left homeless. &quot;Many of the people who lost their homes were living near the coast and along the river tributary,&quot; he says. &quot;They can&apos;t move back to the same place, so now we have the problem of deciding where to put them.&quot; The city hopes to have 4,000 new homes ready by March 2016, but at the end of last year only about 150 had been completed, of which around 100 were occupied. Horiuchi concedes that the slow pace of reconstruction, coupled with a fear of future tsunamis, means some residents will never return. &quot;We expect to have problems along the way, but we will at least try to get the population back up to the pre-disaster level of 163,000.&quot; Construction blueprints quickly get caught up in a tangle of red tape that can hold up applications for planning permission by many months. Local officials complain that actual costs inevitably rise above budget allocations, as delays allow construction firms drive up their estimates. &quot;We then go back to the central government to ask for more money, and the response is: &apos;But we&apos;ve already given you money,&quot; Horiuchi says. Private sector snaps to attention While the official response creaks into action, the gap is being filled by myriad private organisations comprising urban planners, architects, builders and financial experts. Among the many groups attempting to revitalise Ishinomaki&apos;s small and medium sized businesses is Architecture for Humanity. With funding from the Prudential Foundation, the group, which was active in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy and the Haiti earthquake, invited local firms in the region to submit business plans and selected the best eight from more than three-dozen applications. &quot;The situation here is very different from that after, say, the Kobe earthquake in 1995 \u2013 but however you look at it, the reconstruction process is slow,&quot; says Akinobu Yoshikawa, a graduate student of engineering at Tohoku University who belongs to the group. Funding and bureaucracy aside, the recovery effort is being hampered by a lack of co-ordination, according to Christian Dimmer, an assistant professor in the urban studies department at Tokyo University. &quot;There is a lot of grassroots activity in Ishinomaki, but all of the wheels are turning at different speeds,&quot; he says. &quot;There isn&apos;t much co-ordination. They seem to be doing their own thing.&quot;     A man stands on the flooded street in the quake-hit area in Ishinomaki, in 2011. Photograph: Xinhua/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images    Dimmer, who helped produce an online reconstruction projects map of the entire tsunami-hit coastline, believes displaced residents would benefit from clearer, more user-friendly explanations of the authorities&apos; plans for the city. &quot;The technocratic process is very slow,&quot; he says. &quot;People want to know what these plans mean in reality \u2026 how it will impact their lives.&quot; The towering tsunami of three years ago exposed existing seawalls as woefully inadequate. Now residents are locked in debate with the local authorities over the location, size and cost of their mooted replacements. According to local government plans, vulnerable areas will be protected by an outer wall positioned in the ocean, then a taller wall at the edge of the coast. The land behind will be reserved for commercial properties, with a raised road \u2013 another line of defence against tsunamis \u2013 situated in front of residential areas. Public buildings such as schools and hospitals will be located even father inland. &quot;The problem is that if you have a new seawall in one area, you have to rethink the position of seawalls elsewhere,&quot; Dimmer says. &quot;It&apos;s so complex. How much consensus do you need before you go ahead and build? No one knows. There is no manual for this.&quot; It will be years before all of Ishinomaki shares the air of normality evident near its railway station. But the destruction has presented it both with an opportunity and a huge planning headache. The movement of large groups of residents into temporary housing has created new communities whose makeup differs dramatically from the pre-disaster days. &quot;I expect that in many ways the new Ishinomaki will be very different from the old one,&quot; Yoshikawa says. &quot;People from different parts of the city have become mixed up in temporary housing, which in turn have become new communities in their own right. Will they want to stay together when they leave, or will they have to break up again?&quot;     A house damaged in the tsunami sits on top of a bridge in Ishinomaki, in 2011.  Photograph: Kim Jae-Hwan/AFP/Getty Images    As things stand, the official &quot;takeoff&quot; period for the rebuilt city looks hopelessly optimistic. But amid tricky questions about funding, jobs and the practicalities of preventing Ishinomaki from once more being swallowed up by the Pacific Ocean it&apos;s easy to overlook the quiet progress being made on the city&apos;s streets. &quot;After almost three years people&apos;s efforts are coming into view, and that has galvanised the local population,&quot; says Dr Michio Ubaura, a specialist from the department of architecture at Tohoku University who is advising the local government. &quot;But even if you manage to build attractive homes on a brand new city, you still have to persuade people to go and live in them.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Her final stage performances came in 1993 with roles in The Deep Blue Sea and Macbeth at the Watermill theatre, Newbury, which then toured to the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires and the Globe, Tokyo."], "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Film", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-27T14:49:09Z", "title": "Jean Harvey obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jan/27/jean-harvey-obituary", "article": "Our mother, Jean Harvey, who has died aged 83, declared at the age of six that she wanted to be an actress. She went on to a successful stage and screen career, receiving widest recognition for her work in television over more than 30 years. Her most famous role was in Compact (1962), one of the BBC&apos;s first soaps, as the editor of the magazine from which the show took its title. She appeared in several classic serials, including North and South (1975) and two versions of Jane Eyre, playing Mrs Reed in the 1973 adaptation and Mrs Fairfax in 1983. Her favourite TV role was as Sally, the wife of Max (George Cole) in A Man of Our Times (1968), for which she received a Bafta nomination. Jean was born near Birmingham, daughter of Dorothy and Frederick Hillen-Harvey, and studied at the city&apos;s Central School of Speech and Drama before joining Birmingham Rep as a junior member, alongside Donald Pleasence, Eric Porter, John Neville and Paul Eddington. At the Alexander theatre in Birmingham her roles included the Fairy Queen in panto opposite John Le Mesurier as the Demon King. Her first West End appearance was in Lady Precious Stream. In 1953 came a higher-profile role when Jean played the female lead opposite Richard Attenborough in The Mousetrap, taking over from his wife Sheila Sim. As she later recalled: &quot;We used to wonder if it would run till Christmas!&quot; After her career in television she returned to the role, with considerable publicity, some years later. Jean also appeared in three feature films \u2013 Ambush in Leopard Street (1962) with James Kenney, It&apos;s All Happening (also known as The Dream Maker, 1963) with Tommy Steele, and The Best Pair of Legs in the Business (1973) with Reg Varney. She was married in 1954 to the actor Michael David, with whom she had two daughters. They divorced in 1964 and in 1971 she married Sharifin Gardiner, an agricultural economist. At the time of her second marriage, she changed her first name to Kadarijah and in subsequent years lived in Indonesia, Zimbabwe, Nigeria and Nepal with her husband. She also travelled and worked a great deal abroad as a result of her involvement with Subud, a non-denominational charitable and cultural association. She continued to undertake stage and TV work when in the UK. Her final stage performances came in 1993 with roles in The Deep Blue Sea and Macbeth at the Watermill theatre, Newbury, which then toured to the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires and the Globe, Tokyo.

Both are essentially subcultures, cut off in slightly different ways from the mainstream of Japanese pop culture, and there has been a growth in recent years of fans who are not into indie or idol music per se but are more accurately defined as fans of subculture in general. Perhaps recognising this, it\u2019s become a common sight to find idol singers adopting elements of indie and underground culture, be it the noise collaborations of BiS, the indie covers of Dempagumi inc. or the proliferation of indie musicians working as songwriters and producers in the idol scene. The rise of Seiko Oomori is evidence that the trade goes two ways. A singer-songwriter rooted deeply in the darkest, dirtiest depths of the underground scene in the Koenji district of Tokyo (the video for Midnight Seijun Isei Kouyuu sees her performing the song in Koenji\u2019s legendary and legendarily weird Muryoku Muzenji live space), she has increasingly adopted the posture of an idol singer to deliver her off-kilter narratives, even going so far as performing at the 2013 Tokyo Idol Festival. Midnight Seijun Isei Kouyuu demonstrates her spanning of those two worlds, with the electronic, technopop-influenced arrangement replacing her previous acoustic guitar-orientated setup, but breaking down into squalls of noise as the song reaches its mid-point. Oomori\u2019s fusion of sweet, bubblegum elements with occasionally tortured delivery emphasises the darkness and obsession that lurk under the candy-coloured surface, and in this way she has a lot in common with 80s singer Jun Togawa, who also appropriated elements of idol culture and contorted them to more dissonant ends. Whether Oomori has Togawa\u2019s self-awareness and acuity remains to be seen, but with Midnight Seijun Isei Kouyuu she has finally marked herself as one to watch for audiences beyond the cramped basements and lofts of Koenji. \u2022 More from Clear and Refreshing"}, {"sentences": ["Beijing stepped up its claims to the islands \u2013 known as the Diaoyu in China \u2013 at the end of last year when it declared an air-defence identification zone in the region that overlaps with Japan&apos;s.

The ministry said in a statement: &quot;Our government strongly condemns this and asks Japan to immediately withdraw it. If Japan truly hopes to contribute to world peace, it should nurture peace and reconciliation in the minds of its next generation, not plant the seeds of conflict and dispute.&quot; Takeshima, known in South Koreans as Dokdo, is protected by a small police garrison and is home to just two permanent residents \u2013 an elderly fisherman and his wife. The rocky islets lie roughly equidistant between the Japanese and South Korean mainland in a stretch of water referred to as the East Sea by Koreans. A spokeswoman at the Chinese foreign ministry, Hua Chunying, told reporters: &quot;We once more urge Japan to respect historic realities, stop provocations and teach the younger generation a correct historical perspective.&quot; It is the first time teachers have been encouraged to refer to the Senkakus as part of Japan, a shift that reflects Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&apos;s desire to ditch &quot;masochistic&quot; appraisals of the country&apos;s wartime history, promote its territorial claims and instill feelings of patriotism among schoolchildren. Earlier this month, the education ministry said future textbooks would have to reflect the government&apos;s official position on contentious historical issues. Critics believe that will mean omitting, or at least watering down, descriptions of wartime atrocities, including the Japanese imperial army&apos;s use of tens of thousands of sex slaves before and during the second world war, and the Nanking massacre, in which an estimated 300,000 Chinese citizens were killed by Japanese troops. Despite frequent sightings of Chinese surveillance vessels in waters near the Senkakus, Japan insists there is no dispute over their ownership. Beijing stepped up its claims to the islands \u2013 known as the Diaoyu in China \u2013 at the end of last year when it declared an air-defence identification zone in the region that overlaps with Japan&apos;s. Ties between Beijing and Tokyo deteriorated in autumn 2012 after Japan bought the islands from their private Japanese owners, sparking violent protests in several Chinese cities. The teaching revisions will add to already strained tied between Japan and its neighbours over ownership of the island groups and disputes over its revisionist take on wartime history. South Korea and Beijing have also voiced alarm at Japan&apos;s recent rise in military spending and plans by Abe to revise the pacifist constitution to allow its armed forces to play a greater role overseas. The teaching guidelines, which are not mandatory, will apply to history, geography and civic classes at junior and senior high schools from April 2016. They were announced just days after the new chairman of public broadcaster NHK, Katsuto Momii, triggered anger in the region by defending Japan&apos;s wartime use of sex slaves. Momii has since expressed regret for the remarks, describing them as extremely inappropriate."}, {"sentences": ["\u201cWe don\u2019t make an effort to write a song about going down to Melbourne Central, or something \u2013 it\u2019s what we know \u2026 It would be weird to write about Tompkins Square Park in New York or somewhere in Tokyo, because we\u2019ve never been there.\u201d The album\u2019s first single Alice isn\u2019t about a girl called Alice, but Alice Springs, and the coming together of \u201cArrernte and white\u201d."], "tags": ["Music", "Indie"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-29T03:01:21Z", "title": "Dick Diver: 'We want to write a sick song like Flame Trees'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/29/dick-diver-laneways", "article": "           Normal 0     false false false  EN-AU JA X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                       For 12,000 glitter-covered punters, the Meredith music festival \u2013 which takes place each December in Victoria \u2013 is the annual palette cleanser after a year of hard slog.

To switch off (literally \u2013 the phone reception is terrible) and forget about real-world concerns.

It makes me wanna go out there and try a little smash-ism!\u201d With that, Dick Diver launched into Head Back, the cult closing track from New Start Again. It\u2019s become an almost unofficial anthem for this festival, and they delivered it with all the sloppy charm you\u2019d expect from a band that unwillingly pioneered a made-up genre called \u201cdolewave\u201d.             This time, however, they served it up with a twist: Four friends doing an interpretative dance about climate change, wearing cardboard box masks of Donald Trump, Clive Palmer, Gina Rinehart and Rupert Murdoch. Not to be outdone, Montfort led the crowd in a \u201cfuck Kochie!\u201d chant aimed at Sunrise host David Koch, before honking a sax while flanked by the dancers who by then were costumed as colourful birds. It all ended with a boot to Gina Rinehart\u2019s cardboard face and a parting message: \u201cDitch Clive. Ditch Napthine. Ditch Abbott. Ditch the Queen.\u201d Phew! \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to feel too comfy,\u201d reflects Montfort later, describing his saxophone antics as a \u201cwimpy Fela Kuti moment\u201d. As for why Koch was the target of his rage, his answer is simple: \u201cHe\u2019s a conservative dog.\u201d This is Dick Diver; a Melbourne bands that brings together humour, self-deprecation, Australian kitsch and addictive melodies like few before it. While their records are not as overtly political as their onstage antics at Meredith, there\u2019s a sense of cultural agitation \u2013 an inherent uncomfortableness with what it means to be Australian \u2013 that runs through their music. There\u2019s the poor punter gambling his life away on Keno. There\u2019s the Centrelink scammer that fakes an injury to stay on benefits on New Start Again. On the new record Calendar Days, there are references to IGA supermarkets and Safeway delis, Fitness Firsts and stacks of TV Weeks.  \u201cIt\u2019s natural,\u201d says Montfort of the Australian references. \u201cWe don\u2019t make an effort to write a song about going down to Melbourne Central, or something \u2013 it\u2019s what we know \u2026 It would be weird to write about Tompkins Square Park in New York or somewhere in Tokyo, because we\u2019ve never been there.\u201d The album\u2019s first single Alice isn\u2019t about a girl called Alice, but Alice Springs, and the coming together of \u201cArrernte and white\u201d. It doesn\u2019t make sweeping, simplistic statements about Indigenous issues; it presents characters and imagery and invites you to draw your own conclusions.      The song was written by Alistair McKay, who does the bulk of songwriting with childhood friend Rupert Edwards. But Dick Diver, who play this month\u2019s St Jerome\u2019s Laneway Festival, has become a more collaborative affair over the years. Drummer Steph Hughes (who also plays in Boomgates) and Montfort himself (who splits his time between \u201csix to seven bands\u201d \u2013 from the scratchy folk of Lower Plenty to the electro-punk of Total Control) contribute songs as well. On stage, it\u2019s an endearingly awkward blend of instrument-swapping and in-jokes, but somehow they pull it off. And they\u2019re getting better with each record, Montfort reckons.  \u201cThe early Dick Diver stuff was really chilled out \u2013 I don\u2019t know what we were going for back then. But now we want to write a sick song like [Cold Chisel\u2019s] Flame Trees.\u201d While Dick Diver haven\u2019t had the same success as Chapter Music labelmates Twerps in the States, Calendar Days has solidified their cult status locally. The album was recorded by Montfort\u2019s Total Control bandmate Mikey Young in a holiday house in Philip Island, Victoria. \u201cIt maybe sounds arrogant, but we were really chuffed on it,\u201d says Montfort of the Calendar Days sessions. \u201cBecause New Start Again was real popular, we hoped Chapter Music wouldn\u2019t lose a whole lot of money if they did a big pressing. We gave ourselves a real pat on the back afterwards.\u201d Calendar Days topped the Guardian\u2019s list of the best Australian albums of 2013, and has been met with near unanimous praise from critics. But Montfort says they\u2019re trying not to let the plaudits go to their heads. \u201cWe all have full-time jobs besides Dick Diver, so if we were making music for anyone else, we\u2019d be failing miserably,\u201d he jokes. That\u2019s right \u2013 the band held up as poster children of dolewave have actual real-life jobs.  \u201cI think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d Montfort says of the genre, which has come to define the kind of jangly-pop bands you\u2019d meet in a line at the Centrelink office in Darebin. \u201cI always rile Rupert up about it, because I think he gets a bit more offended, but I find it funny. It\u2019s such a funny name for a genre \u2026 I hope it takes off.\u201d  Dick Diver play St Jerome&apos;s Laneways festival, touring Australia this month and starting in Brisbane on Friday "}, {"sentences": ["This is the emotion Gloria Steinem identified on the streets of Tokyo when, analysing an unexpected sense of ease, she realised that \u2013 for the first time in her life \u2013 most men were shorter than her."], "tags": ["Psychology", "Science", "UK news", "Gloria Steinem", "World news", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-29T11:44:48Z", "title": "Shorter people shouldn't despair. You're only as small as you feel | Anne Perkins", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/29/short-people-tall-confidence-self-esteem", "article": "The average British male is 5ft 10in and will tell you that he&apos;s about 5ft 11in, while the average woman is 5ft 4in and will probably apologise for it. That last thought&apos;s guesswork, but the rest is fact, or at least a well-sourced Wikipedia entry. How tall we are, according to new research by the clinical psychologist Prof Daniel Freeman, correlates closely with how confident we feel. Freeman is interested in the relationship between paranoia and a sense of inferiority. In his experiment his subjects were fooled by virtual reality into thinking for part of the time they were surrounded by people taller than themselves. It showed there was a strong connection between being small, or at least smaller than the people around you, and feeling small, between the perceived physical reality and the internal emotional reaction. There are obvious evolutionary reasons for feeling safer when you&apos;re bigger than the likely opposition. But it&apos;s aeons since the brain triumphed over brawn when it came to getting hold of power and keeping it. Yet we are still apparently conditioned to regard taller people with the kind of respect that comes from an atavistic fear that they might thump us, and it&apos;s so persistent that tall people, it is claimed, get better jobs, earn more and generally have a better time of it than their shorter brothers and sisters. Until a generation or so ago, there was definitely a class thing going on. In the mid-18th century, the difference between officer recruits (always upper class since joining the army took more ready cash than most people saw in their lifetimes) and the ordinary soldier was an astonishing 7.5in. Even in 1950 there was still a three-inch difference between manual and non-manual workers. But that doesn&apos;t quite explain Freeman&apos;s results, which were about confidence, and anyway there are plenty of people around who aren&apos;t tall doing very well thank you, including those whose appearance is at least part of their work, such as the actor Daniel Radcliffe. Film is particularly adept at blurring the difference. Size matters only where it is relative. It seems obvious: you can&apos;t feel small when you are taller than everyone in the room. Wrong. Speaking as a taller than average 5ft 8.5in, you can. Or at least I could as a tall child in a single-sex school, perpetually stooped in an attempt to make eye contact with my friends, always taller than the rest of my class. Except then feeling small was actually feeling tall, being different \u2013 wearing glasses and having a mortifying tendency to knock things over \u2013 and not in a good way. What I most wanted in life was to be able to do a backflip like my lithe best friend. Playing Romeo because I was tallest was not really compensation. Yet that discrimination may be at the heart of it. It&apos;s not that tall people feel superior, or more effective, or demand to be talked to with particular deference. It&apos;s just how shorter people treat them. For a start, you literally have to look up to the taller person. And the taller person has to look down. Tall people get more space because they take more space. Maybe that reads across into their attitude to life. But maybe the tall person isn&apos;t taking an advantage. They&apos;re being given it. Just like the people in the experiment. This is the emotion Gloria Steinem identified on the streets of Tokyo when, analysing an unexpected sense of ease, she realised that \u2013 for the first time in her life \u2013 most men were shorter than her. As she says, we aren&apos;t in the habit of recognising how our sense of our selves in physical space shapes the way we think and forms part of our mental wellbeing. It is not just our mind speaking to our body: it&apos;s our body speaking to our mind. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent, Eleanor Roosevelt once said. Somehow, it seems significant that Mrs Roosevelt was 5ft 11in."}, {"sentences": ["The Tokyo Zodiac Murders by Soji Shimada (1981) A snowy evening in the Sh\u014dwa period of pre-war Japan."], "tags": ["Thrillers", "Fiction", "Books", "Crime fiction", "Culture", "Edgar Allan Poe", "Wilkie Collins", "Agatha Christie"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-29T15:53:25Z", "title": "The top 10 locked-room mysteries", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/29/top-10-locked-room-mysteries-adrian-mckinty", "article": "The first proper mystery novel that I read was Murder On the Orient Express with a gaunt David Niven and a cherubic Peter Ustinov on the cover. Orient Express, you&apos;ll recall, is the one where everyone did it, which delighted me no end and I was immediately hooked. I began to work my way through the other Agatha Christies at Belfast Central library and it was probably the sympathetic librarian there who put into my hands The Murders in the Rue Morgue, the first real locked-room mystery that I came across. Since then I&apos;ve read dozens of locked-roomers (or &quot;impossible murders&quot;) and I have developed firm opinions about the genre. I have no truck whatsoever with the ones that have a supernatural solution or where the author doesn&apos;t give you enough information to solve the case for yourself. A locked-room problem lies at the heart of my new novel, In The Morning I&apos;ll Be Gone, in which an RUC detective has to find out whether a publican&apos;s daughter who fell off a table in a bar that was locked from the inside was in fact murdered. Firstly I had to assure the reader I was not cheating about the facts: the pub was indeed locked and bolted from the inside, there were no secret passages and certainly no supernatural element. Then, of course, I had to give the reader all the necessary information so that they could solve the case at the same time or before the detective. When it works you should be able to read a locked-room mystery twice, the second time spotting the clues and seeing how the whole thing fits together. When a locked-room mystery doesn&apos;t work the solution makes you groan and the book gets hurled across the room. In The Murders in the Rue Morgue an elderly Frenchwoman is killed in a locked room on the fourth floor. The solution \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 is that the murder was done by a tame orang-utan who climbed in through the open window with a straight razor. Do that sort of thing nowadays and your book would rightly get chucked, probably back at your own head during a signing. The golden age of the locked-room mystery in Anglo-American detective fiction has largely passed, but in France Paul Halter has been churning out original impossible murder novels since the mid-1980s and in Japan the great Soji Shimada virtually invented the &quot;logic problem&quot; sub-genre which is still extremely popular. Mixing classic and contemporary with no supernatural activity allowed, these are my 10 favourite locked-room/impossible murder novels: 10. The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins (1868)  Rachel Verinder&apos;s cursed Indian diamond the Moonstone disappears from her room after her birthday party. This is only a rudimentary locked-roomer, but as the first and still one of the best detective novels it had to be on my list. 9. The Case of the Constant Suicides John Dickson Carr (1941)  Dr Gideon Fell investigates an alarming number of &quot;suicides&quot; at a remote Scottish castle. The deaths have taken place in completely inaccessible rooms. Dickson Carr was rightly known as the &quot;master of the locked-room mystery&quot; and this entire list could, with some justification, have been made solely from JDC books. 8. And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie (1939) Eight people with guilty secrets are invited to an isolated island off the coast of Devon where they begin to be murdered one by one. When there are only two of them left the fun really begins. Previously published under two equally unfortunate titles. 7. Suddenly At His Residence by Christianna Brand (1946) In another part of Devon Sir Richard March has been found poisoned in his lodge. A sand covered pathway leading to the lodge is rolled daily by the gardener. Only one set of footprints is found leading to the lodge and they belong to Claire, who discovered the body. A witty and engaging mystery from a writer who was another locked-room specialist. 6. The Big Bow Mystery by Israel Zangwill (1892) Mrs Drabdump&apos;s lodger is discovered with his throat cut, no trace of a murder weapon and no way a murderer could have got in or out. Arguably the first proper locked-roomer and still a classic. 5. The Mystery of the Yellow Room by Gaston Leroux (1908) Miss Stangerson is found severely injured, attacked in a locked room at the Chateau du Glandier. Leroux provides maps and floor plans showing that an assailant could not possibly have entered or escaped. 4. The King Is Dead by Ellery Queen (1951)  King Bendigo, a wealthy munitions magnate, has been threatened by his brother Judah, who announces that he will shoot King at midnight at his private island residence. King locks himself in a hermetically sealed office accompanied only by his wife, Karla. Judah is under Ellery Queen&apos;s constant observation. At midnight, Judah lifts an empty gun and pulls the trigger and at the same moment, in the sealed room, King falls back, wounded with a bullet. No gun is found anywhere in the sealed room and the bullet that wounds King came from Judah&apos;s gun \u2013 which didn&apos;t actually fire. Good, huh? 3. La Septi\u00e8me hypoth\u00e8se by Paul Halter (1991)  Two men toss a coin and whoever loses has to commit a murder and try to pin the blame on the other. There are only two possible suspects to the subsequent crime and both have ironclad alibis. Seven solutions present themselves to the detectives in this ultra-twisty novel. 2. The Tokyo Zodiac Murders by Soji Shimada (1981) A snowy evening in the Sh\u014dwa period of pre-war Japan. A wealthy artist, Heikichi Umezawa, is finishing up his great cycle of paintings on Zodiacal subjects when his head is smashed in with a blunt object. The studio is locked from the inside and the suspects have alibis. Over the next four decades many of Umezawa&apos;s family members are also gruesomely killed, most in &quot;impossible&quot; ways. In a series of postmodern asides Soji Shimada repeatedly taunts the reader explaining that all the clues are there for an astute observer. 1. The Hollow Man by John Dickson Carr (1935)  Someone breaks into Professor Grimaud&apos;s study, kills him and leaves, with the only door to the room locked from the inside, and with people present in the hall outside the room. The ground below the window is covered with unbroken snow. All the elements are balanced just right in this, the best of Dickson Carr&apos;s many locked-room problems."}, {"sentences": ["The Syd Barrett-like songwriter recorded 2013&apos;s Caramel, his second album, alone in a hotel room in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Psychedelia", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "London"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-29T16:32:13Z", "title": "Connan Mockasin \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/29/connan-mockasin-review-shepherds-bush", "article": "In an increasingly homogeneous music world, it&apos;s great that Connan Mockasin exists.

The Syd Barrett-like songwriter recorded 2013&apos;s Caramel, his second album, alone in a hotel room in Tokyo. It purports to be a concept album about a love affair between a man and a dolphin that ends in a tragic car crash, rendered via luscious, glutinous funk fed through a stoned psychedelic wringer. Live and backed by a four-piece band, the diminutive Mockasin is a leather-jacketed elf with his face hidden beneath a peroxide mop top. Most of his trippy songs meander nowhere much at a glacial pace. The wafty Do I Make You Feel Shy? could be a Prince single spun at 33rpm, although Mockasin appears less likely to prove a voraciously carnal lover than to fall asleep on the job. If there is a fault, it&apos;s that his songs can be slight and insubstantial. I&apos;m the Man, That Will Find You boasts a killer melody that could be prime Isaac Hayes-style blaxploitation funk, but is just the mere outline of a song, yet to be fleshed out. An inveterate genre-hopper, Mockasin then lopes into a bizarre exercise in acid-prog with Megumi the Milkway Above. He reappears in a kimono to vibrate his windpipe through an encore of I Wanna Roll With You, essentially Barry White reincarnated as a fey pixie, and the 10-minute motorik wig-out of Forever Dolphin Love.

Every time he makes a public appearance in his Fed role there are dozens of pundits and politicians waiting to pour vitriol on his head. Critics of his eight-year stint give vent at the mention of his name, such is their anger at his concern for the unemployed and families threatened with the loss of their home. His rescue of the US financial system in 2008, and his part in defeating a global banking collapse, is put to one side by those who argue his policies since the dicey moments before and after the collapse of Lehman Brothers have undermined the dollar and slowed the recovery. Like a patient given a strong dose of antibiotics, the US economy is considered by this vociferous group of rightwingers to be hooked on powerful drugs that, as time goes on, make it weaker, not stronger. A measure of the criticism is former presidential candidate Mitt Romney&apos;s threat to sack him for the crime of zealously and recklessly printing money. Texas governor Rick Perry warned Bernanke against pursuing a monetary policy that would be &quot;treasonous&quot;. A South Carolina state senator called him a &quot;traitor&quot; bent on &quot;rotting out our republic&quot;. Bring back the gold standard, sound money and an end to excessive borrowing, they said, and still do. On the left he is accused of rescuing the banks without strings attached. While it was Treasury secretary Tim Geithner&apos;s decision to underwrite the banking sector, Bernanke is regularly branded Lord Protector of Wall Street and its bonus culture. It is hard to imagine Bank of England boss Mark Carney facing the same abuse. Born in 1953 into one of the few Jewish families in Dillon, South Carolina, Bernanke went to Harvard before teaching economics at Stanford and Princeton. A shy man and consummate academic, he jumped at the chance of making policy. In a few days he will step down with the thanks of his president, who has relied on cheap central bank funds to lubricate the economy in his battle with a cost-cutting Congress. Like Carney, Bernanke has embraced a new role for the world&apos;s central banks \u2013 to be the canary signalling not just inflationary pressures but also potential asset bubbles. This duel role was one he rejected in the early years at the Fed, which dates back to his appointment to the Federal Reserve board of governors in 2002 and elevation to the chair in 2006. Before the crash he was an inflation watcher. Like his counterparts in the eurozone and the UK, he was deaf to fears that ballooning house prices and rocketing share values were bubbles ready to burst. It ranks as the chief criticism of his early years in the post, and reflects the dangers of group-think among those who sit at the policymakers top table. When trouble started to brew he joined Geithner in the failed tactic of bolting together failed banks. Bear Stearns was sold for $2 (\u00a31.20) a share, Merrill Lynch was handed to Bank of America, but then policy ran out of road and the Treasury came up with the $700bn Tarp bailout fund. But once they had been rescued, banks still needed help to perform their basic function. Lending was their stock in trade and needed to be supplemented by central bank funds. Quickly Bernanke adopted quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed entered the market to buy up US government and mortgage debt, with the hope that financial institutions would then convert the proceeds into further loans to households and businesses. In the intervening five years he has thrown around $3tn at the US economy via QE to maintain a flow of credit to beleaguered households and businesses. There are many Bernanke watchers who believe he wanted to go even further. In the 1990s, while an economics professor at Princeton, he blasted the Japanese central bank for its timidity after the Tokyo property crash. He acquired the nickname Helicopter Ben for recommending it offset a large tax cut by buying an equivalent amount of government debt, a plan that he compared to a &quot;helicopter drop of newly printed money&quot;. A rightwing Congress was never going to allow it and as far as anyone knows it was never formally proposed, leaving Bernanke to steer a course between rightwing accusations of profligacy and charges from the Keynesian left that his timidity restricted growth and depressed the jobs market. Through it all he has refused to take on his critics in anything other than measured tones. As he leaves, the US is recovering strongly and the pace of QE expansion has slowed from $85bn a month. His successor, Janet Yellen, is expected to bring QE expansion to an end and eventually hand responsibility for expanding credit back to the private sector. But Geithner&apos;s tactic of letting bankers resume business in a largely unreconstructed financial system - while asking the Fed to keep a watchful eye - is risky when banks refuse to adopt conservative strategies and workers rely on assets like shares and property to pay the bills. The Bernanke years could lead inexorably to another crash."}, {"sentences": ["His passion for the language led him to start a successful student exchange programme with a school in Tokyo.", "It&apos;s all about this sleepy town in Devon teaming up with one of the most cosmopolitan, globally recognised cities in the world \u2013 Tokyo."], "tags": ["Teaching", "Languages"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-30T13:49:00Z", "title": "How a secondary in Devon became the most famous British school in Tokyo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jan/30/learning-japanese-liberates-students", "article": "Crispin Chambers teaches Japanese at Tavistock College in Devon.

Speaking Japanese isn&apos;t difficult at all. The real challenge is literacy. I was teaching English in Awaji&apos;s main high school and I thought it was an incredible opportunity to learn Japanese. I was very fortunate that I had a great mentor who said it was important to try to read and write the language also. So I really had to knuckle down for a few years. My dad was an art teacher and when I was a young lad I used to practice calligraphy. I never knew what the Chinese characters meant but I was used to drawing them. They are basically simple pictures which you put together to create meanings, so it&apos;s a fantastic language to learn. That&apos;s how it took off at Tavistock College 10 years later. It was the novelty factor of it. It was the first time Japanese had been taught in a big UK comprehensive. There was huge scepticism. Up until 1996, Japanese was very much an elite minority language which was being taught in small groups in the independent sector. Suddenly our school in Devon was teaching 300 year 7 pupils. Fortunately, the subject took off and the kids loved it. We did a lot of work with parents explaining how Japanese is closely linked to Chinese \u2013 it&apos;s a pictorial language and very logical. But if it was going to be an ongoing success we had to get good results at GCSEs. Last year we got 86% A* to C grades. The year before was 84% and two years ago it was 89%. Learning Japanese liberates students. We have found that dyslexia doesn&apos;t show up in students studying Japanese and special educational needs (SEN) pupils are more likely succeed because often their learning needs are less obvious. Also, most students who come into secondary school from primary have already been pigeonholed into different levels of capability. When they come in to do Japanese they all get a fresh start. No one knows anything except me and the students are free to just have a go and enjoy the subject. It&apos;s novel, it&apos;s something parents or other teachers can&apos;t do, yet they can read and write this hard script language. Kids just get hooked. Study Japanese and the world is your sashimi. If kids can do Japanese, they can go away and do any subject. You&apos;ll find parents saying that their English handwriting improves because when you learn Japanese you have to be very careful with your stroke order. The thing about Japan is that it comes into every subject area. At our school, one reason other teachers took it on board was because you learn about volcanoes in geography, or earthquake proof buildings in science, or haiku poetry in English. Whatever curriculum area, you&apos;ll always find Japan in there. A lot of my students have gone on to do medicine or law and there&apos;s a confidence that if they can do Japanese, they can do anything. Japan is a huge economy which uses Britain as its bridge into Europe. There are, therefore, fantastic opportunities in a range of industries, from banking to tourism. It certainly enhances your job prospects. The impact Japanese has had on the wider local community was a massive reason why I won the teaching award. When the judges came to Tavistock they insisted on meeting current and former parents, as well as people in the community. We had to stop parents rushing to the college because there were so many who wanted to come and speak either about their children going to Japan or hosting Japanese students. There were even parents who have used Japanese in their jobs as a result. The former mayor of west Devon even suggested, tongue in cheek, they build a statue of me in the town centre. It&apos;s all about this sleepy town in Devon teaming up with one of the most cosmopolitan, globally recognised cities in the world \u2013 Tokyo. You couldn&apos;t have dreamed it up. Education has been an opportunity for me to give something back. I had almost seven years in Japan and was so fortunate to be welcomed into Japanese homes and schools. These are wonderful people and what we imagine them to be like is not the reality. If you talk to our students, they&apos;d all say how fun they are and how much of a desire they have to learn English. They want to come over here, go horse riding on Dartmoor and have cream teas. They embrace our lives as well. People talk about internationalisation and what it&apos;s actually about is getting students from different countries together. Language doesn&apos;t have to be a barrier. It&apos;s about making the unknown, known.

I&apos;m Adrien and I founded the blog Do You Like That Song? (DYLTS is the short version).  Where are you based? I&apos;m based out of Lille, in northern France, although I lived in other countries for my studies. I launched this blog while I was studying in Tokyo and spent six months running it while interning in Barcelona. Describe your blog in a sentence.  A place where music lovers can find new, quality songs daily. How long has your blog been going?  It will be two years in January. I have always had a great interest in music and musical discovery. The project started with a Tumblr page I created to gather the songs I came across in my searches. Then, in January 2012, I decided to transform the Tumblr page into a blog and post music daily. For a while, I was running it on my own, but recently I added new writers to the team this past year. We&apos;re planning to expand even more and there should be interesting projects on the way soon! What do you write about? Music and producers we love! We feature artists from all over the world, and apart from the most famous ones, we want to give exposure to upcoming artists we believe in. Our main genres are nu-disco, chillout, house and indie pop.  The blog mainly features new songs and music videos. We also recently published a couple of interesting interviews, and that&apos;s something we want to continue in 2014. It&apos;s a good way to let artists express and introduce themselves to our readers.  We are also very active on Facebook and Twitter. They\u2019re always great ways to share music, and talk with artists and our followers. Why should people visit your blog?  If you&apos;re keen on discovering new music, Do You Like That Song? will please you. You can do everything from listen to quality music, to read what makes it special for us, to even learn more about your favorite artists. With the global audience we&apos;ve developed, the music we share has no boundaries!  Visit us when you feel like hearing something new and different! Take the time to sit back, relax, and let our music selection take you away.  What\u2019s your top song right now?    This week, I listened to one song in particular, which is No by rising Stockholm producer HNNY. I really like how the track evolves and gradually builds its unique atmosphere. The real highlights are the vocal samples that everyone will recognize. So, do you like that song?      What\u2019s your favourite music blog aside from your own (and why)?   There are a lot of great blogs to discover awesome music! My personal favorite is Golden Scissors. It started when there were not so many music blogs, and I was visiting it daily. That&apos;s where I discovered nu-disco, and I really like their writing style. You can really feel it&apos;s done by people passionate about music. Golden Scissors has been a great source of inspiration to start my own blog and I&apos;m still amazed by their content. Lastly, I want to give shout outs to Upside Sounds, a blog that I am contributing to now; and Absolute Bassline, one of the best music blogs among my French mates."}, {"sentences": ["The difference with Barcelona is the 80 acres of spare land that City have for development around it, now a frenzy of hard hats and scaffolding operating to the designs of Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, the Uruguayan architect whose portfolio includes Jongno Tower in Seoul, Carrasco international airport in Montevideo and various additions to the skylines of New York, Tokyo and Los Angeles, among others."], "tags": ["Manchester City", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-01T20:00:00Z", "title": "Manchester City change skyline of the city as they leave the past behind | Daniel Taylor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/01/manchester-city-leave-past-behind", "article": "The football landscape in Manchester is changing. Just head through the eastern part of town, along Alan Turing Way, and a new stadium is starting to thrust skywards directly opposite Manchester City&apos;s ground, in the same way that Mini Estadi nestles beside the Camp Nou. The Etihad Campus, City&apos;s new training complex, will be operating within six months, with a 7,000-seat stadium as its focal point. The difference with Barcelona is the 80 acres of spare land that City have for development around it, now a frenzy of hard hats and scaffolding operating to the designs of Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, the Uruguayan architect whose portfolio includes Jongno Tower in Seoul, Carrasco international airport in Montevideo and various additions to the skylines of New York, Tokyo and Los Angeles, among others. For those of us who remember the old City, these are moments when it can feel like an entirely different club and it brings to mind a line in Pies and Prejudice, Stuart Maconie&apos;s book about his travels through the north. Manchester, he wrote, was still a &quot;mucky kid at heart, but having been mithered by Mam and had their faces wiped with spittle on some civic hankie, they&apos;ve scrubbed up dead smart.&quot; It encapsulates everything that has happened to City, on the journey from chip-fat to champagne. Vi\u00f1oly&apos;s latest project will feature a long sweeping footbridge, named the Commonwealth Way, to link the two grounds over a dual-carriageway. There will be 16 other pitches, accommodation for players, apartments for relatives, a medical centre, a boardroom, a media theatre and the kind of five-star luxury that it is fair to say was not always evident in the years the team trained on council pitches in Moss Side. Then again, a lot has changed since the days Platt Lane doubled up as a meeting point for the local down-and-outs. Paul Lake tells the story in his autobiography about how a noisy troupe would congregate by the meshed perimeter fence to abuse the players on their laps of the pitch, including one guy whose party trick was to smile menacingly and rub his crotch up and down the netting. &quot;Wonder whether Bryan Robson has to cope with this at the Cliff?&quot; was an often-heard lament among the players. Which feels like a piece of classic City, long before the days when they shelled out \u00a3639,000 a day on wages, ferried executives around in chauffeur-driven cars and once surprised Barcelona after a conference call from Abu Dhabi to Manchester was misunderstood, specifically the words &quot;it&apos;s getting messy&quot; and \u2013 true story \u2013 Garry Cook, bless him, put in a \u00a330m bid for Lionel Messi. &quot;Typical City&quot; \u2013 the phrase that they came to hate \u2013 tends to mean another five- or six-goal thrashing these days and the free-scoring exploits of Manuel Pellegrini&apos;s side tell only part of the story. City&apos;s Under-18s are unbeaten since 28 September and won 2-0 on Saturday against Manchester United. The Under-21s have not lost in three months. At senior level, City fans will have a better understanding now why the people of M\u00e1laga have named a street after Pellegrini and Roberto Mancini was let go. At junior level, City&apos;s Under-13s and Under-14s are national champions. Nobody should get too far ahead of themselves but if Abu Dhabi&apos;s royal family continue to apply the same mix of hard ambition and incalculable wealth, it is not outlandish to wonder whether what we are seeing now is leading to a period of extended domination. If it is a deception, apologies in advance for being reeled in. For now, though, it feels like common sense after City&apos;s anachronistic run of freewheeling wins. A 5-1 joyride at Tottenham, to go with a 6-0 against the same opposition in Manchester, the various ordeals for Arsenal (6-3), United (4-1), Norwich (7-0), West Ham (9-0 over two legs of the Capital One Cup semi-final), and not forgetting another eight occasions when City have scored at least four; these are results that belong to a black-and-white era. Their latest financial results show that annual revenue, \u00a387m only four years earlier, has risen to \u00a3271m, overtaking Chelsea and Arsenal and putting City sixth in the Deloitte money list. Yet there are other ways to calculate the club&apos;s growth. In the space of a year, City&apos;s ticket office have dealt with fans from 76 different countries. City&apos;s worldwide television audience is up by 133% since 2009 (in the UK it is by 103%) and 15.2m of the annual 33m visitors to their website are from abroad. No trophies are awarded for this sort of thing but it is still monumental progress that the club&apos;s YouTube channel attracted 60m hits over the year. Barcelona&apos;s, to put it into context, had 50.5m, Santos are next with 30.7m, then Real Madrid (24.5m) and Juventus (19.6m). United fan like to taunt City with an adaptation of the old Inspiral Carpets song: &quot;This is how it feels to be City/This is how it feels to be small/This is how it feels when your team wins nothing at all.&quot; It no longer feels so cutting when pre-season fixtures in the United States are selling out within 20 minutes and analysis by the Mailman Group shows that City are suddenly more than twice as popular as any other European club on China&apos;s main two social media sites, Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo. In other ways, City are still in a game of catch-up. At Old Trafford, there is a stadium tour every seven minutes and a plausible explanation why the television companies have selected every one of United&apos;s FA Cup ties for live coverage since late-January 2005. Repetitive? Yes. Unimaginative? Absolutely. But you can understand the logic when United pulled in higher viewing figures for their game against Crawley Town in 2011 than watched Arsenal play Barcelona three days earlier. The modern-day City do not have the same kind of pull. Newspaper data also shows that they have plenty of ground to make up, comparing the number of website hits a City match would ordinarily attract compared to one featuring United, Liverpool or Arsenal. The drop to that next group down, comprising Chelsea, Real Madrid and Barcelona, is considerable. These are relatively small matters, however. The bottom line is that success on the pitch has to happen first and providing that it is sustained, the rest falls into place over time. Every league match at the Etihad is a sell-out these days and cup-tie attendances \u2013 so poor a few years ago the crowds used televised fixtures to chant their displeasure to the stay-aways \u2013 now average above 42,000, an increase of 7%. Plans have already been drawn up to increase the stadium&apos;s capacity from 48,000 to 60,000. It is ambitious but the work will not be undertaken unless extensive research confirms it will be worthwhile. For the current campaign, season tickets were sold out within 90 minutes. A \u00a31bn outlay from Sheikh Mansour will always polarise opinion and it is certainly an unorthodox place of sport when middle-ranking staff are asked to choose between a BMW or Range Rover for a company car (in a different time, it was something small and inexpensive with one strict condition: nothing red). It is tempting as well to wonder how seriously Uefa have looked at the bloated sponsorship agreement with Etihad Airways, from the Abu Dhabi empire, that has helped City tick the financial fair play boxes. But it was always futile expecting a forensic investigation and before anyone complains too loudly it is also worth remembering the hypocrisies and self-serving interests of the clubs campaigning to Uefa for those regulations. They wanted a closed shop. What they got was a club living up to Lonely Planet&apos;s description of Manchester as having a &quot;champagne-for-breakfast insouciance and almost giddy attitude.&quot; That club, in fairness, have clearly had enough of being taken for a ride as potential sellers put on a premium for prospective signings, as Porto can now testify after bumping up the price for Fernando and Eliaquim Mangala. A few years ago, City would have signed the cheque. Nowadays, they bend to nobody. It is the big club&apos;s mentality and Manchester&apos;s changing skyline just adds to the sense of a club coming into their time. If they can hold off Chelsea, Arsenal and everyone else this season it is going to be difficult, in the extreme, to shift them from the top. Ingenius, infuriating, Berbatov will be missed by many Farewell then, Dimitar Berbatov. You were infuriating at times, you danced to a different tune and maybe sometimes it was us, not you, who put on the wrong track. But when you were good, those days when you made it feel like football was the most natural thing in the world, we would always forgive you for the occasional lapses. A personal memory lingers from a 2-0 win for Manchester United against West Ham in October 2008. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the goals but it was the blur of movement and high skill before the second of them that sticks in the mind, as Berbatov spun, pirouetted and glided away from James Collins to set it all up. sp &quot;I&apos;m going to have to see that again to understand how he did it,&quot; Sir Alex Ferguson, as confused as the rest of us, said afterwards. &quot;You&apos;d pay double the money to watch that \u2013 fantastic imagination, control and balance.&quot; It was not always like that and Berbatov has at least one foot in the pantheon of Ferguson buys who could not show value for money. All the same, 56 goals and 27 assists from 149 games is a decent counter-argument. At Tottenham Hotur, it was 46 goals in 101 matches and the last season and a half at Fulham, leading to his loan arrangement with Monaco, brought 20 more from 54 appearances. Of course there was always much more to Berbatov than just a list of numbers on a sheet of paper. Just consider the clip of him taking down a long, crossfield pass at Craven Cottage with the nonchalance of a man who does not appear to realise, or care for, the speed of everything around him. From 40 yards the ball sticks to his boot like a stone landing on sand. And those were the kind of moments for which we will remember him, rather than the occasions when he drifted to the edges, holding the ends of his sleeves and watched games whizz by. Berbatov, in the good times, had the knack of reminding his audience that a player who puts his foot on the ball sees the most. Arsenal, with their heavy reliance on Olivier Giroud, could have done much worse."}, {"sentences": ["People like Emma Vieceli, Kate Brown and Paul Duffield all grew up watching translated anime and reading comics at the time Tokyopop began the proliferation of English-language manga adaptations in book and comic stores.", "Akira      The series is set in a bleak 2019 (2030 in later publications), after third world war Tokyo has been re-built as Neo-Tokyo and crime is rife.", "Biker gangs ride the streets looking for anything to entertain themselves but when one discovers the government is behind the destruction of old Tokyo they realise it was the fallout of an experiment gone horribly wrong and it all has something to do with a young boy known as Akira."], "tags": ["Teen books", "Children and teenagers", "Comics and graphic novels", "Manga", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-03T11:35:00Z", "title": "Manga comics: where to start", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/feb/03/manga-top-ten-teens", "article": "Walk into any large bookshop and you are sure to find colourful shelves packed full of &quot;backwards&quot; stories. For those who don&apos;t already know, they&apos;re manga comics, and one of their features is that - in keeping with the Japanese originals - they are printed backwards.  So why is manga so popular? We talked to some of the experts to find out more about this booming genre.  Our first call was on Steve, of the specialist shop Gosh Comics, based in London&apos;s Soho. He pointed out that manga belongs to a very specific subculture of comics with a very distinct and exotic look. &quot;I think this can resonate with teenagers in particular who are curious about the world and their place in it and can often be intrigued by ideas and art from other countries as a way of distinguishing themselves from the place they are from.&quot; Bookshop manager turned graphic novel critic PM Buchan said: &quot;When I was managing the book stock for a busy comic book store in Newcastle, pretty much the only reason that teenage girls were coming into the shop was to buy manga. Shelves and shelves of the stuff. Because for the first time in decades there were comics available that actually spoke to them directly. It didn&apos;t matter whether they were horror manga, like Junji Ito&apos;s Tomie, or shonen manga like Naruto, there was no stigma attached to girls reading manga in the same way that there was superhero comics, and there was a diverse range of manga being translated, made by women and for women.&quot;  Not only is manga more accessible for readers, but it has inspired a whole new generation of writers. Buchan added: &quot;At the moment we&apos;re seeing the first generation of British comic creators who grew up reading manga, all beginning to finally meet mainstream success. People like Emma Vieceli, Kate Brown and Paul Duffield all grew up watching translated anime and reading comics at the time Tokyopop began the proliferation of English-language manga adaptations in book and comic stores. These are creators influenced by the Japanese style of storytelling, and they&apos;re acting as role models for younger manga readers who want to create manga of their own.&quot; One problem facing newcomers to manga is simply the overwhelming choice. Where do you begin? So we&apos;ve put together our own guide to the top manga series for teens. If you have any other suggestions, let us know at childrens.books@guardian.co.uk and we&apos;ll add them to the list. Let&apos;s make this the go-to destination for manga lovers. One word of warning: Manga can include strong themes. Top manga series for teens 1. Fullmetal Alchemist     Hiromu Arakawa, Fullmetal Alchemist - Volume 1    Fullmetal Alchemist follows two brothers, Edward and Alphonse, in a fictional world where alchemy rules. However, when they try to resurrect their mother a tragic accident occurs and Edward loses his limbs and Alphonse his body. The series follows their adventures as they try to find the philosopher&apos;s stone to restore their health. After a visit from the state military they agree to join up in return for help finding the stone and their adventures begin. 2. Naruto     Masashi Kishimoto, Naruto 3-in-1 Edition 1    Originally a one-shot comic this series is now on it&apos;s 64th release and still has a way to go. Naruto is a teenage ninja in training. As a child he was orphaned when his village was attacked by the powerful fox, Nine-Tails and a number of people, including his parents, were killed. Although he doesn&apos;t know it to begin with, the fox demon has been trapped within Naruto and he continues his training unaware. The series showcases his training, exams and missions as he grows up. 3. Bleach     Tite Kubo, Bleach: v. 1    The inspiration for feature films, video games and even rock musicals, Bleach is one of the most popular manga series. Ishigo could always see spirits but when one passes some of her Spirit Pressure energy through to him, he is given the powers of a Soul Reaper. With his new powers he now has the responsibility to guide people through to the afterlife and protect humans from the evil spirits and Hollows that threaten them. 4. Death Note     Tsugumi Ohba, Takeshi Obata, Death Note Black Vol 1    When Light Yagami discovers a spiritual book called the &quot;Death Note&quot; he doesn&apos;t quite know what he&apos;s found until a shinigami (death god) called Ryuk explains that when someone&apos;s name is written in the book, they die. Light plans to use the book to wipe out the criminal underworld but with so many thugs and villains passing away people can&apos;t help but start to notice. Soon Light goes from being the hunter to the hunted. 5. Akira      The series is set in a bleak 2019 (2030 in later publications), after third world war Tokyo has been re-built as Neo-Tokyo and crime is rife. Biker gangs ride the streets looking for anything to entertain themselves but when one discovers the government is behind the destruction of old Tokyo they realise it was the fallout of an experiment gone horribly wrong and it all has something to do with a young boy known as Akira. 6. Black Butler     Yana Toboso, Black Butler: Vol 1    Ciel Phantomhive disappeared on the night of his 10th birthday, the same night a fire wrecked his family home and his parents are murdered. A month later he returns to take over the illustrious family business with a butler named Sebastian Michaelis. People think he is just a hugely attentive man but little do they know that the two have made a pact.

Dragonball     Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball: v. 1 (Dragon Ball (Viz Paperback)) (Dragon Ball (Prebound))    Teenagers Goku and Bulma join forces to track down the seven dragonballs as once they find them all they will be able to ask the dragon Shenlong for one true wish. During their travels Goku trains in martial arts and they meet numerous people that both help and hinder their mission but with a wish at stake they are not the only people hunting the dragonballs. This series continued on to become Dragonball Z. 8. Blue Exorcist     Kazue Kato, Blue Exorcist 1    Rin Okumura and his twin brother Yukio were raised by well-known exorcist Father Shiro but during a bitter argument it is let slip that the twins true father is Satan, which explains Rin extraordinary strength. When Rin witnesses Shiro die which trying to protect him, Rin decides to battle his heritage, swearing to beat Satan and begins training as an exorcist himself. But can he hide his history and the demon battling within.  9. Astro Boy     Akira Himekawa, Osamu Tezuka, Astroboy, Tome 1 :    One of the original manga series, first published in 1952, it follows the Ministry of Science creation known as Astro Boy. Created by Doctor Tenma after the death of his son, Astro Boy was made more human than most robots but after he realises the mistake he&apos;s made the Doctor pushes Astro boy away. Eventually he ends up in the hands of professor who discovers his powers and his ability to feel emotions. from then on Astro Boy is a crime fighting good guy, battling evil robots and alien invaders. Your suggestions EwanMy other suggestions would be Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind by Hayao Miyazaki - I think it&apos;s the only comic book he&apos;s done but it&apos;s just as absorbing as his animated films and even more epic - and Tekkonkinkreet by Taiyo Matsumoto; his deceptively rough drawing style is rather different to what you&apos;d expect from most manga, being more influenced by European comics, but it&apos;s a beautifully surreal tale about an unusual friendship. I know that Paul Duffield, who you mentioned in the article, is very influenced by his work. RonWhat about any about girls? Ghost in the Shell, maybe, but what about something from Clamp, the all-female and highly talented quartet of magna artists who have produced such excellent work as Tsubasa (multi-dimensional love quest with tragic twist), Chobits (human-android love story), XXXholic (humorous horror) and Angelic Layer (gladiatorial battles with small fighting robots)? Then there&apos;s stuff like Steel Angel Kurumi and Love Hina, Cowboy Bebop, His And Her Circumstances and so many more that would appeal to girls as much as, if not more so, than some of your choices. SamuelOne Piece is another well-known and very popular manga. It&apos;s very imiginative and, in my opinion, better than the two other &apos;popular manga&apos; which were in your list, Bleach and Naruto. Another &apos;great&apos; absent in the list is Rurouni Kenshin. I enjoyed its anime-form &quot;Samurai X&quot; very much and the manga is even better. Dagger ChildFirstly, why is everything from the pubescent boys&apos; shelf? Nothing for Twilight fans like &quot;Vampire Knight&quot;? Secondly, where is &quot;Alita&quot;? It goes beside &quot;Akira&quot; and &quot;Ghost In The Shell&quot;, always. Finally, &quot;Nightschool&quot;, which I adore even more than Sandman. (They now have her drawing James Patterson scripts - Neil, you need to save her!) GabriellaFor me, the great absent of your list is Rurouni Kenshin. A beautiful manga whose storytelling is based on love, honor and courage. Rurouni Kenshin also helped many teenagers to decide to study japanese as a foreign language. In Mexico we received this manga under the name of &quot;Samurai X&quot; RamonWhat?\u00a0 No mention of \u00a0Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima&apos;s classic Lone Wolf and Cub?\u00a0 It&apos;s is a epic work reknown for is complex characters, historical detail, wondeful artwork, and the iconic title characters.\u00a0 I suggest you give it a read if you missed this one (though, with the exception of a charming tribute/cameo in Genndy Tartakovsky&apos;s &quot;Samurai Jack,&quot; I&apos;d skip\u00a0any of the\u00a0film and TV adaptations).\u00a0 Amritpal I noticed some very interesting manga here and am ever so glad that you chose to include Full Metal Alchemist but I saw no reference to Buso Renkin which is also very interesting! It&apos;s about a child (teen) who is killed in battle, later revived using a special alchemical talisman. However having been resurrected the main character must fight to preserve the female alchemist who saved him, which expands into a very lovely story about love, battle and the idea of an &apos;inner strength&apos; through the use of the main character&apos;s Buso Renkin. Very interesting characters, one fellow dresses up as a butterfly for some reason, and nice plot-line. Antje I was very pleased to read your very positive article on manga as a genre, and while I certainly agree that Fullmetal Alchemist belongs at the top of any list of manga (for teens or otherwise), I find the remainder of your list somewhat one-sided and biased. It lists pretty much exclusively shonen manga, which with their male-dominated cast, male main protagonists, and high density of fights and battles (whether with ninja skills as in Naruto, or with swords in Bleach) is directed at and appeals mainly to male teenagers.I&apos;m not saying that girls can&apos;t enjoy this manga as well, but most certainly none of the series on your list is &quot;made by women and for women&quot;, as you put it in your article.Shojo manga can be a bit sickly sweet, but for manga with a bit more romance than martial interest I would for example recommend Ouran High School Host Club (a girl disguised as a boy in a rather crazy elite high school), or Kamisama Hajimemashita (about a young girl who gets conferred the powers of a deity, and goes to live in a temple with its fox guardian spirit).Three more of my favourite series which stand out among the rest and can appeal to both male and female teenagers are Natsume Youjinchou (about a boy who can see demons, and helps both humans and demons with their problems), Rurouni Kenshin (about a wandering samurai in Meiji-era Japan) and Hikaru no Go (a young boy&apos;s journey to becoming a profession Go-player, helped by the ghost of a long-dead Go-master)."}, {"sentences": ["The GameCube being shown off at a Nintendo games event in Tokyo, 2000 Photograph: YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/EPA    Nintendo Game Cube, 2001 Another Nintendo machine, but this one takes us to the periphery of the modern era."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Retro games", "Nintendo", "PlayStation", "Sony", "Game culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-04T07:00:15Z", "title": "The six best retro consoles for modern gamers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2014/feb/04/the-six-best-retro-consoles-for-modern-gamers", "article": "People often make the mistake of thinking that video games are a relentlessly forward-looking medium. It&apos;s all about the next big release, the next console generation, the next PC graphics card technology. Except it isn&apos;t really. Games are, like most other artforms these days, obsessively self-referential. They are constantly mining the past for successful ideas, merging old genres to create strange new ones, or simply borrowing the aesthetics of past generations. If modern games have one fault (they probably have more, but let&apos;s not go there), it&apos;s that they can seem intimidating to newcomers because they rely so much on age-old conventions and traditions.  Also, old consoles are nice. They look weird and thrilling, with their chunky plastic bodies and their gigantic cartridge ports. They are relics of fun, nostalgic artifacts that remind us of childhoods spent waiting patiently for games to load from cassettes, or blowing the dust out of old carts. Obviously, there are hundreds of online emulators that let you experience classic titles from the comfort of your PC, but that&apos;s sort of missing the point \u2013 much like listening to the MP3 of an old 78 record. Part of the pleasure is in the ritual of the vintage hardware: plugging in a cartridge, sliding in a diskette, or hitting the button that sends a CD lid flipping up like an old ghetto blaster. It&apos;s faintly fetishistic, of course, but you know, fetish is about pleasure, and old games machines certainly provide that. Anyway, for those interested in trying old consoles first-hand, here are six classics that I&apos;d recommend starting with. I deliberately chose machines that are easy to get hold of on eBay or at car boot sales and that won&apos;t break the bank. They all have very large gaming libraries and again, the games are easily available. These are all relatively reliable too so even if you buy one that looks like it has been driven over by a Ford Mondeo, it should still function. As ever, feel free to add your own suggestions!     A rare sighting of a Commodore Amiga 500 doing something other than playing Cannon Fodder    Commodore Amiga, 1985 Okay, this isn&apos;t strictly a console, it&apos;s a home computer, but if you owned an Amiga in the late-eighties or early nineties you owned one of the best games machines on the planet. This was the glory era of Britsoft, when idiosyncratic UK studios like Bitmap Brothers (Speedball 2, Chaos Engine), Team 17 (Worms), Bullfrog (Syndicate) and Sensible Software (Cannon Fodder, Sensible Soccer) were in their pomp. It&apos;s also where a lot of technically gifted European studios like Guerrilla and Housemarque originated, courtesy of the &apos;demo scene&apos;, where coders, artists and musicians competed to wring the absolute most out of the Amiga hardware.  Buying guide: you can get a basic functional Amiga 500 for about \u00a335 on eBay, but look for people offering bundles of the computer and games. Subsequent models, including the Amiga 600 and Amiga 1200, offer more processing power and design refinements, as well as compatibility with later titles, but most of the best games will run on a 500 or the slightly improved 500+ just fine. &quot;I&apos;d go for the Amiga 500+,&quot; says journalist and vintage games collector Will Freeman. &quot;It plays a few more late era games than the 500, and with an easily available, super simple to use bit of software \u2013 I use \u2018Relokick\u2019 \u2013 you can trick your Amiga 500+ into booting up as an Amiga 500, thus letting you play all the additional games.&quot;     The original Japanese Sega Mega Drive Photograph: Evan Amos/public domain    Sega Mega Drive, 1988 As the first major 16bit console, the Mega Drive was a massive success in the US and Europe, thanks to its combination of fantastic arcade conversions and authentic (for the time) sports simulations. It was the golden age of the scrolling action game, with titles like Streets of Rage, Altered Beast and Mickey Mouse: Castle of Illusion typifying the genre, while EA came into its own producing the Fifa, NHL and NBA simulations. There were also wonderful RPGs like Phantasy Star and Shining Force, as well as compelling blasters such as Gunstar Heroes, Truxton and Contra: Hard Corps, all filled with colour and energy. And of course, there was Sonic the Hedgehog, his first three adventures still as astonishingly fast and vibrant as they were 20 years ago. Buying guide: There were two basic versions of the Mega Drive in Pal territories, the original and the updated Mega Drive 2. Both are fine, though the latter is smaller and feels cheaper, and the &apos;reset&apos; switch is prone to breaking. The original Mega Drive also has better sound quality, even though it doesn&apos;t run true stereo through the A/V port. You can pick up a Mega Drive on eBay for \u00a320-100 depending on condition and the number of games bundled with it, but you&apos;ll also find them at car boot sales for a fiver. Make sure you get all the cables and at least two joypads so you can play great two-player titles like Micro Machines. Oh and if you&apos;re thinking of building on to your system with one of the two later Mega Drive add-ons, go for the Mega CD rather than the later 32X. The latter had very few decent games, while the Mega CD boasted the decent Sonic CD and luscious Lunar: The Silver Star, and you can experience the era&apos;s most controversial title, NightTrap \u2013 which is awful, by the way, but was debated in the US Senate during a &apos;ban this sick filth&apos; frenzy so it has &apos;historical interest&apos;.      An original SNES or Super Nintendo Entertainment System, also known as the Super Famicom    Super Nintendo Entertainment System, 1990 Some call Nintendo&apos;s 16bit machine the greatest games console of all time, and it&apos;s difficult to disagree. It was technically superior to the Mega Drive with more colours and clever sprite rotation/scaling hardware and it has a truly vast software catalogue. Indeed, from 1990 to 1996, the system saw some of the most iconic series&apos; of all time, from Final Fantasy to Street Fighter, with Nintendo wringing the most out of its exclusivity deals with Japanese developers. And of course, there were homegrown classics like Super Mario Kart, Super Metroid and F-Zero, as well as the wonderful Donkey Kong Country titles from first-party studio, Rare. And basically, if you want to understand the history of the JRPG genre, this is where to come and gorge yourself: Chrono Trigger, Zelda, Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy III... the list is endless.  Buying guide: As with the Mega Drive, a basic unit with all the leads will cost you upwards of \u00a320, but it&apos;s worth checking eBay for decent bundles of hardware and games. The pal machines can get quite discoloured so this isn&apos;t going to look pretty, but the hardware is sturdy.      The Sony PlayStation in its initial form Photograph: Evan Amos/public domain    Sony PlayStation, 1994 It was tough to decide between Sony&apos;s original 32bit console and its spectacularly successful successor, but for greater retro appeal, we went for the former. This was the machine that totally disrupted the home console market, shoving Sega and Nintendo out of the way and bringing Sony into the industry in a big way. The sleek hardware architecture is built for 3D graphics, and unlike its rival, the Sega Saturn, developers got to grips with it fast, relishing a new piece of kit to fiddle with. Games-wise, this is where a lot of the key current franchises came into their own, including Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Tekken and Tomb Raider, and where developers discovered the twenty-something, post-pub gaming generation through offbeat music-powered classics such as WipEout and Pa Rappa the Rappa. It&apos;s also worth tracking down gems like Konami&apos;s strategy RPG Vandal Hearts and Reflections&apos; early open-world gangster adventure, Driver.  Buyers guide: There were several iterations of the PlayStation One and you should do some research before buying, even if that just means reading the Wikipedia entry on PlayStation Models. Earlier version had more inputs on the back as well as a Parallel I/O connector, which was only ever really used for cheat cartridges. However, these first models also had some problems playing FMV (full-motion video), so unless you really want Audio In/Out connections, go for a later iterations. The budget PSone machines are okay, but they&apos;re teeny and look like toys \u2013 they don&apos;t have the slightly chunky bold looks of the originals. The PSone also omits the serial port, so if you fancied connecting two PlayStations together for local multiplayer WipEout face-offs, avoid it. As for pricing, you can get a machine for a tenner on eBay, and often that will include a few games. Remember to search locally, though, to save on postage with those massive bundle deals. Oh and you&apos;ll need some memory cards to save your games, too!     The GameCube being shown off at a Nintendo games event in Tokyo, 2000 Photograph: YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/EPA    Nintendo Game Cube, 2001 Another Nintendo machine, but this one takes us to the periphery of the modern era. Launched against the mighty PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox, it is often erroneously thought of as a failure, even though it sold over 22m units and Nintendo made a tidy profit on each one. Well-known for its distinctive box-like design and proprietary mini-disc games format, it looked childish compared to its super-masculinised rivals, and never got the third-party publisher support it deserved. Still, there were some amazing games, with the likes of Super Smash Bros, Super Mario Sunshine and Animal Crossing all holding up to modern scrutiny. And it wasn&apos;t all family-friendly cuteness: GameCube had arguably the best ever survival horror title, Resident Evil 4, as well as the bizarre Killer7 and the dark-as-hell Eternal Darkness: Sanity&apos;s Requiem \u2013 every one of those will shock and amaze even today.  Buying guide: you&apos;ll get a standard blue or black machine for around \u00a315-30, but may have to pay more for one of the limited edition platinum models. If you&apos;re really into colours, there&apos;s a lovely orange version but that was only available in Japan so you&apos;d have to stick with buying NTSC games. Again, go for bundles where possible and if you can get more than one joypad even better \u2013 you will want to play Super Smash Bros. with friends.     The Sega Dreamcast in all its idiosyncratic glory Photograph: Evan Amos/public domain    Sega Dreamcast, 1999 The machine that took on the might of the Playstation 2 \u2013 and nobly failed \u2013 is one of the most interesting mainstream consoles in recent history. It was the first entrant in the 128bit generation, the first to include a built-in modem for online multiplayer action, and the first to include a personal screen in its controller, capable of playing its own games \u2013 an idea later borrowed by Nintendo for the Wii U. It was also home to some truly wonderful games, from Sega&apos;s own Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi and Shenmue, to brilliant third-party titles like Soul Calibur and Metropolis Street Racer. There was the prototype console MMORPG, Phantasy Star Online, and the utterly weird Seaman, a game about a talking fish, with a narration from Leonard Nimoy. There was the musical fun of Space Channel 5 and Samba de Amigo; there was a fishing game \u2013 Sega Bass Fishing \u2013 that came with a fishing rod controller; there was a train simulation \u2013 Densha De Go \u2013 that came with a train driving dashboard controller. The visuals were luscious, the sound gorgeous, the ideas plentiful. A beautiful loser.  Buying guide: If you want a Pal machine (one that will play UK-bought games) you&apos;re stuck with the basic model. It&apos;ll set you back between \u00a330-40 on eBay, but be careful with controllers, the trigger buttons are prone to snapping, so if you&apos;re buying online, check with the seller that this hasn&apos;t happened. Also, make sure you get a couple of controllers and visual memory units (i.e. the little memory cards/mini-consoles) and I&apos;d thoroughly recommend a VGA adaptor, which will make the games look lovely on your HDTV. If you suddenly get really into Dreamcast and want some collectible hardware, you&apos;re looking at Japanese or American imports \u2013 Sega Retro has a list of all available models, but these will be super expensive. Finally, if you&apos;re buying games that came with dedicated peripherals (Sega Bass Fishing, Samba de Amigo, House of the Dead, etc), make sure you get the accessories too. I&apos;d also snag an Agetec arcade stick for serious Soul Calibur and Capcom vs SNK bouts.  Accessories If you find yourself succumbing to the retro gaming bug, here are some other things you may need 1. A CRT monitor. If you&apos;re buying a console from before 2000, the chances are, the visuals will look better on a traditional CRT television rather than a new flatscreen display. You could just buy a basic old telly from a car boot sale or local newspaper ad, but there are better options. We&apos;d recommend a decent TV monitor, like a Sony PVM \u2013 these were produced for the television industry, but they&apos;re relatively cheap to pick up on eBay and give a great picture quality to classic games. Hantarex also used to make amazing &apos;quadristandard&apos; CRT montors with a vast array of inputs and the ability to play both Pal and NTSC games \u2013 you can occasionally track these down on eBay. Alternatively, you can buy something called a scanline processor that will give you a great picture from vintage games on a modern flatscreen TV. They cost around \u00a3100, but they make a huge difference. Check out this guide to scanline processing for more info. 2. The right cables. Viewing your old retro games through a standard RF cable (the one that plugs into the aerial socket on the back of the TV) is rarely the best way to experience them. At the very least you should invest in a set of composite or component cables, or even better a true RGB SCART cable, which provides a superbly crisp image. Basic cables can usually be found on Amazon or eBay, but if you&apos;re looking for something to connect, say, a Sony PVM to your Mega Drive, look for a specialist supplier. I use Retro Gaming Cables who have a vast array of obscure accessories and are really friendly and knowledgeable.  3. Online help. There are dozens of websites, forums and online communities dedicated to retro gaming, most are only too pleased to help newcomers with technical issues. Try RacketBoy, HardcoreGaming101 or Sega-16. Also the monthly Retro Gamer magazine is very good, written by knowledgeable staff and filled with interesting features and interviews.

Why do some such spaces attract crowds of happy visitors whilst others sit barren and empty? Whyte&apos;s research programme, conducted with stopwatches, time-lapse videography, and lots of simple paper charts, was a spectacular success. Based on his findings, he made a series of simple and easily implemented recommendations that the city soon codified into its municipal construction codes. Today, any visitor to New York might find any number of things to complain about but the wide availability and attractive human affordances of the city&apos;s many public spaces is not likely to be among them. Whyte&apos;s epiphany was that the way to answer important questions about how to build a commodious and psychologically healthy city lay in careful observation, collection of data and the creative ability to lay aside preconceptions and view a streetscape with a &quot;beginner mind&quot;. Whyte&apos;s book The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces, and the short film based on this work, are as fresh and insightful now as the day that they appeared, and are required reading and viewing for any student of urban behaviour. Fast forward a few decades, and many things have changed, but the fundamentals remain the same. If we want to know how to make a better city, the place to start is at ground level, using observation and measurement, and applying what is known of the human sciences to those measurements to build a psychologically grounded view of the relationship between the physical design of a city and what happens there. What has changed dramatically is the set of tools that are available to those who would understand the detailed workings of the urban realm. Now we can go well beyond simple observations of the overt behaviour of city dwellers. We can look inside the bodies and minds of those who inhabit urban spaces. We can measure their gaze, their beating hearts, and the state of their autonomic nervous systems as they react to arousing and stressful events. We can also measure their brainwaves. We can, if we are willing to carry specially designed apps on our mobile phones, record our location and movements, but also our moods, interests, and our patterns of thought. New affordable devices for measurement of a host of brain and body variables are reaching the consumer marketplace every day, and many of them can be paired with phones. There is even a recipe for a DIY brainwave headset that consumers can print for themselves with a 3D printer and use with openly available software. The wide availability of sensors that measure our physiology, powerful, mobile, computing platforms, and information networks that can connect us to research laboratories with interests in urban behaviour has vaulted the methodologies used by Whyte into a toolbox filled with unprecedented and exciting opportunities to harness huge amounts of psychological data to make sense of how a city works.     Rush hour in Shibuya, Tokyo, the basis for one of the Relive models. Photograph: Rudy Sulgan/Corbis    For a fully realised science of urban psychology though, it isn&apos;t enough to have a powerful array of methods for the collection of data. We also need theory and experiment. For a truly scientific approach to the problem of the city, we need to be able to test hypotheses, and compare alternative urban realities. But how can we do this when our subject matter consists of vast constructions of concrete, glass and metal? We can&apos;t tear down and rearrange city blocks to see what works. In tandem with our arsenal of tools for measurements, we need a way to build hypothetical city spaces. How do we develop an experimental science of urban design? In the research laboratory for immersive virtual environments (Relive) at the University of Waterloo, we have turned to simulation methods to help build such a science. Participants are placed into highly immersive simulations of city spaces using sophisticated head-mounted displays and precise motion tracking. They are able to walk freely through photo-realistic simulations of urban spaces that are replete with depth, colour, and motion. We can monitor their gaze and their movements along with their physiology using a set of unobtrusive sensors while they do so. One of our environments is based on Shibuya, a hectic and seemingly chaotic part of Tokyo with its famous scramble crossing \u2013 one that allows pedestrians to cross from all directions. The use of 3D visualisations by architects and planners is not particularly new \u2013 design professionals often use simulations to explore the look and feel of a construction. What is new is the capability and will to explore our reactions to such simulations at a fine-grained level of analysis using sophisticated methods of data collection and analysis. Using such methods, we can explore the behaviour of a visitor to a virtual urban setting whose design, because it is built only of pixels, is entirely under our control and can be arranged and rearranged with a few keystrokes on a computer. For example, in one recent set of experiments, conducted by Kevin Barton of Relive, we designed a stark-looking industrial setting consisting of about 30 city blocks. The streetscapes were so designed to explore the impact of different types of layouts on how we find our way and how the shape of an environment influences attention, cognitive effort, and urban stress. One layout was very orderly, like a Manhattan, Washington or Canberra, while another was more organic and meandering, like New Orleans or London. We discovered that the manner in which such cityscapes were explored, and the psychological reactions to their design, varied strongly with their overall &quot;grammar&quot;. Journeys through the systematic spaces were stereotyped and efficient and accompanied by low levels of arousal and attention. Journeys through the more chaotic spaces were longer, filled with more hesitations, arousal and effortful attention. The value of such findings is that they give us a set of powerful methods by which to predict the psychological effects of an urban design before anything is built.     William Whyte on 5th Avenue, New York, in 1989. Whyte is considered the godfather of urban psychology. Photograph: William Foley/Time & Life Pictures/Getty    Although there is no doubting the power of a virtual reality simulation to unearth relationships between the organisation of the built environment and the operation of our minds, we still need to establish that our simulations are close enough to the real thing that findings from our laboratory generalise to the lived-in environment of a city filled with a hubbub of people, noise, smells, and traffic. For this, there is no substitute for experimentation at street level. Our approach has been to lead participants on walks through city spaces while wearing gear that allows us to measure their cognitive and emotional responses to what they experience. In one such study, conducted as a part of the travelling BMW-Guggenheim Laboratory, we were able to show that views of green space not only caused people to become happier but also changed their physiology \u2013 their autonomic nervous systems showed strong signs of relaxation responses. Though such a finding provides good ammunition for those who advocate for the importance of refreshing oases of nature in dense cities, it was hardly a surprise to us. What is more interesting is that we can reproduce these effects in simulations in our laboratory, meaning that we are able to pinpoint exactly what aspects of natural views produce such restoration. In one such study, conducted by Deltcho Valtchanov of Relive, we were able to produce physiological relaxation using views of virtual nature that was just as dramatic as that seen in visitors to real-world green spaces. In more recent work, we have shown that a part of the relaxation response to natural scenes hinges on specific properties of visual scenes that can be defined mathematically (the relative proportions of finely detailed contours as opposed to the more coarse &quot;blobby&quot; contours that are present in the image). What is exciting about this finding is both that it makes a good match with what is known of the preferences of brain areas known to be involved in reward and environmental preference, and that it provides a tool with which to predict the restorative potential of an urban vista on the basis of its visual properties, regardless of whether it contains trees and grass. This might point the way to methods that could optimise such effects in crowded cities where the space available for parkland is severely limited. The examples I have described suggest that a marriage of laboratory-based virtual reality simulations with real-world observations using smartphones and physiological sensors could form the basis of a new and powerful discipline of experimental urban design based on sound principles of psychology and neuroscience. As we move into an exciting new era of city design in which engaged citizens have never been more interested in how to make cities better, and in which they can be provided with good tools to contribute to the efforts to do so, we are poised to move into high gear. We have ambitious plans to move beyond these initial steps to build more comprehensive models of both existing and hypothetical city spaces in our lab, and to provide more tools to determine how to grow great cities. As we face an era of daunting problems including population growth, changing energy balances, urban densification, and climate change, the need for solutions has never been more pressing. But on the positive side, our approach provides a strong window of opportunity to entertain and implement important changes.

Twenty years ago, with the US economy recovering strongly from recession, the then chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, started to tighten policy. Markets reacted badly, particularly in the emerging world, to rising US borrowing costs. Mexico was the first domino to fall: Thailand; South Korea, Indonesia and Russia followed within the next four years. History is now starting to repeat itself. Although the Fed is currently not tightening policy (merely reducing the amount of monthly stimulus) the reaction in financial markets since the turn of the year has been as violent as it was in the spring of 1994. Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei fell by 4% on Tuesday and both it and Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng index have fallen by more than 10% since their recent peaks. To be fair, the recent market gyrations are not just the result of Fed tapering. There are also worries about China&apos;s slowing economy and the fragility of some of the world&apos;s leading emerging markets. Turkey is seen as the likeliest candidate to be the Mexico of this emerging markets crisis. That, of course, assumes that this is a crisis rather than just a wobble. Most of the sage voices in the financial markets are of the view that the fundamentals of the global economy are good. With monetary policy continuing to support growth, they are inclined to view sell-offs as buying opportunities, a chance to get in while prices are low. So far, there has been none of the capitulation you get when a crisis really takes hold. In those circumstances, investors forget all about &quot;buying opportunities&quot; and dump the lot. It would, though, be very unwise to rule out the possibility that this &quot;wobble&quot; could turn nasty. For a start, the world&apos;s capital markets are pretty much the same as they were two decades ago. Capital pours in when times are good and pours out when times are bad. Secondly, the period since last May, when the Fed first announced it was thinking of tapering, has exposed the structural weaknesses of some of the bigger emerging economies: not just inflation-prone Turkey and Argentina, but commodity-dependent Russia and infrastructure-weak India. If investors need an excuse to pull out they don&apos;t have to look very hard. Finally, crises go through easily defined stages. First you have the boom, then the denial period when nobody can accept that there is a problem. The next phase is acceptance, a grudging acknowledgement that there a few isolated problems that need to be addressed. The penultimate stage is panic, followed by confession, when sins are repented. So where are we now? Somewhere between denial and acceptance at a guess."}, {"sentences": ["SAYONARA 1 T. C.

I do apologize for the late announcement of the last two competition results. With three comps in quick succession this is always a busy time for me, and our holiday in India merely added to the pressure. Things should return to normal for the time being from February, barring the unforeseen. SAYONARA proved unexpectedly awkward to clue effectively, making the judging process correspondingly difficult, and there was much unsoundness from less experienced solvers. This included the frequent use of &apos;back&apos; to indicate reversal, which I&apos;ve always found unacceptable in a down word. (&apos;Back up&apos; would be all right.) Several of you asked concernedly whether the choice of clue word was my way of announcing in advance the ending of the Azed series, in the same way that Araucaria warned his many solvers of his last illness by inserting a number of thematic words in one of his Guardian puzzles. I&apos;m happy to dispel any such fears. I am as healthy as increasing age permits and have no plans to stop setting as long as I remain so. And on the subject of Araucaria, more than a few clues submitted were on the lines of &apos;Valedictory extract from essay on Araucaria&apos;, a nice tribute but, alas, just too popular to gain higher than HC placing in the lists. More cricketing references, I&apos;m afraid, with &apos;bye&apos; invitingly possible as a definition for SAYONARA. And the arrival on the test-match scene of Ben Stokes makes the abbreviation S for &apos;stokes&apos; (in what sense I know not) more attractive than hitherto. I certainly cannot declare a moratorium on such usage, beyond the general warning that clues with a cricketing theme in their surface reading are not an automatic guarantee of preference in the eyes of the judge!"}, {"sentences": ["John Doyle and his partner Laura Martires, from Portugal, formed studio Index in Tokyo 2011 where the couple met whilst studying."], "tags": ["Architecture", "Australia news", "Design", "Art and design"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-05T05:45:42Z", "title": "Melbourne: the home of hot architects", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/05/melbourne-archiecture-sibling-index-michael-ong", "article": "Melbourne is a city that embraces the innovator, the dreamer and the doer, which is probably why it attracts so many architects \u2013 like me. When my business partner Juliet Moore and I set up our studio Edwards Moore four years ago, the city seemed young and agile, while boasting world class buildings and spaces such as the RMIT Design Hub, Federation Square and the Melbourne Recital Centre. It offered a &quot;have a go&quot; ethos and a welcoming of difference \u2013 be it in architectural style or project type.  There\u2019s a strong community spirit among the city\u2019s architects, who frequently share their ideas. Set up in 2012, New Architects Melbourne meet regularly to discuss projects and air their opinions over a beer. And there&apos;s the Monday evening meet-up in the city&apos;s Loop Bar where architects can swap design experiences and present ideas. There are many exciting design studios, each with big goals, its own voice and a strong identity, producing rigorous and ambitious designs. Here are some of the best.     Avoid the NSA: Sibling's On/Off installation at Melbourne university.    Sibling Who? Established in 2012 by eight friends,  Sibling studio crosses the disciplines of architecture, urbanism, cultural analysis and communication, producing not just buildings but also installations, strategies and events.   What have they built? One of Sibling&apos;s founders, Nicholas Braun, says their approach to design \u201cinsists on spatial forms that foster an engagement with broader social issues\u201d. A recent project, the installation  On/Off at Melbourne University, questions our connected world of data cables, smartphones, radio frequencies and surveillance through the creation of a modern day Faraday Cage. This structure prevents electromagnetic charges reaching its interior to create a space of disconnection and escape. Braun calls it \u201ca gesture to physically connect people in a space with architecture creating a filter or temporary firewall between the individual and the world\u201d.   Sibling are working on designs for a new regional museum \u2013 their largest project to date \u2013 along with some retail projects exploring the online selling strategy as well as the physical space.     You need Hans ... Ong's Hans House. Photograph: MODO/Ricky Fung     Michael Ong Who? Melbourne-born Ong has been named in Italian architectural journal Casabella\u2019s 2013 list of international architects under 30. Why Melbourne? Ong says he\u2019s \u201ca little biased, but as a young architect, Melbourne is arguably one of the for most supportive and exciting cities to be in right now.\u201d  What has he built? Completed in 2013, the architect\u2019s first project, the Hans house, is a beautifully detailed exercise in restraint. Built in the suburb of Aberfeldie, it comprises a two-storey angled timber box hovering over a ground level living space, in which the form cradles and pulls the landscape in and towards the centre of the house.  Ong is currently working on a number of residential projects due to start on site later this year. One of these is a three-storey house just 3.7m wide and built over an existing laneway in north Melbourne. \u201cIt\u2019s a project which I hope to explore alternative architectural typologies as we move into a denser way of living and dwelling,\u201d he says.     Heard of the knuckle sandwich? Here's the house to match.    Index Who? John Doyle and his partner Laura Martires, from Portugal, formed studio Index in Tokyo 2011 where the couple met whilst studying. They enjoy working across a range of projects from small-scale renovations, houses and fit-outs to large scale masterplan projects citing their goal as design \u201cbeyond simple problem-solving\u201d. Why Melbourne? \u201cMelbourne\u2019s architecture and design scene is one of the most vibrant and exciting in the world,\u201d says Doyle. \u201cThe key to this is the huge range of small and experimental practices that are at work\u201d.  What have they built? Their latest project, Knuckle House, completed at the end of 2013 is a house in the form of a human knuckle. It is divided into a series of segments which are slipped and rotated in order to allow natural light to penetrate deep into the plan. \u201cThe brief called for large living spaces that included access to courtyard gardens, as well as a balcony to take advantage of views of the city,\u201d explains Doyle.     That's Amore ... a loft apartment by Adrian Amore.    Adrian Amore  Who? Trained in Melbourne, Amore is an architect with an interest in \u201ca city\u2019s sense of place, form, detail and in creating sensuous architecture\u201d.  Why Melbourne? \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting city to be working as an architect because of its relative infancy. There is a sense that there is possibility to have input into the way the city is shaped and projected on the world stage.\u201d What has he built? Housed in a former butter factory in west Melbourne, Amore\u2019s freshly-finished loft apartment project features walls that tear, bend and converge. Its jaw-dropping sculptural stair forms the focus and backdrop to the apartment, twisting and soaring upwards to a roof deck that overlooks the city. The open-plan ground level is defined by bending and wrapping walls which contain bathroom and storage spaces.  He is currently working on concepts for a split-level concrete house for a surburban site in inner Melbourne as well as a sculptural steel office building on a tricky, narrow site in Carlton."}, {"sentences": ["Demon\u2019s Soul was originally overlooked when it was revealed at the Tokyo Game Show in 2008."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Xbox", "PC", "PlayStation", "PS3", "Game culture", "Peter Serafinowicz"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-06T07:00:03Z", "title": "Dark Souls II \u2013 has the best game of a generation been saved until last?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/06/dark-souls-ii-has-the-best-game-of-a-generation-been-saved-until-last", "article": "Video games no longer launch within a meritocracy \u2013 if indeed they ever did. The sheer volume of new titles released via Steam and smartphone app stores mean that many interesting, unusual or well-crafted projects fail to reach the audience that they perhaps deserve. Flash-in-the-pan success stories such as the Vietnamese-made Flappy Bird, the iOS phenomenon-du-jour, can seem capricious; these are unpredictable outliers from whose success few meaningful lessons can truly be drawn.  From Software\u2019s Dark Souls series (which debuted with the Sony-funded Demon\u2019s Souls on PlayStation 3) is an exception to the rule. Its success has been slow, steady and entirely fuelled by the joyous admiration and grassroots support of players around the world. Demon\u2019s Soul was originally overlooked when it was revealed at the Tokyo Game Show in 2008. This dark fantasy-themed action game demands that players learn, understand and master its systems, or else face severe punishment. The precise nature of its combat is at odds with insta-thrills of popular button-mashing contemporaries while the dingy aesthetic and ephemeral storyline make the game ill-suited to a ten-minute burst of play on a noisy show floor. Some players even put the controller down before they made it past the character creation screen, the game\u2019s creator Hidetaki Miyazaki has said.     xx    As such, Sony launched Demon\u2019s Souls in Japan with little fanfare. The game sold fewer than 30,000 copies in its first week. But then word of mouth spread and a tail of sales began to extend and rise. Another publisher picked Demon\u2019s Souls up for a Western launch and, when this was met with profitable success, From Software began work on a sequel, Dark Souls, which would became one of the best-regarded video games of the past decade. Unlike Flappy Bird, Dark Souls\u2019 success is easier to quantify, even if it boldly eschews current fashions in style and design. About as far from the churning mainstream of gung-ho action games as one can trek, in Dark Souls you skitter through narrow sewers and dense forests while cowering behind a shield. Your only hope is to come across one of the bonfires that punctuate this unforgiving world, a rare point of safety to which you will return if your character is killed in battle. It\u2019s tense, taut and the sense of achievement when you overcome one of the game\u2019s many and varied pitfalls is unusually potent. Dark Souls\u2019 subsequent success was not founded on marketing spend, then, but on the grim, evangelical affection of its players.     xx    It\u2019s this same affection that landed the British actor and comedian Peter Serafinowicz a key role in Dark Souls II, which launches next month. He was so enamoured with its predecessor that he approached Namco-Bandai with an offer to lend his voice to one of the forthcoming game\u2019s characters. The publisher agreed and Serafinowicz has provided not only the voice of Pate, one of the game\u2019s typically inscrutably and weird inhabitants, but also the grunts of exertion and screams of terror that make up the main player character\u2019s vocal repertoire. Even the game\u2019s contributing actors appear to have come for love, not money. As well as the kindness of talented fans, Dark Souls II has clearly benefitted from the kind of additional investment that success affords. Its world, a shadowy island that seems to be in equal parts based on the crags and froth of the Cornish coastline and the granite-faced castles and conifers of Romania has been built upon an all new graphical engine. It renders the island\u2019s nooks and contours with exquisite grace. The game\u2019s opening section takes place within a deserted clearing where small mammals scuttle and cringe in the tall grass, and where you are lead toward your goal by an enticing use of lighting. Each scene has been composed with greater care than was seen in the earlier games; the sense of aesthetic wonder when you finally emerge from a network of stone corridors onto a yellow-grassed coastline is unforgettable.     xx Photograph: /PR    This sequel\u2019s style and rhythm is entirely in keeping with the previous titles in the series. This is a haunting and haunted netherworld of chinked cobblestones, crumbling clock towers and beleaguered knights. You meet other travellers slumped against walls or tree stumps, and they offer barely sensical encouragement or admonishment \u2013 all of which adds to the mystique. The world appears to be open for exploration: there are multiple routes that can be taken right from the start, each with its own awaiting snares and terrors. The series\u2019 wonderfully esoteric and ambient multiplayer aspects remain: you can see ghost-like animations that reveal where other players died (perhaps offering a clue as to a hidden danger) while its possible to invade or be invaded by other players for co-operative or combative play at any moment. The tweaks to gameplay are subtle. The game now allows for regional matching, so you can play alongside players from your nation should you prefer. There are now two ways to jump in the game both of which are more easily executed than in the past. Melee damage is determined by your distance to a target, increasing as you close in, a development that adds further subtlety and nuance to what is already the finest combat system in video games. Your character, chosen from a clutch of classes, can equip four status-affecting rings instead of two. This is a game without a pause button, but while you\u2019re delving about in menu screens your character is now shown on screen, so it\u2019s easier to notice if you\u2019re being attacked while changing your equipment, for example. The inventory has been overhauled for simpler management, and a \u2018Soul Vessel\u2019 item allows you to reset your character\u2019s parameters (where before you were forced to begin the game afresh with a new character).     xx    New items allow you to alter the game\u2019s difficulty. One, when burned at a bonfire, will increase enemies\u2019 power in the vicinity. Another item increases the capacity of your Estus Flask, the item that replenishes your character\u2019s health. There are improved ways to ward off other players who would invade your game and wreak havoc (including punitive measures for those who continually murder other players: it\u2019s possible for these spoilsports to see their health capped as low as ten per cent of its capacity).  These small amends may have tremendous knock-on effects. But they are also minutiae in a game where the broad sweep experience is arguably more important than the nitty-gritty detail. Dark Souls found its audience through attention to detail, but more importantly, its ambiance, idiosyncratic character, mysterious, foggy storyline and, of course, those unforgettable set-piece battles. That all of these factors make a return for this sequel is one of the few mysteries that can be solved ahead of the game\u2019s release. \u2022 Dark Souls II is out on 11 March (US), 14 March (Europe), on Xbox 360 and PS3.

The company \u2013 which will have recorded losses for six out of the last seven years \u2013 was forced to scrap forecasts for a \u00a3180m profit it made only last October and said instead it would hurtle more than \u00a3600m into the red as it absorbs the costs of making 5,000 more staff redundant. In April 2012, chief executive Kazuo Hirai slashed 10,000 jobs, but a failed attempt to return its TV business to profitability has now prompted more drastic measures. Sony&apos;s long-term credit rating was cut to junk last month by Moody&apos;s, over concerns at the losses in computers and television sets. It was already rated junk by Fitch. The shake-up, announced on Thursday, is Hirai&apos;s second big attack on costs since taking office two years ago. After 17 years in the personal computing business, the Japanese multinational has decided to walk away from laptops and focus its engineering talent on smartphones, games consoles, and its movie and music studios. Sales of desktop computers are in decline across the industry as consumers switch their activity to laptops and phones. The television business has not made a profit since 2004, with losses totalling \u00a34.6bn in nine years, and Hirai said he hoped greater independence from the mother company would make the division more agile. Sony is an increasingly distant third to Samsung and LG in televisions, with its share of global sales falling from 8.1% to 7.5% in the last quarter . &quot;I think we are heading in the right direction, and by making it a separate company we will speed decision-making up,&quot; Hirai told reporters in Tokyo. &quot;As for the future, there are many possibilities, and not just for our TV business.&quot; Sony retained its October forecast for sales of 14m LCD sets, but said the division would incur a 10th consecutive annual loss, costing the group \u00a3150m this year. The smartphone business is also loss-making, but the group&apos;s Xperia phones are selling well and Sony has reached third position in the global smartphone rankings, according to Bloomberg. However, the forecast was cut from 42m to 40m units for the year ahead. Some analysts, however, said Sony&apos;s moves were too little, too late: &quot;The reform announced today comes far too late,&quot; said Masahiko Ishino, of Advanced Research Japan Co. &quot;Sony cannot take measures ahead of changes in market deterioration. There isn&apos;t much hope to revive the electronics business overall.&quot; Sony has had more success with gaming. Its PlayStation 4, released head to head against the Xbox One before Christmas, has sold more than 4.2m units \u2013 trumping the 3m-plus shipments for Microsoft&apos;s machine. Box office success for American Hustle and Captain Phillips, and hopes for the latest in the Spider-Man franchise, have helped Hirai resist calls from the American hedge fund boss Daniel Loeb, who has been lobbying Sony to spin off its movie and distribution units. Loeb wanted a separate stock listing for the studios, with 20% of the equity to be traded publicly. Instead, Sony has hired management consultants Bain &amp; Co to advise on a restructuring. &quot;There&apos;s no prospect of its TV business being profitable,&quot; said Makoto Kikuchi, the Tokyo-based chief executive officer for Myojo Asset Management Co. &quot;Sony&apos;s strengths are content such as games and movies. It cannot increase profit without moving its focus from TV production to content.&quot; The Vaio division will be sold to private equity group Japan Industrial Partners, for an estimated \u00a3300m. A separate company will be set up to manage the business, in which Sony will retain a 5% stake. The company will retain control of television making for now, but Hirai has not ruled out a sale. &quot;My responsibility is to turn around the electronics operation,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d like to say this time&apos;s reform is final but amid intensifying competition, reform may be needed going forward.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["We had creative sessions in San Francisco, Paris, and Tokyo, with people talking all at once in three different languages."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Wii U", "Nintendo", "Sonic the Hedgehog", "3DS"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-06T21:09:22Z", "title": "Sonic Boom \u2013 gaming's hedgehog hero reinvented", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/06/sonic-boom-gamings-he", "article": "If you played video games in the nineties, you know Sonic the Hedgehog. You know how Sega dreamed up its spiky, slightly rebellious hero as an answer to Nintendo\u2019s moustache-wielding, mushroom-chomping Mario character. You also know this was very much the Blur vs Oasis of the gaming world, dividing a whole generation along pixellated battle lines. Were you Sonic or were you Mario? School playgrounds around the world were bitterly divided.  Over the following twenty years, Sega has updated its mascot for every new generation of hardware, providing fresh enemies and revised environments, and bridging the gap between the character\u2019s 2D origins and the three-dimensional worlds of modern games. There have been notable successes: the first four brilliant, revolutionary titles, Sonic Rush on the Nintendo DS, Sonic Adventure 2 on Dreamcast. There have been depressing failures, too (we\u2019re looking at you, extreme sports travesty, Sonic Riders, and you Sonic Unleashed, in which Sonic turns into a, ugh, werehog). But the original creators of the game \u2013Sonic Team \u2013 have usually been in full creative control, prodding their progeny forward with little tweaks here and a few graphical flourish there. A gradual evolution, then.  But that is about to change.   Sonic Boom is \u2013 Sega claims \u2013 a bold new take on its hedgehog icon, a sort of side-universe to the main series. David Corless, the global brand director for Sonic, likens it to the way Marvel and DC often have multiple comic book titles for each of their major super heroes. Developed as part of Sega\u2019s current publishing deal with Nintendo, the game will launch only on Wii U and 3DS in the autumn. Who could have imaged a deal like that when Sonic arrived to challenge the Mario hegemony in 1991? Meanwhile, leading French animation studio OuiDo has been brought in to create a companion animated series to coincide with the launch \u2013 it\u2019s the first new TV outing for Sonic since the anime series Sonic X ten years ago, and the first to to be developed in CGI. Sega has also inked a deal with Tomy to produce a range of tie-in action figures and playsets. This is a true cross-generation lunge at Sonic\u2019s still vast fan base.      Amy has come a long way since her original incarnation as a lovestruck Sonic fan.    At the heart of it all is a co-op action adventure, allowing two players to team up and take on Sonic\u2019s archenemy Dr Eggman and his hordes of metallic minions. Early teaser trailers, however, hint that a major new enemy is being added, although Sega is of course, remaining tight-lipped for now. What we do know is there are four familiar heroes to choose from \u2013 Sonic, naturally, and his friends Knuckles, Tails and Amy, each with their own specific moves and abilities.  What will immediately strike veteran fans is the pretty radical re-design of these familiar platforming icons. Sonic now has a dashing scarf (yes, hedgehogs accessorise) and athletic tape wrapped round his wrists, like a boxer. Also... he has completely blue arms now. Blue arms! They were sort of flesh coloured before \u2013 and have been since the beginning. He looks grown up. Which is the point. \u201cThe objective was to make the characters instantly recognisable as being from Sonic Boom,\u201d says Bob Rafei, the creative director at LA-based studio Big Red Button, which is handling the new title. \u201cWe explored various costume options and quickly found the limits of what works and what doesn\u2019t. Since we wanted to push the characterisation of Sonic and friends to fit our narrative, I thought it more appropriate to make them a touch older by adjusting their head, hand and feet proportions. The athletic tape hints at a team that is ready for any action \u2013 it is about practicality rather than vanity. Given they have very clean graphic lines, it was important not to clutter their silhouettes, so any little addition had to be carefully considered. They are designed for an epic action adventure.\u201d The emphasis of the game will be on how the characters collaborate through each level. Sonic has speed (duh), but Knuckles has strength, Tails has his gadgets, and Amy wields her usual gigantic hammer. On top of this, the studio has added a new mechanic, the \u2018ener-beam\u2019 a sort of elastic force that links the two player characters together. This is clearly a way of preventing players from straying too far apart on screen, but it can also be exploited in useful various ways \u2013 for example, stretching the link to its limit in order to catapult one character over a chasm or into an enemy. It\u2019s a weird concept, it sounds sort of awkward, but at least it is new.     Knuckles is the muscle of the operation.    Rafei insists he was determined to avoid some of the cliches of cooperative play. \u201cIt was one of our biggest challenges,\u201d he says. \u201cWe constantly had to remind ourselves not to fall into the trap of creating babysitting, escort or protection style scenarios where one player is gated by the other simply for the sake of co-op. What we don\u2019t want is forced co-op play resulting in excessive interruption to gameplay momentum. Through extensive play-testing we settled on the right balance of opportunistic moments in combat and co-op environmental puzzles placed at key moments that are meaningful to the player.\u201d So what sort of game is it really? A 3D platformer? An open-world adventure? Rafei, who once worked at world renowned studio Naughty Dog on titles like Crash Bandicoot and Jak &amp; Daxter, says the team was most heavily inspired by Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and the later Sega Dreamcast game, Sonic Adventure, which shifted the feel of the series from platforming to 3D action and exploration. \u201cSonic 2 had a \u2018team\u2019 vibe between Sonic and Tails and we wanted to recapture that plus kick things up a notch by adding Amy and Knuckles to the equation,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn Sonic Adventure, the game\u2019s structure offered exploration and discovery that opened up more as the player progressed. We believe this is a great approach and modelled Sonic Boom after it. We also love what Sonic Team did with Sonic Generations, giving the player 2D and 3D variations of the same level. Our take was to integrate 2D and 3D seamlessly within the level in a way that made sense, keeping things fresh for the player.\u201d The environments we\u2019ve glimpsed will be very familiar to Sonic veterans. Lush green hills, azure skies, glowing beaches extending off into a nuclear explosion of a sunset. This time though, everything has been designed with both a game and an animated TV series in mind. The developers at Big Red Button worked closely with OuiDo to get the look of the characters and the world just right, using some of the same art and CGI assets and sharing their ideas with Sonic Team\u2019s Japanese heads who oversaw and advised on the whole project. \u201cThere was lots of collaboration on the design side,\u201d says OuiDo executive producer, Evan Baily. \u201cOn the TV side, our director, Natalys Raut-Sieuzac, led the way, along with Sandrine and OuiDo\u2019s team of designers. We had creative sessions in San Francisco, Paris, and Tokyo, with people talking all at once in three different languages. It was very exciting to put our heads together to find a look that felt true to the DNA of Sonic, but also new.\u201c \u2022 Sonic Boom \u2013 the reinvention of a gaming icon, in pictures     Tails is the inventor of the team, bringing a range of gadgets into the equation. And of course, he can fly.    The result is that both the game and the TV series take ideas and inspiration from each other. \u201cGame and TV animation are different animals so we looked for opportunities to cross-pollinate ideas,\u201d says Rafei. \u201cCharacters that were developed for the game crossed over to the show and vice versa. Guidelines we developed with Sonic team for bosses, as example, were carried over to the show in effort to have consistency.\u201c  A key concern for Big Red Button has apparently been to explore the unique touchscreen interfaces of the Wii U and 3DS consoles. The former comes with its GamePad controller, which features its own screen like a tablet PC. \u201cThe GamePad display has given us a great solution for local co-op play,\u201d says Rafei. \u201cWe tried different solutions for our co-op camera, including single split-screen display, but ultimately this wasn\u2019t able to service our game vision. The GamePad also has a look-around mode where the player can scan the environment looking for clues and hints to secrets in the game. As for 3DS, there are some crossover plans between it and the Wii U involving special unlocks for Sonic fans who have both versions.\u201d     The Sonic team    With firm details of the game rather lacking right now, skeptical Sonic veterans will no doubt feel they have been here, or hereabouts before. Sega has promised great things from previous Sonic reinventions, but the games have always been anchored to the immutable origins of the character as a 2D hero, a relic of the Mega Drive era. Sega conceded to this with its 2011 title Sonic Generations, which mixed 2D stages in with 3D environments, tugging at the heartstrings of nostalgic fans. Sonic is, in someways, gaming\u2019s Star Wars, an entertainment brand lodged in the memories of thirty-something fans who remember how they once idolised the series but have then had to put up with years of diminishing returns. There have been bright spots, certainly, but can we ever find our way back to Sonic 1, 2 or 3, to the sheer design genius that drove Yuji Naka, Naoto \u014cshima and Hirokazu Yasuhara to disrupt the sedate flow of the platforming genre? Sonic Boom, then, has a lot to prove. Keeping fans onboard while attempting to ensnare the eight-to-11 year-olds will be a huge challenge. And we\u2019ve seen far too little to know how it has been met. No doubt Sega will be showing more of the game at the huge E3 video game conference in Los Angeles in June. And the publisher is currently working on deals with TV channels to host the 11min animated episodes. This new action adventure, with its emphasis on comic escapades and an older cast, carries a lot of weight on its re-energised shoulders. The Sonic vs Mario wars may be officially over, but some of us still root for Sega\u2019s spiky icon. This is an intriguing offshoot, but let\u2019s hope it shoots off in the right direction. \u2022 Sonic Boom - gallery"}, {"sentences": ["Browse our Tokyo city guide     Image three    Image three: Mount Kilimanjaro, TanzaniaFancy a trip?"], "tags": ["Travel"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-07T06:00:00Z", "title": "Name the mountains \u2013 picture quiz answers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/feb/07/mountains-picture-quiz-answers", "article": "Image one: Matterhorn, Switzerland/ItalyFancy a trip?

The prime minister said he was making his intervention because he wanted Scots to realise that people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were not looking the other way or walking on by. &quot;It&apos;s so important for Scotland to realise that the rest of the family see this as a very important family decision,&quot; he told an audience at the velodrome in London&apos;s Olympic Park. Cameron said all 63 million people in the UK had a voice in this year&apos;s historic referendum and urged people across the country to &quot;pick up the phone&quot; to friends and family in Scotland to urge them to vote against independence in September. After setting out the moral, economic, geopolitical and diplomatic arguments against Scottish independence, Cameron said there was &quot;an emotional, patriotic case&quot; that traditionally reticent Brits had been too reluctant to make. Cameron is aware he is not the most persuasive voice in Scotland, but believes he cannot stay out of the argument and has chosen to raise the emotional stakes in the referendum. He admitted: &quot;Some people have even advised me to stay out of this issue \u2013 and not to get too sentimental about the UK&quot;, but added: &quot;I care far too much to stay out of it.&quot; He said he would be making further speeches in Scotland in the coming months and taking the cabinet to Scotland, and wanted to set out his belief that the UK family would be diminished if the Scots took the irreversible decision to leave.     Your country needs you: Cameron's evocation of the Olympic spirit was criticised by Scotland's deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA    The SNP said the speech reflected jitters in the no campaign and said it was despicable that Cameron had dragged in the emotion of British Olympic success to win an argument about independence. But Cameron brushed aside the criticism, saying: &quot;Sometimes we can forget just how big our reputation is, that the world over the letters &apos;UK&apos; stand for unique, brilliant, creative, eccentric, ingenious. We come as a brand \u2013 a powerful brand. &quot;Separating Scotland out of that brand would be like separating the waters of the river Tweed and the North Sea. If we lost Scotland, if the UK changed, we would rip the rug from under our own reputation.

He said: &quot;I passionately hope that my children will be able to teach their children the same \u2013 that the stamp on their passport is a mark of pride. That together, these islands really do stand for something more than the sum of our parts, they stand for bigger ideals, nobler causes, greater values. &quot;This is our home \u2013 and I could not bear to see that home torn apart. I love this country. I love the United Kingdom and all it stands for. And I will fight with all I have to keep us together.&quot; In a warning to people who have so far given the referendum debate little attention, he said: &quot;Centuries of history hang in the balance; a question mark hangs over the future of our United Kingdom. &quot;If people vote yes in September, then Scotland will become an independent country. There will be no going back.&quot; Cameron said for him the best thing about the Olympics &quot;wasn&apos;t the winning; it was the red, the white, the blue. It was the summer that patriotism came out of the shadows and into the sun.

There can be no complacency about the result of this referendum. The outcome is still up in the air and we have just seven months to go. Seven months to do all we can to keep our United Kingdom as one. Seven months to save the most extraordinary country in history. &quot;And we must do whatever it takes. So to everyone in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; everyone, like me, who cares about the United Kingdom, I want to say this: you don&apos;t have a vote, but you do have a voice. Those voting are our friends, neighbours and family. &quot;You do have an influence. Get on the phone, get together, email, tweet, speak. Let the message ring out from Manchester to Motherwell, from Pembrokeshire to Perth, from Belfast to Bute, from us to the people of Scotland \u2013 let the message be this: we want you to stay.&quot; Nicola Sturgeon, the deputy first minister of Scotland, said: &quot;It is a mistake to mix politics and sport in this way. I welcome people in the rest of the UK like David Cameron being part of the debate, but he cannot have his cake and eat it. He cannot say &apos;I want to be part of the debate&apos;, but then say &apos;No, I am not prepared to come to Scotland and have a head-to-head debate with the first minister [Alex Salmond]&apos;. &quot;If that continues to be his position, he does not have the courage of his convictions, he does not have the guts to come here and actually test his argument against the arguments of Alex Salmond, and the yes campaign. &quot;If David Cameron is still not prepared to do that but continue to deliver lectures from London, people will draw their own conclusions from that.&quot; She added: &quot;Now we are being love-bombed, so let us celebrate the bonds of history, culture and family in all parts of the UK \u2013 but that does not mean we should be governed from London.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The track that got us out of bed this morning Mal Waldron: Rock One For Jimbo San   Pure intensity from &quot;The Man&quot;, taken from Japanese-only issue Tokyo Bound, an album highly recommended by us."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Electronic music", "Dance music"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-07T18:00:00Z", "title": "Demdike Stare's favourite tracks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/07/demdike-stare-favourite-tracks", "article": "The track we&apos;ll be opening our next DJ set with Various Artists: No 8  Genius workout from the wizard that is Torsten Pr\u00f6frock, a mesmerising loop over nearly 20 minutes that unfolds into something very rare-sounding, not quite ambient music, or dancefloor.

Leon was born in London, the son of Martin, a property developer and Kindertransport refugee, and Doris (nee Berman), a gabardine importer. Leon&apos;s interest in cartoons started at the age of six, when he began copying the works of Michael Cummings. But he soon developed his own style and, at the age of 14, while at University College school, won the Observer&apos;s national political cartoon competition. He entered the Slade art school in London at the age of 17 but after about a year suddenly announced that he was catching the Trans-Siberian Express to Japan. He settled in Tokyo, scratching out a living teaching English as a foreign language. It was here that he not only met Akemi, whom he married several years later, but also discovered karate, which he studied and practised, almost daily, for the next 38 years. On his return to London in 1979 Leon found it impossible to secure a regular outlet for his work, although his cartoons appeared, from time to time, in the New Statesman, News on Sunday, Socialist Worker, New Internationalist, Green Socialist and, more recently, the Morning Star. In 1983 Leon published The Big Bang for Bureaucrats, a series of cartoons depicting the absurdities of those emergency circulars instructing local government officials how to prepare for the aftermath of a nuclear attack. Leon described this work as attempting &quot;a different type of political cartooning that is at the same time more informative and more offensive&quot;. Leon&apos;s work remained largely unpublished and it was perhaps his frustration at the lack of recognition that eventually prompted him to take his cartoons on to the street. Harnessing his art to the anti-war movement that sprang up in 2001 with the Nato attack on Afghanistan, and working closely with Artists Against the War, Leon created two cartoon postcards which he also turned into large posters and, standing at the top of Park Lane, began advertising his work. He found himself overwhelmed by demonstrators wanting to buy his cards, and was to become a familiar sight at demonstrations with his improvised sandwich board, drawing crowds queuing up to buy his latest work. I still remember the day he phoned, in great excitement, to tell me that he had just seen a photograph of a poster-size image of his postcard Mad Dogs and Englishmen on the side of a rickshaw in Dhaka. It was not unusual to see photographs of Leon&apos;s work carried at antiwar demonstrations in cities as far afield as San Francisco, Rome and Mexico. His work even featured in the 2006 film Children of Men and in Mark Wallinger&apos;s 2007 Turner Prize entry State Britain. Leon was responsible for most of the visual art for the Respect party&apos;s election campaigns (2004-07). He also produced, in collaboration with Colin Gill, Topple the Mighty (2005), a &quot;wrecker&apos;s guide to London statues&quot;, examining the darker deeds concealed behind a number of well known statues. A good selection of Leon&apos;s art can be seen at leonkuhn.org.uk Leon is survived by Akemi and his partner Keiko."}, {"sentences": ["The rest is pretty much not worth the flight, but this is one Vermonter&apos;s opinion, and then we have all those leaves in the autumn.Doreen Forney, Pownal, Vermont, US \u2022 American exceptionalism: the real author is Joseph Stalin and it wasn&apos;t a compliment.Barbara Koch, Mansonville, Quebec, Canada \u2022 America is exceptionally deluded, especially about where to pick a fight.Christine Acres, Tokyo, Japan \u2022 The US has the biggest debt of any country, yet has many billionaires and a growing number of poor people.Nick Bagnall, Omokoroa Beach, New Zealand Nowheresville is where it&apos;s at Where exactly is the middle of nowhere?"], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2014-02-11T13:59:00Z", "title": "Someone's end is surely nigh", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/feb/11/notes-queries-when-is-end-nigh", "article": "What end is nigh and when?

The machinist&apos;s needle is poised over the Hiut Denim jeans, then a rapid burst of click-clacking leaves a perfect line of golden stitches around the fly. The precision of the work is the hallmark of someone who has been making jeans for almost 30 years. However, this skill would probably have been lost without Hiut Denim, which was set up two years ago in Cardigan, a small market town in west Wales. The company makes high-end jeans, costing up to \u00a3230 for a pair of selvedge denim, and sells them direct to customers through its website. It is part of a new breed of smaller British manufacturers that are eschewing traditional routes to market and embracing the benefits of the web. Hiut is the sort of operation that George Osborne evoked in his 2011 budget speech when he envisaged a &quot;march of the makers&quot; who would bolster Britain&apos;s fragile finances and rebalance the economy. The jeans-maker was launched by David Hieatt, a former Saatchi advertising copywriter, and his wife, Clare, who together had already founded another Cardigan-based clothing brand, Howies. The creation of Hiut Denim is rooted in the history of Cardigan. The town was once home to the biggest jeans factory in Britain, employing 400 in a town of 4,000 people. Dewhirst Ladieswear made jeans for Marks &amp; Spencer until it closed the Cardigan operation and moved production to Morocco in November 2002. Evans says the shutdown was &quot;like a bereavement&quot;. It ripped the heart out of the town and dumped about 10% of the population on the dole overnight. But Hieatt recognised that the skills remained even though the factory was gone. &quot;Even the postman who picks up our parcels at the end of the day used to cut jeans for 20 years,&quot; he says. &quot;Like humans, towns can lose confidence. Cardigan lost some of its mojo when Dewhirst closed. It was world-class at making jeans one day, and the next day it was gone. They [staff] have got a second chance, myself and Clare have got a second chance and so has the town.&quot; The Hieatts, who are Welsh, started Howies as a T-shirt-making operation in their London home in 1995. It grew, and they moved it to Cardigan in 2001. But rapid growth blew a hole in the brand&apos;s finances and they were eventually forced to sell the business to Timberland, an American group, in 2006. Three years later, the husband and wife team left the business after clashing with the Timberland hierarchy about the direction of Howies. &quot;I made mistakes [with Howies],&quot; Hieatt admits. &quot;So there is an element of unfinished business. It was a good apprenticeship because we wouldn&apos;t know how to build this now. I have to prove to myself that this time I can get it right.&quot; Hiut \u2013 a combination of the first two letters of his surname and &quot;utility&quot; \u2013 started making jeans in Cardigan two years ago with five people, including staff from the old Dewhirst factory. The operation now has 10 employees \u2013 including four &quot;grand masters&quot;, as Hieatt likes to call the machinists \u2013 because of their combined experience of more than 100 years. He believes he can create a world-beating jeans brand from this part of west Wales to take on the likes of Nudie and Dr Denim. The next big step on that road will be to design a perfect pair of jeans for women. Hieatt is confident the brand can carve out a niche in the women&apos;s market and has just signed up one of only three mills in the world that can supply X Fit denim. This material comprises strands of crimped polyester wrapped in cotton, which enables the soft cloth to stretch in all directions without losing shape. &quot;We want to launch a women&apos;s X Fit jean in April and we will invite all the shops down here for it,&quot; he says. If Hiut can crack the women&apos;s market, Hieatt will probably need a bigger factory. &quot;I want to get those 390 other people their jobs back,&quot; he says. Conventional wisdom suggests the company would stand a better chance of success by moving production to Asia, where labour is cheaper. But Hieatt reckons the internet has helped level the playing field. He scampers off into his whitewashed office to grab a laptop. The screen shows two images of crowds outside the Vatican in Rome to greet a new pope. One picture dates from 2005; the other from 2013. &quot;In the first one, from 2005, you are lucky if you can spot two people holding mobile phones,&quot; he says. &quot;In the second one, from last year, you are lucky if you can spot two people without mobile phones.&quot; It demonstrates why high streets have become wastelands of empty stores \u2013 smartphones are portable shopping centres that have transformed the way people shop. &quot;I can&apos;t think of anything that the internet is not changing in some way. It is making the march of the makers more doable,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s why I love those pictures. Stories travel for free now and they travel fast.&quot; Social media has played a huge part in helping Hiut reach denim geeks in the hipster hotspots of London, New York and Tokyo. In its short life, the company has gained influential devotees, including &quot;Taffia&quot; Welsh rock royalty such as the Manic Street Preachers, Gruff Rhys from Super Furry Animals and Cate le Bon. Other converts to the brand include ageing punks the Stranglers, and Ant and Dec, who wore the Welsh company&apos;s jeans during the latest series of I&apos;m a Celebrity. The TV presenters also gave the jeans-maker an unexpected boost by tweeting their denim allegiance to their 3.2 million followers. The plug was invaluable, Hieatt says: &quot;Celebrities have an incredible power, and when your marketing budget is as big as your coffee budget it&apos;s great because we couldn&apos;t afford to reach those people by traditional means.&quot; If building a global denim brand from rural west Wales seems ambitious, Hieatt&apos;s next project is even more so. Four years ago, he thought about launching a startup school for budding entrepreneurs. He couldn&apos;t figure out the business model, so for a while nothing happened. He then read about Y Combinator, the US fund created by four computer programmers and venture capitalists that provides seed capital. The fund takes a small stake in fledgling firms in return for 12 weeks of some of the best mentoring and business advice on the planet. It has funded successful technology companies such as Dropbox, Scribd and Reddit. &quot;This got me thinking &apos;why not do our own startup school in Cardigan?&apos;&quot; says Hieatt. &quot;We pay people \u00a310,000 to come along and we take a 7% stake. At the end of the 12-week course, we get all the money men here and the companies can pitch for funding.&quot; To get the Dragons Den-style school up and running, Hieatt must first raise \u00a34m. He hopes the financial regulator will approve the venture within the next few weeks. This will give him the green light to contact financial backers. Why is this project so important to him? Hieatt pauses, then recalls a story about how Jack Lemmon inspired a teenage Kevin Spacey after seeing the younger actor in a youth theatre show and taking the time to give him some advice. &quot;Lemmon later told him it was important to send the elevator back down for those starting out on the ground floor.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The US troops are at the heart of a political battle that will have far reaching consequences for the security of an increasingly unstable Asia-Pacific: if the Japanese and US get their way a decade from now the picturesque coastline below Camp Schwab will reverberate to the roar of military aircraft taking off and landing on an offshore runway whose fate has pitted Okinawa against the government in Tokyo, and which threatens to sour Japan&apos;s relations with the US.", "&quot;It says the new base will have no environmental impact, and that building a new base will reduce the burden on the people of Okinawa, but how can anyone seriously believe that?&quot; Eager to prevent creating more friction with Washington, government officials in Tokyo insisted the relocation would go ahead as planned, despite Inamine&apos;s recent election victory."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US news", "US military"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-11T20:45:00Z", "title": "US envoy visits Okinawa amid long-running row over military bases", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/11/us-envoy-okinawa-dispute-caroline-kennedy", "article": "The azure waters lapping at the sandy beaches of the city of Nago could have leapt straight out of a brochure. But the yells coming from a nearby football field at Camp Schwab, overlooking the north-east coast of Okinawa, offer a clue to the area&apos;s envisaged future, not as a holiday destination but as a bedrock of the region&apos;s security with thousands of US troops at its core. Here, groups of marines are being put through their paces during an exercise in armed, non-lethal, combat. &quot;Open your eyes!&quot; barks an officer as his charges brave a faceful of pepper spray before trying to pacify &quot;enemy&quot; soldiers. The US troops are at the heart of a political battle that will have far reaching consequences for the security of an increasingly unstable Asia-Pacific: if the Japanese and US get their way a decade from now the picturesque coastline below Camp Schwab will reverberate to the roar of military aircraft taking off and landing on an offshore runway whose fate has pitted Okinawa against the government in Tokyo, and which threatens to sour Japan&apos;s relations with the US. Caroline Kennedy, the US ambassador to Japan, will find herself at the centre of this dispute during a brief visit to Okinawa on Wednesday. Her welcoming party may well include hundreds of people who on Tuesday attended a rally ahead of her arrival, holding signs calling for the closure of all military bases on Okinawa. Kennedy will visit a peace park, dedicated to the estimated 230,000 soldiers and civilians who died in Okinawa in the final months of the second world war, before meeting the island&apos;s governor. Local media reports said she would also view the proposed site of the new runway from a helicopter. Successive US and Japanese administrations have said the troop presence on Okinawa has contributed to peace in the Asia-Pacific for the past 70 years, and must stay put amid modern-day threats to stability from Chinese naval aggression and the looming presence of an unpredictable, and nuclear-armed, North Korea. But in 1995, both countries were forced to confront Okinawa&apos;s military burden after public outrage over the abduction and rape that year of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen. The incident brought hundreds of thousands of Okinawans on to the streets. Years of negotiations led to a compromise plan of moving Futenma, a marine corps base in a densely populated city, to an offshore site at the eastern outskirts of Nago. As an additional sweetener about 8,000 marines and their families are to be transferred out of Okinawa to Guam and Hawaii. But 18 years after the allies agreed to move Futenma, not a single marine or piece of military hardware has been moved, amid fierce opposition from voters in Nago and their anti-base mayor, Susumu Inamine. &quot;Without the mayor&apos;s approval and consent, this process cannot go forward,&quot; said Inamine, who was re-elected last month. &quot;In order to protect the future for our children I will not allow a new base to be built here.&quot; The stage is now set for a long and potentially bitter battle between Okinawa, the Japanese government and the US. The stakes are high: failure to build the new facility, which is expected to cost at least $8.6bn (\u00a35.3bn), would pose the most serious challenge yet to the Obama administration&apos;s planned strategic &quot;pivot&quot; towards the Asia-Pacific. The relocation plan received a boost late last year when the governor of Okinawa prefecture, Hirokazu Nakaima, who once opposed the base move, approved permits for land reclamation at the new site. Admiral Samuel Locklear, head of the US Pacific command, welcomed Nakaima&apos;s about-turn, calling the argument for relocating to Nago compelling. But opponents have since filed a lawsuit in an attempt to invalidate the governor&apos;s approval. Locklear told a briefing he was aware of local opposition to the move, but added: &quot;From a military perspective, having the base [there] as soon as possible will allow the [security] alliance to move forward.&quot; Nakaima, who faces an election later this year, has been accused of being bought off by Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who had earlier promised 300bn yen in annual investment for Okinawa, Japan&apos;s poorest prefecture, through to 2021. &quot;Our opposition to the relocation will continue for as long as necessary,&quot; said Jun Asato, chief of military base countermeasures at Nago city hall. &quot;The people made their voices heard in the election. We want Futenma out of Okinawa. Its replacement should be built somewhere else in Japan, or overseas. Ideally, all of the military bases here should be shut down.&quot; US military officials in Okinawa insist the relocation should go ahead as planned. To retain their ability to respond quickly, for instance to an emergency in the East China sea, their logistical, air and ground forces must be close together, they say. Removing one or more would compromise their ability to safeguard the region&apos;s security, they maintain. Noah Rappahahn, a first lieutenant, said: &quot;The most important thing is that all three of those elements are in place. That&apos;s what makes the marines so different. They all need to train together to be effective. After all, the marines are a war fighting organisation. &quot;That&apos;s why the relocation plan is a step in the right direction. The Futenma base will move away from a populated area, land can be returned [to its civilian owners] and the new facility will have less of an impact on the local population. We care about the local community and the need to return land and ensure their safety.&quot; For the anti-base activists who have continued a non-violent protest from a beachside tent near Camp Schwab for the past 17 years, the relocation is a test of Japan&apos;s democratic health. &quot;Voters in Nago have had their say, but the Japanese government is ignoring the result, just as it has always ignored the people of Okinawa,&quot; said Hideki Yoshikawa, of the Citizens&apos; Network for Biodiversity in Okinawa. &quot;That, and the environmental destruction that would come with the new runway, is what angers us most.&quot; Yoshikawa said the planned construction of the offshore, V-shaped, runway on reclaimed land would destroy the bay&apos;s delicate ecosystem, which includes one of the few remaining habitats for the dugong, and threaten the safety of 2,000 residents living closest to the site. &quot;My advice to ambassador Kennedy would be to not trust the Japanese government,&quot; he said. &quot;It says the new base will have no environmental impact, and that building a new base will reduce the burden on the people of Okinawa, but how can anyone seriously believe that?&quot; Eager to prevent creating more friction with Washington, government officials in Tokyo insisted the relocation would go ahead as planned, despite Inamine&apos;s recent election victory. But activists say the project can expect even fiercer opposition, with many protesters expected to take to canoes and fishing boats to obstruct offshore surveying work. &quot;As a last resort we will occupy the site,&quot; said Hiroyuki Tanaka, a regular at the protest tent. Local authorities, meanwhile, can call on an armoury of procedural hurdles, such as denying construction firms the use of local ports and roads. &quot;It is going to get nasty,&quot; said a source familiar with the relocation plans, who did not wish to be named. &quot;There are lots of older residents opposed to the base who say they don&apos;t have that long to live and will do anything to stop construction. That is a very scary prospect.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 12 February 2014.

She added: &quot;Hopefully we can work together to keep the momentum moving forward for progress.&quot; Okinawa, located about 1,000 miles south of Tokyo, hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops in Japan and three quarters of US bases. Kennedy&apos;s first trip to Japan&apos;s southernmost prefecture comes as Tokyo seeks guarantees of Washington&apos;s support over its long-running dispute with China over ownership of the Senkaku islands, in the East China Sea. The US has refused to take sides in the dispute, but says it will honour its security treaty obligations to come to Japan&apos;s aid if it comes under attack. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is determined to break the current deadlock over the proposed relocation of Futenma, a US marine corps airbase in Okinawa, from the middle of a densely populated area to an offshore site on the outskirts of Nago city. Tokyo and Washington agreed to the move, plus the transfer of about 8,000 troops and their families to Guam and Hawaii, after the 1995 rape of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa by three US servicemen. But local opposition has so far prevented the relocation from going ahead. Many Okinawans, angered by pollution, crimes involving servicemen and the risk of aircraft accidents, are demanding that Futenma be moved off the island altogether. Nakaima, who once opposed the relocation, recently made an about-turn and granted permits to begin land reclamation at the new site, setting him on a collision course with the mayor of Nago, Susumu Inamine, who was re-elected last month on an anti-base platform. &quot;There are various problems \u2026 such as crimes, accidents, environmental issues and so on,&quot; Nakaima told Kennedy. &quot;We would like to seek your help so we can resolve the issue and reduce our burden of hosting US bases.&quot; Outside, a small but vocal group of protesters denounced Kennedy&apos;s visit as an empty gesture, with some asking why she had no plans to discuss the base move with Inamine, who is expected to attempt to delay construction by, for example, blocking developers&apos; use of local ports and roads. But most of their anger was directed at Nakaima, whose decision on land reclamation now faces a legal challenge. &quot;Until he gave his consent, in almost 70 years not one political leader in Okinawa had said the bases were welcome here,&quot; said Kazunobu Akamine, a 60-year-old demonstrator. &quot;He did the worst thing imaginable. &quot;We will never agree to the construction of the new base. The people of Okinawa are being discriminated against by the Japanese government and, by extension, the United States.&quot; The Okinawan media seized on Kennedy&apos;s criticism last month of the dolphin slaughter in Taiji to demand why she was not similarly concerned about the fate of the dugong, a sea mammal whose habitat off the coast of Nago will be affected by the base construction. &quot;You expressed that you were deeply concerned by the &apos;inhumaneness&apos; of drive-hunt dolphin killing,&quot; the Ryukyu Shimpo newspaper said. &quot;Then is it not inhumane to pose a threat to the habitat of the dugongs by destroying their feeding grounds?&quot; In an open letter to Kennedy, the Okinawa Times said that to go ahead with the relocation in defiance of local wishes &quot;is completely unacceptable in a democratic society&quot;. The paper continued: &quot;To attempt to build a new military airbase in Okinawa, after the tragedy of the Battle of Okinawa, the long and difficult 27 years of American occupation that followed it, and the disproportionate burden of military bases shouldered by Okinawa since, is nothing but blatant discrimination against the Okinawan people. Please relay these feelings to President Obama.&quot; Earlier in the day, Kennedy laid a wreath at a memorial to the 240,000 people, including US troops and about a quarter of the island&apos;s civilian population, who died during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945."}, {"sentences": ["His Kuwait embassy in Tokyo might have been assembled from several vaguely similar extant buildings, while the Shizuoka press centre is all cages attached to a stout pole."], "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-13T07:00:00Z", "title": "The incredible hulks: Jonathan Meades' A-Z of brutalism", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/13/jonathan-meades-brutalism-a-z", "article": "Asplund The term nybrutalism, new brutalism, was the jocular coinage of architect Hans Asplund. He applied it to a small house in Uppsala, in his native Sweden, designed in 1949 by his contemporaries Bengt Edman and Lennart Holm and built of bricks. Were it not for that material, the house might stand as the very example of the light, ascetic, prim, nordic modernism that afflicted Britain for some years after the war. The Festival of Britain in\u00a01951 was actually The Festival of Plagiarising Scandinavian Architecture. Asplund&apos;s neologism caught on in Stockholm and was picked up by British architectural pilgrims to that city, among them Oliver Cox, Graeme Shankland and Michael Ventris, the decoder of Linear B (an ancient script seen as one of the great linguistic riddles). Although the epithet signified nothing, or maybe because it signified nothing, it was taken up as a slogan of defiance or something by arty young British architects, none artier than Alison and Peter Smithson and their representative on Earth, Reyner Banham, an architectural critic whose prose may cause all but the entirely insentient to wince. The Smithsons&apos; Hunstanton School in Norfolk, finished in 1954, derives from Mies van der Rohe and has little in common with subsequent buildings that were deemed brutalist. B\u00e9ton brut Banham expanded Asplund&apos;s coinage, turning it into a bilingual pun on the French b\u00e9ton brut \u2013 literally raw concrete. Exposed concrete, left rough and unfinished, would become the defining trait of brutalism. So Banham, with his weakness for feeble wordplay, linked brutality with concrete, even though there had\u00a0been concrete structures since the\u00a0Romans, most of them pacific. The shared etymology of brut and brutal was unfortunate. Monoglot opponents of brutalist buildings \u2013 knowing nothing of b\u00e9ton brut and apprised only of the English component, brutal \u2013 were handed the ammunition of what seems like a boast of culpable aggression. Or maybe not: the French, to whom the pun was clear, have been no more appreciative of their brutalist buildings than the English. Cit\u00e9 Radieuse Before the war, Le Corbusier&apos;s work was sleek, smooth, right-angled, rational. Postwar, he led the reaction against such architecture: he dumped a technical manual in favour of ecstatic poetry. La Cit\u00e9 Radieuse in Marseille, aka l&apos;Unit\u00e9 d&apos;Habitation, was the first of his\u00a0exercises in sculptural and plastic moulded concrete which, in spirit if not style, have affinities with the primitivist tendency of the arts and crafts. L&apos;Unit\u00e9 gave the word brutalism a meaning. Le Corbusier ripped off countless other artists and architects, notably Fernand L\u00e9ger, Pablo Picasso and most importantly Friedrich Tamms. Indeed, his later oeuvre can be viewed as a synthesis of thefts. Le Corbusier never applied the word brutalist to his own work.     Tricorn Centre, Portsmouth. Photograph: View Pictures/Rex    Dystopia Brutalism is the decor of dystopian films, literature and comics, just as gothic is for horror. See Alphaville, A Clockwork Orange, Blade Runner, Get Carter, La Haine. Books and films have of course impinged on the way brutalist buildings have been judged down the years, assisting in their condemnation. They have been found wanting beside the holyhocked cottages and winking dormers beloved by Blighty. Expressionism Brutalism, as Nikolaus Pevsner pointed out with some distaste, had its roots in expressionism, the jagged, often counter-intuitive, mostly brick idiom that flourished in the Netherlands, Germany and the Baltic states from 1910 to 1930. Its greatest exponent was Michel de Klerk, whose social housing projects in Amsterdam retain, a century after they were made, a beguiling freshness. Its kitschiest exponent was Bernhard Hoetger. His B\u00f6ttcherstrasse in Bremen, a street 100m long, was commissioned by the inventor of decaffeinated coffee, Ludwig Roselius, who dedicated it to Adolf Hitler. At the 1936 Nuremberg Rally, Hitler showed his gratitude by declaring it decadent.     Gottfried B\u00f6hm's Mariendom, in Neviges, Germany    F\u00f6rderer Vatican II was a godsend to architects. The Roman Catholic church was a generous, adventurous patron, and its buildings were to be advertisements for the church&apos;s newfound modernity. With few functional demands to take into consideration, architects enjoyed carte blanche. God can, apparently, live anywhere \u2013 and in the 1960s, he shared the widespread taste for open-plan spaces and theatre-in-the-round. The boundary between architecture and sculpture, which Le Corbusier had broached, was now comprehensively trampled. The architects who most took advantage of this were Walter F\u00f6rderer in Switzerland and Germany, Gottfried B\u00f6hm in and around Cologne, and Fritz Wotruba in Vienna. Their work defines brutalism. It is accretive, ostentatious, hyperbolic in its asymmetries and protracted voids, composed of parts that do not connect or are in a fragmentary state, dramatically vertiginous, geometrically farouche, extravagantly cantilevered, discomfiting, aggressive (in so far as an inanimate object can be \u00a0aggressive). There is no desire to please with prettiness or even beauty. The reaction demanded is that of awe. The quality that the greatest brutalist buildings manifest is sublimity. Geology Brutalist architecture did not seek to represent geological formations. It sought to create buildings that matched such formations, even challenged them. Mankind could take on nature and win, could make its own yardangs and hoodoos. Half a century ago, mankind lorded it over the earth. The practices of being friendly to vegetables and minerals, and of granting rights to animals were far in the future \u2013 though they had, of course, been de rigueur in Germany for 12 years, from the Nazis&apos; seizure of power to their defeat. H To anyone under the age of 50, brutalism belongs to the age of their non-existence. It is something that happened in history, while postmodernism is still with us. But now, having ransacked all other dressing-up boxes, architects have gradually turned to brutalism for inspiration. The most prolific is Jurgen Mayer Hermann, who trades as J Mayer H. His border checkpoints and service stations in Georgia might, at first glance, be taken for works of the 1960s \u2013 they are uncompromising, assertive, convinced of the artist&apos;s right to impose his vision without consultation, without accommodating consensual taste. Imperial College London Sheppard Robson&apos;s magnificent hall of\u00a0residence in South Kensington was finished in 1963 and demolished 42 years later. It is not shown on the practice&apos;s website. Nor are its slightly later and happily extant lecture halls at Brunel University. Are its current architects embarrassed by their predecessors&apos; work? Uneasy about how potential clients might react? Imperial College has form in this area. Some professor of a &quot;discipline&quot; called Sustainable Energy in Business defends the destruction of cooling towers thus: &quot;You have to think: how much does this enhance the landscape compared to what else we could do if we weren&apos;t having to maintain the towers?&quot; This is the very epitome of unreflective short-termism and a not-particularly-convincing justification for sanctioned vandalism. Jasari The School of Advanced Proxenetism, in Albania&apos;s capital Tirana, was designed by the late Nexhat Jasari, whose other works included soundproofed containers, experimental dungeons and the Presidential Bison Run.     Jonathan Meades in front of Skopje post office, Macedonia. Photograph: Francis Hanly/BBC    Konstantinov   Skopje \u2013 in Macedonia, then the southernmost Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \u2013 was largely destroyed by an earthquake in July 1963. The masterplan for rebuilding the city was undertaken by the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. Most of the actual buildings were designed by Yugoslav architects, among them Janko Konstantinov, whose post-office complex presages the wild and delirious spomenik memorials to the National Liberation War (ie the second world war). President Tito commissioned scores of these futuristic melds of architecture and sculpture, some of which have been recorded by Belgian photographer Jan Kempenaers. Many, however, were destroyed during the 1990s civil wars. Konstantinov&apos;s work also presages the weirdly joyous style of the later years of the Soviet satellites, the Leonid Brezhnev Plays Las Vegas school of architecture. Much of this has been recorded by the French photographer Fr\u00e9deric Chaubin.     The Trinity Square car park, Gateshead. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA    Luder The three finest works of British brutalism were designed by Rodney Gordon of the Owen Luder Partnership. They were: Eros House in Catford, London; the Tricorn in Portsmouth; and the Trinity in Gateshead. The first, a block of flats, is disfigured; the other two shopping centre and car park complexes have been destroyed in acts of petty-minded provincial vandalism. One can have nothing but contempt for the scum-of-the-earth councillors, blind planners and toady local journalists who conspired to effect the demolition of such masterpieces. One can only despair at the pusillanimous lack of support from wretched English Heritage. The dependably crass Prince of Wales, the man who sullied Dorset with Poundbury, described the Tricorn as &quot;a mildewed lump of elephant droppings&quot;, a simile as vulgar as it is visually inept. No doubt his heritage industry toadies removed their tongues in order to chortle a moment&apos;s laughter. The critic Ian Nairn was on the money: &quot;This great belly laugh of forms ... the only thing that has been squandered is imagination.&quot; Gordon&apos;s imagination was indeed fecund, rich, untrammelled. It was haunted by Russian constructivism, crusader castles, Levantine skylines. But the paramount desire was to make an architecture that had not previously existed. There are as many ideas in a single Gordon building as there are in the entire careers of most architects. The seldom-photographed street level stuff at the Trinity left the observer with the sensation of being in the presence of genius. One thinks of the burning of books. Monstrosity It took more than three-quarters of a\u00a0century before high Victorian architecture began to be rehabilitated through the efforts of John Betjeman, Evelyn Waugh, etc. Their pleas went unheeded. They were reckoned to be perverse and mischievous. Thousands of &quot;monstrosities&quot; were destroyed. The survivors are now widely valued, and lost ones are mourned. We\u00a0have learned nothing. Half a century after brutalism&apos;s heyday, the\u00a0term &quot;concrete monstrosity&quot; trips\u00a0readily off the tongues of the unseeing, the torpid, the incurious. Britain is once again being architecturally cleansed in favour of timidity and\u00a0insipidity. New Newness and change were bound to be for the better. When Harold Macmillan announced in 1957 that &quot;most of our people have never had it so good&quot;, some of our people were still living in caves (in the Severn valley), and many of our people had no bathrooms and shared outdoor toilets. Built along brutalist lines, new flats had all those amenities, plus central heating, and were welcomed by their occupants. Social-housing projects were not yet bins for sociopaths. But they would soon become so: if blocks are unguarded, if there are no janitors, if they are not maintained \u2026 You don&apos;t buy a car and never get it serviced. Organisation Todt The Nazis&apos; civil-engineering arm, named after Fritz Todt, built motorways and arranged their surrounds in order to achieve minimal damage to the landscape. These animal-lovers were nothing if not green. From the outbreak of war, its work was almost entirely martial. After Todt&apos;s death in 1942, the OT was directed by Albert Speer. Its architects included Werner March, author of the 1936 Berlin Olympics stadium, and the startlingly prolific Friedrich Tamms, who created the designs for 60 different types of gun emplacement, bunkers, shelters, flak towers, U-boat bases, etc. Tamms was, arguably, the first brutalist. He revived the expressionism that the Nazis had proscribed. The forms he used were seldom functional. Rather, they employ the imagery of might \u2013 vizors, chainmail fists, anthropomorphism and zoomorphism. They were terrifyingly graphic warnings to the people of occupied countries.     Sainte Bernadette church, Nevers. Photograph: Collection Artedia/VIEW    Parent The church of Saint Bernadette in Nevers, France, consecrated in 1966, is the work of architect Claude Parent and theorist Paul Virilio. For some years, they had been studying the thousands of structures that comprise the Atlantic Wall, the coastal fortifications built \u2013 by slave labour \u2013 along the west of Europe from 1940-44. The similarities between these structures and brutalist architecture had been brushed under the carpet. In their huge bunker-like church, Parent and Virilio make the link explicit. Quebec Canada&apos;s most extreme examples of brutalism are in Quebec City, which boasts Dimitri Dimakopoulos&apos;s boorish Concorde Hotel; and in Quebec Province, home to Moshe Safdie&apos;s thrilling Habitat 67, a collision of 150 residential units in\u00a0Montreal that appear to teeter perilously. The effect is both fragmented and monolithic: a labyrinth made by termites with an eye for right angles. Robbins The Committee on Higher Education, chaired by economist Lionel Robbins, sat from 1961-63. Its report recommended a massive expansion of tertiary education. New universities were to be built. Old universities and colleges were to be extended. One reaction was Kingsley Amis&apos;s observation that &quot;more will mean worse&quot;. Another was delight on the part of architects who saw an incomparably rich gravy train approaching. Denys Lasdun&apos;s University of East Anglia is perhaps the finest of the lot. The Roger Stevens building at Leeds \u2013 by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon \u2013 is agreeably weird. One minor nail, a drawing pin, in brutalism&apos;s coffin was its rapid espousal by the Wilsonian establishment, which caused half-witted spartist protest-kids to identify it with repressive authority. Soreq Those protest-kids have no doubt directed many howls of self-righteous anger at the Soreq Nuclear Research Plant in Israel. The architect was Philip Johnson who, in his long life (he lived to 99 and never retired), had jumped on many bandwagons and even started a few. One of this creepy socialite&apos;s many enthusiasms was Hitler, which makes an Israeli commission a matter of wonder. While his brutalist buildings in the US are as unconvincing as most of his oeuvre, this temple to radiation on the dunes a few miles south of Tel Aviv is impressive. Brutalism was the cold war&apos;s architectural mode, on both sides of the Iron Curtain \u2013 Mutually Assured Construction.     Kenzo Tange's Yamanashi press and broadcasting centre, Kofu, Japan    Tange Kenzo Tange&apos;s viscerally exhilarating Yamanashi press and broadcasting centre in the Japanese city of Kofu is a vast machine that seems to be missing vital parts. His Kuwait embassy in Tokyo might have been assembled from several vaguely similar extant buildings, while the Shizuoka press centre is all cages attached to a stout pole. Elsewhere, Tange hangs cantilevers at oblique angles and creates buildings that look as if they are in the process of collapsing. Utzon The Danish architect J\u00f8rn Utzon is celebrated for the Sydney Opera House. His essays in brutalism were failures, tentative and timid. Indeed, this was an idiom for which Scandinavians seemed to have had no stomach. A tragic lack of insensitivity and an excess of rationality no doubt militated against its adoption. Vanbrugh The proto-brutalist John Vanbrugh&apos;s buildings were widely lambasted while he was still alive. Blenheim was described as &quot;a quarry&quot;. When he died, the Reverend Abel Evans famously wrote: &quot;Lie heavy on him earth! For he\u00a0/laid many a heavy a load on thee.&quot; World&apos;s End This estate of seven London towers, between King&apos;s Road and the Embankment, was designed by Jim Cadbury-Brown and Eric Lyons. More than any other London scheme, it demonstrates brutalism&apos;s debt to expressionism, explicitly that of Hamburg and Bremen. It is restless, angular, red brick, complicated. Cadbury-Brown&apos;s earlier work included the Royal College of Art, an equally commanding presence. X Team X was a loose grouping of youngish architects, manifesto folk, who in 1953 broke\u00a0with CIAM (Congr\u00e8s International d&apos;Architecture Moderne) to pursue a less rational architecture \u2013 in other words, they had understood\u00a0the prevailing change of\u00a0mood. The\u00a0group included Le Corbusier&apos;s collaborators Shadrach Woods and George Candelis, who had been instrumental in changing that mood, and the Smithsons. In\u00a0Rachel Cooke&apos;s Her Brilliant Career, there is a photograph of the teenage Alison Smithson. At first\u00a0glance, it appears to be Kevin Rowland in Dexy&apos;s ragamuffin period. This is worrying. Yale Paul Rudolph began his career, in Florida, by designing light and airy houses, mostly of modular construction. He moved from these chamber\u00a0pieces to full-blown and very noisy\u00a0symphonies: massive, lumbering, sullen campus buildings that manifest a spectacular indifference to what anyone thinks of them. This is sod-you-ism at its most stubborn. One is obviously led to think of clumsy robots sodomising each other. Rudolph was dean of Yale&apos;s architecture school and author of that faculty&apos;s building. Among his pupils were Richard Rogers\u00a0and Norman Foster. Photoshop Rogers&apos;s Lloyds building and render it\u00a0as though it were built of concrete. Zapotec During the 1920s, there was a California craze for neo-Mayan architecture or, more precisely, exterior decoration. The pre-Columbian modes that attracted attention in the 1960s were the Zapotec and the Inca: massive, bold, cyclopean, devoted to 45\u00b0 slopes. Where building ends and natural formations begin is often moot. \u2022 Jonathan Meades&apos;s Bunkers, Brutalism, Bloodymindedness: Concrete Poetry starts on BBC4 at 9pm on Sunday. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 February 2014 to correct Evans&apos;s epigram on Vanbrugh."}, {"sentences": ["The band are known in the Tokyo scene for constantly evolving their sound and also for being a truly DIY entity, producing and distributing their records exclusively by themselves."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Folk music"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-13T17:09:34Z", "title": "Six must-listen new tracks from around the world", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/feb/13/six-must-listen-new-tracks-from-around-the-world", "article": "IRELAND: Ha\u00fcer - Helicop Serenity B: \u201dHa\u00fcer is a Dublin-based one man set-up cursed with a weakness for nostalgic 80s music production and synth-based cinematic film scores.

She scoops up two trays of sushi marked 50% off in the evening sale \u2013 a regular feature at supermarkets across the city.

I moved here a few years ago when I wanted to be in a fun part of town and I didn&apos;t mind so much about the expenses. But now we&apos;re thinking of moving farther out, beyond Tokyo. We could easily get a bigger place for less.&quot; In what has become a predictable annual announcement, the Economist Intelligence Unit last year declared the Japanese capital to be the most expensive city on the planet. Its calculation, based on the weighted average of the cost of 160 goods and services, has put Tokyo at the top of the ranking for 14 of the past 20 years. While the yardstick offers some insight into life in the metropolis, it perpetuates skewed notions left over from the 1980s, when a domestic spending spree created an economic mirage, sent prices sky high, and frightened off many foreign visitors. Prolonged deflation and falling wages long ago convinced Tokyo residents to forgo conspicuous consumption for a more prudent lifestyle. To cater to their penny-pinching approach, chains of enormously successful discount retailers sprang up, persuading people to spend less and, in turn, driving the cycle of deflation. Tenants pay a premium to live in the capital \u2013 a monthly average \u00a53,124 (\u00a318.50) per square metre over 55 square metres, or about 42% of wages for a typical, single-income household. But they must dig deeper for their onerous annual ward taxes \u2013 and, because the Fukushima disaster prompted a shutdown of all 50 nuclear reactors across the country, they are also paying more than \u00a58,000 a month in household electricity bills.     Rents in Tokyo are so high that half those aged 20 \u2013 34 live with their parents. Photograph: Shuji Kajiyama/AP    &quot;It&apos;s true that prices for some things in Tokyo are still expensive,&quot; says interior designer Ako Miura, &quot;but the real problem for people who live here is how much they get paid.&quot; The 30-year-old recently returned to the city where she lived as a child after a long stint in Melbourne (number five on the Economist&apos;s list last year). She was thrilled to land a position at an architecture firm that handles major commercial projects across the city, less so when she found out what she would be earning. &quot;The first three months, they put me on this trial period which is just \u00a5200,000 (\u00a31,183) [a month],&quot; she says. Since then her pay has gone up to \u00a5280,000, about two-thirds of her earnings in Melbourne, and still some way off the record-low average monthly earnings of \u00a5314,150 for Japanese workers in 2013. &quot;I couldn&apos;t say no,&quot; says Miura, who usually puts in 11-hour days at the office and gets home after 9pm. &quot;And anyway, I&apos;ve heard that in the architecture field, our company actually pays generously compared with lots of other companies, which shocks me a bit. Young people in Tokyo earn really bad money.&quot; So meagre are their earnings that half of Japanese between 20 and 34 live with their parents, convinced they do not make enough to support an independent lifestyle. Since peaking in 1997, salaries across all age groups have fallen by 15%. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has implored companies to share a recent surge in profits with their staff, but most are reluctant. Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at IHS Global Insight in Tokyo, forecasts that wages will rise by just 1% this year, while inflation will increase by 2.7%. A consumption tax increase in April \u2013 from 5 to 8% \u2013 is also causing anxiety among shoppers.     For many workers in Tokyo, poor pay rather than high prices presents the biggest challenge. Photograph: Shizuo Kambayashi/AP    &quot;I can understand why people are cautious,&quot; says Miura, who opted for a cheap lease on a 39-square-metre apartment in Shimokitazawa, a lively neighbourhood of bars, galleries and thrift shops popular with students and young professionals. With her boyfriend, she pays just \u00a584,000 a month \u2013 well below the average for the neighbourhood \u2013 but only because the apartment block went up in 1974, several years before building regulations incorporated the latest earthquake safety guidelines. They signed the contract over the loud protestations of Miura&apos;s sister-in-law, the guarantor. While her boyfriend looked for work, Miura supported them both on her trial wage. She gave up eating out altogether and also cosmetics for a while, and she and her boyfriend restricted themselves to discount clothing chains, such as the hugely popular &quot;non-label&quot; labels Uniqlo and Muji. Uniqlo, in particular, has enjoyed a stratospheric rise, driven by the universal appeal of its basic range. &quot;Winter was coming, so we were a bit anxious,&quot; says Miura. &quot;Without Uniqlo, I don&apos;t think my boyfriend would have survived. He&apos;s okay that he&apos;s got a job now, but back then the temperature was falling every day and he had to buy this Heattech stuff, which provides extra warmth. It&apos;s cheap to start with, but Uniqlo discounts every weekend \u2013 it&apos;s crazy.&quot; She pauses to think, then says: &quot;Actually, I think all his clothes are either Muji or Uniqlo.&quot; Bargains are not limited to clothing stores. Celebrated Michelin-starred restaurants might charge upwards of \u00a520,000 (\u00a3118) for dinner, but across the Japanese capital, beef-bowl chains are engaged in a neverending price war, some offering meals for as little as \u00a5300. Bento meals from convenience stores start at about the same price. And more extravagant lunches include two or three courses for just \u00a51,000. Miura concedes that she and her boyfriend are &quot;picky&quot; about food. &quot;Now that we both have jobs, we sometimes eat out. In Melbourne, we could occasionally afford to go somewhere really nice for special occasions, but here we can&apos;t do that.&quot; The cost of some discretionary purchases in Tokyo is more sobering. A trip to the cinema starts at \u00a51,800 (\u00a310.60) and, from April, taxis will charge \u00a5730 before even leaving the rank. But Miura sticks to the city&apos;s famously reliable rail network because of a system under which most Japanese companies cover the commuting costs of their full-time staff. &quot;Every little bit helps,&quot; she says. &quot;It was a big stress when we moved here, but we survived and that surprised me. I thought okay, you can live supercheap here if you want, but I don&apos;t want to be back to student life again. That&apos;s the thing about Tokyo. You can get by on very little \u2013 if you make sacrifices."}, {"sentences": ["But Caracas is not alone \u2013 from Tokyo to Singapore, unaffordable megalopolises are crippling their less fortunate residents.", "\u2022 More from our Unaffordable Cities series: Tokyo \u2013 Singapore \u2013 Caracas \u2013 Berlin"], "tags": ["Cities", "Petrol prices"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-14T07:00:00Z", "title": "The world's most expensive cities", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/datablog/2014/feb/14/most-expensive-cities", "article": "In Caracas a 1kg loaf of bread will cost you US$9.40, in Mumbai just $0.86.

The deal would more than double the number of users in Rakuten\u2019s digital empire, which offers services from financing to shopping to online video on its e-commerce platform, the largest in Japan. In the face of a shrinking population and weak consumer spending at home, however, Mikitani is trying to re-invent Rakuten as a one-stop-site for a global audience. Privately held Viber, run from Cyprus by the Israeli entrepreneur Talmon Marco, will add 300 million users to Rakuten\u2019s existing 200 million users, Mikitani told reporters in Tokyo. \u201cThis acquisition \u2026 will take Rakuten to a different level \u2026 Developing this messaging system on our own would have been impossible,\u201d said Mikitani, who is also the company\u2019s chief executive, adding that Rakuten users could, for example, use Viber\u2019s instant messages to contact an online store while considering a purchase. Rakuten\u2019s e-commerce platform, Rakuten Ichiba, is the sixth largest in the world by sales. The company puts a premium on its ability to communicate with customers. Last year, Mikitani told Reuters this personal touch will give Rakuten the edge over rivals like eBay and Amazon in Europe, where recession-hit retailers are struggling to tempt clients to spend. Rakuten has spent big in recent years on a variety of overseas purchases to broaden its businesses and reach under what Mikitani calls its \u201cRakuten Ecosystem\u201d strategy. The company has acquired e-commerce providers from Brazil to Germany, as well as Toronto-based eReader business Kobo and online video providers Wuaki.tv of Spain and Viki of Singapore. In 2012, it made a large investment in website Pinterest. \u201cThis combination presents an amazing opportunity for Viber to enhance our rapid user growth in both existing and new markets,\u201d said Marco in a statement. \u201cSharing similar aspirations with Rakuten, our vision is to be the world\u2019s number one communications platform and our combination with Rakuten is an important step in that direction.\u201d Viber is one of the top five most downloaded smartphone phone call and messaging apps, and counts the United States, Russia and Australia among its biggest markets. It recently launched an instant messaging app for personal computers that allows users to make outgoing mobile calls to other Viber users and non-registered mobiles, making it a rival to Skype. Its 300 million registered users represents growth of over 120% in 2013. But the company is tight-lipped about how many of its users are \u201cactive\u201d, rather than merely signed-up for the service. By indicators such as tweets or google search activity, it appears tiny in comparison to competitors such as Skype and Whatsapp. The acquisition by Rakuten is expected to be completed by the end of March, both companies said."}, {"sentences": ["\u201cThis includes the question of how an Adiz might or might not come about.\u201d In a stridently anti-Japanese editorial on Friday, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency said the US must pressure Tokyo into ceasing its \u201cprovocative moves\u201d or risk a future regional conflict."], "tags": ["China", "World news", "North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-14T16:07:58Z", "title": "Upbeat Kerry says China willing to press North Korea on nuclear program", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/14/john-kerry-china-north-korea-nuclear-program", "article": "US secretary of state John Kerry struck a positive tone on Friday about China\u2019s commitment to pressuring North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program. Kerry told reporters in Beijing that he has discussed \u201calmost every subject of concern for the United States and China and the region\u201d with Chinese leaders during his 24-hour visit to the capital, including \u201cthe commitment that the United States and China share to achieve a de-nuclearized North Korea, as well as a special role that China can play in helping to make that goal a reality.\u201d The discussions had been positive, Kerry said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that on every level, in all of our conversations today, China could not have more forcefully reiterated its commitment to that goal, its interests in achieving that goal, and its concerns about the risks of not achieving that goal \u2013 in terms of what it might mean, in terms of stability on the peninsula, as well as the potential for an arms race in the region.\u201d Kerry landed in Beijing on Friday morning after a day of meetings in South Korea, his first stop on an Asian tour. He met China\u2019s president Xi Jinping before entering a series of talks with other officials, including his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. He said that the discussions involved climate change; the international response to Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions; and China\u2019s \u201chuman rights challenges\u201d, including a recent spate of dissident arrests and issues in the ethnically-riven far-western regions Xinjiang and Tibet. Chinese state media has chastised Kerry for highlighting US concerns over China\u2019s increasingly aggressive claims to disputed territory in the east and south China seas. On Friday, he cautiously criticized the country\u2019s unilateral declaration in November of an air defense identification zone (Adiz) over a swath of the east China sea also claimed by Japan. \u201cWe\u2019ve expressed our concern about the need to try to establish a calmer, more rule-of-law based, less confrontational regime\u201d in the disputed areas, Kerry said. \u201cThis includes the question of how an Adiz might or might not come about.\u201d In a stridently anti-Japanese editorial on Friday, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency said the US must pressure Tokyo into ceasing its \u201cprovocative moves\u201d or risk a future regional conflict. \u201cThe United States has to know that, while Beijing has always been trying to address territorial brawls with some neighbouring countries through peaceful means, it will not hesitate to take steps to secure its key national security interests according to China\u2019s sovereign rights,\u201d Xinhua said. In Seoul, on Thursday, Kerry said the White House wanted a fresh emphasis on getting North Korea back to six-nation talks aimed at getting Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons. \u201cThe US will not accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. We will not accept talks for the sake of talks. And the DPRK [Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea] must show that it will negotiate and live up to its commitments regarding denuclearisation.\u201d Efforts toward that end, he said, would rely heavily on Chinese pressure. \u201cChina has a unique and critical role that it can play,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cNo country has a greater potential to influence North Korea\u2019s behavior than China, given their extensive trading relationship with the North.\u201d But China\u2019s leverage with North Korea is being tested. Diplomats say Beijing received no prior warning of the December arrest and execution of Kim Jong-un\u2019s uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who had been considered Pyongyang\u2019s senior official on China affairs and was a strong promoter of free trade zones being set up along their mutual border. That followed Pyongyang\u2019s snubbing of Beijing\u2019s wishes when it conducted a missile test in late 2012, followed by the underground detonation of a nuclear device last spring. Jang\u2019s removal was seen as depriving Beijing of its chief conduit into the North Korean regime and in the weeks that followed the leadership found itself at a loss as to how to proceed. A delegation of Chinese diplomats led by the foreign ministry\u2019s deputy head of Asian affairs visited Pyongyang last week in a sign that Beijing was trying to renew dialogue. Those discussions involving the two Koreas, the US, China, Russia and Japan, broke down at the end of 2008 and US officials say they see no point of restarting talks until Pyongyang shows an authentic desire to make good on its prior commitments to dismantle its nuclear programmes."}, {"sentences": ["The report concludes that the evidence gathered by the three-person commission, which held sometimes emotional public sessions in Seoul, Tokyo, London and Washington, gives &quot;reasonable grounds \u2026 to merit a criminal investigation by a competent national or international organ of justice&quot;."], "tags": ["North Korea", "Human rights", "International criminal court", "World news", "Law"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-14T17:44:09Z", "title": "UN to accuse North Korea of crimes against humanity", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/14/un-accuse-north-korea-crimes-against-humanity", "article": "A major UN investigation into human right abuses in North Korea is set to conclude that the country has committed crimes against humanity and should be referred to the international criminal court in the Hague, according to reported leaks of its findings. The commission of inquiry on human rights in the country, set up in March by the UN&apos;s Human Rights Council, is due to announce its findings in Geneva on Monday. The Associated Press, quoting officials who had seen the commission&apos;s embargoed report, confirmed it found North Korea culpable for offences including crimes against humanity through starvation and extermination, as well as the abduction of people in South Korea and Japan. The report concludes that the evidence gathered by the three-person commission, which held sometimes emotional public sessions in Seoul, Tokyo, London and Washington, gives &quot;reasonable grounds \u2026 to merit a criminal investigation by a competent national or international organ of justice&quot;. One part of the commission&apos;s remit was to decide whether North Korea&apos;s leadership, potentially including the top ruler, Kim Jong-un, should be referred to the ICC. While North Korea is not a signatory to the treaty that created the ICC, the Australian retired judge who heads the commission, Michael Kirby, has noted previously that the UN security council can extend the court&apos;s remit in exceptional cases. However, any such move by the security council is likely to be vetoed by China, which has close links with North Korea and maintains a policy of sending back people found to have fled across the North Korean border into China, despite widespread evidence they face mistreatment and detention on return. Kirby has said the report is likely to hold China to account for this policy. North Korea has refused all requests to participate in the process. Witnesses at the unprecedented public evidence sessions included escapees from North Korea who gave appalling accounts of life in prison camps, including claims one female prisoner was forced to drown her new-born baby and prisoners were put in a cell with a 50cm-high door, forcing them to enter by crawling. In a recent interview with the Guardian, Kirby expressed regret that there was more media coverage of the curiosities of the dynastic Stalinist state&apos;s rulers, such as visits by the retired US basketball player Dennis Rodman, than of rights abuses. &quot;That is a commentary, really, on the international media,&quot; he said. &quot;But it&apos;s also a commentary on the relatively closed nature of North Korea. It is a country which to some extent has been able to sail under the attention of the international community by being closed.&quot; Even before the report was concluded, Kirby said evidence of some rights abuses was clear: &quot;There are objective signs that are really uncontested. For example, in North Korea a third of infants up to their fifth year are severely stunted. That is an objective sign of failure of government to properly attend to the feeding of the population. &quot;If you have a closed society you can&apos;t really blame the general population for not knowing. But our duty is to bridge the gap, to shine a spotlight. That&apos;s what we&apos;re trying to do. One of the most powerful images viewed during the inquiry was that of the Korean peninsula at night. It shows the light in China and South Korea, and a large, dark section, which is North Korea. Well, our job is to shine a light into the dark section. That&apos;s exactly what we&apos;re going to do.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["It was only two years after Ghost World that she got one of her key roles: the lead in Sofia Coppola&apos;s Lost in Translation, a plaintive, semi-romance about two American misfits at a plush Tokyo hotel."], "tags": ["Scarlett Johansson", "Film", "Israel", "World news", "UK news", "Under The Skin"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-16T00:05:00Z", "title": "Scarlett Johansson: a star with politics under her skin | Observer profile", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/feb/16/scarlett-johansson-israel-oxfam-hollywood", "article": "It is usually the case that studios, agents and distributors will co-ordinate release dates to capitalise on a star&apos;s popularity, but it is rare that an A-list actress will be headlining two remarkable new films and an international political controversy all at the same time. That&apos;s not your run-of-the-mill Hollywood career, but then Scarlett Johansson is no common-or-garden star. The nature of her latest movies tells you as much. In Her, which has just opened in the UK, she plays Samantha, a computer operating system that evolves in response to the user&apos;s needs and personality. She is as present as any of her flesh-and-blood co-stars despite appearing in voice only. Her is complimented by Under the Skin, in which she is seen but rarely heard. As an extra-terrestrial who assumes human form to cruise the streets of Glasgow in a Transit van looking for men to devour, she has perhaps 20 or 30 lines in the entire film. She is almost unrecognisable in a brown wig and a ratty fur coat, though on closer inspection the plump, amused lips are a giveaway. Under the Skin, released next month, was made under deeply unorthodox conditions that attest to Johansson&apos;s flexibility and daring. For the scenes in which she is driving around Glasgow, the director, Jonathan Glazer, rigged her vehicle with tiny cameras so that she could be filmed surreptitiously picking up her &quot;prey&quot;\u2013 real people, rather than actors \u2013 who Johansson selected spontaneously as she was driving. The unsuspecting men would be informed by a crew member that they had just been filmed and then asked to sign a release form. Those who needed extra convincing might be told the identity of the mystery driver who had just chatted to them or driven them a few miles down the road. &quot;Good gosh!&quot; would come the reply, or a close equivalent in the Glaswegian vernacular. It&apos;s hard to think of many stars of Johansson&apos;s stature who would throw themselves willingly into such an inherently suspenseful exercise, incorporating that level of risk and that demand for improvisation. In a business where anyone vaguely pleasing to the eye can rise to the top by hitting their marks and smiling on the red carpet, Johansson goes several extra miles, in this instance, while driving on the left in a Transit van. Some people at Oxfam, where she has been a goodwill ambassador from 2005 until last month, might be wishing that her near-silence had extended from the set of Under the Skin and into her public life. When Johansson signed up to be the face of SodaStream, beginning with a half-time commercial at the recent Super Bowl, Oxfam expressed concern over the implicit conflict: the carbonated drinks company has a factory in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank. &quot;Oxfam is a human rights organisation,&quot; observed the boycott campaign founder, Omar Barghouti. &quot;They cannot maintain an ambassador if they are involved in a complicit Israeli company built in a settlement.&quot; Sure enough, Johansson stepped down from Oxfam three weeks after the row began, amid accusations that she had been politically naive. But it was the tenor of her statement that alarmed some commentators. &quot;Scarlett Johansson has respectfully decided to end her ambassador role with Oxfam after eight years,&quot; her spokesperson said. &quot;She and Oxfam have a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. She is very proud of her accomplishments and fundraising efforts during her tenure with Oxfam.&quot; A commentator on the opinions website Mondoweiss described this as Johansson not only extricating herself from a tricky position but &quot;cynically and opportunistically\u2026 throwing Oxfam under the bus&quot; by suggesting that she had been asked implicitly to boycott SodaStream, when, in fact, the charity only wanted her to refrain from promoting the firm. The Mondoweiss writer worried that this leaves Oxfam vulnerable to accusations that it supports a boycott of Israel, when, in fact, it does not express any opinion. If there is an upside to this argument, it must be that it has dragged a contentious political issue into the pop-culture spotlight; refracted through Johansson&apos;s celebrity, it suddenly enters the lives and perspectives of her fans. How it reflects on Johansson is another matter. She has not been slow to exhibit exasperation with the PR treadmill, but getting quizzed at press junkets about, say, your character&apos;s motivation in Iron Man 2 must have looked preferable over the last month to having aspersions cast on your political integrity. As a child, Johansson&apos;s mother took her and her twin brother, Hunter, with her whenever she voted in order to impress upon them the importance of the democratic process. &quot;Both of my parents were extremely liberal,&quot; she has said, &quot;so I think I grew up in a household that was very politically conscious. We all watched the elections on TV and we watched the debates. We just naturally became politically active. It was just understood that it was important, that it was our responsibility. I never tell people whom to vote for. I&apos;m not telling people where to give money, but if there is to be a spotlight shed on me, then I&apos;d like to direct that spotlight on to causes I think are worthy or on to interesting, progressive figures.&quot; Or, for that matter, manufacturers of fizzy drinks. Johansson has had an unimpeachable career so far. That is not to say she has played it safe. Though she has been in her fair share of duds (The Nanny Diaries, Michael Bay&apos;s The Island), it would be a hard-hearted soul who placed the blame for them at her feet. Her three-film collaboration with Woody Allen (beginning with Match Point, in which she was cast after the original choice, Kate Winslet, dropped out) included the regrettable Scoop, which didn&apos;t get a cinema release in the UK, but then it also produced the divine Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Swings and roundabouts. What makes her such an exhilarating performer is her apparent derision for the very celebrity culture in which she is embroiled. That impression is partly an accident of physiognomy and geography \u2013 that slight Elvis sneer in her smile, which signals a pre-emptive sarcasm, coupled with the vocal twang inherited from her Bronx-born mother. But from her earliest performances, there was a sense that Johansson was on to something; she was a step ahead of her peers. As far back as Ghost World, an adaptation of Daniel Clowes&apos;s graphic novel in which she played, at the age of 17, one half of a pair of sardonic outsiders, she exuded an inner knowingness. That has survived into her work today, whether it is her luminous performance in Girl With a Pearl Earring, strange, small-scale productions such as the porn-addict comedy Don Jon or superhero extravaganzas such as Avengers Assemble, in which she played Black Widow, essentially Rita Hayworth with a knack for martial arts. Like Jennifer Lawrence, she combines the lustre of a star with the earthy, unpredictable frisson of a character actor. It was only two years after Ghost World that she got one of her key roles: the lead in Sofia Coppola&apos;s Lost in Translation, a plaintive, semi-romance about two American misfits at a plush Tokyo hotel. Johansson was the young woman left to her own melancholia while her photographer boyfriend darted off on assignments, while Bill Murray was the ageing actor with whom she makes an unexpected connection. The film had its share of easy reassurances, but Johansson was a revelation. Much of the movie hinged on close-ups of her pensive, enigmatic beauty, her ability to convey deep reserves of intelligence and sadness. Though woe betide anyone who took her in real life to be the ethereal creature she is in the movie. Journalists who presumed to ask what Bill Murray&apos;s character whispers in her ear at the end of the film could bank on an acidic dismissal: &quot;Oh, you think you&apos;re the first one to ask?&quot; she replied to one reporter. Until the fall-out over SodaStream, her only roundly negative experiences with the media had been the result of prurient journalism \u2013 it wasn&apos;t her fault that the US press was fascinated by her divorce after three years of marriage to the actor Ryan Reynolds, or that her computer was hacked and nude photographs of her distributed online. If the SodaStream affair has taken a little of the fizz out of her persona, that shouldn&apos;t diminish the artistic choices she has made. Hollywood stars are always pimping themselves out to brands and companies: that was one of the running gags of Lost in Translation. What makes Johansson different from most celebrities who shill for the highest bidder is that it doesn&apos;t quite square with the coolness she has cultivated so far. She should be pleased about that. She might even take the furore as a bitter kind of compliment."}, {"sentences": ["His plans show Willis is thinking very big: Hunter will open its first store in London in July, with plans for others in New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai."], "tags": ["Stella McCartney", "London fashion week autumn/winter 2014", "London fashion week", "Fashion"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-16T00:06:00Z", "title": "The boot's on the other foot as Stella McCartney's husband takes to the catwalk", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/feb/15/stella-mccartney-husband-hunter-boots-london-fashion-week", "article": "When it comes to fashion shows, Alasdhair Willis&apos;s usual role is to provide a supportive presence on the front row for his wife, Stella McCartney. On Saturday, however, roles were reversed as the British wellington boot company Hunter showed its first runway collection at London fashion week. The show raised the curtain for a new era under creative director Willis, the former publishing director of design magazine Wallpaper. Although wellington boots were in the news for all the wrong reasons last week, Willis was at pains to avoid making links with the terrible weather. &quot;We would never want to profit from that, in any way,&quot; he said before the show. As McCartney looked on, models showed off vinyl capes, waxed jackets and dresses and mackintoshes in weatherproof materials. Colours ranged from primary brights to classic khaki, deep purples and metallics. Willis said the collection was inspired by extremes of exploration \u2013 by deep-sea diving and outer space, and by the pioneering spirit of the era in which Hunter was first established, as the North British Rubber Company, in 1856. The designs also took cues from the component parts of the wellington boots themselves, with details such as the &quot;moustache&quot; on the toe of the boot being echoed on shoulders and pockets of jackets. The most spectacular moment of the show came just before the finale, when magician Dynamo made a surprise appearance on the catwalk. First, he performed his Matrix move, leaning back on one leg until parallel with the floor. Next, eight of the models on stage were magically &quot;disappeared&quot; before being summoned back for one last walk, during which playing cards showered down on models and guests. Willis said that the Instagram-friendly spectacle was symbolic of his ambitions for Hunter: &quot;We are drawing on our heritage, but we are pioneering and forward-looking. The British heritage brands that are successful globally are not just stamping a union flag on clothing and trying to sell it to China \u2013 they are moving forward.&quot; Dynamo was a canny match in marketing terms, too: &quot;He is the most-followed magician in the world,&quot; said Willis, &quot;with a reach of six million on his social platforms.&quot; Though Hunter has been firmly on the fashion radar since Kate Moss wore a pair to Glastonbury in 2005 \u2013 a moment that many have identified as the starting point for the now omnipresent &quot;festival chic&quot; trend \u2013 it was only in 2012, when US private equity firm Searchlight bought a stake in the business, that taking the company global and diversifying beyond boots became a possibility. Searchlight hired Willis to lead this charge, and Willis restructured the company into two divisions: Hunter Original, the &quot;twentysomething, cooler, fashion-conscious&quot; line, with prices starting at \u00a385 for boots and \u00a3380 for rubber jackets, which were being shown on Saturday , and Hunter Field, a tech- and performance-focused line which will launch in spring/summer 2015. His plans show Willis is thinking very big: Hunter will open its first store in London in July, with plans for others in New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai.     The high heeled Hunter  Photograph: Ben A. Pruchnie/Getty Images    Overseeing a catwalk show is a huge challenge, as Willis&apos;s wife knows only too well. McCartney&apos;s best advice? &quot;Trust your instinct,&quot; said Wills, and also: &quot;Keep calm, don&apos;t get stressed \u2013 although I know what it&apos;s like, seeing it on the other side for 13 years. When you&apos;re at the centre of it the lead-up to the show is very difficult.&quot; The woman who made Hunter a household has not been forgotten, either \u2013 the collection includes a heeled wellington boot inspired by a certain Ms Moss. &quot;Kate told me that she would love to wear a heel to Glastonbury \u2013 especially this year, when it was so dry,&quot; said Willis: &quot;and this is the perfect wellington heel.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters    Few outside Chile know the high quality of Santiago&apos;s transport, but everyone knows the high quality of Tokyo&apos;s.

English friends had explained to me, not without pride, the importance of grumbling to the national character, but I still want to stress to every Londoner I meet that \u2014 take it from a visiting Los Angeleno \u2014 the tube exists, and that counts as no trifling achievement. Beyond that, and like every other means of urban transport system around the world, it tells you nearly everything you need to know about the city it serves. If you wish to understand London or any place else, look no further than how people move through it. This goes not just for subways, but overground trains, buses, cycleways, rickshaws, and every mobility solution in between. You can learn a great deal from robust transport systems, and even more from underdeveloped ones. This line of thinking never occurred to me in my years growing up just outside Seattle, a city which I frequented but never gave much thought. Seattle&apos;s &quot;retro-futuristic&quot; image has, for the past half century, rested in large part on a pair of structures built for its 1962 World&apos;s Fair: the globally recognisable Space Needle, and the lesser-known but still sadly evocative monorail. While neither offer much of everyday value to the locals, the monorail \u2013 which takes the form but, in running back and forth on only a mile of track, not the function of a dedicated public transit system \u2013 stands as a reminder of the city&apos;s many frustrated attempts at complete urbanisation. Proposals for a useful monorail network have risen and fallen over the years; the first light rail line there opened only in 2009. The surprisingly backward state of Seattle transport tells a story familiar to many American cities: an aesthetically bold, forward-looking optimism in the years after the second world war, followed by decades of bitter struggle with its own demanding suburbs, home in this case to the mighty or once-mighty likes of Boeing and Microsoft. Amazon&apos;s recent relocation of its offices to downtown Seattle bodes well for the life of the city proper, but it still has no end of catching up to do with the metropolises of Europe, Asia and Latin America, where high densities of transit not only exist, but make statements about the cities that built them. Often the style of a city&apos;s transport reflects how that city sees itself, or would like to. The still-gleaming Santiago metro opened in 1975 as a declaration of Chile&apos;s emergence, real or desired, from provincial isolation. With improvements that have turned it over the past 25 years into South America&apos;s most extensive subway, it also announces the country&apos;s escape from dictatorship. &quot;Make sure you ride the metro,&quot; Santiaguinos abroad would insist to me upon hearing of my plans to visit their city.     Despite the grumbles from its passengers, the tube functions as London's main arteries. Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters    Few outside Chile know the high quality of Santiago&apos;s transport, but everyone knows the high quality of Tokyo&apos;s. Before making my first trip to Japan, I prepared myself for astonishment at the functionality of its trains. I also prepared myself for the white-gloved hands of the oshiya, or &quot;pushers&quot; \u2013 station workers employed to cram as many rush-hour commuters as possible behind a subway car&apos;s closing doors. In the event, though I never felt the touch of the oshiya, I was impressed not just at the perfectly punctual, all-reaching trains, but the way riders regard them not as objects of great municipal and national pride, but as expected necessities. Japanese major cities, more than any others of my acquaintance, run on expectations \u2013 a constant stream of them, routinely fulfilled to the slightest detail. If the schedule says the bus will show up at 8:31, a Kyoto-based English friend told me, people start looking at their watches at 8:32. Even in Osaka, Japan&apos;s comparatively Falstaffian second city, reputedly characterised by rustic straightforwardness and saturated with vulgar capitalist energy, the trains (on which I never saw anyone drink, eat, or speak into a mobile phone) adhere to a standard of regularity no less rigorous than Tokyo&apos;s. Korea, with less time to develop than Japan and more development to do, has given rise in Seoul to a city that appears to have only just been torn out of its packaging. None of its 50 tallest towers have stood for even 30 years, and most of the Seoul metropolitan subway that takes you between them entered service more recently than that. The longest (and busiest, and most station-equipped) such system in the world has developed into not just a means of getting efficiently from Apgujeong to Bokjeong, but a showcase of the spirit that turned a city in shambles in the 1960s into a vision even the most space age-minded American of that era wouldn&apos;t have entertained. But for everyone who sees the future in Seoul or Tokyo, many more see it, with hope or regret, in Shanghai. The astonishing speed with which infrastructure has sprouted in the Chinese city inspires contradictory feelings in those of us based in slower-growing cities: envy that our governments can&apos;t build whole rapid transit systems in a matter of years, tempered by relief that they lack the authority necessary to do so. Ride a train in a Chinese metropolis and, by all accounts, you experience the idea of cities as massive logistical problems; object lessons that even the ambition and resources that China commands can&apos;t alone solve them. Los Angeles attained its vast size and bizarre shape due to the growth of its first, early 20th-century, pre-population-boom rail system, the formidable &quot;red cars&quot; and &quot;yellow cars&quot; of the Pacific Electric and Los Angeles Railroads. But the sweeping eight-lane freeways that replaced them after the war still monumentalise the freedom of speed and impulsive mobility \u2013 at least when you drive on them in the middle of the night.     A jeepney in Manila: US military 4x4s left over from world war II have been converted, often flamboyantly, into the most popular form of transport in the city. Photograph: Thom Lang/Corbis    One of its components actually began in 1900 as a six-mile bicycle highway, an innovation that sounds more suited to modern Copenhagen than to LA in any era. Because the Danish capital has spent the past half-century encouraging cycling as a primary means of transport, you&apos;ll learn far less about the city on its limited, expensive subway than you will on its wide, traffic-separated bicycle lanes, observing the cross-section of the population that pedals all around you. Of all Copenhagen&apos;s sights, none blows American minds more than that of one of the city&apos;s many girls in skirt and spike heels, cigarette in one hand, mobile phone in the other \u2014 sitting on, of all things, a bicycle. As it has elevated &quot;hygge&quot; (cosiness) into a way of life, Copenhagen has elevated the humble bicycle into a cultural icon, a pillar of its image. London has done the same with black taxis and doubledecker buses \u2013 not to mention &quot;mind the gap&quot; as a take-away phrase for tourists, expats and students. But while New York&apos;s cabs exude a trademark rough-edged urbanity, American cities don&apos;t usually represent themselves with elements of transit \u2013 apart, that is, from the classic yellow school bus. Regular American city buses are typically maligned, due to the supposed poverty of their riders. This gearing of public transport toward the socioeconomic margins, especially margins seen as isolated from or in conflict with the majority, impedes popularity and thus implementation; dedicating a bus lane in Los Angeles has proven a task comparable to the labours of Hercules. The bicycle in America has only just begun to escape similar associations. Most designations of bike-friendliness have gone not to proper cities but college towns: Davis, Boulder, Long Beach, Iowa City \u2013 places that, while pleasant enough, command little national, let alone international import. Modest Portland, Oregon, the US city in which I most enjoy cycling, feels like a Tokyo or Seoul by comparison. Yet despite its reputation as a paradise for alternative transport, I always notice suspiciously few normally clothed riders on the road there with me. Ride a bike in any of America&apos;s supposedly top cities to do so, and you come to know the still-strong American genius for branding, as opposed to the faltering American genius for execution. When Los Angeles laid down its first high-profile cycle lane, the rain washed it mostly away within months. Even as a city&apos;s forms of transport empower us, they limit us, reducing us to a narrow set of obsessions: New Yorkers&apos; compulsive but futile questions about when the train will come; Angelenos&apos; sad, Sisyphean quest for free parking; Copenhageners&apos; budgeting for their next bicycle when their current one inevitably gets stolen; Londoners&apos; ceaseless insistence that the whole of their infrastructure lies more or less in ruins. Yet they can also make manifest the human ingenuity that makes such improbable accretions as cities work in the first place. A Filipino friend once described Manila to me as a transport enthusiast&apos;s paradise, albeit one made up of many thousands of small, barely-maintained units. Anyone who boards a &quot;jeepney&quot; (a US Army jeep, flamboyantly converted for public transportation) there gains insight into the culture of repurposing and improvisation that keeps the city chugging along, whichever natural, political, or infrastructural disasters may come. You get the same sense from a ride on one of Mexico City&apos;s green &quot;pesero&quot; microbuses \u2013 icons, too, in their way \u2013 which pick up and drop off passengers where required, rather than on a set route.     A rare quiet moment on LA's freeway system. Photograph: Eye Ubiquitous/Rex    Certain developing cities have drawn the eyes of the rest of the urban world with their transport alone: Curitiba in Brazil, made its name by pioneering bus-based rapid transit, a form of which, over in the Colombian capital, Bogot\u00e1, has also made a hearty go. Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, Bogot\u00e1&apos;s former mayor, has proven eminently quotable on the matter of transport as a reflection of metropolitan character and building the means of transport as a way of defining that character. &quot;An advanced city,&quot; he has proclaimed, &quot;is not a place where the poor move about in cars; rather, it&apos;s where even the rich use public transportation.&quot; This goes a fair way to explaining the seething frustrations of many American cities, composed in large part of poor people in cars, made ever poorer by their associated costs. Pe\u00f1alosa has also spoken of our &quot;need to walk, just as birds need to fly&quot;, suggesting a city&apos;s need for &quot;pedestrian infrastructure shows respect for human dignity&quot;. And indeed, you can learn as much about a city from observing how people walk in it as how they ride, cycle, and drive. I did so in London, whose citizens cross the street any time they please, regardless of what the traffic signal says. Me and my Los Angeles compatriots remain, alas, too cowed by the pricey threat of jaywalking tickets, the monstrously aggressive (and in my experience mythical) spectre of the &quot;LA driver&quot;, and the sheer width of the roads to do the same. We can learn from London, I told myself, and the thought cheered me. It had to, as I&apos;d wound up stranded by the tube strike, an illuminating transport phenomenon which had me revising my opinions about the city all over again. We can learn from London, yes, but let&apos;s not learn everything from it."}, {"sentences": ["One woman giving evidence anonymously to the hearing in Tokyo recounted being encouraged to train for a public mass gymnastics display through the heroic example of a young boy who died after practising through the pain of an acute appendicitis and was viewed as a hero."], "tags": ["United Nations", "World news", "Law", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "Human rights"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-17T15:44:00Z", "title": "North Korea: 'You are brainwashed from the time you know how to talk'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/north-korea-human-rights-abuses-stories-un-brainwashed", "article": "Among the desperate and appalling chronicle of horrors presented across 372 pages in the full UN report into rights abuses in North Korea, the chilling testimony of a young woman called Jee Heon, sent to a prison camp after being returned from China, stands out. Giving evidence to the commission&apos;s first public evidence session, in Seoul last August, Jee explained the camp guards&apos; policy towards women who returned to North Korea pregnant. The country&apos;s strict rules over perceived racial purity meant most of these women endured forced abortions, lest their babies have Chinese fathers. One woman, however, successfully gave birth, Jee said. &quot;The baby was crying as it was born; we were so curious, this was the first time we saw a baby being born. So we were watching this baby and we were so happy. But suddenly we heard the footsteps,&quot; she said. The footsteps belonged to a guard, who ordered the mother to drown her baby. Jee continued: &quot;The mother was begging, &apos;I was told that I would not be able to have the baby, but I actually got lucky and got pregnant, so let me keep the baby, please forgive me&apos;, but this agent kept beating this woman, the mother who just gave birth. And the baby, since it was just born, it was just crying. And the mother, with her shaking hands she picked up the baby and she put the baby face down in the water. The baby stopped crying and we saw this water bubble coming out of the mouth of the baby. And there was an old lady who helped with the labour, she picked up the baby from the bowl of water and left the room quietly.&quot; The evidence forms part of a particularly shocking section of the report on the experiences of North Koreans who escape to China and are sent back, often with the assistance of Chinese authorities. The report describes forced, late-term abortions without anaesthetic \u2013 sometimes using rusty instruments, the use of chemicals to induce labour, beatings, forced labour and poor nutrition. The inquiry heard equally desperate personal testimony from Shin Dong-hyuk, perhaps the most famous escapee from North Korea \u2013 the only prisoner ever known to have successfully escaped from a so-called &apos;total control camp&apos; for political prisoners. Shin \u2013 who was born in Camp 14 in 1981 through a union engineered by guards between his unwilling parents \u2013 described his childhood there, including how a girl aged about seven was beaten to death after she was found to have slipped a few spilled grains from the guards&apos; food rations into a pocket. Mice were rife in the camp but could only be caught and eaten on the rare occasions guards agreed, he said.     North Korean refugee and human rights activist Shin Dong-hyuk speaks during a rally outside the White House in 2012. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images    Shin also described what happened when he accidentally dropped a sewing machine at the factory where he was forced to work. &quot;The guard told the floor manager to cut off my finger, so I got on my knees and I begged not to do so but that didn&apos;t work obviously. And, I thought my whole hand was going to cut off, but it was just a finger. So, at that time I was grateful, really grateful to the guard because I was only losing a finger instead of a hand,&quot; Shin said. A number of the most disturbing stories in the report centre on North Koreans&apos; experiences during the great famines of the 1990s, a natural disaster that the UN inquiry concludes was nonetheless exacerbated by state policies to divert food to citizens considered more valuable. At the hearing in Washington one woman, Jo Jin-hye, described carrying around her severely malnourished infant brother, who could not be breast-fed as their mother did not have enough food to lactate. &quot;Because there was no food, he was not able to stop crying,&quot; she told the panel. &quot;My baby brother died in my arms because he was not able to eat. And because I was holding him so much, he thought I was his mom. So when I was feeding him water, he was sometimes looking at me smiling at me.&quot; Another survivor of the famine, Kim Hyuk, became a street child \u2013 known in North Korea as kotjebi, or &apos;flowering swallows&apos;. He was seven when his mother died and described being placed briefly in an orphanage, but leaving after 24 out of the 75 children starved to death. A nurse told the commission she saw many street children crushed to death after trying to sleep in coal stores for warmth. Around the same time, the commission heard, the North Korean state spent almost \u00a3500m on monuments to the founder of the state, Kim Il-sung, when he died in 1994. The report also noted that even with stunting among children rife, North Korea spent nearly \u00a3400m on luxury goods for top officials in 2012 alone. Perhaps the most illustrative personal testimonies in conveying the all-pervasive reach of the state come in the section on propaganda and official control over personal lives and thoughts. Among the evidence was of children&apos;s lives at school, where they were encouraged to draw only pictures of Kim Il-sung or images &quot;which might have pleased Kim Il-sung&quot;. One woman giving evidence anonymously to the hearing in Tokyo recounted being encouraged to train for a public mass gymnastics display through the heroic example of a young boy who died after practising through the pain of an acute appendicitis and was viewed as a hero. The report describes the central role of the portraits of Kim Il-sung and his late son and successor, Kim Jong-il, which must be displayed in every North Korean home. One witness said his father had been sent to a political prison camp after mopping up a spilled drink with a newspaper containing an image of the elder Kim.

The UN&apos;s commission on human rights in North Korea, which gathered evidence for almost a year, including often harrowing testimony at public hearings worldwide, said there was compelling evidence of torture, execution and arbitrary imprisonment, deliberate starvation and an almost complete lack of free thought and belief. The chair of the three-strong panel set up by the UN commissioner on human rights has personally written to North Korea&apos;s leader, Kim Jong-un, to warn that he could face trial at the international criminal court (ICC) for his personal culpability as head of state and leader of the military. &quot;The commission wishes to draw your attention that it will therefore recommend that the United Nations refer the situation in the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea [the formal name for North Korea] to the international criminal court to render accountable all those, including possibly yourself, who may be responsible for the crimes against humanity,&quot; Michael Kirby, an Australian retired judge, wrote to Kim. At a press conference to launch the report, Kirby said there were &quot;many parallels&quot; between the evidence he had heard and crimes committed by the Nazis and their allies in the second world war. He noted the evidence of one prison camp inmate who said his duties involved burning the bodies of those who had starved to death and using the remains as fertiliser.      &quot;When you see that image in your mind of bodies being burned it does bring back memories of the end of world war two, and the horror and the shame and the shock,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;I never thought that in my lifetime it would be part of my duty to bring revelations of a similar kind.&quot; Holding up a copy of the report, Kirby said other nations could not say of North Korea, as happened with the Nazis, that they did not know the extent of the crimes: &quot;Now the international community does know. There will be no excusing a failure of action because we didn&apos;t know. It&apos;s too long now. The suffering and the tears of the people of North Korea demand action.&quot; Asked how many North Korean leaders and officials could ultimately be held responsible, Kirby said it could reach the hundreds. The inquiry heard public evidence in Seoul, Tokyo, London and Washington. Among more than 80 witnesses, along with 240 people who gave confidential interviews to avoid reprisals against relatives in North Korea, were escapers from the country&apos;s feared prison camps, including one who reported seeing a female prisoner forced to drown her newborn baby because it was presumed to have a Chinese father. The near-400-page main report concludes there is overwhelming evidence that crimes against humanity have been, and are still being, committed within the hermetic nation. It says: &quot;These are not mere excesses of the state: they are essential components of a political system that has moved far from the ideals on which it claims to be founded. The gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world.&quot; North Korea refused to participate in the investigation or allow the commission to visit, and immediately rejected the findings, calling them &quot;a product of politicisation of human rights on the part of EU and Japan in alliance with the US hostile policy&quot;. The report recommends that the UN refer the situation in North Korea to the ICC. While North Korea is not a signatory to the treaty that created the ICC, the UN security council can extend the court&apos;s remit in exceptional cases. In practice this would probably be vetoed by China, which has close links with North Korea and maintains a policy of sending back people found to have fled across the border, despite widespread evidence that they face mistreatment and detention on their return. The commission&apos;s report heavily criticises China for this, saying the policy appears to breach international laws on refugees. The report concludes that many of the crimes against humanity stem directly from state policies in a country which, since it was formed from the division of Korea, has been run on a highly individual variant of Stalinist-based self-reliance and centralised dynastic rule. The inquiry found &quot;an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion&quot;, with citizens brought into an all-encompassing system of indoctrination from childhood. Perhaps the most chilling section describes the vast network of secret prison camps, known as kwanliso, where hundreds of thousands of North Koreans are believed to have died through starvation, execution or other means. It is estimated that between 80,000 and 120,000 political prisoners are still held, in many cases secretly.

Analysis courtesy of the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea Copyright: Digital Globe    The report says: &quot;Their families are not informed of their fate or whereabouts. Persons accused of political crimes therefore become victims of enforced disappearance. Making the suspect disappear is a deliberate feature of the system that serves to instil fear in the population.&quot; Other particularly disturbing parts of the report detail the experiences of women who are interned on their forced return from China when it is believed they could be pregnant from a Chinese man, something which contravenes North Korea notions of racial purity. Aside from the drowning of the newborn baby the panel heard testimony of forced abortions, sometimes using chemicals or beatings, or surgical procedures without anaesthetic. Other sections of the report cover abuses such as the lack of food. While natural disasters were in part to blame for a famine that killed huge numbers in the 1990s, the report notes that the North Korean state has &quot;used food as a means of control over the population&quot;. It adds: &quot;It has prioritised those whom the authorities believe to be crucial in maintaining the regime over those deemed expendable.&quot; The commission also condemns the almost complete lack of freedom of movement for North Koreans both within their country and abroad, the discrimination of the so-called songbun system, where the state politically classifies people based on their birth and family, and the large-scale abduction of people from other countries, mainly Japan and South Korea. The report says the abuses clearly meet the threshold needed for proof of crimes against humanity in international law. t adds: &quot;The perpetrators enjoy impunity. The Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea is unwilling to implement its international obligation to prosecute and bring the perpetrators to justice, because those perpetrators act in accordance with state policy.&quot;            Asked whether he believed the report would change anything immediately in North Korea, Kirby recalled a UN mission he led in the early 1990s to report on human rights abuses in Cambodia, some years before that country&apos;s eventual UN-led tribunal on Khmer Rouge crimes. He said: &quot;Bearing witness, collecting the stories, recording them and putting them there for future use can sometimes bear fruit a little later.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["P20Bitcoin price collapses on Tokyo exchange."], "tags": ["Media"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-18T08:45:59Z", "title": "Today's media stories from the papers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/18/media-briefing-tuesday-18-february", "article": "Top eight stories on MediaGuardian     Peter Horrocks said the 'drumbeat of editorial cuts' at the World Service has stopped.

For years now, researchers in the field of urban transport have looked at biomimicry as a tool for establishing the most efficient routes around congested cities, typically by road or rail. The use of naturally occurring living organisms to solve spatial design problems has, in this area, variously been explored by mimicking the foraging process of ants or the growth of crystal structures. But it is a particular form of slime mould, Physarum polycephalum (the &quot;many-headed slime&quot;), that has shown particular promise, having been applied to cities around the world and now offering the potential for mimicking regularly occurring events, such as rush hours. P polycephalum is a plasmodial, single-celled organism which grows outward from a single point, searching for food sources. Once these have been located, the many branches it has sent out die back, leaving only the most efficient route between food source nodes. By arranging pieces of oatmeal on a Petri dish to represent railway stations, researchers at the University of Hokkaido in Japan successfully grew a slime mould model of the Tokyo rail system in 2010. Since then, slime has mapped the optimum transport networks of numerous cities, as well as the Silk Road and a full global trade route.            In a comparison of 14 countries&apos; motorway networks, a global team of researchers led by Professor Andrew Adamatzky \u2013 director of the unconventional computing centre at the University of the West of England \u2013 used oat flakes and slime to establish that cities in Belgium, Canada and China had existing transport networks most similar to the slime model, and thus were most efficient, while networks in the US and Africa were indicated to be the least efficient. Closer to home, when Adamatzky&apos;s team mapped the UK motorway network, the M4 motorway between Bristol and London very rarely occurred, with the plasmodium instead routing traffic through the West Midlands. Furthermore, according to the slime mould&apos;s point of view, the M6/M74 should be rerouted through Newcastle, linking London to Glasgow along the east rather than the west coast.     The M6 running past Carlisle. According to the slime mould the motorway should be rerouted along the east coast through Newcastle.  Photograph: Peter Noyce LC/Alamy    Mapping by slime mould has a number of benefits, not least its relative ease and speed. Slime mould grows at 1cm an hour in optimum conditions, and will successfully map most problems in a few days. The established network is still a living &quot;supercell&quot; (effectively a single cell with multiple nuclei), and as a result, can also become a dynamic modelling tool. For example, problems in the system such as a road crash or flooding can be simulated by simply adding salt at the relevant point on the map. Salt is toxic to the plasmodium and the organism will retract from it, strengthening other lines and opening new routes across the network, which can thus provide information for traffic planning contingencies. Up to now, research has not included types of terrain such as rivers or mountains, nor any understanding of social and political factors. It will only map the most efficient route to all points. But current research suggests the slime mould leaves chemical markers on unsuccessful routes as a reminder. This could be used in the future to indicate terrain features missing from current models. This developing form of biomimicry demonstrates some of the possibilities of using unconventional computing in urban planning, and as slime mould techniques are increasingly employed so does our understanding of what this complex organism can teach us. Most intriguing of all is the potential for the mould to &quot;expect&quot; changes in its environment. Back in 2008, researchers at Hokkaido University repeatedly subjected successfully growing slime moulds to low temperatures and dry air every 30 minutes. Not the best conditions to grow slime in; so as expected, growth rates slowed. When the researchers then stopped applying poor growth conditions, however, half of the slime moulds tested still slowed their growth rate 30 minutes later, in expectation of the stimulus. Such behaviour could potentially be used to get transport network models to adapt to regularly occurring events, such as rush hours, or as a planning tool for project management. For the moment, though, the mechanisms behind this aspect of the slime mould&apos;s behaviour remain poorly understood."}, {"sentences": ["The next tournaments in the HSBC World Sevens Series are in Tokyo and Hong Kong at the end of March."], "tags": ["USA rugby union team", "Glasgow Rugby", "Rugby union", "US sports", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-18T17:37:11Z", "title": "USA sevens sensation Carlin Isles 'signs short-term deal with Glasgow Warriors'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/18/usa-sevens-carlin-isles-signs-glasgow-warriors", "article": "Carlin Isles, the former sprinter and college footballer who has become known as the fastest rugby player in the world, has reportedly joined the Glasgow Warriors.  On Tuesday, under the headline \u201cCarlin Isles SIGNS for Glasgow\u201d, Britain\u2019s The Rugby Paper said: \u201cIn an attempt to represent the USA Eagles at the World Cup in England next year, the fastest man in rugby will link up with the Scottish side next week once his visa is cleared.\u201d However, on Tuesday afternoon Nigel Melville, the chief executive of USA Rugby, said the deal had not been completed. \u201cObviously Carlin would like to play overseas,\u201d said Melville, \u201cbut I think there\u2019s a lot more details to be confirmed before he accepts [a deal].\u201d Isles, a USA sevens representative who only took up the game in 2012, has never played top-level 15-a-side rugby. Despite this, after his rise to fame through a YouTube video which has attracted more than 5 million views, \u201cCarlin Isles\u2019 Olympic Dream\u201d, he was linked in the press with Leinster and Toulon. The Rugby Paper quoted Isles\u2019 UK agent, Tom Beattie, as saying: \u201cCarlin wants to play in the World Cup next year and Glasgow is the best environment for him to achieve his dream. \u201cHe\u2019s very much looking forward to work with [former Scotland full-back turned SRU coach] Chris Paterson as well as playing alongside [Scotland and Lions back] Stuart Hogg, who he watches a lot. He\u2019s very thankful to the USA federation for allowing him to pursue his dream.\u201d The Rugby Paper reported that Isles\u2019 deal in Scotland would last until the end of the season. Earlier this month, Glasgow signed the USA sevens and 15s international Folau Niua on a short-term contract. In December, Isles signed as a wide receiver with the practice squad of the National Football League\u2019s Detroit Lions. He has continued to play for the USA sevens team since then, scoring tries at the USA Sevens in Las Vegas and the New Zealand Sevens in Wellington. The Rugby Paper said negotiations about how Isles can combine his Glasgow contract with further sevens appearances were ongoing. The next tournaments in the HSBC World Sevens Series are in Tokyo and Hong Kong at the end of March.         Carlin Isles scores a try against Argentina in Las Vegas.    Should Isles join Glasgow, he will also join a growing number of American rugby players who are based in Europe.

How will we meet the cost of social care? What can we do to prevent isolation and loneliness? How can we promote the positive contribution that older people make to society? Many developed nations are facing the same challenges. &quot;We&apos;re all wrestling with the problems of social isolation and loneliness in one way or another,&quot; said Mervyn Kohler, external affairs advisor to Age UK. He added: &quot;You can&apos;t assume that we can pick up a model from one country and transplant it over here, but ... there are many more imaginative ways to address the growing problem.&quot; Here are five projects making an impact in managing an ageing population. Germany Alongside regular taxes, German citizens pay into a social insurance scheme which pays for the cost of care that may be needed in later life or if long term illness or disability hits. When citizens make a claim they have a choice: either they can take a lump sum or they can ask for &quot;payment in kind&quot;, which means the cost of the services they need will be covered by the state. &quot;The cash payment is of much lower value than if you&apos;d opted for the services in kind, but it&apos;s very popular,&quot; said Caroline Glendinning, professor of social policy at the University of York. &quot;It&apos;s used to support family care giving.&quot; The scheme is financially stable because, culturally, care is often provided informally by family members, and so the strain of paying for large amounts of care does not fall to the state. Opting for the single payment also means the carer has some claim to the money. The scheme pays into the pension of the carer, offers four weeks respite care and provides access to training. &quot;The German social insurance idea is a good one in terms of trying to ensure that the entire population actually has an income which is respectable and adequate enough to open up the possibility of social inclusion rather than just mere survival,&quot; said Kohler. Netherlands In the Netherlands, a visiting scheme for older people has been established to prevent isolation. Volunteers are recruited en masse. They provide older people with information about services, ask about their emotional wellbeing and establish if they are lonely. If the volunteers cannot solve a problem themselves they turn to professionals. The aim of the scheme is that every older person in the country is visited at least once a year, but the performance of local governments varies depending on their financial situation. France French authorities have developed an inter-generational leisure scheme which helps pensioners to spend their holidays with family, even if they are frail. Funds from the French state pension are diverted to fund the construction of large holiday complexes suitable for all the family, from small children to the very old - with most located in already popular holiday destinations along the southern and northern coastlines. &quot;It&apos;s an excellent example of lived inter-generational solidarity: you can actually go on holidays as a family, including grandparents, if some basic healthcare and social care infrastructure is provided,&quot; observed Andreas Hoff, a research fellow at the Oxford Institute of Ageing. He added: &quot;Isn&apos;t that much better than asking for respite care? Middle-aged caregivers get respite without the feelings of guilt for leaving behind their parents in institutional care.&quot; The holiday parks have easy access for disabled people and sheltered accommodation with specialist medical and care facilities. Holidaymakers do pay for their stay, but some families can apply for assistance. Japan Adachi, a heavily populated ward in the north of Tokyo, has launched a &quot;zero isolation&quot; project aimed at reaching out to its ageing community. Data is analysed on all people over the age of 70. Older people who talk with someone outside their household less than once a week, or has nobody to turn to for help are defined as isolated. For those who meet the criteria, visitors help to break the cycle of isolation and encourage participation in events such as karaoke, exercise groups and shared dinners. There are events aimed at bringing isolated people out of their homes and into the community at least twice a month. &quot;Adachi&apos;s initiative around zero isolation was a specific response to the community&apos;s despair that a deceased older man could lay undiscovered in his home for as long as 30 years,&quot; said Andrew Stevens, chief researcher at the Japan Local Government Centre. He added: &quot;The scheme was aimed at using existing resources and structures more effectively to promote vigilance on the part of a busy population living in a Tokyo commuter suburb, towards their older neighbours.&quot; The scheme is already being rolled out to single parents. Cyprus Cyprus has established a parliament for older people made up of representatives from charities and groups. It meets once a year, together with the Cypriot president, the minister of health and the minister of labour and social insurances. Ministers are bound by law to implement some of their decisions. The parliament even delayed a recent banking vote, to protect the interests of savers. Ireland has a similar scheme, the Irish senior citizens&apos; parliament, which is run by volunteers and has had huge success in rallying older people to put pressure on government."}, {"sentences": ["Birds of Tokyo: Lanterns, 2013         Source: YouTube    They might have started as a side project for Karnivool\u2019s Ian Kenny, but the Birds have now become one of the biggest bands in the nation."], "tags": ["Perth festival 2014", "Music", "INXS", "Pendulum", "Tame Impala"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-20T06:25:04Z", "title": "From Pendulum to Tame Impala: Perth in 10 songs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/20/pendulum-tame-impala-triffids-perth-festival", "article": "Despite, or perhaps because of, its size and isolation, Perth has long been the birthplace for great Australian music.

We must try to live!&quot;)\u00a0and is inspired by the life of aeronautical engineer Jiro Horikoshi who designed Mitsubishi&apos;s A6M Zero fighter. It&apos;s probably the gentlest animated feature about an armaments designer you&apos;ll ever see.  &quot;Poor countries want airplanes,&quot; Jiro (Hideaki Anno) is told, as they watch oxen haul the latest prototype out onto the field for testing. Lacking the power of western engines, Jiro and his fellow engineers must instead work with everything at his disposal \u2013\u00a0flush rivets, split flaps, retractable undercarriages, the lightest aluminium alloy \u2013 to reduce the drag on that aircraft and pluck it into the vast, blue yonder.  In that face-off between western power and eastern ingenuity you have both a portrait of pre-war Japan, its economy in the tank, desperate to pull itself into the 20th century, and a clue to what gives Miyazaki&apos;s film its lyrical lift. In many respects, the animation traditions of America and Japan follow the course of their aeronautics industries.  Whether it be Mickey losing control of his magic in The Sorcerer&apos;s Apprentice, young Dash learning to temper his speed in The Incredibles (&quot;I&apos;ll only be the best by a tiny bit&quot;), to the young sorceress of this year&apos;s Disney hit Frozen, relishing the icy thrill of female empowerment, America&apos;s animated features are, to a large extent, soft power tutorials \u2013\u00a0parables of the risk and responsibilities of great power. They put kids in the cockpit and teach them how to take their country for a spin.  Mizyaki&apos;s hero is instead marked by a more modest, even self-effacing gallantry. Too short-sighted to be a pilot, Jiro peers at the world through thick Harold Lloyd spectacles, watching planes carve great arcs against slowly moving cloudbanks. In his dreams, he talks a walk on their wings alongside his hero, Italian aviator Giovanni Caproni (Mansai Nomura), who tells him &quot;Airplanes are not for war or making money. Airplanes are beautiful dreams waiting to be swallowed by the sky.&quot;  Miyazaki&apos;s fascination with flight goes all the way back to 1984&apos;s Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, whose heroine negotiates the post-apocalyptic jungle by glider; was most fully explored in 1992&apos;s Porco Rosso, about a flying ace who happens to be a pig, chasing air pirates in the Adriatic sea.  The Wind Rises certainly doesn&apos;t scrimp on its aeronautic minutiae;\u00a0taking inspiration from a mackerel bone, Jiro&apos;s designs for strut fittings spring to life from his table in demonstration of aerodynamic principle. But for Miyazaki, the wonkishness equally edges into another abiding obsessions: the animating power of nature herself. From its shots of blooming parasols, breeze-filled curtains, fluttering snowflakes and rustling bamboo grass, there is barely a frame of The Wind Rises that doesn&apos;t serve as a reminder why Miyazaki named his studio after a wind, the Ghibli, capable of reshaping whole desert landscapes at a single stroke. Sounds awfully lot like an animator to me. It even blew Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas into each other&apos;s arms in The English Patient, if memory serves.  Wind plays cupid here, too, in the aftermath of the 1932 earthquake that flattens Tokyo, here a roiling behemoth that ripples the earth like a rug, although as always with Miyazaki it&apos;s the aftermath that interests him most: a series of subterranean groans and burps, as ash and embers fill the air, threatening the stacks of the Tokyo library. Jiro rescues a beautiful young girl, Nahoko (Miori Takimoto), using his slide-rule as a splint for her broken arm, before going to work for Mitsubishi, who send him to Nazi Germany to study the work of that country&apos;s all-metal planes. &quot;Who are they planning to bomb with this thing?&quot; he asks. &quot;America, probably&quot;.  A naif who dreams of birdlike flight while his country readies itself for war, Jiro returns to Tokyo, where he raises laughter from his colleagues with his suggestion that &quot;If we leave the guns out we should be OK.&quot;  In some ways, he is something of distant cousin to the young Jim Ballard, who in Empire of the Sun gazed on the fuselage rivets of Japanese Zero fighters, &quot;dizzied&quot; by their &quot;magic and poetry&quot;: &quot;An immense pathos surrounded the throttle and undercarriage levers, the rivets stamped into the metal fabric by some unknown Japanese woman on the Mitsubishi assembly line.&quot;  In Spielberg&apos;s film adaptation of Ballard&apos;s book, Ballard&apos;s identification with Japanese pilots became an image of transcendence, a flowering of international friendship amid a shower of sparks, but in the book Jim&apos;s gaze is a little beadier, more unnerving, with just a dash of Stockholm syndrome: he is fetishizing the likely instruments of his own death.  A similar paradox enfolds Miyazaki&apos;s film, which has come under fire from some critics, both in Japan and here in America, where it&apos;s nomination for the best animated feature by the Boston Film Critic&apos;s circle brought objections from members who objected to its canonization of the man at least partly responsible for the carnage of Pearl Harbor. The looming cataclysm is not absent from Miyazaki&apos;s canvas; in Germany, Jiro witnesses Nazi thugs delivering a beating in an alleyway and later crosses paths with a Jewish emigre who warns him of Hitler&apos;s plans for world conquest.  &quot;Japan will blow itself up,&quot; he hears. But it is telling that the most vividly realized scenes of devastation are nature&apos;s doing, not man&apos;s. The only blood spilled is that coughed into a handkerchief by Nahoko, whom Jiro later marries, their love shaped by their dwindling time together: she suffers from tuberculosis. This is Miyazaki&apos;s major departure from Horikoshi&apos;s life story, partially inspired by Thomas Mann&apos;s novel The Magic Mountain, and there is a certain poetic symmetry to Nahoko&apos;s suffering from a respiratory disease \u2013 more\u00a0airways, only this time internal and blocked. I wonder if Miyazaki&apos;s poetically occluded view of the bloodshed to come is as myopic as some of his critics maintain: the latter half of the film comes suffused with melancholy and loss, it lovely processions of images is all the more poignant for Miyazaki&apos;s recent announcement that this will be his last film. &quot;I&apos;m retiring&quot; Caponi tells Jiro in a dream. &quot;This is my last design.&quot; The loss is ours. Elsewhere on the Guardian Xan Brooks:   Naturally the animation is a joy to behold. The film&apos;s crisp colours and commanding lines summon up a ravishing portrait of pre-war Japan with its puffing steam-trains, huddled neighbourhoods and lulling nocturnal tram-rides through town. Some of the setpieces (most notably the apocalyptic earthquake that leads to the burning of Tokyo) are the equal of anything the director has produced in Spirited Away or My Neighbour Totoro. But the film itself is genteel to a fault. It&apos;s too polite, it needs more bite.  \u2022 The Wind Rises is on limited US release beginning Friday.

Seven years later, a new cast of gaffe-prone colleagues is again making life uncomfortable for Japan&apos;s leader. In recent weeks, Abe&apos;s advisers have angered Japan&apos;s closest ally, the US, while his appointee as head of Tokyo&apos;s organising committee for the 2020 Olympics took a public sideswipe at one of Japan&apos;s best-loved sports stars. Abe&apos;s problems began last month when Katsuto Momii, the head of Japan&apos;s public broadcaster, NHK, caused irritation in Washington by complaining that Japan was being unfairly singled out for criticism over its use of up to 200,000 women as sex slaves before and during the second world war. Momii, who was chosen to head NHK by a board that includes Abe appointees, also suggested that the broadcaster would toe the government line on key political and diplomatic issues, such as Japan&apos;s dispute with China over ownership of the Senkaku islands. Having initially voiced regret for the remarks, Momii now appears unrepentant. &quot;What is wrong with what I said?&quot; he told fellow NHK board members this month, according to Japanese media. The broadcaster was sucked deeper into the mire when Naoki Hyakuta, a conservative novelist who serves on its board, said the Tokyo tribunals \u2013 in which several Japanese leaders were convicted of war crimes \u2013 were used to deflect attention from the &quot;genocidal&quot; US fire-bombings of Tokyo and its nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. NHK has since been rebuffed in its attempts to secure an interview with the US ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy. Abe&apos;s visit to a war shrine in Tokyo at the end of last year has provided the richest seam of material for his indiscreet colleagues. His December pilgrimage to Yasukuni shrine, where several war criminals are honoured among Japan&apos;s 2.5 million war dead, prompted a rare rebuke from the US, which said it was disappointed that he had risked adding to tensions with China and South Korea. Abe&apos;s special adviser and close friend, Seiichi Eto, took to YouTube to hit back at the criticism, saying it was Japan, not the US, that should feel disappointed with its ally. This week the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, instructed Eto to remove the video, in which he appeared in front of giant posters of Abe along with his slogan &quot;Take back Japan&quot;. Suga was again forced on to the defensive after Abe&apos;s economic adviser, Etsuro Honda, defended the prime minister&apos;s Yasukuni visit in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, adding that Japan needed to build up its military to defend itself against China. Honda, the paper said, dreamed of a Japan &quot;that isn&apos;t beholden to the US as a patron, and doesn&apos;t feel restrained by the sensitivities of its neighbours&quot;. He claimed his remarks had been distorted. The Wall Street Journal stands by its story. Even Japanese athletes competing in the Winter Olympics in Sochi were not immune to the tide of tactless comments. Yoshiro Mori, a former prime minister who was chosen by Abe to oversee Tokyo&apos;s preparations for the 2020 Games, offered a morale-sapping critique of Japan&apos;s popular figure skater Mao Asada after she failed to execute a difficult triple axel in her short programme this week. &quot;That girl, she&apos;s always falling at a critical moments,&quot; he said of Asada, who pulled off a stunning performance in the free skate a day later to end the competition a respectable sixth. Mori will not have endeared himself to Chris and Cathy Reed, who were born in the US but represented Japan in the ice dance competition. &quot;They live in America,&quot; he said. &quot;Although they&apos;re not good enough for the US Olympic team, we include these naturalised citizens on our team.&quot; Mori&apos;s dedication to sport was behind arguably the biggest scandal of his calamitous year in office. On being informed that a Japanese fishing vessel crewed by high school students and teachers had been accidentally hit \u2013 and sunk \u2013 by a US submarine off Hawaii in 2001, Mori elected to continue playing a round of golf. Nine people, including four students, died in the accident. For Abe, the recent slew of gaffes has disturbing echoes of his previous term as leader when, for example, his health minister described women as &quot;baby-making machines&quot;, just as his administration was trying to encourage couples to have more children. This time, though, Abe has the electoral calendar on his side; he does not have to face voters again until 2016."}, {"sentences": ["Unusual Tokyo     Tokyo as seen by Takashi Kitajima.", "Photograph: Takashi Kitajima (http://www.flickr.com/turntable00000)    Japanese photographer and computer software engineer Takashi Kitajima has created a series of hypnotising shots of his hometown, Tokyo."], "tags": ["Cities", "Smartphones", "Instagram", "Photography", "Moscow holidays", "Berlin holidays", "Bangkok holidays", "Sao Paulo holidays", "US news", "Russia", "Germany", "Thailand", "Brazil", "Cairo holidays", "Egypt", "Population", "Ethiopia", "Transport", "Tokyo holidays", "Japan", "Photography", "Flickr", "Maps", "Economics", "US economic growth and recession", "Road transport"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-21T16:55:57Z", "title": "City links: the best of the web", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/feb/21/city-links-the-best-of-the-web", "article": "1.

Numbers back this up: in 2012, Egypt\u2019s national statistics agency estimated Cairo\u2019s population density at 45,000 per square kilometre, roughly 1.5 times that of Manhattan. Argaman argues this has seeded the widespread idea that Egypt must be uncrowded for it to be sustainable, and that this assumption has allowed state officials to disengage from the problems and concerns of the city and the people who live in it.

City data and the counterintuitive nature of suicide A group of computational anthropologists, led by Hygor Piaget Melo at the Federal University of Cear\u00e1 in Brazil, have studied the rate at which homicides, suicides and deaths from traffic accidents increase against the population size for all cities in Brazil and each county in the US, as this Technology Review article explains. The results have been surprising. Murders increase with population, so big cities have more per head than smaller ones. The rate of deaths from traffic accidents is the same regardless of the size of the city. And, most striking of all, the number of suicides per capita is higher in smaller cities. One reason proposed is the social nature of suicide; that \u201cthe kind of emotional intensity associated with suicide might dissipate more easily in big cities, where there are more people to shoulder the burden\u201d. 4.

Outside the biggest stores, scuffles broke out as gamers fought for favourable positions \u2013 the police were called in. It was chaos. This was March 2000, the launch of the PlayStation 2 console \u2013 the most successful games machine ever produced. The rest of the world would have to wait months for this, but back then the domestic market was the most important to Sony, as it had been to all major console manufacturers for twenty years. Japan was the epicentre of gaming; it had the console makers, the best developers and the biggest games. But over the course of the following decade things changed. February 22, 2014. The PlayStation 4 is being launched in Japan three months after the machine\u2019s high profile arrival in North America. There have been queues, of course, but no riot police this time, and no one is watching the sales figures for a hint of how this console may perform \u2013 it has already sold five million units elsewhere in the world. There are a couple of Japanese launch titles \u2013 gangster adventure Yakuza: Ishin and fantasy strategy sim Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends the key examples \u2013 but, apart from a new beta demo for Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn there is nothing huge. Talking about the delay, Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Worldwide Studios, has said that the Japanese development industry wasn\u2019t quite ready to support the machine, but this isn\u2019t the whole story. It papers over something more profound. The country hasn\u2019t been ready for years. In 2002, Japan accounted for 50% of the global video game market. By 2010, it was at 10%. If you go back to the era of PlayStation 1 and 2, you will see it was dominated by Japanese giants like Nintendo, Sony, Capcom, Konami and Namco. The biggest games were arcade conversions \u2013 the likes of Tekken, Ridge Racer and Street Fighter \u2013 but the biggest console originals came from Japanese studios too: Super Mario, Resident Evil, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid... These were the games everyone was excited by. The top ten best selling games of the nineties were all developed in Japan.  But in the early 2000s Western tastes began to change. The arrival of Rockstar\u2019s seminal open-world shooter, Grand Theft III, kickstarted a whole new genre of expansive sandbox games, while the increasing popularity of first-person shooters like Quake and Unreal led to big American franchises like Medal of Honor and Call of Duty set in grittily authentic landscapes. As a whole, Japanese gamers tended to prefer fantasy adventures and hyper-stylised arcade-style shooters \u2013 they didn\u2019t go for open-worlds, they didn\u2019t go for cinematic naturalism. A rift was developing.  Risk factors At the same time economic factors were working against the Japanese industry. An economic recession shrank the domestic market for console games, and hit publisher\u2019s ability to compete in terms of development costs. The Dreamcast title Shenmue, an incredibly prescient, ambitiously sprawling adventure required a reported $70m to develop, almost ruining its publisher Sega \u2013 but in the West, among companies like Electronic Arts, Activision and Ubisoft, this would soon be a pretty standard budget. And on the other side of the financial spectrum, a very strong indie scene has developed in the US and Europe, often with the financial backing of larger publishers (there is a thriving indie scene developing in Japan, but it has largely been contained in hobbyist groups). It also seems easier for younger talent to rise into positions of prominence within larger developers whereas in Japan, a rigidly hierarchical management structure can keep fresh talent from blossoming.  By the time of the PS3 and Xbox 360, Japanese publishers were bit part players. While Nintendo was still in a dominant position thanks to the massive success of the Wii console, Capcom, Namco, Konami, Square Enix and co struggled to maintain interest in their big franchises. Some tried to Westernise the brands, often diluting the appeal in the process. The later Resident Evil and Final Fantasy titles have, in the eyes of many gamers, lost their intrinsic qualities in the bid to appeal more broadly. In 2009, Keiji Inafune, the producer behind such mammoth games as Mega Man, Onimusha and Resident Evil 4, famously stated that the Japanese development scene was finished. It was stuck in a past of traditional role-playing games and sci-fi mech battlers. It couldn\u2019t compete.  There have been notable exceptions, of course. Plenty of them. Formed by a cabal of legendary designers and producers, Platinum Games has produced two of the finest games of the decade: Bayonetta and Vanquish; Grasshopper Manufacture retains the Japanese sense of surreal mischief with titles like No More Heroes and Lollipop Chainsaw; Capcom has produced the enormously popular Monster Hunter series of creature capture games; and of course Nintendo is still turning its big names Mario and Zelda into beautiful gaming experiences. Perhaps most tellingly, From Software\u2019s Demon\u2019s Souls and Dark Souls titles \u2013 intricate obtuse, demanding fantasy action adventures \u2013 have garnered an obsessive following in the West despite eschewing the industry flow toward more intuitive, less challenging, gaming experiences.  Signs of life But the industry is very different now than it was in 2000. The smartphone sector has exploded, some believe at the expense of the handheld console gaming sector (although Pokemon and Animal Crossing are still wonderful and popular). The PC scene in the West is strengthening through the dominance of the Steam platform, and the traditional console market has Activision, EA, Take Two and Ubisoft at its head. Look at the big gaming sites and the most anticipated titles of 2014 are Destiny, Titanfall, Watch Dogs, Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division... All produced in North America. And of course there is the rise of the online massively multiplayer RPG, a genre dominated in Asia by Chinese and South Korean giants. Japan is still there, however. Inafune\u2019s apocalyptic comment isn\u2019t quite accurate. Dark Souls 2, Mario Kart 8, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and new Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts titles are all looking enticing. The global fanbase is watching. Certainly, there has been a huge fall between 2000 and 2014, between dominating the industry and getting the freshest console three months after other territories (and the Xbox One hasn\u2019t even got a Japanese release date yet). But this business has always been about trends, it is cyclical, and the next big thing could easily come out of Tokyo or Osaka. Dark Souls shows there is an appetite for the sort of challenging and cryptic titles that Japanese publishers excel at. And there are new routes to market that cut out the repressive strata of traditional publishers. Last year, Infanune, the developer who criticised the staid Japanese industry, turned to Kickstarter to fund his new project Mighty No 9, and achieved his target in a matter of hours. Sony is supporting indie-minded development in Japan, funding offbeat titles like Tokyo Jungle and Rain with young teams and fresh ideas. Companies like Playism and Nyu Media are helping to get brilliant Japanese indie titles like La Mulana and Gigantic army to the west; boutique western publishers like Rising Star and Rice Digital are cherry picking the best local fighting games, JRPGs and shoot-\u2019em-ups. There is masses of activity bubbling under the surface. So the late launch of the PS4 tells us one story about the Japanese games industry, but it doesn\u2019t provide a full-stop or a signal of unstoppable decline. The British industry has suffered a huge fall from grace in recent years, as major publishers have pulled out, shutting studios in their wake. But it has clambered back, not just with high profile releases like GTA V, Batman and Forza Horizon, but with cool interesting indie projects. Japan is doing the same, perhaps. Veteran gamers know that from Metroid to Herzog Zwei to Resident Evil to Metal Gear to Killer7 to Dance Dance Revolution to Demon\u2019s Souls, Japan has led industry thinking on design and mechanics; it has innovated, it has invented new genres with style and flourish and purity of vision. It is now playing catch up again, but it is a skilful player. Maybe PlayStation 4, with its more open publishing platform, its easy welcome to smaller studios, its global digital distribution, will be a major part of that process.  \u2022 Tekken over \u2013 Japan\u2019s gaming future"}, {"sentences": ["The digital currency, seen by its promoters as a super-efficient way to pay online, has suffered a setback with the Tokyo-based MtGox business, that once boasted it was the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, evaporating, at least for now."], "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Technology", "Currencies", "Business", "E-commerce", "Internet", "Economics", "Japan", "World news", "Cryptocurrencies"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-25T17:18:36Z", "title": "Bitcoin will survive despite MtGox debacle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/economics-blog/2014/feb/25/bitcoin-will-survive-despite-mtgox-offline", "article": "Bitcoin is here to stay, despite a little hiccup in Japan. The digital currency, seen by its promoters as a super-efficient way to pay online, has suffered a setback with the Tokyo-based MtGox business, that once boasted it was the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, evaporating, at least for now. This would mean little if it could explain where bitcoins worth several million pounds held in its databanks have gone. The owners say they have yet to get an explanation. There is a strong rumour, based on a supposedly leaked report from the exchange, that theft accounts for around 744,000 missing bitcoins, or 6% of the entire world stock. With a bitcoin valued at more than $500 before the story broke, the theft could leave users more than $370m out of pocket. Such a huge loss would engulf most businesses in a welter of lawsuits. The digital currency was already battered by criticism pointing out its popularity with criminal gangs seeking to evade regulators or anti-fraud police. Critics also highlighted its lack of government support and the volatile price, which soared above $1,200 before Christmas before falling back below $420 on Tuesday. Techies claim they are the equivalent of Klondyke miners with a pick and shovel chipping away at rocks dotted with ore. In a sense that is how they come by their booty, except that the chipping is done by an algorithm and the whole exercise performed on a PC, perhaps from the safety of their bedroom. In a masterstroke, the currency&apos;s creator set a limit on the amount that could be generated, making everyone think that its limited supply would mean the price can only go up. That part of the plan at least seems to be unravelling. But even if the MtGox debacle hurts bitcoin beyond repair, it will be back in another guise \u2013 if only because digital currencies give clever people who lack the interpersonal skills to make it in business a chance to make a quick million bucks. Until the skills and cunning of bitcoiners can be redirected into something more useful, they will keep at it."}, {"sentences": ["Stringent adherence to US money-laundering regulations (though based in Tokyo, it belonged to a US company, Mutum Sigillum LLC) meant it was significantly harder to sell bitcoins on the site (that is, converting them into a \u201cfiat\u201dcurrency such as dollars) than to buy them (swapping dollars for bitcoins)."], "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Technology", "Crime", "World news", "Hacking", "Data and computer security"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-26T08:49:15Z", "title": "Mt.Gox v Fort Knox: What happens when a bitcoin exchange collapses", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/25/mtgox-v-fort-knox-what-happens-bitcoin-exchange-collapses", "article": "The collapse of Mt Gox will be hard for bitcoin to recover from. If a leaked \u201ccrisis strategy\u201d document is accurate, by the end of the site\u2019s life, its total bitcoin holdings were just 2,000btc, while customer deposits totalled 624,408btc.  The reason for the discrepancy, according to the document, is a vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol, which allowed 744,408btc - about 6% of all the bitcoins presently in circulation - to be stolen from the site\u2019s \u201ccold storage\u201d, a bitcoin wallet unconnected to the main network where coins are (theoretically) safe from hacking attacks.  The issue, known as \u201ctransaction malleability\u201d, has been known about since 2011, and most bitcoin software is already protected from it. The Bitcoin Foundation, the non-profit devoted to development and promotion of the currency, says that \u201cany company dealing with Bitcoin transactions [which has] coded their own wallet software should responsibly prepare for this possibility\u201d. In early 2013, Mt Gox was the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, with an estimated 70% of all transactions going through the site. But the site always had problems, particularly with withdrawals. Stringent adherence to US money-laundering regulations (though based in Tokyo, it belonged to a US company, Mutum Sigillum LLC) meant it was significantly harder to sell bitcoins on the site (that is, converting them into a \u201cfiat\u201dcurrency such as dollars) than to buy them (swapping dollars for bitcoins). This caused the price to veer away from that on other exchanges. In June 2013, the site even implemented a \u201ctemporary hiatus\u201d on dollar withdrawals, preventing every user from accessing their money. That hiatus officially ended after two weeks, but withdrawing dollars remained slow. Cold storage: something went bad Then, in early February, MtGox also limited bitcoin withdrawals. Users could still use the site to trade bitcoins to other currencies within their own accounts (so if you owned 2btc you could credit your dollar account on the site with its equivalent), but couldn\u2019t withdraw their purchases to spend outside the site. The price of bitcoin on MtGox became completely disengaged from the wider bitcoin market, and plummeted below $100 last Friday; on other exchanges it was above $500. It seems likely that it was early February when the company discovered that its cold storage was gone. While the value of customer accounts was 624,408btc, the company actually only possessed the 2,000btc that were in its \u201chot wallet\u201d \u2013 the bitcoin wallet connected directly to the exchange and used to enable trading (rather like the cash float in a cash register, as opposed to the safe in the back of the shop \u2013 which was the \u201ccold storage\u201d).  Even in pure dollar-denominated debts, the crisis strategy document says the company is insolvent, with $55m of liabilities but assets of just $32m ($5m of which are held by the US Department of Homeland Security after they were seized in August 2013.) Mt Gox seems to hope this won\u2019t be the end of the road. The crisis strategy document implies a rebranding to \u201cGox\u201d, replete with a new logo and a plea to big hitters in the bitcoin world to donate some money to ensure that depositors don\u2019t lose all their holdings. A peek at the source code of the now-blank site contains a hint of a future acquisition, with an empty space labelled \u201cput announce for mtgox acq here\u201d. But the document is also brutally honest about the likely future of MtGox \u2013 and bitcoin itself. \u201cThe reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company,\u201d it reads. \u201cHowever, with bitcoin/crypto just recently gaining acceptance in the public eye, the likely damage in public perception to this class of technology could put it back 5~10 years, and cause governments to react swiftly and harshly. At the risk of appearing hyperbolic, this could be the end of bitcoin, at least for most of the public.\u201d Most of the bitcoin community seems prepared to try and separate perception of MtGox from that of the currency and concept itself. Marc Andreesen, whose Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm has invested heavily in bitcoin, described the firm as \u201cobviously broken and possibly outright crooked\u201d when speaking to CNBC on Tuesday. \u201cThis is like [bankrupt financial services firm] MF Global,\u201d he continued, \u201cnot some huge breakdown of the underlying technology or other exchanges.\u201d Henry Blodget, formerly an equities analyst and now in charge of Business Insider, puts it like this:     No, Bitcoin is not &quot;doomed.&quot; But the collapse of the co that was synonymous with Bitcoin for years is a big confidence blow.&mdash; Henry Blodget (@hblodget) February 25, 2014    There\u2019s a chance consumer trust in bitcoin may survive. What happened to Mt Gox is essentially a bank robbery - albeit one bigger than any in recorded history (the next-biggest recorded theft is for $108m). It\u2019s actually far easier to comprehend than something like the collapse of Northern Rock or Lehman Brothers; and if those failures didn\u2019t bring down fractional reserve banking or highly leveraged derivative trading, then there\u2019s hope for bitcoin. Vanishing bitcoins, vanishing trust? But if the MtGox losses are equivalent to a bank robbery, they underscore the perception of bitcoin as a currency highly susceptible to bank robberies. Users of services including Bitcoinica, Inputs.io, and now MtGox have all seen their deposits disappear overnight. So how secure are other exchanges? Many bitcoin services were hacked together with little attention paid to long term security. For instance, MtGox incorporated encryption code which was described by its creator two years ago as \u201cquick\u2019n\u2018dirty\u201d because they were \u201ctoo lazy\u201d to do it the proper way. In a world where a single bitcoin was worth pennies, that was acceptable, but once real money was at stake, the duct-tape approach led to problems. Bitcoin exchanges are now constantly under pressure, with a massive DDoS attack hitting some of the biggest in early February. By their nature, such exchanges are tempting targets for hackers; they are, in essence, a bitcoin wallet connected to a web interface. All too frequently, the security system in place has been easy to overwhelm. But the new generation of bitcoin companies \u2013 professional, venture-capital-backed, serious and, hopefully, secure \u2013 are fighting to change that. Their move towards reliability even extends to pushing for regulation of the currency, something which seems anathema to longer-standing users. \u201cThere\u2019s probably some minimal requirements and procedures that should be put in place if you\u2019re facilitating that kind of exchange,\u201d as Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of bitcoin payment processor Coinbase, said to regulators in January. Others are proposing a move away from another of bitcoin\u2019s guiding principles: anonymity. \u201cAnonymity prevents reversal of transactions, but with a trend away from anonymity, transactions will be visible and thereby reversible under certain circumstances,\u201d says venture capitalist Michael Jackson of Mangrove Capital Partners. \u201cA depositor protection scheme will come. In \u2018real\u2019 currencies, this protection is provided by the central banks, or currency issuers. With no central bank, the industry needs to take this role.\u201d But there isn\u2019t currently any technical basis for such a change, and it\u2019s unclear if a non-anonymous bitcoin is even theoretically possible. Bitcoin still has long term issues regarding transaction speed, price volatility, and ease of use, as well as finding a killer app which isn\u2019t online drug sales. But those take a back seat to the need to credibly reassure people who own bitcoins that their cash is safe.

Ho Chi Minh City, half a world away in Vietnam, is a fast-growing megacity clogged with motorbikes; an extraordinary mixture of old and new, rich and poor. Different as they seem, the two cities have something crucial in common. Both sit on river deltas, and are defined \u2013 and increasingly threatened \u2013 by their relationship with water. Perched near coasts astride major rivers, with tributaries running through neighbourhoods, these two port cities are on the front lines of climate change. Now they are coming together in an unusual partnership, sharing coping strategies as their positions grow more perilous. Rotterdam, with long experience in flood management, is advising Ho Chi Minh City on the development and implementation of a climate adaptation plan to help the Vietnamese city avoid disaster as sea levels rise and the frequency and severity of storms increases. This east-west collaboration could hold important lessons for flood-threatened cities around the world. Ho Chi Minh City and Rotterdam are both seeking to strike a balance between the two main approaches to flood protection: bolstering expensive, hard protections while also &quot;making room for the river&quot; \u2013 creating space for water to run without damaging developed areas. Added to the mix are new ideas such as dotting flood zones with playgrounds that can hold run-off water when needed. For all the cities&apos; differences, says Alexandra van Huffelen, Rotterdam&apos;s vice-mayor for sustainability, Ho Chi Minh City &quot;really felt the same [as us]; the same issues arose&quot;. Its leaders initially sought Rotterdam&apos;s advice because, she recalls, they saw the Dutch city was also grappling with &quot;more water coming down the river at unexpected times, problems with extreme rainfall, rising sea levels, salinisation levels and issues with groundwater \u2013 exactly the same issues they were facing.&quot; In truth, Rotterdam and Ho Chi Minh City share similar DNA, each bustling with the energy typical of a business-minded shipping hub. Unlike other Dutch cities, whose streets are lined with graceful, centuries-old homes, Rotterdam was nearly flattened in the second world war, and it has rebuilt itself with a modern sensibility. Rem Koolhaas&apos;s new De Rotterdam megatower is the latest example of its architectural ambitions.     During the rainy season, some parts of Ho Chi Minh City flood twice a day. Photograph: Stijn Koole    Ho Chi Minh City has also known war, of course. Its wide French boulevards and elegant but decaying old buildings mix with communist-era blocks and modern shopping malls and skyscrapers. While the Dutch are famous for the carefully engineered dikes, sea walls and other barriers that protect their low-lying home from the sea, the Vietnamese have learned to live with water, building floating buildings and homes on stilts, and selling goods from longboats in the Mekong delta&apos;s floating markets, south of Ho Chi Minh City. &quot;It&apos;s a more traditional way that they are using,&quot; says Van Huffelen. &quot;They come from a more natural way of protecting themselves; we come from a more infrastructural way. We&apos;re meeting each other halfway. They&apos;re learning from us about storm surge barriers and dikes and things like that, and we&apos;re learning from them [that] you need to work with nature, and let nature help you protect the coastline.&quot; In the rainy season some parts of Ho Chi Minh City flood twice a day, with waters rising almost knee high when the tide comes in. Residents are forced to learn resilience, says Chantal Oudkerk Pool, a Rotterdam climate adaptation expert who\u00a0is closely involved with the Ho Chi Minh City effort. &quot;You have no choice but to protect your home by elevating the ground floor,&quot; Oudkerk Pool says. &quot;They all have tiles on the floor. Here, we have expensive wooden floors, and if the water comes, we have thousands of euros in damage. They just mop the floor and it&apos;s done. Very simple, but very effective.&quot; Ho Chi Minh City&apos;s flooding problems are likely to get worse as the impact of climate change intensifies and the city&apos;s fast growth continues; its population of roughly 8 million is expected to reach 12 million by 2020. A third of Ho Chi Minh City suffers regular flooding now, and if expansion into low-lying areas continues unchecked, two-thirds could be vulnerable in a decade. According to one of the intercity collaboration&apos;s advisors, Ho Long Phi, over the past 10 years the Vietnamese authorities have installed $1bn (\u00a3600m) worth of protection measures for the city&apos;s centre, reducing flooding even as peak tides have risen and intense storms have become more frequent. But in that time, says Phi, who is director of Vietnam National University&apos;s centre of water management and climate change, the population of the low-lying suburbs has boomed, and they now require $3bn in new protection measures. \u00a0     Storm-surge barriers at the port in Rotterdam.

Rotterdam, widely viewed as a world leader in resiliency planning, developed a climate adaptation strategy in 2008; a year later, officials from the two cities first encountered each other through Connecting Delta Cities; a network founded by Rotterdam which also includes Tokyo, Jakarta, London, New York and New Orleans. After months spent researching the scope of Ho Chi Minh City&apos;s challenges, the two cities signed a memorandum in 2011 appointing a consortium of public and private sector experts to begin work on the plan. Their efforts culminated in the delivery of a major adaptation strategy last year, laying out six broad goals such as increasing water storage and drainage capacity, and making sure flood risk informs development decisions. The Vietnamese then signed Rotterdam on for phase 2 of the effort (now just beginning), in which the Dutch will help local planners apply the ideas more concretely. The Dutch government has put \u20ac1.4m (\u00a31.15m) into the project, and corporate participants hope to profit from their presence in Ho Chi Minh City in a setup the teams refer to as &quot;Vietnamese ownership, Dutch partnership&quot;. For the first six months, Giao Lan Phuong \u2013 a Ho Chi Minh City-based project manager from the engineering consultancy Grontmij \u2013 served as a translator. Now, however, the Vietnamese participants have improved their English so much that interpretation is rarely needed, Phuong says. &quot;We understand each other and we learn from each other. Of course, we have different cultures, [but] all the people from both sides are very open and we talk to each other.&quot; Jeroen Aerts, professor of water management and risk at Amsterdam&apos;s VU University \u2013 another part of the Ho Chi Minh City consortium \u2013 stresses the need to pay attention to cultural cues to make such a collaboration work. While the Dutch are used to speaking directly in meetings, Aerts explains, &quot;in Vietnam it&apos;s different. If you are in a workshop with a high official, other people wait for them to say something. You need to understand how it works, and if you understand it then you really can do something.&quot;     Ho Chi Minh City has learned to live with the Saigon river, creating floating buildings and homes on stilts. Photograph: Guardian Cities    Like many flood-prone areas, Britain included, both Rotterdam and Ho Chi Minh City are debating when to build expensive protection infrastructure and when to retreat, letting the water take some areas so that others can stay dry. In Rotterdam, a few neighbourhoods have been designated as occasional flood zones, with resilient homes that feature measures like electrics placed high off the ground.\u00a0&quot;You can&apos;t protect everything, and you need to give the river its room,&quot; Van Huffelen says. Rotterdam has come up with some clever solutions which could be tweaked to fit the needs of its Vietnamese partner, Oudkerk Pool says. These include measures like &quot;water squares&quot; \u2013 patches of land that serve as playgrounds or parks in good weather but become holding basins for runoff when floods come. Beneath some of its underground car parks, Rotterdam has installed storage tanks that play the same role, releasing excess water only when the city&apos;s drainage system can handle it. The Dutch experts are urging Ho Chi Minh City officials to plan carefully as the city&apos;s population booms, ensuring that newly developed areas include lots of green space, which can act like a sponge during deluges, and special pavements that absorb water rather than speed its runoff. Not everything that has worked in Rotterdam can be transferred directly to Ho Chi Minh City, in part because it is a far poorer city, and its governing institutions are less effective. &quot;You can&apos;t just copy and paste. You have to base it on your real capacity \u2013 and the Dutch people cannot understand us as well as we understand ourselves,&quot; Phi says. &quot;We have to match our abilities with our vision \u2013 the vision could be the same, but the way is totally different.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["MtGox filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo on Friday, with the world\u2019s former biggest bitcoin exchange blaming \u201ca weakness in our system\u201d for its collapse."], "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Japan", "Hacking", "Data and computer security", "Technology", "Business", "Bankruptcy and IVAs"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-28T13:30:38Z", "title": "MtGox files for bankruptcy in Japan after collapse of bitcoin exchange", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/28/bitcoin-mtgox-bankruptcy-japan", "article": "MtGox filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo on Friday, with the world\u2019s former biggest bitcoin exchange blaming \u201ca weakness in our system\u201d for its collapse.

He doesn&apos;t do Twitter, and he\u00a0doesn&apos;t do Facebook, and he\u00a0doesn&apos;t text because, without a\u00a0phone, he can&apos;t. He has just got a website. It has, he explains, taken four years to get it up. &quot;I&apos;m not a technophobe,&quot; he says. &quot;I think it&apos;s all rather incredible. But I think the business of the writer is to write.&quot; And write he has. Now aged 43 he is a prizewinning and critically acclaimed author of five novels, four volumes of poetry, a short story collection and a children&apos;s book. He has suggested we meet at Chapel Market, just off Islington&apos;s Upper Street in London where there&apos;s one stall selling artisan bread and cakes, but mostly the stalls are selling what markets nearly always sell: cheap bags and clothes, fruit and veg, cleaning products, make-up and tat. And a Manze&apos;s Eel Pie and Mash Shop. Hill this place because his new novel, What Was Promised, has a lot to do with markets, and because he once worked in this particular one. &quot;It was the best holiday job I ever had,&quot; he tells me. &quot;We&apos;d come out here bright and early and sell our jogging bottoms and Batman T-shirts.&quot; What Was Promised starts off in Columbia Road, of market fame, in 1948. Spanning 40 years, it tells the story of three families brought to the East End by the war. There&apos;s Solly Lazarus, the Jewish watchmaker from\u00a0Danzig, and his beautiful wife, Dora. There&apos;s Clarence Malcolm, the &quot;Banana King&quot; from Jamaica, his wife, Bernadette, and Sidney, their son. And there&apos;s Michael and Mary Lockhart, originally from Birmingham, who both know not to ask too many questions about the errands Michael&apos;s paid to run. Their daughters, Iris and Floss, play with Sidney and with a boy who thinks he must be an orphan, and who says his name is &quot;Pond&quot;. All immigrants of a kind, the characters have to learn, as Clarence puts it, to live on their &quot;wits alone&quot;. They live in Columbia Buildings, condemned by the council as a slum. As they struggle to make ends meet, their lives and stories intertwine, first in good ways and then in a terrible way that will change nearly all their lives. The effects of this are still being felt in 1988 when the novel ends. &quot;Markets are precious,&quot; says Hill, &quot;and they&apos;re so easily destroyed. And they&apos;re not very English, which is why when people got off the boats in 1948, they would see this little slice of life, which could be anywhere. I wanted to get the sense of that and how that felt.&quot; Hill, who has been described by this paper as &quot;contemporary literature&apos;s renaissance man&quot;, seems as comfortable with a 500-page novel as a short story or a poem. He brings his poet&apos;s eye for precision to the teeming life of the market. He talks, for example, about air that &quot;tastes of old batteries&quot;, rain that &quot;hardens down into the byways&quot;, &quot;crizzling down the windows&quot;, and about a face &quot;sunken as old meat&quot;. But his main theme isn&apos;t actually the market but the &quot;collisions&quot; the city throws up. The novel, like his last poetry collection, Nocturne in Chrome and Sunset Yellow, has Emerson&apos;s &quot;cities give us collision&quot; as its epigraph. &quot;When people get exhausted by the city and want to escape,&quot; he says, &quot;it&apos;s the collisions they want to get away from. I have,&quot; he\u00a0adds, &quot;been trying not to write about London for years.&quot; If he&apos;s been trying, he hasn&apos;t been trying all that hard. In his first collection of short stories, Skin, which won the 1998 PEN/Macmillan award for fiction, he wrote partly about Japan, where he&apos;d been living, but also about London Zoo. His first novel, Underground, published in 1999, as you might guess from the title, is largely set on the underground: and not just in the passages and tunnels that people still use. His next, The Love of Stones, switches between Victorian and contemporary London, as well as Tokyo and Istanbul. The Cryptographer, about a love affair between a tax inspector and &quot;the world&apos;s first quadrillionaire&quot; is set in the London of\u00a0the future. Only his fourth novel The\u00a0Hidden, published five years ago, is set largely outside London, in Greece. His first poetry collection, Year of the\u00a0Dog, which won him an Eric Gregory award in 1995, was, like Skin, dominated by images of Japan. His second, Midnight in the City of Clocks, moves between London and Japan. His third, Zoo, is nearly all about London, and was published while he was poet in residence at London Zoo. Nocturne in Chrome and Sunset Yellow, published in\u00a02006, is pretty much a love song to the city. &quot;London,&quot; he says, in the poem &quot;November&quot;, &quot;\u2013 there&apos;s a rhythm to the\u00a0name, its ending an echo of its beginning, as if London were the name\u00a0for somewhere full to the brim with its own echoes&quot;. Rhythm is, of course, as central to prose as to poetry, but there&apos;s also the rhythm of structure, and plot. Hill&apos;s previous four novels could probably be described as &quot;intellectual thrillers&quot;: in Underground, the central character is trying to track down the person who&apos;s pushing women under trains; in The Love of Stones, she&apos;s on a hunt for a missing jewel; in The Cryptographer she&apos;s investigating an electronic currency that seems to have been protected by an unbreakable code; and\u00a0in The Hidden a team of archeologists hide, and eventually reveal, a terrible secret. &quot;Judgments and secrets are what make a good novel,&quot; he says, when I point out the pattern. But you couldn&apos;t describe his latest novel as a thriller. Was he trying to get away from the genre? &quot;That,&quot; he says carefully, &quot;might be true. People have expectations of what you are as a writer. And writers, on the whole, don&apos;t like to be classified. About five years ago, I decided I wanted to write a novel about people, rather than ideas.&quot; What Was Promised is certainly a novel about people, and the people in it are much more powerfully depicted than the characters he&apos;s given us before. As a novelist Hill has been praised for &quot;the sort of brilliance that leaves you short of breath&quot; and described by AS Byatt as &quot;one of the two or three most original and interesting young novelists working in Britain today&quot;. Before he was picked in 2004 by the Poetry Book Society as a Next Generation Poet, and by the Sunday Times as a Young Writer of the Year, he was nominated by the TLS as one of the Best Young Writers in\u00a0Britain. But he hasn&apos;t always been praised for his characterisation. Penelope Lively said that Katharine, the central character in\u00a0The Love of Stones, &quot;remained a\u00a0shadowy creature&quot;. Sam Leith described Casimir, in Underground, as &quot;a sort of ambulant potato&quot;. Did such comments play a part in his decision to\u00a0write a novel about people? &quot;Absolutely!&quot; says Hill. &quot;They&apos;re quite right. My strong suits, coming from poetry, will naturally be description, which I love doing. It comes very easily, and possibly structure, up to a point. My weaker suits are character and dialogue, and that&apos;s why I&apos;ve invested four years in this.&quot; And what, I ask, about plot? Presumably, with all those thrillers, he had to do some meticulous plotting in advance? Hill shakes his head. &quot;I don&apos;t really plot, no. Do you know that lovely Ursula Le Guin book about writing? She\u00a0talked about her novels having rhythms not like poetry, but huge rhythms, like mountain ranges \u2013 and that comes out of not knowing too much. When the plot grows out of the character, that&apos;s much harder, because you&apos;re constantly gardening, and trying to work out which bit needs to be trimmed.&quot; In the past, Hill has said that he can&apos;t write poems and novels at the same time. Now, he does both. &quot;During the last novel,&quot; he says, &quot;it was so difficult that halfway through I just caved in, because I was so hungry to write poetry. It helped when I came back to the novel as well.&quot; And how different is the process? &quot;I think,&quot; he replies, after a pause, &quot;the poem and the short story have an affinity, in that you know it&apos;s going to be over soon. With a novel, there is no hurrying it. You&apos;re constantly walking into the unknown.&quot; What Was Promised is about outsiders, but then nearly all Tobias Hill&apos;s work is about outsiders. His own family is a mixture of German-Jewish and British. His mother&apos;s German parents moved to Welwyn Garden City because &quot;they thought in a new town no one would have any roots&quot;. His father&apos;s family were &quot;goldsmiths and gunmakers and workhouse masters&quot;. One of his relatives, he says, &quot;was a\u00a0dodgy, irascible travelling land surveyor who once chased off an armed sailor with a shotgun and ended up going mad with syphilis&quot;. Hill grew up in a &quot;bookish household&quot; in Kentish Town, north London, with a journalist father who made &quot;intricate model boats&quot; and wrote &quot;rather good poetry&quot; and a graphic designer mother who did &quot;rather good pictures&quot; and sang. As a child, he was obsessed with butterflies, gemstones and dinosaurs. His grandmother, he says, &quot;was an avid collector of things&quot;. He hated school \u2013 Hampstead school, where Zadie Smith was also a pupil \u2013 but he started writing poems as a child, and was published by\u00a0the time he was 20. Two years later, he went to live for\u00a0a couple of years in Japan (&quot;like another version of Britain. There&apos;s the\u00a0same introspection, the same ritualistic tendencies, and tea.&quot;) When he returned to London, he had decided he was\u00a0going to be a writer. &quot;I came back with the idea that I would give it a\u00a0real\u00a0go, and move back into my old bedroom. I\u00a0clomped round the house annoying my parents until they finally threw me\u00a0out.&quot; He met his wife, Hannah, at his father&apos;s memorial service when he was\u00a026. In his poem &quot;October&quot;, he writes: &quot;I\u00a0will never have seen enough of you.&quot; Now they have 14-month-old Kit. Hill teaches creative writing one day a week, but the rest of the time he\u00a0writes. It sounds pretty idyllic. No\u00a0wonder he writes in his poem &quot;November&quot;, &quot;all that brilliance was\u00a0ours&quot;. Hill is warm and polite, yet his work has often been described as clever but cool. &quot;I know what they mean,&quot; he says. &quot;I see people occasionally saying the same thing about Kazuo Ishiguro. What I\u00a0feel about Ishiguro is that he&apos;s an intensely emotional writer, and either you get that or you don&apos;t. Obviously, I\u00a0want people to get something out of this novel. I don&apos;t,&quot; he says, &quot;want them to say I&apos;m cold.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["He would play undercover cop Brian O&apos;Conner in all the subsequent entries in the series, with the exception of 2006&apos;s Tokyo Drift, the third; the franchise has made nearly $1bn at the US box office."], "tags": ["Oscars 2014", "Paul Walker", "Film", "Oscars", "Awards and prizes", "Culture", "US news", "World news", "Oscars 2015"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-03T03:55:15Z", "title": "Paul Walker: Academy pays tribute at 2014 Oscars", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/03/paul-walker-oscars-tribute-in-memoriam", "article": "The Oscars paid tribute to Paul Walker \u2013 the star of the Fast and Furious movies whose death last year at the age of 40 shocked Hollywood \u2013 by devoting part of its traditional In Memoriam section to the actor.

When she first arrived years ago, she found the city harsh; the air seemed often to be thick with tension. But it was exciting, too, all the different lives and cultures, its astonishing &quot;openness&quot;, and slowly she carved out\u00a0her own space within it. These days, she runs a successful design company and is engaged to a wry but loving Englishman called Mark (though she has not yet told her parents this news, knowing it will mean the end of their hopes for her return). Only then\u2026 the phone rings. Her father, a keen mountaineer, has been killed in an accident after falling 60ft. She must go home for the funeral. In Japan, everything should be so familiar. But she feels at a distance. Japanese funerals are replete with ceremony, rituals she considers with the eye of an exile, and cannot help but find wanting. She hates the funeral &quot;package&quot; her family must buy \u2013 it appals her that a kaimyo, a holy name conferred on the dead by a Buddhist monk, counts as an extra \u2013 and as the chanting begins she finds that she cannot cry. The whole performance reminds her of the Noh play she saw during her last visit to the country; the ghastly modern funeral home is a stage, and she is an actor, courtesy and formality filling the space where grief should be. It&apos;s only when she reaches into her father&apos;s open coffin and touches his face that she is able to feel anything at all, and now it&apos;s partly guilt that has her making a spectacle of herself (her family gaze on, startled by her sudden sobbing). Her father had wanted nothing more than for her to marry a nice Japanese boy and settle down in Tokyo. Fumio Obata is a Japanese exile himself \u2013 he came to Britain in 1991 to study illustration at Glasgow School of Art and never left \u2013 and perhaps this is one reason why his fantastic graphic novel Just So Happens feels so richly intimate; he knows all about the conflict of belonging. But it&apos;s clear, too, that he is a talent to watch. I like his elegant, understated drawings, which hint at the manga stories he must have read as a boy. Bullet trains, Shinto temples, shopping malls, sushi restaurants: he does them all beautifully. His storytelling, too, is crazily accomplished, flashback deployed with great care the better to reveal Yumiko&apos;s state of mind (in comics, flashback can often feel clunky). Most of all, I like the book&apos;s message, which is about talent and fulfilment, and the way that thwartedness helps no one. After the funeral, Yumiko travels to Kyoto to see her mother (her parents divorced when she was a teenager), who has always thrilled at her daughter&apos;s new life of possibility, roundedness and ambition. And here, something clarifies for her at last. She returns to London liberated from a burden she had not even known she was carrying. Her father&apos;s death has, it seems, set her free, not from marriage and Japanese conformity but from her mother&apos;s need to live vicariously through her. Obata&apos;s final frame is a sketch of Regent Street beneath grey skies, a taxi nosing its way determinedly towards Piccadilly Circus. For all its bustle, it feels strangely peaceful."}, {"sentences": ["Think of the reckless proclamations about the right of Crimea to self-determination \u2026 the Kremlin seems to have forgotten that Japan has a claim out for the Kuril Islands, and that a peace treaty has not yet to be signed with Tokyo."], "tags": ["Ukraine", "Russia", "World news", "US news", "Vladimir Putin", "Protest"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-03T17:48:13Z", "title": "Ukraine crisis deepens: commentary and analysis on Russia in Crimea", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/03/ukraine-crisis-russia-crimea-commentary-analysis", "article": "As Russian forces continued to seep into Ukraine this weekend, covertly, overtly and with the authorization of president Vladimir Putin and the Russian parliament, last week\u2019s intimations of war have turned into a slow-motion invasion on the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians and \u201cnormalizing\u201d the situation that western nations so recklessly fueled in Kiev. At least that\u2019s the party line. How did we get here?  Last week, Viktor Yanukovych, pressured by a revolution boiling over in the country\u2019s capital, disappeared. Putin announced surprise military exercises in the Black Sea and along Russia\u2019s western border. Yanukovych, eventually deposed by parliament (his own party abandoned him), surfaced in Russia and denounced the \u201ccoup\u201d that ousted him.  Armed gangs \u2013 almost indisputably backed by Russia and sometimes admitted Russian soldiers \u2013 seized government buildings and airports in the Crimean peninsula, and pro-Russian demonstrations popped up across eastern Ukraine. The new government in Kiev denounced Russia\u2019s actions as \u201cnaked aggression\u201d and invasion, yet so far has refused to engage its military. Russian vehicles, arms and troops began appearing in eastern Ukraine, and on Saturday the Duma unanimously approved Putin\u2019s request to authorize military intervention.       Russian troops, having surrounded Ukrainian bases, are urging peaceful surrender \u2013 and being politely rebuffed by the Ukrainians. Only one major Ukrainian commander has defected thus far, and he was heckled at his own press conference and promptly accused of treason in Kiev.       The big question is, of course, what happens next, and it is a messy one.  Despite CNN\u2019s insistence, very few people involved (and Putin probably isn\u2019t one of them) see this as a \u201ccold war chess match\u201d; ethnic divisions in Ukraine (like everywhere else) don\u2019t boil down to something as basic as \u201cpro-Russian in the east and pro-European in the west\u201d: most of the country speaks both languages, plenty of ethnic Russians are pro-European, and important minorities, such as the Tatars, have a voice in this, too. The US and Europe are hardly powerless, but their options are limited. Here\u2019s analysis from experts around the world: Anne Applebaum at the Washington Post foresees a continued creep into Ukraine:  Unless Vladimir Putin suddenly becomes irrational \u2013 which of course can\u2019t be excluded \u2013 he must know that a full-scale invasion is entirely unnecessary. After all, he possesses a whole arsenal of non-military tactics that could undermine the new Ukrainian government. A provokatsiya is technically a \u201cprovocation\u201d. But it has a narrower meaning as well: a political event or action that the authorities, through their secret services, create to serve their own purposes. A staged crisis; the publication of outrageous documents, authentic or fake; a rapidly organized political movement of the far right or far left; an anonymous bomb explosion. Crimea is vulnerable to manipulation. Russian agents successfully undermined the sovereignty of Georgia by offering Russian passports and other inducements to the residents of South Ossetia, a Georgian province, and then carrying out a de facto invasion. \u2026 Crimea could become a part of Ukraine that is not really ruled by Ukraine. There are longer-term tactics available as well. Russia\u2019s corrupt business elite, together with Ukraine\u2019s corrupt business elite, will certainly try to draw Ukraine\u2019s new leaders into the same web that caught Yanu\u00adkovych as well as his \u201cpro-Western\u201d predecessors. There is a lot of money available to Ukrainian politicians of all sorts who don\u2019t mind being on the Russian payroll, and it\u2019s a lot more money than anybody will get from a State Department \u201cdemocracy\u201d grant.      People march during a procession in central Moscow to support the people of Crimea and Ukraine, including Russian speakers. Photograph: Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters    Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre, for the Guardian, writes that Putin\u2019s endgame likely involves controlling the story and rebalancing Russia\u2019s role in the world:   Over the last 10 days, Moscow has been unpleasantly surprised several times \u2026 The new official Ukrainian narrative, it was feared in Moscow, would change from the post-Soviet \u201cUkraine is not Russia\u201d to something like \u201cUkraine in opposition to Russia\u201d. Moscow now has two options: a confederacy between Crimea and Ukraine and Crimea\u2019s full integration into the Russian Federation (a relevant law is being adjusted to allow this). Even if there is no war, the Crimea crisis is likely to alter fundamentally relations between Russia and the west and lead to changes in the global power balance, with Russia now in open competition with the United States and the European Union.        \u2018The president oversaw military exercises in the western and central districts.\u2019   Oxana Shevel explains the importance of Tatars at the Washington Post:  The Tatars \u2013 a Muslim group that was deported en masse from Crimea by Stalin in 1944 and that for decades has waged a peaceful struggle for the right to return \u2013 have been coming back in droves since 1989. According to the latest Ukrainian census, Crimean Tatars account for 12.1% of the Crimean population of 2,033,700. They represent a highly mobilized and unified constituency that has consistently been pro-Ukrainian and opposed to pro-Russian separatism on the peninsula.  Whatever the Tatar grievances against the Ukrainian state may be, when faced with the choice of being under either Russian or Ukrainian control, the Crimean Tatar leadership has consistently and unequivocally chosen Ukraine.   As far as what western Europe and the US can do, Ulrich Speck, another Carnegie scholar, posted his thoughts on Facebook on the EU\u2019s \u201ccarrots and sticks\u201d:   I think Berlin has a strategy which is trying to bring Putin back into the camp of reasonable leaders of states. By taking a much softer approach than other western leaders, Steinmeier and Merkel are trying to build bridges which allow Putin to step back from further aggression. But it can only work when it is coordinated. Carrots can only work as a diplomatic tool if there are also sticks: Putin must understand what the price is for invading Ukraine, and he must understand that the west is united and very serious. If Berlin only holds carrots, someone else needs to carry the stick.  Currently I don\u2019t see such a coordinated approach. Without a close coordination of US and EU positions, the Kremlin will perceive the west as weak and is unlikely to stop his actions in Ukraine.   Josh Rogin, at the Daily Beast, considers President Obama\u2019s possible courses:   The administration is already doing what it can do now to show Putin that the US government is serious about its outrage over Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine. In addition to Kerry\u2019s Sunday announcement that the US has suspended preparations for the June G8 meeting in Sochi and might seek to expel Russia from the G8 altogether, officials said the US has cancelled several planned bilateral events and is expected to cancel several more. Effectively, the US has decided to put the brakes on all aspects of bilateral relations until the crisis in Crimea is further resolved. Even Russian business leaders could be targets for asset freezes and visa bans. Administration officials added that Russian companies were fair game for sanctions if they can be shown to have been involved in either the invasion of Ukraine, or the effort to destabilizing the interim government that replaced ousted President Viktor Yanukovich, who fled to Russia last week.        So how does this play out in Ukraine and Russia?  Probably very, very poorly. Ukraine has a fragile new government, an economic crisis and endemic corruption; the stakes are high and self-evident. For Russia, everything from its economy, internal politics and its borders could be threatened \u2013 besides the obvious costs of what would be a bitter war. Mark Adomanis at Forbes takes a pessimistic outlook that invasion would devastate Russia\u2019s economy (a tumbling ruble this morning has supported him so far):  The economic costs to Russia will be severe. The Moscow stock market is going to get absolutely clobbered when it opens tomorrow, and many foreign investors are going to bolt for the exits as quickly as they can. Depending on the severity of the situation in Ukraine, the Russian financial system could come screeching to a halt. It\u2019s a given that many of these decisions impacting Russia\u2019s economy will be made in haste and without a sober calculation of costs and befits, but that\u2019s the way the world works: investors often overreact to political events and they will certainly overreact to a military invasion of a neighboring country. Russia\u2019s economy has already been slowing down for the past several quarters, and the absolute last thing that it needs at the moment is a huge acceleration in capital flight. The ruble is also going to suffer ... .   Tikhon Dzyadko deputy editor of Dozhd, an independent TV station, has written a piece for the New Republic on how invasion causes more problems at home than anything:  What does [the Kremlin] get in return? Problems on its own territory. Think of the reckless proclamations about the right of Crimea to self-determination \u2026 the Kremlin seems to have forgotten that Japan has a claim out for the Kuril Islands, and that a peace treaty has not yet to be signed with Tokyo. \u201cDon\u2019t chop the branch you\u2019re sitting on\u201d is a Russian proverb. A Russian invasion of Ukraine [would] paradoxically help Ukraine: questions about the legitimacy of the new government in Kiev will fall away; the IMF and the West will be tripping over themselves to help Ukraine financially; this, in turn, will prop up the government in Kiev, which is currently broke; and, finally, the Ukrainian people will be united in their fight against an occupier.  Russia, on the other hand, will be left with international isolation and yet another neighboring territory recognized by no one. In 2008, it was Abkhazia and South Ossetia; now, it is the Crimea. But in acquiring the Crimea, Russia will lose Ukraine, its biggest partner for transporting gas to Europe.        And finally, Timothy Snyder at Foreign Policy sees problems if Russia starts playing border games \u2013 China could take advantage in Siberia:  An attempt to seize Ukrainian territory would be a disaster in the short run, ruining Russian credibility around the world and likely starting a major war. In the long-term, such an action, even if it were to succeed, would set a rather troubling precedent \u2013 for Russia itself. If Russia excludes its own borders from the general international standard of inviolability, it might face some unwanted challenges. [In eastern Siberia] Russia holds major natural resources along its border with China, the world\u2019s longest. Beijing \u2026 will likely note the developing Russian doctrine on the flexibility of Russia\u2019s external borders. China also has a stake in eastern Siberia. It needs fresh water, hydrocarbons, mineral resources such as copper and zinc, and fertile soil for its farmers. Beijing actually invests more in eastern Siberia than does Moscow. No one knows the exact number of Chinese citizens in eastern Siberia \u2026 but it certainly dwarfs the number of Russians in Crimea.

But Brailsford&apos;s role has been highlighted by Chris Boardman, who said the team needed &quot;a full-time boss.&quot; Sutton had set a benchmark of six medals for the championship, but the team fell one short in spite of sterling efforts from women such as double gold medallist Joanna Rowsell. Of most concern was the men - endurance and sprint - returning empty-handed from a track World&apos;s for the first time since Lottery funding began in 1998. This was a sudden drop from 2013, when Great Britain topped the medal table with nine medals, including five golds. &quot;The buck stops with me and I&apos;m big enough to take it,&quot; said Sutton, who had harsh words for the men&apos;s endurance team, who managed only eighth in qualifying in the team pursuit, a key benchmark for Great Britain and a discipline in which they had won a medal every year since 2000, apart from a fourth place in 2009. Coming as it did on day one, that result set the tone for a week in which only Ed Clancy&apos;s fifth place in the omnium - with three first places in the six counting events - offering any relief from the gloom. &quot;They need to look at themselves,&quot; said Sutton, pointedly. &quot;They got it wrong. They went out for the festive season, came back and weren&apos;t where they should have been (performance-wise). I&apos;ve got concerns with the current crop of riders we&apos;ve got and it&apos;s only them that can change. We&apos;ve just gone backwards and I think the accountability rests with the riders.&quot; It was a result that raised eyebrows, among onlookers such as Dan Hunt, the coach who guided Clancy, Steven Burke, Peter Kennaugh and Geraint Thomas to gold in London, who told the Guardian afterwards, &quot;What concerns me is the quality of the teams in front of them. Being beaten by Germany, Switzerland and Spain is worrying.&quot; It had been suggested the younger riders in the endurance squad, 21-year-old Sam Harrison, and 20-year-olds Owain Doull and Jon Dibben could eventually rival double Olympic team pursuit gold winners Clancy and Thomas, but Sutton is not so sure. &quot;Ed&apos;s special. I don&apos;t think the other boys have got the talent if I was totally honest,&quot; Sutton added. &quot;When you&apos;ve got a man like [London gold medallist] Steven Burke not to make the squad, he needs to reflect on where&apos;s he going. This isn&apos;t just pointing the finger at the men&apos;s team pursuit. This is not me criticising my team. I&apos;m here to support them. [But] it&apos;s the World Championships and they have come here to perform. If they leave one stone unturned they&apos;re going to get exposed.&quot; Sutton added that he would like the four-time Olympic champion Sir Bradley Wiggins and the London 2012 gold medallist Peter Kennaugh to state their intentions over returning to the track for Rio. &quot;I know Pete&apos;s appetite for the track is still very big,&quot; Sutton said. &quot;We would welcome him with open arms, and Bradley. If Brad&apos;s definitely going to ride the track I think if he was to say sooner rather than later that is definitely a goal then that might just be that little bit of upward pressure that the other guys need.&quot; Brailsford had said that he would reassess his role with the squad as part of the review process after Cali and Boardman - part of the senior management team that guided the squad to seven gold medals in Beijing \u2013 said that Brailsford needed to choose between Sky and Great Britain. &quot;[the team] needs a boss,&quot; Boardman said. &quot;I believe Dave&apos;s making a decision on what he&apos;s going to do, but it needs a full-time boss. Dave would clearly be the best full-time boss, but if he&apos;s not going to do that, it might be better if somebody else comes in and takes the reins. &quot;He&apos;s such a character, if he&apos;s still there it&apos;s difficult for people to go in and take command, but it needs somebody like him. Shane [Sutton, the head coach] is great, a good second in command, but perhaps not the person to be the big boss. The potential is all still there. It just might need somebody to pull it all together. They&apos;re just missing an edge. If you were concerned about anything, it&apos;s the fact they&apos;re finding it difficult to pinpoint and haven&apos;t seen it coming into the event.&quot; Sutton was keen to defend his boss, with whom he has worked closely since the Athens Games. &quot;For people to start pointing the finger at Dave is unfounded. This guy&apos;s been the greatest leader in British sport history. His legacy will go on and on.&quot; Sutton was adamant both he and Brailsford have the enthusiasm and desire to revitalise the British track team. &quot;We love a battle. We&apos;ve got a real scrap on here now. I don&apos;t want to go anywhere; I probably want it more than the riders. I want to stay here, I want to take them into Rio (in 2016) and into Tokyo (in 2020), if I&apos;ve got the opportunity.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Is London going to become ever more like Tokyo, where an apartment is more of a capsule for sleeping than actually living in?"], "tags": ["UK news", "Manchester", "Evan Davis", "BBC2"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-04T11:55:00Z", "title": "Evan Davis's Mind The Gap - the view from Manchester", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2014/mar/04/evan-davis-mind-the-gap-review", "article": "Evan Davis&apos;s fascinating documentary on BBC2 last night made grim viewing north of Watford. I watched on my sofa in Manchester, feeling defensive about my adoptive home and irked about the unfair advantages bestowed on our nation&apos;s capital at such a high price to everyone else. Mind the Gap purported to find out how London has come to dominate the UK&apos;s economy, culture and politics \u2013 and at what cost to the rest of the country. As Davis kept reminding us, the capital now generates more than a fifth of Britain&apos;s income and is rapidly pulling further away from the rest of the country. &quot;The danger,&quot; he acknowledged, &quot;is that while London congratulates itself on global economic success the rest of the country feels left out of it.&quot; We only really saw &quot;the north&quot; twice in the first of two episodes. Next week Davis promises to look more closely at which other city in the UK has the best chance of rivalling London. But in the opener I was dismayed to see the north portrayed once again as the gloomy home to knackered old mills (Davis visited one particularly dilapidated specimen near Hebden Bridge in order to remind us that at the peak of the industrial revolution the north was contributing more to the UK&apos;s economy than London) and beautiful but bleak moorland (he reccied a bit of the Tour de France route in Yorkshire with a local businessman who said he would rather see 2% growth across the country than 3% in London). London, on the other hand, was portrayed as a bustling metropolis full of world class restaurants and eminently employable, ambitious and productive workers (no whingeing Tykes around here). Davis followed Glyn Britton, managing partner of creative marketing agency Albion, who commutes to the capital each week from near Stockport. The cameras showed him attending a meeting with an insurance client, where good looking young people had earnest discussions about meerkats. &quot;The meeting lasted for an hour and a half with everyone standing up!&quot; exclaimed Davis, which seemed the carry the hidden subtext: &quot;not like those lazy sadsacks in the north sitting on their bums all day.&quot; London&apos;s workers produce 29% more per hour than the rest of the country, he added later. The Today presenter also interviewed Matt Brittin, head of Google in the UK and Ireland, about the \u00a3650m new offices the firm is building by Kings Cross in London. The new headquarters will be as long as the Shard is high, taking up 700,000 square feet. Given that Google&apos;s business is online, you might think they could have set themselves up on a Hebridean island and still managed to control the internet in a borderline creepy way, but Brittin said there was no question of building in Manchester or Birmingham. &quot;The attraction of London of course, is it&apos;s by far the biggest city in the UK, it&apos;s where the most people are and therefore we&apos;ve got the biggest talent to draw from.&quot; He said Google was particularly keen on their new neighbours in Kings Cross, the Central St Martin&apos;s, the University of the Arts (and the Guardian, he didn&apos;t add). As Davis explained the concept of agglomeration economics, I mused how I would never have upped sticks to Manchester if the BBC hadn&apos;t made the first move by building Media City, and wondered why Manchester University&apos;s world class science departments didn&apos;t act as more of a magnet in pulling in high tech businesses from around the world. The thought was underlined by Davis&apos;s interview with Tan Sri Liew Kee Sinn, one of Malaysia&apos;s richest businessmen, whose firm has bought Battersea Power station in London. He plans to rebuild the power station brick by brick and then knock up thousands of luxury flats on all sides \u2013 studios are already on the market for \u00a3350,000 and the penthouses are expected to sell for \u00a318m-plus. Ludicrously, 850 of the apartments were sold off plan before one floor-to-ceiling window was fitted. Davis asked Sinn if he had ever considered building a similar development in Manchester, Sheffield or Birmingham. Giving a rather mischievous look, the Malaysian muttered something about trying to keep his shareholders happy and said that &quot;for now&quot;, London was the only place to be. Boris Johnson would say it is the megarich like Sinn who have made the capital so successful \u2013 the mayor likened the city to &quot;a gigantic undersea coelenterate which takes in and then expels&quot;, as well as a big blob of jam on a piece of Ryvita which spreads of its own volition. But watching Mind The Gap it was hard not to be sickened by the vulgar trappings of that wealth. I worry about the consequences of rising house prices for the drones rather than the Queen Bees who can afford the recently renovated town house in Mayfair Davis toured for the programme. With eight bedrooms, three kitchens and a swimming pool, the un-renovated property was bought for \u00a317.5m, just after the financial crash, and is now expected to sell for just under \u00a340m. Michael Eggerton, the estate agent, said he expected the buyer to be a foreign prince or princess who would live in the property for perhaps 30 days a year. It wasn&apos;t big or grand enough for an actual king or queen, he suggested. The house came with a set of gaudy plates hand painted in gold leaf at a cost of \u00a34,000 each \u2013 gilded in Stoke-on-Trent, according to Eggerton, providing that the north of England does still make some things. The human cost of this flood of foreign money was well illustrated by Davis&apos; explorations of the Heygate estate in Elephant and Castle, south London, which is currently being demolished. He interviewed Jimi Payne, one of the few owner occupiers in old the concrete monolith, who paid \u00a350,000 for his three-bed flat in 1997. The council compulsarily purchased it from him a few years ago for \u00a3163,000. Despite making a superficially fat &quot;profit&quot;, Payne found himself priced out of central London and ended up scraping together \u00a3187,000 to buy a one-bed place in Walthamstow, in north-east London. Three-bed properties on the revamped Heygate estate are already being advertised to overseas buyers for \u00a3700,000. London&apos;s population is projected to reach ten million by 2031. Where is everyone going to live? Are more people going to be joining Glyn Britton commuting down from the north on HS2 if it&apos;s ever actually built? Is London going to become ever more like Tokyo, where an apartment is more of a capsule for sleeping than actually living in? As the credits rolled, someone on Twitter pointed me in the direction of a story which broke in the north yesterday. TransPennine Express, which operates some of the north&apos;s busiest cross country commuter routes, including Manchester to Leeds and Hull, has quietly announced plans to move nine of its trains down south to Chiltern Rail in the south-east, apparently to plug a shortfall down there. The Manchester to Middlesbrough morning route is already the third most overcrowded in the country, with 23% of passengers standing during busy times. But nevermind. The greedy coelenterate of the south must get priority."}, {"sentences": ["Russian power brokers live in Kensington and the Upper West Side, and ski in Courchevel, while shares in Russian businesses are bought and sold in Moscow&apos;s exchange on behalf of investors in Tokyo, New York and Hong Kong."], "tags": ["Vladimir Putin", "Ukraine", "Europe", "World news", "Russia"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-04T21:19:50Z", "title": "Strengths and weaknesses on all sides in the Ukraine crisis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/04/strengths-weaknesses-all-sides-in-ukraine-crisis", "article": "Vladimir Putin&apos;s first television performance since pro-Russian forces took over government buildings in Crimea on Thursday coincided with a standing down of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border and a hope that a European war had, for a day, been averted. Aware that his press conference would be scrutinised by domestic and international audiences, the Russian leader was by turns emollient, authoritative and fantastical. It is worth examining what he said in some detail. The source of the Ukraine crisis was, according to Mr Putin, an &quot;unconstitutional coup&quot; that toppled the elected president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych. The Russian leader laid the blame for this putsch on western-backed fascists whose moves were orchestrated by the US, the EU or both. Since Mr Yanukovych had asked for Russian help in a letter sent by the former Ukrainian president on Saturday, the door remained open to further adventures inside his western neighbour&apos;s borders: Russia would, Mr Putin said, intercede in eastern Ukraine if he felt there was a threat. Mr Yanukovych was the only legitimate leader of the country, so Russia would refuse to recognise the result of the forthcoming election on 25\u00a0March. At times Mr Putin became lost in flights of apparent fancy: the mask-wearing troops who had seized Crimea were not Russians but in fact Crimean self-defence forces who, he suggested, bought their new-look Russian uniforms in local shops. These men had taken control in a bid to prevent attacks by bands of revolutionary fascists \u2013 none of whom the world&apos;s media has yet seen or heard from. The interim Ukrainian government will be struggling to interpret these rambling statements of Russian intent. Some of what Mr Putin said is true: the European Union carries a share of responsibility for what occurred \u2013 it was the offer of an EU association agreement, which Mr Yanukovych&apos;s government rejected, that sparked pro-Brussels demonstrations. It is also true that there were groups of far-right activists among the protesters. But few impartial observers would argue that the events in the Maidan constituted a coup or anything other than a revolution against a corrupt president. And if Mr Yanukovych is the only legitimate leader of Ukraine, why did Mr Putin bury him with the words &quot;I think he has no political future. I told him that&quot;? What is clear is that Mr Putin is intent on keeping Kiev weak, even at some risk to Russia. His actions have already cost his country dear. It has been isolated internationally, with its traditional ally China expressing scepticism, and its G8 status is threatened. If the Crimean peninsula is indeed annexed in the long term, Moscow will gain an angry new population of reluctant Ukrainians and Muslim Tatars. And as Mr Putin pointed out, the economic consequences are already being felt. This is not the cold war. The world is no longer split into eastern and western blocs divided by a separating iron curtain. Russian power brokers live in Kensington and the Upper West Side, and ski in Courchevel, while shares in Russian businesses are bought and sold in Moscow&apos;s exchange on behalf of investors in Tokyo, New York and Hong Kong. On Monday Moscow&apos;s stock lost a staggering 11% of its value while the rouble fell to a record low, prompting the Russian central bank to spend at least $7bn supporting it. Capital flight, economic sanctions, asset freezes and travel restrictions could affect Russia&apos;s power structure in ways they would not have conceived of in 1968. But if the interlinkage of world economies is a weakness for Putin, it is also a weakness for Europe. Germany needs Russian gas and, as was eloquently explained by a briefing document photographed in Downing Street stating that Britain should &quot;not support, for now, trade sanctions \u2026 or close London&apos;s financial centre to Russians&quot;, the City wants Russian business. If European governments are serious about helping Ukraine find a way through Russia&apos;s interference, they will have to think hard about where their priorities lie."}, {"sentences": ["Sydney has now dropped to fifth place and Melbourne is in equal sixth, along with Geneva, Caracas and Tokyo.", "Singapore also bumped Tokyo out of top spot following a drop in the value of the yen since last year.", "Tokyo 10."], "tags": ["Australia news"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-05T01:28:04Z", "title": "Sydney and Melbourne hold their places among 10 most expensive cities", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/sydney-and-melbourne-still-ranked-among-worlds-10-most-expensive-cities", "article": "Sydney and Melbourne still rank in the top 10 most expensive cities in the world although they have dropped a few places thanks to the weaker Australia dollar, according to the Economist\u2019s 2014 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey.

Historical grievances have always played a role in regional tensions. But longstanding issues \u2013 particularly over Japanese wartime brutality in China \u2013 are being invoked increasingly frequently and explicitly. The news that Japan is considering revising its apology for enslaving Chinese and South Korean women in military brothels follows inflammatory remarks from public figures, including the head of the state broadcaster. Meanwhile, China has approved the establishment of national memorial days to commemorate the Nanjing massacre and Japan&apos;s defeat in the second world war. Chinese officials reportedly want President Xi Jinping&apos;s visit to Berlin next month to focus on the war - underlining Beijing&apos;s attempts to contrast German contrition with what it sees as Japan&apos;s lack of remorse. And on Wednesday, China&apos;s premier told the National People&apos;s Congress: &quot;We will safeguard the victory of World War II and the postwar international order, and will not allow anyone to reverse the course of history.&quot; Leaders have also drawn pointed parallels between past and present, with the Japanese prime minister, Shinz\u00f5 Abe, suggesting bilateral relations were akin to those between the UK and Germany before the first world war. The Filipino president, Benigno Aquino, took it a step further by comparing China&apos;s rise to that of Nazi Germany. For Beijing, the more potent parallel in the light of hawkish Abe&apos;s ascendance is not 1914 but 1894 \u2013 the beginning of Japan&apos;s first war against it. The historian Wang Zheng, of Seton Hall University in the US, said problems such as the territorial dispute over the Diaoyu or Senkaku islands in the East China Sea were deeply rooted in history. But he argued that China and Japan also see past and future as closely tied, to a degree that western counterparts do not. &quot;Unfortunately, they have quite different understandings of history \u2026 Both sides consider themselves peace-loving and the other side as aggressive,&quot; he said. While a new museum in northern China commemorates the man who assassinated Korea&apos;s Japanese governor in 1909 as a patriotic martyr, Tokyo calls him a terrorist. &quot;Eastern nations have a habit of referring to history in diplomatic disputes \u2026 They like to make historical stories serve the present reality,&quot; said Zhang Lifan, an independent Beijing-based historian. He argued that highlighting some aspects of the second world war allowed China to remind the US of previous enmity with its now ally Japan. Wang&apos;s book, Never Forget National Humiliation, explores the broader issue of the Communist party&apos;s extensive and sophisticated use of nationalism to legitimate its rule. The concept of a &quot;century of humiliation&quot; at the hands of foreign powers \u2013 from the opium wars, which began in the 1840s, to Japan&apos;s defeat \u2013 has been central to nation-building, he said. &quot;To have the country get back to its former glories is the basic motivation of China&apos;s history,&quot; he said. While Mao Zedong proclaimed that &quot;the Chinese people have stood up&quot;, it was after the student protests of 1989 that Beijing systematically built up its patriotic education programme. Wang noted that this message cannot be dismissed solely as propaganda: atrocities took place, within living memory. Victims and their families are understandably angry to see Abe visit the Yasukuni shrine, which honours Japanese war dead, including several convicted war criminals. Nor are Communist leaders simply using this view of history cynically: it affects their own attitudes, emotions, judgment and understanding. The frictions with Japan in part reflect a similar message on Abe&apos;s part of a return to historical greatness. He has suggested his country needs to end &quot;masochistic&quot; feelings of guilt and his vision of national rejuvenation includes revising the constitution, under which it renounces war. He has promoted rightwingers to prominent roles \u2013 such as at the state broadcaster \u2013 and Shogo Suzuki, an expert on Sino-Japanese reconciliation, at Manchester University, noted that the right&apos;s rise may also have emboldened revisionists to speak out. Such comments do not reflect the mainstream, Suzuki argued. &quot;The number of Japanese people who think Japan did a lot of harm to Asian people has actually increased over the years,&quot; he said. But many view Japan&apos;s aggression within the context of its race against western imperial powers. There is also a sense of exasperation that other countries are not held to account in the same way, Suzuki said: Tokyo has apologised for its record, while western countries have barely acknowledged their brutal colonial histories. And Japan, too, suffered wartime trauma \u2013 the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Others point out that while Chinese leaders urge others to face the past, they suppress discussion of politically instigated domestic disasters such as the great famine that began in the late 50s and the Cultural Revolution. &quot;China criticises Japan for distorting history, but the party distorts history too,&quot; said Zhang. While wrangling over the past appears to be driving the two countries further apart, Wang believes honest discussion could bring them closer together. He cited a joint history textbook produced by academics from South Korea, China and Japan \u2013 a project that the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, has suggested could be built on officially. Where the scholars could not agree, they presented their differences in the text. &quot;Even if they can&apos;t agree on everything, they should be able to have a dialogue about the past,&quot; said Wang. &quot;It&apos;s not just the responsibility of the government, but of scholars and educators. Otherwise, this cycle of hatred will continue.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["He spent a month learning about the cuisine while working in Tokyo in 2012."], "tags": ["Japanese food and drink", "Chefs", "Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-05T13:02:00Z", "title": "Japanese cuisine: how washoku is taking over Britain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/05/japenese-cuisine-washoko-unesco-britain-chefs", "article": "Few words trip so pleasingly off the tongue as washoku.

They have a completely different approach to food,&quot; he says. &quot;They are taught to bring out the essence of an ingredient. It seems very simple, but some of the methods are quite complicated. They use colour, texture, scent and presentation to enhance the diner&apos;s sense of seasonality and transience.&quot; Chef and food writer Valentine Warner is another fan: &quot;Everything they do with food is sincere and considered,&quot; he says &quot;I think it&apos;s going to replace Scandinavian cooking as the next in food.&quot; It often takes years for a Japanese cook to perfect one particular skill, whether it is making the perfect noodle broth or cutting sashimi that melts in the mouth. There is a measured ritual in every movement, and perfection is demanded from ingredients, which means that the quality of produce in the UK has often been a problem. Yoshinori Ishii, executive chef at Michelin-starred Umu in London, explains: &quot;When I first arrived here, the fresh fish tasted pungent to me, and even the vegetables varied enormously in quality.&quot;     Sashimi grouper and sliced radish with sea tangle. Photograph: Shizuo Kambayashi/AP    The answer, for him, lay in treating Britain like a nascent Japan \u2013 he transformed his supply chain. He taught Cornish fishermen to catch fish the Japanese way, ikejime \u2013 spiking the fish in the brain for instant death and to prevent the release of certain chemicals (this gives the fish a sweeter taste). He found Exmoor caviar and sourced Japanese vegetables grown in Lewes by NamaYasai, which supplies everything from daikon to edamame. Robin Williams, NamaYasai&apos;s organic farmer, has seen his business grow steadily since he and his Japanese wife began in 2005. &quot;You&apos;d be surprised how many top chefs, such as Brett Graham at The Ledbury, use Japanese ingredients,&quot; he says. And rightly so: Japanese aubergines have a delicate skin; kabocha pumpkins are exquisite roasted; and kabu, little white turnips, are so sweet you can eat them raw. Another chef Williams supplies, Marc Bolger from Circa Events in Brighton, explains: &quot;NamaYasai follow the Japanese practice of picking things the same day you&apos;re going to eat them. It makes them taste amazing.&quot; Once you look, you find the influence of washoku in the most unexpected places. Take the very British-sounding William Curley, a chocolatier. Bite into one of his chocolates and you might find a Japanese black vinegar or cherry blossom ganache. &quot;We&apos;ve found that the subtlety of Japanese flavourings really enhances the taste of chocolate,&quot; says Suzue Curley, his fellow patissier and Japanese partner. They are planning to offer &quot;yuzu gateau, kinako shortbread and matcha Mont Blanc&quot; later this year, with sake pairings. The drinking of sake is as integral a part of washoku as wine is to French cuisine, and Satomi Dosseur, sake sommelier at Zuma, believes that its reputation in Britain is changing. &quot;Many of our customers used to think sake was something strong that you drank hot in a small cup, but now many love it even more than wine, especially chilled or at body heat,&quot; she says. And as our awareness of this wonderful cuisine grows, so do the opportunities to learn. The recent launch of Sozai, Britain&apos;s first Japanese cooking school, and an upcoming series of sake seminars in London and Paris are just the start of what Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to Britain, has declared &quot;the year of washoku&quot;. Time, then, to brush up on your skills.

In Britain, traders buying and selling bitcoin no longer have to pay VAT on their purchases of the currency, but are instead liable for capital gains tax or income tax if they make a profit on their speculation. It is unknown how many bitcoin traders did, in fact, pay VAT on their purchases of bitcoin before HMRC changed its official advice. \u2022 Bitcoin bank Flexcoin closes after hack attack"}, {"sentences": ["Singapore and New York will leapfrog Tokyo and Hong Kong to take second and third places."], "tags": ["Real estate", "Rich lists", "Business", "London", "UK news", "New York", "US news", "World news", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-05T19:40:00Z", "title": "London retains crown as favourite city of world's ultra-rich", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/05/london-favourite-city-world-ultra-rich-new-york-asia", "article": "Booming stock markets and global economic recovery continued the seemingly inexorable rise in the numbers of the world&apos;s super-rich last year, according to a report that predicts their ranks will swell by nearly 30% to 215,000 over the next decade.  The world&apos;s so-called &quot;ultra high net worth individuals&quot; \u2013 those with $30m (\u00a321m) or more in assets apart from their main home \u2013 number 167,669, according to a report from estate agents Knight Frank \u2013 up 59% over the past decade.  Roughly equal to the population of the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea \u2013 and many of them do indeed have a place there \u2013 they control more than $20tn in assets \u2013 more than the national output of the US and Germany put together.  London was home to more UHNWIs (4,224) than any other city in 2013 and this will still be the case a decade later, with nearly 5,000 expected to be living there, according to the report.  Singapore and New York will leapfrog Tokyo and Hong Kong to take second and third places. The top six cities have more UHNWIs living in them than Latin America and the Middle East combined. Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank, said the cluster of businesses, international appeal, heritage and democratic institutions in London and New York are not easy to replicate. But, he said, &quot;London wins over New York: It&apos;s more diverse. There are more nationalities living here and it&apos;s a more global city.&quot; Britain is the number one destination for those seeking a new domicile, although the US is still more popular with the Asian wealth elite. Russia has seen an outflow of ultra-rich individuals to places like London, New York and Dubai.  Pippa Malmgren, ex-economic adviser to George Bush, said: &quot;I would argue that the UK has now emerged as the world&apos;s most attractive residence for non-domiciles. The crackdown on tax havens in Switzerland has removed these old options for new capital. As a result, there has been a huge influx of global capital into the UK \u2013 and this is reflected in many things, including property prices.&quot; In coming decades both London and New York could be eclipsed by Asian cities, where luxury property markets are booming.  The numbers of super-rich are forecast to double in Africa and India in the next decade. In China the ranks of the ultra-wealthy will soar by 80%. Bailey said: &quot;History, location and their long established wealth mean London and New York&apos;s positions look unassailable, at least for now. It is further down our leader board that the real city wars are being waged. The main battleground is Asia, where a handful of locations are slugging it out in the hope of establishing a clear lead as the region&apos;s alpha urban hub.&quot; Asian cities, led by Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, experienced the fastest growth in property prices last year, but some of the cities affected by the 2008 downturn \u2013 such as Dublin, where prime property soared 17.5% last year \u2013 are now on the road to recovery.  As well as swanky estate agents and yacht builders, all this is music to the ears of the big jewellers, auction houses and most prestigious wine estates. The ultra-rich like to spend their wealth on jewellery, especially in emerging markets, followed by art, watches, wine and cars, a survey for the report found.  Bailey said space travel and asteroid mining were hot investments, with 70 billionaires putting money into space or sub-orbital flights. Sir Richard Branson, whose Virgin Galactic plans its first space flight this year, holds out the prospect of travelling from London to Sydney in a couple of hours \u2013 allowing Chinese or Indian investors to pop over to their Tuscan farmhouse on a whim.  How they spend it Superyachts and private jetsSuperyachts \u2013 defined as those longer than 60 metres \u2013 and private jets are the preserve of the seriously rich and last April saw the launch of the world&apos;s biggest, the 180-metre Azzam. With a reputed price tag of \u00a3400m, it is widely understood to have been built for Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Emir of Abu Dhabi. The market for smaller yachts is only just returning to normal. Private jet sales also bounced back in the second half of 2013.  Luxury brandsBoston Consulting Group calculated earlier this year that the world&apos;s wealthiest spent \u00a31.1tn on luxury goods and services. Very little of that money would have been spent in Africa but the continent is expected to see the greatest growth in spending, along with the Middle East. Growth in luxury brand outlets is slowing in Asia, as the Chinese government cracks down on conspicuous consumption and many rich residents shop abroad.  Rare stamps and coinsCoins are becoming more popular in China, India and Russia. Gold Roman coins are particularly sought after. A 1794 US &quot;Flowing Hair Silver Dollar&quot; fetched a record $10m at auction in New York a year ago. Rare stamp values are also rising: The Stanley Gibbons China 200 rare stamp index climbed 36% between 2011 and 2012. Classic carsClassic car values are up 28% over the past 12 months, according to the Historic Automobile Group&apos;s Top Index. Not only the most famous marques are doing well: one of the biggest movers last year was Japan&apos;s first supercar, a Toyota 2000 GT from the late 1960s. Jewellery and artGold prices are falling, but the best untreated stones \u2013 particularly &apos;fancy&apos; diamonds and other coloured stones \u2013 are fetching record sums. Natural saltwater pearls, amber, coral and jade are also in demand. Contemporary and postwar works set new records last year, according to Art Market research: Francis Bacon&apos;s Three Studies of Lucian Freud sold for $143m at Christies in New York in October \u2013 a record for any artwork. \u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 6 March 2014 to clarify that it is the Chinese government which has been cracking down on conspicuous consumption."}, {"sentences": ["Here are some other findings from the release:   Five countries are represented in the top 20: the US, UK, Japan, Canada and Switzerland and overall 20 countries are represented in the top 100  The University of Tokyo at 11th place, is the highest ranking university outside of the UK or US (down two places on last year\u2019s rankings) Three institutions included in the reputation rankings fail to make the top 200 of the Times Higher Education World University Rankings: Moscow State, Middle East Technical and S\u00e3o Paulo King\u2019s College London is Europe\u2019s biggest riser \u2013 up from 61-70 to joint 43rd   You can see the full 2014 world reputation rankings below, we have also included the 2013, 2012 and 2011 positions in the downloadable spreadsheet which also contains breakdowns by country."], "tags": ["UK news", "World news", "Education", "Higher education", "Asia Pacific", "Australia news", "US news", "Students", "Harvard University", "MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Yale University", "Princeton University", "University of Cambridge", "University of Oxford", "Imperial College London", "London School of Economics and Political Science", "London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine", "UCL (University College London)", "University of Manchester", "University of Edinburgh"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-06T11:16:33Z", "title": "World's top 100 universities 2014: their reputations ranked by Times Higher Education", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/mar/06/worlds-top-100-universities-2014-reputations-ranked-times-higher-education", "article": "Harvard university has retained its number one spot on the Times Higher Education\u2019s world reputation ranking of universities, with US institutions taking eight of the top 10 positions. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford follow to make up the top three. Cambridge and Oxford are both down one place on last year\u2019s rankings which puts them in fourth and fifth place respectively. The University of California, Berkeley, Princeton, Yale, California Institute of Technology and the University of California, Los Angeles take the remaining places in the top 10.  The US, with 46 institutions in the top 100, is named as an \u201dundisputed superpower when it comes to university brands\u201d by the creators of the list. In the release, they also highlight what they call \u201cworrying evidence of reputational decline among UK institutions.\u201d       As in the past with these rankings, the UK has the second highest number of top 100 representatives and they\u2019ve actually increased since last year - up one from nine in 2013. But the Times Higher Education argue, the UK\u2019s overall showing has worsened since 2011, when it had 12 representatives and warns of \u201cpolarisation between the \u2018golden triangle\u2019 (London, Oxford and Cambridge) and the rest of the UK.\u201d Six London universities make the top 100 - more than any other city in the world.  Both Imperial College and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) have moved up a place, to 13th and 24th respectively while University College London (UCL) has dropped five places to 25th. King\u2019s College London is one of the most improved institutions in this year\u2019s tables, rising from the 61-70 band to joint 43rd. The University of Edinburgh remains at 46th position, while the University of Manchester has dropped from 47th in 2013 to the 51-60 band. The London Business School and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine are both new entries to the list.  Commenting on the rankings, Bahram Bekhradnia, president of the UK\u2019s Higher Education Policy Institute, said:  Given the UK\u2019s size, this survey suggests we are still punching above our weight as far as research performance is concerned: at more than four times our size, the US has only around four times the number of universities in the top 100. What is worrying though is the apparent deterioration in the reputation of a number of our universities. At a time when despite economic problems others have sought to protect their research investment, we have seen a real-terms decline, which could amount to over 20 per cent in 10 years. We should expect our research output to follow: it is difficult to imagine why not. \u201cWhile reputation surveys do not tell you anything objective about quality, they nevertheless do reflect visibility and awareness by others of a university\u2019s activities: academics are likely to be more aware of those with whom they\u2019ve recently collaborated, those with recent relevant articles and those presenting at conferences. So a reputation survey such as this is likely to be a harbinger of things to come and a predictor of subsequent trends.  The rankings also highlight a big improvement for Germany which now has six universities represented in the top 100 - the third highest representation in the list behind the US and the UK.   The annual world reputation rankings, a subsidiary of the Times Higher Education world university rankings, are based based on the results of the Academic Reputation Survey carried out by Ipsos MediaCT for Thomson Reuters.

He tweets about everything from his toenail falling off to &quot;giving it large in Croatia&quot; and posts pictures of his coffee cup decorated with a smiley face because the &quot;Starbucks lady 100% fancied me&quot;. So far, so your average 18-year-old boy in 2014. That coffee comment might not have been just adolescent bravado. Marr is likely to turn heads, even of the most harried barista: he&apos;s 1.9m (6ft 2in) tall, blond with green eyes, a cheeky grin, a baby face with added cheekbones. He&apos;s also a male model. On the books of Next, one of London&apos;s biggest agencies (they also look after supers including Arizona Muse and Malgosia Bela), today he&apos;s on his way around London for appointments with Longchamp, Burberry and Margaret Howell. These are castings \u2013 open model auditions \u2013 for shows at London Collections: Men, the menswear fashion week that takes place in January. He is on his way from his agency&apos;s office on Old Street to a casting for a Longchamp presentation around the corner. Once inside, the world of the male model starts to take shape. Five or six other boys, all accompanied by the telltale &quot;book&quot; \u2013 a black A4 portfolio with photos of previous work inside \u2013 and regulation cheekbones, sit on benches in a reception area, staring straight ahead in silence. This is not an industry where friends are easily made. Marr, who also plays football semi-professionally, says &quot;it&apos;s almost as competitive. I have a couple of model friends but not loads. You don&apos;t tend to go around together&quot;. When Marr&apos;s name is called, another aspect of his day-to-day reveals itself \u2013 quite literally. Marr strips off to be photographed in one of the brand&apos;s suits. He&apos;s wearing pants with the Superman logo on the waistband. He&apos;s still just a boy. He may have started his career with an exclusive on the Calvin Klein catwalk in Milan, but he&apos;s inexperienced. &quot;I have done shoots when I have to pretend it&apos;s summer, standing in my pants, been in a bath and asked to blow bubbles,&quot; he says, with a smile at the mysteries of the industry. Following Marr \u2013 chosen at random from a selection of new faces \u2013 is a study in one of fashion&apos;s least high-profile industries. Every move of the zeitgeist&apos;s current favourite model Cara Delevingne is followed in its minutiae, but her male counterparts are left well alone. Ask a passerby to name a male model and they would probably say Derek Zoolander, the antihero of Ben Stiller&apos;s hilarious 2001 spoof of the industry. While the 80s produced a couple of models that edged towards household name \u2013 Tyrese, Marcus Schenkenberg \u2013 the trend hasn&apos;t continued. The idea of a stable of male supermodels equivalent to Naomi, Kate, Claudia and Christy seems remote, sure, but men&apos;s fashion is on the up. Estimated to be worth \u00a310.4bn in 2013, it&apos;s grown 12% in the past five years, and a study by Mintel suggests this will continue, with growth to 2017 predicted at 11%. In line with this change, the\u00a0interest in male models is also growing. Forbes magazine\u00a0now publishes a\u00a0list of the highest-paid male models alongside its one for women, and there are a couple of names on there \u2013 David Gandy, Sean O&apos;Pry \u2013 that might just resonate outside of the\u00a0industry. The March cover of US men&apos;s magazine Details\u00a0features 10 of the biggest names working in men&apos;s fashion today.     Tommy getting changed backstage at the Superdry show    Male models are still small fry compared with the female of the species, though. The combined total earnings of the top 10 male models \u2013 \u00a34.85m \u2013 is dwarfed by their female counterparts, who earned more than \u00a350m. Sarah Vickery, Marr&apos;s agent at Next, is quite upfront about it. &quot;It&apos;s the only industry, apart from prostitution, where men get paid less,&quot; she says. Vickery \u2013 who has the unenviable task of organising the lives and careers of a bunch of teenage boys \u2013 is sanguine. &quot;The day rate for a catalogue model is around \u00a33,500 for a guy, but it&apos;s \u00a38,000 for a girl,&quot; she says. &quot;There&apos;s not really much you can do about that.&quot;            Patrick McKenzie, who began modelling in the noughties was paid $500 (\u00a3307) for appearing in a Gucci campaign, while the girls &quot;were probably on $10,000. I didn&apos;t care \u2013 I thought it was a fortune&quot;. Fifteen years later, Marr is resigned to the difference, too. &quot;Unless you&apos;re David Gandy, you don&apos;t earn as much money as the girls,&quot; he says, sat on the 55 bus from Old Street as it lurches around another corner on its way to Hackney Central. &quot;I guess it kind of makes sense \u2013 there&apos;s a lot more focus on girls&apos; fashion.&quot; Indeed. Menswear&apos;s \u00a310.4bn worth has nothing on the\u00a0women&apos;s industry, which was estimated at about \u00a320.7bn in 2012. This massive disparity could be down to the fact that, for an average Joe who likes fashion, an interest in models is not an extension of being interested in clothes. According to Kevin Braddock, editor-in-chief of style magazine Sleek (which published a special on masculinity earlier this year), &quot;Any heterosexual guy found staring at another guy is going to have an elbow in the ribs\u00a0from his friends.&quot; While society sees a direct link between female models and how young girls feel about their looks, Braddock believes their male counterparts have less impact on their sex&apos;s self-esteem.     Tommy trying on a jacket at the Superdry show    &quot;I think most men would dismiss a male model as &apos;just a model&apos;,&quot; he says, &quot;blank and cold-looking. Men are less interested in what other men look like,&quot; adding that&apos;s why sportsmen often star in ad campaigns: &quot;They care about someone like Theo Walcott because he&apos;s part of their wider belief system or allegiances.&quot; If neither supermodel fame nor house-buying riches are on the cards for most male models, why do they do it? Unlike women in the industry, many seem to have second jobs. Marr has a Saturday job in Hollister \u2013 proving staff at the store really do have model looks \u2013 and others I talk to work as a graphic designer, photographic studio manager and a DJ. This is often a necessity, rather than a sideline. The website payscale.com reported last year that a moderately successful female model would be on \u00a329,000, while a male model would be on \u00a316,000. Doing the maths, Linda Evangelista \u2013 who famously said she wouldn&apos;t get out of bed for less than $10,000 \u2013 wouldn&apos;t even roll over for \u00a316,000 a year. Still, the appeal seems to be \u2013 for teenagers like Marr at least \u2013 earning enough from doing relatively little. &quot;Before modelling, I was scavenging off my mum,&quot; he says. &quot;I genuinely don&apos;t know what I would have done if this hadn&apos;t happened. I might have worked with my dad in the garage.&quot;     Tommy makes his way to a casting session on the tube    &quot;A successful guy is never going to reach the heights of Gisele [B\u00fcndchen, the world&apos;s highest-paid model, who earned more than \u00a325m last year],&quot; says Ryan Frost, a men&apos;s booker at London agency, Models 1, &quot;but if you&apos;re an 18-year-old kid, the money isn&apos;t bad.&quot; Marr models only part-time, but he&apos;s giving it a good go. Now at the casting for Common \u2013 a Swedish brand making its debut at LC:M \u2013 in an industrial estate in Hackney Wick, he&apos;s struggling to get his footballer&apos;s thighs into regulation skinny trousers. Not that he lets that trouble him much \u2013 for a young model, it is all about casting your net wide. Rejection from one designer might mean open arms from another. He has high hopes for Burberry and Tom Ford, both of whom tend to use more athletic body types. &quot;You have to be quite resilient,&quot; he says, on the walk to the train station, checking his phone for\u00a0his next appointment. Marr&apos;s look \u2013 healthy, fresh-faced and with good bone structure \u2013 works in his favour. Adam Hindle, a casting director who works across Tom Ford to Damir Doma, says the aesthetic changes depending on the client but &quot;it has been more grownup over the last few seasons&quot;. &quot;People want healthy at the moment,&quot; Vickery adds, &quot;kind of like Bruce Weber but less bulky.&quot; Marr, with a bit of fake tan, would fit right in. Even with all this on his side, Marr should be prepared for a shockingly short career. Frost says out of 10 boys that\u00a0Models 1 might initially sign, only three or four move from new faces to the main board \u2013 where established models are grouped \u2013 and therefore stand the test of time. Even then, an editorial model \u2013 a boy who has an indie rather than boyband look \u2013 could be modelling for only four years.     Tommy (second left) waits with fellow models for a casting session at Gieves and Hawkes    As with the women, male models are often young and naive when they start to work in a grownup industry. This can spell classic &quot;too much too young&quot; trouble. Patrick McKenzie, the Gucci model, started working in 1999 after he was spotted by a casting agent. He started at the top. The California native&apos;s first job was in front of Mario Testino&apos;s lens, paired with supermodel Jacquetta Wheeler. For a 19-year-old boy, it felt great. &quot;Guys are happy to be an object of desire,&quot; he says. But he quit after five years because he felt overwhelmed by it. &quot;You&apos;re in your formative years, legitimately an adult but really you&apos;re just out of high school. And living like that, it really does a number on you because there&apos;s no accountability other than turning up on time.&quot; Now 33, he&apos;s since rejoined the industry, but\u00a0works as a film-maker. He&apos;s art-directed videos for big names such as Taylor Swift, and he is currently working on a documentary about the alienation of the male model experience. It\u00a0was partly prompted by the suicide of several friends, including Josh Sangster, a Canadian model who died after a work trip to Tokyo. McKenzie is keen to stress that modelling wasn&apos;t to blame for the tragedies, but says that it&apos;s an easy industry for young men to disappear without a trace. &quot;These guys had some serious emotional and psychological issues before becoming a model, but the lifestyle is certainly not conducive to a man prone to depression,&quot; he says. &quot;There wasn&apos;t anything unusual about staying in bed for a week or doing copious amounts of drugs to escape.&quot;     David Gandy in an ad for Dolce & Gabbana \u2026 Gandy is one of very few 'big name' male models    While Marr seems too much of a happy chap to succumb to this dark side, he says modelling has made him grow up. &quot;I used to be a right little shit,&quot; he admits with a smile. The new mature Marr does still make a few mistakes. After those December castings, he&apos;s in Tenerife with his mates during the crucial post-Christmas flurry when designers such as Tom Ford and Burberry \u2013 the big guns \u2013 are on the hunt for models. Back in London in time for the shows, he is booked for just two \u2013 Bobby Abley, the young London designer who is part of the MAN initiative, and Superdry, clothier to the masses. Watching him walk in Abley&apos;s show \u2013 with bunny ears and cartoon-printed top \u2013 followed by the hoodies and jeans of Superdry is a surreal snapshot of 24 hours in the life of a male model. It turns out, though, it&apos;s one Marr is turning his back on, at least for the moment. He has been signed elsewhere \u2013 to play as a fullback for League Two side Chesterfield. &quot;This is my last show for six months,&quot; he says, backstage at Superdry. &quot;I hope I can come back to it.&quot; Vickery has little doubt he can. &quot;He&apos;s a classic cool boy, so\u00a0has longevity,&quot; she says. &quot;The football might even add to his appeal \u2013 clients these days want personality.&quot; To be a male model seems like a transient stage\u00a0in a young man&apos;s life, a moment in front of the camera on the way to something else. The\u00a0prize might not be as greenbacked as Gisele&apos;s but \u2013 if the floodlights of a football pitch don&apos;t come calling \u2013 other rewards are certainly theirs for the\u00a0taking. One thing&apos;s for sure, though: a male Cara Delevingne won&apos;t be on the scene any time soon. \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 7 March 2014 to correct the spelling of two names.

The banks of the River Liffey are hosting a resurgent property market that is exceeded only by Jakarta, Auckland, Bali and Christchurch, said estate agency Knight Frank. Its report on global house prices found that Dublin property prices rose faster than Los Angeles, Tokyo and Dubai, with values increasing by 17.5% in 2013 compared with the previous year. However, a population scarred by the consequences of its last property boom \u2013 a \u20ac67.5bn (\u00a356bn) rescue loan from a trio of international lenders \u2013 is wary of signs of a house market recovery. A group representing thousands of Irish mortgage holders has raised concerns over the price increases, pointing to thousands of repossessed properties that are not on the market and whose absence from estate agents&apos; windows could be holding up the prices of houses that are being sold. David Hall, a co-founder of the Irish Mortgage Holders Association campaign group, said the latest figures on mortgage arrears this year showed that there were 1,600 empty properties held by the Irish banks that were not on the market. He also pointed out that Nama \u2013 the state agency which bought thousands of properties abandoned by banks and builders after the 2008 financial crash \u2013 has held back 14,000 properties from entering the market. As a consequence, house prices are higher, said Hall, who added that price increases for commercial and domestic properties in Dublin had been &quot;very patchy&quot; as some homeowners continued to suffer from the after effects of the credit crunch. Property prices in rich Dublin postcodes such as D14 may have increased by 22% last year, but tens of thousands of Irish mortgage holders are still in arrears and the hikes in the cost of a house are restricted to the richer suburbs of the Irish capital, especially south of the Liffey. House prices are surging in affluent areas of south Dublin such as Clonskeagh, with a three-bed bungalow in the area fetching \u20ac740,000 \u2013 an increase of two-thirds on a similar property nine months earlier. Outside the capital, property prices remain stagnant at best. A 10-bedroom house in Monaghan, near the border with Northern Ireland, is being sold for \u20ac90,000. Yet for a small country such as the Republic it is the scale of the mortgage arrears which will temper any talk about a new property boom. By the end of 2013 the total value of mortgage arrears in the Republic was \u20ac2.1bn, including \u20ac1.8bn owned by borrowers who had fallen behind in their payments for more than a year. Hall also referred to a report by the global ratings agency Fitch, which predicted further mortgage repossessions this year. Fitch said one in five houses where mortgages had been in arrears for more than three months could be repossessed. There are still 700 &quot;ghost estates&quot;, the name given to empty private housing estates built during the boom, many of them mini-new towns constructed around the edges of greater Dublin. Hailing Ireland&apos;s exit from its bailout in December, the country&apos;s finance minister, Michael Noonan, said the nation had emerged from its worst crisis since the potato famine. Warning that there must be no more debt-fuelled property sprees, he said: &quot;We can&apos;t go mad again.&quot; The Knight Frank report is raising concerns that the wrong kind of economic recovery is on the way, with thousands of homeowners still struggling on the sidelines."}, {"sentences": ["A girl holds a placard during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Tokyo on 11 September 2011, six months on from the devastating Japan tsunami."], "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Fukushima", "World news", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "Environment", "Cancer research", "Medical research", "Science", "Cancer", "Health", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-09T19:34:20Z", "title": "Fukushima's children at centre of debate over rates of thyroid cancer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/09/fukushima-children-debate-thyroid-cancer-japan-disaster-nuclear-radiation", "article": "When doctors found several tiny nodules on his 12-year-old daughter&apos;s thyroid gland, Toshiyuki Kamei refused to let parental fear get the better of him. The symptoms are not uncommon, and the probability that they will develop into something more serious is low. Yet Kamei can be forgiven for occasional moments of doubt: his daughter, Ayako, is one of almost 400,000 children who were living in Fukushima on 11 March 2011 \u2013 the start of the world&apos;s worst nuclear accident for a quarter of a century. &quot;As a parent, of course I worry, but my daughter is taking it in her stride,&quot; said Kamei, who lives in Iwaki, a city about 40km (25 miles) south of the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. &quot;She doesn&apos;t tell me if it&apos;s on her mind, and I&apos;ve decided not to ask her about it.&quot; Three years after the plant suffered a triple meltdown that released huge quantities of radiation into the atmosphere, medical authorities in Fukushima prefecture are reporting a significant rise in the number of thyroid cancer cases among local children and young adults.     A doctor conducts a thyroid examination on four-year-old Maria Sakamoto in Iwaki town. Photograph: Damir Sagolj/Reuters    The results have prompted a bitter debate about the potential effects the meltdown had on the health of hundreds of thousands of children. Either the higher-than-normal rates of thyroid cancer are connected to the nuclear accident, or they are the inevitable result of a testing regime unprecedented in size, and conducted using state-of-the-art medical equipment. Last month, the number of confirmed and suspected cases of thyroid cancer among people aged 18 or below at the time of the accident rose to 75, compared with 59 at the end of last September. Of the current total, 33 cases have been confirmed as cancer. Under the guidance of Fukushima Medical University, local health authorities have so far tested 254,000 out of 375,000 Fukushima children and adolescents, who will continue to be screened regularly throughout their lives. Medical officials in Japan dismissed a link with the nuclear accident, but conceded that the results required further analysis. &quot;We hope to look for unknown types of gene mutations, other than those known to be associated with the generation of thyroid gland cancer, to study if they could serve as markers for determining if the cancers were induced by radiation,&quot; said Shinichi Suzuki, a professor of thyroid gland surgery at the university. At first sight, the figures give cause for alarm. Thyroid cancer normally affects one to two people per million among 10 to 14-year-olds in Japan, a rate far lower than observed in Fukushima, although tests there apply to people aged up to 18.     The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant pictured in August 2013. Photograph: Kyodo/Reuters    Inevitably, parallels have been drawn with the 1986 disaster in Chernobyl. Estimates vary, but according to the UN Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, more than 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer among exposed children and adolescents living in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus had been reported by 2005. There, no attempt was made to prevent children from drinking milk or eating leafy vegetables, leaving them vulnerable to ingesting dangerous amounts of the radionuclide iodine-131, a recognised cause of thyroid cancer. But experts familiar with both disasters caution against making similarly gloomy predictions for the children of Fukushima. Dillwyn Williams, emeritus professor of pathology at Cambridge University, pointed out that a noticeable increase in thyroid cancers was not observed until three to four years after the Chernobyl accident. &quot;Much less radioactivity was released from\u00a0Fukushima\u00a0than from\u00a0Chernobyl,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of [the Fukushima radiation] was blown over the Pacific Ocean, and thyroid doses in the most-affected areas are low compared to\u00a0Chernobyl. &quot;It is very unlikely there will be a large increase in thyroid cancer or any other health problems, apart from anxiety and psychological difficulties. That does not mean the surveillance should stop. There were surprises after Chernobyl and there may be again after Fukushima.&quot; Williams and other experts have attributed the large number of cases to the use of hypersensitive ultrasound, which can detect the tiniest lesions, and the large number of children being tested. In Fukushima, the first recorded cases of thyroid cancer \u2013 whose latent period can be between four or five years to several decades \u2013 came just a year after the meltdown. In Chernobyl, it took four years before cancer rates rose. &quot;The similarity in the public response to both accidents arises from a lack of awareness of the population about the real dangers and risks of radiation exposure,&quot; said Prof Konstantin Kotenko, director general of the state research centre at the Federal Medical Biological Agency in Moscow. &quot;After the both accidents the following was observed among the members of the public: fear and negative stereotypes due to exaggeration of the danger of ionising radiation, symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress. Undoubtedly, these perceptions of radiation have a negative impact on the health of the population, including children.&quot; Gerry Thomas, professor of molecular pathology at Imperial College, London University, blames growing anxiety among Fukushima residents on &quot;pseudo-scientists who can shout louder than real scientists&quot;.     A girl holds a placard during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Tokyo on 11 September 2011, six months on from the devastating Japan tsunami. Photograph: Toru Yamanaka/AFP/Getty    &quot;The biggest effect will be psychological \u2013 just as it was post-Chernobyl,&quot; said Thomas, who insists the rising number of cases is due to comprehensive screening, not radiation. &quot;I still stick with what I have always said: there will not be a single death due to the radiological consequences of this accident.&quot; But scientists have struggled to reach a consensus over the possible health effects of prolonged exposure to relatively low levels of radiation. While the World Health Organisation and other UN agencies praised the Japanese authorities for ordering the swift evacuation of neighbourhoods close to Fukushima Daiichi, their decision soon after to raise the allowable annual radiation exposure limit from one to 20 millisieverts [mSv] put children in danger, said Dr Paul Dorfman of the Energy Institute at University College, London. &quot;This is inexplicable,\u00a0since 20mSv is the allowable dose for an adult radiation worker,&quot; Dorman said. &quot;Given that infants and children are still in their developmental\u00a0stage, they\u00a0should not have been subjected\u00a0to this dose. &quot;Unfortunately, what this means is that we may be seeing increased ill health in the future. Not simply gross cancers and possibly\u00a0heart\u00a0problems, but also things that are difficult to detect\u00a0through\u00a0epidemiology, such as immune\u00a0problems.&quot; The anxiety felt by parents in Fukushima stems from a widespread lack of trust in the local medical authorities, which have come under government pressure not to cause alarm among residents. The Japanese government has resisted calls from parents to conduct comparable screenings among children in a region of Japan that was not affected by the disaster. That, radiation experts say, would at least establish whether or not the thyroid cancer spike in Fukushima is out of the ordinary. &quot;It is such an obvious measure that could be completed in about six months, but the government has done absolutely nothing for three years,&quot; said Koichiro Ono, a local kindergarten teacher. &quot;The government is worried that if the results suggest that there is a link, it will ruin its plans to restart nuclear reactors.&quot; As north-east Japan prepares to mark the third anniversary of the disaster, in which almost 20,000 people died \u2013 most of them in two prefectures north of Fukushima \u2013 the country&apos;s leaders are trying to put a positive spin on the recovery effort. During a recent visit to a Fukushima village where the evacuation order imposed in March 2011 has been partially lifted, prime minister Shinzo Abe congratulated residents on taking a crucial step towards resuming the lives they were forced to put on hold after their homes were irradiated. Kamei, however, was not impressed. &quot;How can anyone talk about life returning to normal in Fukushima until everything has been done to ensure that people have their health?&quot; he said. &quot;Politicians keep talking about recovery, but that doesn&apos;t mean anything to people living around here.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Speaking to reporters who were on a rare visit to the plant on the eve of the third anniversary of the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, Dale Klein said Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] had yet to reassure the public over the handling of water leaks that continue to frustrate efforts to clean up the site."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "World news", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-10T16:56:22Z", "title": "Fukushima operator may have to dump contaminated water into Pacific", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/10/fukushima-operator-dump-contaminated-water-pacific", "article": "A senior adviser to the operator of the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has told the firm that it may have no choice but to eventually dump hundreds of thousands of tonnes of contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean. Speaking to reporters who were on a rare visit to the plant on the eve of the third anniversary of the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, Dale Klein said Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] had yet to reassure the public over the handling of water leaks that continue to frustrate efforts to clean up the site. &quot;The one issue that keeps me awake at night is Tepco&apos;s long-term strategy for water management,&quot; said Klein, a former chairman of the US nuclear regulatory commission who now leads Tepco&apos;s nuclear reform committee. &quot;Storing massive amounts of water on-site is not sustainable. A controlled release is much safer than keeping the water on-site. &quot;Tepco is making progress on water management but I&apos;m not satisfied yet. It&apos;s frustrating that the company takes four or five steps forward, then two back. And every time you have a leakage it contributes to a lack of trust. There&apos;s room for improvement on all fronts.&quot; Tepco&apos;s failure to manage the buildup of contaminated water came to light last summer, when it admitted that at least 300 tonnes of tainted water were leaking into the sea every day. That revelation was followed by a string of incidents involving spills from poorly assembled storage tanks, prompting the government to commit about $500m (\u00a3300m) into measures to contain the water. They include the construction of an underground frozen wall to prevent groundwater mixing with contaminated coolant water, which becomes tainted after coming into contact with melted nuclear fuel deep inside the damaged reactors. Tepco confirmed that it would activate an experimental wall at a test site at the plant on Tuesday. If the test is successful, the firm plans to build a similar structure almost 2km in length around four damaged reactors next year, although some experts have questioned its ability to use the technology on such a large scale. Klein, too, voiced scepticism over the frozen wall solution, and suggested that the controlled release of treated water into the Pacific was preferable to storing huge quantities of it on site. But Tepco, the government and nuclear regulators would have to win the support of local fishermen, and the release of even treated water would almost certainly draw a furious response from China and South Korea. &quot;It&apos;s a very emotional issue,&quot; Klein said. &quot;But Tepco and the government will have to articulate their position to other people. For me, the water issue is more about policy than science.&quot; Tepco is pinning its hopes on technology that can remove dozens of dangerous radionuclides, apart from tritium, internal exposure to which has been linked to a greater risk of developing cancer. Klein, however, said tritium does not pose the same threat to heath as bone-settling strontium and caesium, and can be diluted to safe levels before it is released into the sea. The Fukushima Daiichi plant&apos;s manager, Akira Ono, said the firm had no plans to release contaminated water into the Pacific, but agreed that decommissioning would remain on hold until the problem was solved. &quot;The most pressing issue for us is the contaminated water, rather than decommissioning,&quot;\u00a0he said. &quot;Unless we address this issue the public will not be assured and the evacuees will not be able to return home. &quot;We are in a positive frame of mind over decommissioning the plant over the next 30 to 40 years, But we have to take utmost care every step of the way because errors can cause a lot of trouble for a lot of people.&quot; Currently about 400 tonnes of groundwater is streaming into the reactor basements from the hills behind the plant each day. The plant has accumulated about 300,000 tonnes of contaminated water, which is being stored in 1,200 tanks occupying a large swath of the Fukushima Daiichi site. Eventually Tepco hopes to have enough space to store 800,000 tonnes, but fears are rising that it will run out of space sometime next year because it can&apos;t keep up with the flow of toxic water. Fukushima three years on For visitors and workers alike, the journey to the plant begins at J-Village, a former training complex for the Japanese football team that now serves as the Fukushima cleanup&apos;s logistical base. During the 20-minute bus ride through neighbourhoods still bearing the scars of the earthquake and tsunami, there were signs that decontamination work is making modest progress. Atmospheric radiation levels are falling, leading the authorities to partially lift evacuation orders in neighbourhoods on the edge of the evacuation zone. Some of Fukushima&apos;s 100,000-plus nuclear evacuees are now permitted to return to their homes during the day, but radiation levels are still too high for them to make a permanent return. In the town of Naraha, where atmospheric radiation hovered around 2 microsieverts an hour on Monday \u2013 the official decontamination target is 0.23 microsieverts an hour \u2013 large black bags filled with radioactive soil cover fields once used for agriculture, where they will remain until agreement can be reached on a permanent disposal site. Part of a railway line running along to coast is due to reopen in the spring, although stretches of track that pass through the most contaminated areas are expected to remain closed for years. Inside Fukushima Daiichi, reporters were reminded of the frantic attempts by a small group of Tepco engineers to save the plant from an even greater catastrophe in the hours after its power supply was knocked out by a towering tsunami three years ago. In the control room for reactors 1 and 2, both of which suffered meltdowns, one worker&apos;s attempts to record water levels by scribbling them on to a disabled control panel are still visible. None of the unnamed men, who had to work by torchlight, are still at the site: some have retired, but most had to leave because they quickly reached their lifetime radiation dose limit. &quot;It is difficult to describe what that time was like for those workers,&quot; said Kenichiro Matsui, a Tepco official. &quot;They worked tirelessly to save the reactors. They had a real sense of mission.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["From a European mountain top, tucked into cycling gear, to a snowy yard in North America, to an equatorial paradise, to a passenger cabin at cruising altitude, and even to a crowded commuter train in Tokyo (I knew the Yamanote Line well in my more than eight years in Japan!"], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2014-03-11T16:01:50Z", "title": "Inside the 14 March edition", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/mar/11/abby-deveney-inside-guardian-weekly", "article": "Guardian Weekly readers love words.

Coverage from the Observer on Islamic extremist group Boko Haram rounds out that package. From India, our other partner paper, the Washington Post, profiles the leader of that country&apos;s new Common Man party. How will it fare in month-long voting (the world&apos;s biggest democratic exercise) that begins 7 April? It will take some time to tell. As part of our India coverage, Le Monde looks at India&apos;s public education system, concluding that schools aren&apos;t up to the mark. Beyond those two news spreads, we report from Japan, where contaminated water from the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant may need to be released into the Pacific, from Hong Kong, where asylum seekers remain a forgotten group, and from China, where a top-level leadership meeting will take on the issue of pollution. On our Comment pages, Gary Younge argues that dirty CIA deeds are dragging the US into darkness, and Julia Buxton considers Venezuela a year after Hugo Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s death. Our Letters page is full of attitude, and we would have it no other way, as readers reflect on the nature of democracy and the plight of women in politics. Why not join in this debate? We&apos;d love to read your letters. A batch of super deep-read pieces follow. We visit the German town that arms the world, assess the green loans helping Kenya&apos;s small farmers, and consider how technology is shaking up society in China.

Searches were called off after 11 days but after two months a pair of survivors walked for 10 days through the mountains to find help and enable the others to be rescued.

Wreckage was eventually found just over a year later after a hiker discovered Fossett&apos;s papers in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Investigators said the probable cause of the crash was strong gusts of wind that overpowered the plane.     Wreckage from Steve Fossett's plane on a  California mountainside.

It is called Ceiling Painting or Yes Painting, and it is one of the classics of conceptual art that fill her retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. It consists of a stepladder leading up to a steel-framed panel and a dangling magnifying glass. When John Lennon climbed up Ono&apos;s ladder at the swinging London gallery Indica in 1966, there were more steps, but the word written above his head was the same as in this version: a &quot;yes&quot; so tiny you need the magnifying glass to read it. The smallness of the yes and the difficulty of reaching it reflected her pain at the time, Ono says. A relationship had just come to an end and she had a vision of a journey into the heights, &quot;like a cathedral&quot;, to be rewarded by some kind of hope, some affirmation &quot;on high&quot;. As it happened, her hopeful artwork was to change her life. The most serious Beatle heard about the amazing artist who had shown up in London, went along for a private viewing and climbed that ladder to read the tiny word. The author of I Am The Walrus and Strawberry Fields recognised a kindred spirit. So the work is best known nowadays among readers of Beatles biographies for its part in one of the great love stories of modern times. Yet Yoko Ono is much more than her fame. She has lived in the most lurid and cruel of pop culture spotlights, reviled as the black-clad avant-gardiste who &quot;broke up the Beatles&quot;, mocked along with Lennon for supposedly naive peace-mongering, and brutally widowed by gun violence. Now her time has come. The Yes Painting is not here as a piece of Lennonabilia but as one of a hugely impressive array of installations, performance documents, &quot;instructions&quot;, music and films that leave no doubt of a true original&apos;s influence on the art of this century. Is there any contemporary art style she did not pioneer? At times this feels like a retrospective of Turner Prize winners: here&apos;s a film of a fly crawling on a woman&apos;s naked thigh that might be misattributed to Douglas Gordon or Damien Hirst; a cinematic celebration of bottoms Martin Creed might be proud of, a chair wrapped in desiccated fabric that is as poetic as any sculpture by Rachel Whiteread \u2013 all made by Ono more than 40 years ago.     White Chess Set, 1966/2013. Photograph: David Hornback    In person, she&apos;s charming, authoritative and mysterious. She wears dark glasses and a hat indoors \u2013 but any first impression of hauteur is undercut by the way she keeps humorously lowering and raising her shades on her nose as she enthusiastically expounds her philosophy. Nor does she seem aware of my orders to stay clear of her personal life in this exclusive interview \u2013 which is just as well as it would be nonsensical. Art and life are the same thing for Ono. Her work is acutely, often shockingly personal. Conceptual art, she tells me, is &quot;more expressive&quot; than painting: a striking claim that her art proves true \u2013 at least when she&apos;s providing the concepts. In 1964 a young woman knelt down before an audience in Tokyo and placed a pair of scissors on the ground in front of her. Members of the audience were invited to come forward, one by one, and cut off pieces of her clothing. In films and photographs of Cut Piece, as it is called, Ono maintains a passive deferential pose and expression as women and, more disturbingly, men cut off more and more of her clothing until she&apos;s kneeling in her underwear. It is surely one of the most powerful of all feminist artworks. But did she think of it, I want to know, as a feminist statement back in 1964? Ono&apos;s intelligence flashes. &quot;All powerful art has many layers of drama,&quot; she explains. &quot;I was originally thinking of the Buddha and how he gave everything up.&quot; That ascetic surrender, she thought then, is what life is like for women, and she conceived Cut Piece as an &quot;acceptance&quot; of that reality. So it&apos;s not angry? &quot;No, it&apos;s not angry.&quot; Yet violence and pain streak through her art, for all its Buddhist acceptance. When her relationship with her boyfriend Tony Cox was breaking up in London in the late 1960s, she woke up one morning to find he had vanished from their all-white flat. She responded by bisecting a roomful of their stuff \u2013 a chair, a framed painting, a case, a shelf unit, a kettle, a teapot, even shoes. It was not just spite: it was art. Her installation Half-a-Room is one of the most powerful moments in the retrospective. It&apos;s like a haunting relic of a tragicomic play, a set for a Samuel Becket monologue or an image from a sad song. When it was shown at the Lisson Gallery in 1967, it looked to a Britain highly sceptical about conceptual art (to put it mildly) like ultra-hippie craziness. Today it is another Ono creation that seems like the prototype for about a hundred recent works of art.     River Bed, 1996/2014. Photograph: David Hornback    She called that Lisson Gallery show the Half-a-Wind show, and her retrospective is named after it. What did it mean? Like the half-destroyed room at its heart, the title spoke of loss, absence, incompleteness. &quot;We are all just half a person&quot;, she says. In fact, at that moment she was in the process of finding her other half: Lennon helped with the exhibition. You can&apos;t really get away from him at the Guggenheim, because their love was founded on artistic collaboration and he was her as she was him, artistically, in the late 60s and 70s. Their relationship did not start with physical passion, she explains. Instead it began as artistic collaboration: when Cynthia Lennon finally caught them together, they had been up all night making art. Lennon&apos;s face hovers in grainy colour in their film Smile, one of the shared endeavours that sealed their love. There&apos;s a little work of art called Box of Smile: you look inside to see your reflection (you provide the smile). In an uncomfortable vintage David Frost interview, the art lovers present Frost with a version of this piece as they try to explain conceptual art to a television studio audience that looks like its average age is 100. For all the bile unleashed on Ono in 1960s Britain, she got away with one stunt no recent artist has rivalled. &quot;Amazing, isn&apos;t it?&quot; she says happily, remembering how in 1967 the police let her wrap one of the lions in Trafalgar Square in a huge piece of cloth. Photographs of the happening look far more subversive, somehow, than today&apos;s routinised and respectable artworks on the square&apos;s fourth plinth. The word &quot;revolution&quot; comes as readily to her lips today as it did when she and Lennon put up a poster in Times Square saying War Is Over (If You Want It). The counterculture she did so much to shape, and that she sees today in the internet, &quot;is a revolution but there is no bloodshed; art quietly changed the\u00a0world.&quot; With such a sense of mission, she never worried about pleasing the public. Back then, &quot;most people didn&apos;t want to know and I wasn&apos;t about to explain about it. My art was different from what was considered as art. My idea was that maybe one day 50 years later or 100 years later people might discover it.&quot; At 81, she has lived to see that day. Her interactive feminist conceptual art, her films and installations, now look like beacons of what art is now and will be in years to come. To visit this moving and beautiful show is to see what Lennon saw in her \u2013 a visionary he looked up to, an artist whose imagination and intelligence, he insisted, set him free and showed him a better life. He was right and the cynics who satirised her were wrong."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo was plunged into two &quot;lost&quot; decades of stagnation after it prevented zombie companies from declaring bankruptcy \u2013 even blocking petitions from bondholders in the courts - when a property collapse exposed debts many times the value of their businesses."], "tags": ["China", "Li Keqiang", "Asia Pacific", "Bankruptcy and IVAs", "World news", "Business", "Money", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-13T20:29:00Z", "title": "China's Li Keqiang warns investors to prepare for wave of bankruptcies", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/china-li-keqiang-wans-investors-bankruptcies", "article": "China is braced for a wave of industrial bankruptcies as its slowing economy forces companies with sky-high debts to the wall, the country&apos;s premier has said. Premier Li Keqiang told lenders to China&apos;s private sector factories they should expect debt defaults as the world&apos;s second largest economy encounters &quot;serious challenges&quot; in the year ahead. Speaking after the annual session of the national people&apos;s congress, Li Keqiang said: &quot;We are going to confront serious challenges this year and some challenges may be even more complex.&quot; He told lenders to China&apos;s private sector factories they should expect debt defaults. Li said China must &quot;ensure steady growth, ensure employment, avert inflation and defuse risks&quot; while also fighting pollution, among other tasks. &quot;So we need to strike a proper balance amidst all these goals and objectives,&quot; he added. &quot;This is not going to be easy,&quot; he said. Li&apos;s warning followed the failure of Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy to make a payment on a 1bn yuan (\u00a3118m) bond last week. The default was the first of its kind for China and widely seen as pointing to the end of 11th-hour government bailouts for troubled enterprises. Some analysts said the decision to let some indebted firms collapse was a sign the authorities had learned from the Japanese boom and bust experience of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Tokyo was plunged into two &quot;lost&quot; decades of stagnation after it prevented zombie companies from declaring bankruptcy \u2013 even blocking petitions from bondholders in the courts - when a property collapse exposed debts many times the value of their businesses. However, figures this week revealed that Beijing is copying the Japanese tactic of ramping up public infrastructure spending to replace the steep slowdown in private sector investment. Fixed asset investment, a measure of government spending on infrastructure, expanded 17.9% during the first two months of 2014, the National Bureau of Statistics said. China&apos;s industrial production rose at its slowest pace in five years with surveys showing a faster slowdown than expected. Industrial output, which measures production at factories, workshops and mines, rose 8.6% in January and February year on year, which is the lowest pace of growth since the 7.3% annual growth figure recorded in April 2009. The figures covered a two-month period owing to China&apos;s lunar new year holiday week, which fell in both months. Retail sales gained 11.8% in the two months from the year before, the lowest since an 11.6% increase in February 2011. The pessimistic data surprised economists but followed indicators for manufacturing, trade and inflation that also suggested weakness in China&apos;s economy. China&apos;s GDP grew 7.7% in 2013, unchanged from the year before, the slowest growth since 1999. Li said this month that Beijing was targeting economic growth of about 7.5% in 2014, the same target as last year. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a research note that the results were a confirmation of &quot;fast deterioration of China&apos;s economic growth&quot;. But Julian Evans-Pritchard, Asia economist for Capital Economics, said officials were unlikely to intervene. &quot;Limited and seasonally distorted data over the last few weeks have made it difficult to make sense of what&apos;s really happening in China&apos;s economy,&quot; he said in a note. &quot;Despite this broad evidence of a slowdown, we don&apos;t think policymakers will necessarily step in to support growth,&quot; he said, adding that officials were &quot;comfortable with a moderate slowdown&quot;. The figures come as China&apos;s leadership says it wants to transform the growth model away from an over-reliance on often wasteful investment, making private demand the driver for the country&apos;s development. A reliance on public sector investment while the private sector rebalances away from low margin manufacturing relies for its success on the economy maintaining the government&apos;s growth target. Li said: &quot;Last year, without taking any additional short-term stimulus measures, we succeeded in meeting our target. Why can&apos;t we do this this year?&quot; He emphasised the target was approximate. &quot;This &apos;about&apos; shows that there is a level of flexibility here.&quot; At any rate, he said authorities were not focused on the figure itself, but how it contributes to improving livelihoods, saying growth &quot;needs to ensure fairly full employment and needs to help increase people&apos;s income&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I still can&apos;t believe I&apos;m standing in front of you now,&quot; she told reporters in Tokyo.", "&quot;There were some raised eyebrows in Tokyo&apos;s Scottish community about the nationality of the actress, and therefore the authenticity of the story, but anything that brings together the &apos;water of life&apos; and the two great nations of Scotland and Japan can only be a good thing,&quot; she said."], "tags": ["Japan", "Whisky", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Scotland", "UK news", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-14T11:29:06Z", "title": "American actor Charlotte Kate Fox wins role as 'mother of Japanese whisky'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/14/american-actor-charlotte-kate-fox-mother-japanese-whisky", "article": "In six months&apos; time, Charlotte Kate Fox will be a household name in Japan. In Scotland, whisky drinkers may well raise a glass in her honour. The 28-year-old American actor has beaten more than 500 other hopefuls to secure the role of Rita Cowan \u2013 a Scottish woman regarded as the mother of Japanese whisky \u2013 in the national broadcaster NHK&apos;s hugely popular morning drama slot later this year. Tens of millions of viewers will follow Fox in her role as Rita, originally from Kirkintilloch in East Dunbartonshire, as she and her husband, Masataka Taketsuru, leave Scotland to lay the foundations for Japan&apos;s award-winning distilleries. Masataka, who will be played by the popular Japanese actor Tetsuji Tamayama, arrived in Scotland in 1918 to study organic chemistry at Glasgow University. The real purpose of his journey, though, was to fulfil a burning, if half-formed, ambition to learn the secrets of whisky distilling. He was turned away by several hotels, ending up as a lodger in the home of his future wife, the daughter of a local doctor whose fiance was killed in the first world war. After apprenticeships at the Longmorn and Hazelburn distilleries, Masataka set about fulfilling his second wish \u2013 persuading a middle-class Scottish woman to accompany him back to Japan. Despite opposition from both families and disapproving noises from their neighbours, Masataka and Rita married at a Glasgow register office in 1920 and arrived in recession-hit Japan the following year. The later episodes of the drama will focus on their struggle to establish the Dai Nihon Kaju (later to become Nikka) distillery in Yoichi on Japan&apos;s northernmost island of Hokkaido, in the years before the Pacific war. &quot;Without Masataka and Rita, the whisky industry in Japan may never have got started,&quot; said Chris Bunting, author of Drinking Japan. &quot;All of the major Japanese\u00a0distillers trace their\u00a0whisky making to the knowledge they brought back from Scotland and the two big firms, Suntory and Nikka, were in a position in the postwar years to make\u00a0whisky\u00a0an important part of Japanese alcohol culture.&quot; Bunting believes the drama could strengthen Japan&apos;s well-developed thirst for whisky, including the country&apos;s vaunted single malts. &quot;There used to be a tendency to look down on Japanese\u00a0whisky, but anybody who has been paying even passing attention to\u00a0international whisky\u00a0competitions since about 2001 knows that the Japanese distillers produce some of the best spirit in the world,&quot; he said. NHK said the drama would portray Rita and Masataka&apos;s struggle with the &quot;difficulties of an international marriage and challenges in the production of Japan&apos;s first whisky,&quot; as well as Rita&apos;s attempts to get to grips with Japanese culture. The broadcaster, whose morning TV drama slot will enter its 91st season with Rita&apos;s story, described the characters as an unlikely match between &quot;a Japanese man who is a socially clumsy dreamer and his British wife, who is brimming with elegance and speaks the dialect of Osaka&quot;, where the couple were based. It promised a sympathetic drama that &quot;vividly portrays the fundamental strengths of Japanese people who have struggled to get through tough times&quot;. But the years leading up to the outbreak of war were, if anything, more difficult for Rita. The couple were watched by the feared secret police, with Rita wrongly suspected of helping allied submarines navigate Japanese waters. Local children threw stones at their home. After Rita died in 1961, having never returned to Scotland, a distraught Masataka reportedly wanted her bones to be placed by the side of his bed. They are buried, side by side, in Yoichi. Fox, the first non-Japanese female actor to land a prominent role in an NHK drama series, said she was honoured to have gotten the part. &quot;I still can&apos;t believe I&apos;m standing in front of you now,&quot; she told reporters in Tokyo. NHK scriptwriters said the drama&apos;s storyline would at times stray into the realms of fiction, adding that Fox&apos;s character would be called Ellie. Lori Henderson, the Scottish executive director of the British Chamber of Commerce in Japan, said she was intrigued to see how Fox, whose grandmother is Scottish, would portray Rita. &quot;There were some raised eyebrows in Tokyo&apos;s Scottish community about the nationality of the actress, and therefore the authenticity of the story, but anything that brings together the &apos;water of life&apos; and the two great nations of Scotland and Japan can only be a good thing,&quot; she said. Massan \u2013 Rita&apos;s nickname for her husband \u2013 will run over 150 episodes, each lasting 15 minutes, every weekday and Saturday morning from September."}, {"sentences": ["Uttoxeter 2.05 Pure Style 2.40 Dare To Endeavour 3.15 Songsmith 3.50 Goulanes 4.25 Gentle Bob 5.00 Oscar&apos;s Pet 5.35 Some Plan Fontwell 1.55 Shuil Gealeach 2.30 Ringa Bay 3.05 Vision Des Champs 3.40 Last Shot 4.15 No No Bingo 4.50 Benny The Swinger 5.25 Solstice Son (nap) Kempton 2.20 Arkaim 2.55 Another Hero 3.30 Top Of The Range 4.05 Oscar Hoof (nb) 4.40 Ned Stark 5.15 Midnight Macarena 5.50 Dancing Shadow Newcastle 2.15 Aneedh 2.50 Dingo Bay 3.25 Cool Sky 4.00 Lackamon 4.35 Ballycool 5.10 Nexius 5.45 Right To Rule  Wolverhampton 5.40 Outbid 6.10 Daneglow 6.40 Tokyo Brown 7.10 Jaahiez 7.40 Big Orange 8.10 Star Links 8.40 Sian Gwalia 9.10 Khajaaly"], "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-14T19:12:37Z", "title": "Horse racing tips: Saturday 15 March", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/14/horse-racing-tips-march-15", "article": "Uttoxeter 2.05 Pure Style 2.40 Dare To Endeavour 3.15 Songsmith 3.50 Goulanes 4.25 Gentle Bob 5.00 Oscar&apos;s Pet 5.35 Some Plan Fontwell 1.55 Shuil Gealeach 2.30 Ringa Bay 3.05 Vision Des Champs 3.40 Last Shot 4.15 No No Bingo 4.50 Benny The Swinger 5.25 Solstice Son (nap) Kempton 2.20 Arkaim 2.55 Another Hero 3.30 Top Of The Range 4.05 Oscar Hoof (nb) 4.40 Ned Stark 5.15 Midnight Macarena 5.50 Dancing Shadow Newcastle 2.15 Aneedh 2.50 Dingo Bay 3.25 Cool Sky 4.00 Lackamon 4.35 Ballycool 5.10 Nexius 5.45 Right To Rule  Wolverhampton 5.40 Outbid 6.10 Daneglow 6.40 Tokyo Brown 7.10 Jaahiez 7.40 Big Orange 8.10 Star Links 8.40 Sian Gwalia 9.10 Khajaaly"}, {"sentences": ["I bought all the books of his I could in London, and they are still with me here in Tokyo \u2013 they&apos;re practically the only ones here."], "tags": ["Music", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "Folk music"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-16T00:05:01Z", "title": "Ivor Cutler: 'He didn't live by the same rules as everyone else'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/16/ivor-cutler-beautiful-cosmos-scottish-musician-poet", "article": "He was adored by the Beatles, John Peel and John Lydon and signed by cult labels from Harvest and Virgin to Rough Trade and Creation, but mainstream success didn&apos;t matter a jot to Ivor Cutler. The ultimate outsider&apos;s outsider, he preferred to peer sombrely from the stage behind owlish glasses, singing his songs about bugs, herrings and his father pointing at thistles, his faithful harmonium wheezing along with him. Next month, seven years after his death at the age of 83, the Glaswegian musician, poet and singer is being celebrated in a new touring play produced by Vanishing Point Theatre Company in association with the National Theatre of Scotland, whose previous productions include Gregory Burke&apos;s award-winning Black Watch and a stage adaptation of Swedish vampire film Let the Right One In. The Beautiful Cosmos of Ivor Cutler is named after one of his most tender songs (chorus: &quot;This is our universe, cups of tea/We have a beautiful cosmos, you and me&quot;). It takes the artist&apos;s work and life as inspiration, explains director Matthew Lenton, and experiments with them following Cutler&apos;s anarchic example. &quot;I&apos;d always thought of [our play] as being an anti-Mamma Mia,&quot; he says. &quot;We wanted properly to\u00a0illustrate\u00a0what\u00a0an\u00a0eccentric\u00a0Ivor was.&quot; It helps that Cutler&apos;s biography is as rich as his songs. Born into a middle-class Jewish family in 1923, antisemitism and the Great Depression loomed large in his childhood, the latter influencing later works such as Gruts For Tea (&quot;Daddy, we&apos;ve had gruts for three years now. I&apos;m fed up with gruts&quot;), and his most famous sequence of songs, Life in a Scotch Sitting Room. Stories from his early adulthood also point towards his wayward personality. In the second world war, he was dismissed from the RAF for looking at clouds rather than navigating his plane, while his postwar teaching involved getting pupils to improvise\u00a0a\u00a0song\u00a0about killing their\u00a0siblings. Cutler&apos;s musical career proper began on radio and TV in the late 1950s, however, and fame came when Paul McCartney caught him on the show Late Night Line-Up; a few years later, in 1967, he played bus conductor Buster Bloodvessel in the Beatles&apos; Magical Mystery Tour. &quot;I am your friendly courier,&quot; he says as the tour starts, darkly and dourly, as if announcing a journey to Hades. This demeanour had roots in real life too \u2013 a loyal member of the Noise Abatement Society, he even hated loud applause.            Cutler was embraced by indie circles in later years. He recorded a total of 21\u00a0sessions for John Peel&apos;s evening show between 1969 and 1991, and even had a minor hit in 1985 with Women of the World, which was released on Rough Trade (full lyric: &quot;Women of the world take over/&apos;Cos if you don&apos;t, the world will come to an end and it won&apos;t take long&quot;). Creation Records boss Alan McGee even signed Cutler to the label when Oasis were in their pomp. His rebelliousness, playfulness\u00a0and\u00a0oddness won over all\u00a0generations. It continues to win the Vanishing Point team over, too, and Lenton keeps hearing new Cutler stories that make him laugh. One, from a Glasgow soundman he met recently, clearing up after a gig, is particularly evocative. &quot;He heard a voice from the wings, going, &apos;Right, that&apos;s it. I told you, I warned you. I&apos;m leaving you&apos;, and walked around the corner to see Ivor standing there talking to his harmonium.&quot; Abandoned there as promised, the instrument eventually ended up with the Celtic Connections festival team \u2013 but Lenton&apos;s team have it on loan now, and\u00a0it\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0centre\u2011stage for their\u00a0tour. &quot;We love that the story behind it illustrates who he was too,&quot; Lenton adds. &quot;Ivor was the sort of eccentric that&apos;s being squeezed out of the world now, the sort of person we should hang on to \u2013 he didn&apos;t live by the same rules as everybody else.&quot;     KT Tunstall at Glastonbury festival 2008 Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    KT TunstallSinger-songwriter and Ivor Cutler obsessive When I first heard Ivor Cutler about 15\u00a0years ago \u2013 on a mixtape King Creosote made me, I think \u2013 I was howling with laughter. My parents&apos; idea of fun had been to get us camping in horizontal rain, so hearing Life in a Scotch Sitting Room and the parents dragging their kids out to look at nature \u2013 &quot;Look, said father, a patch of grass!&quot; \u2013 that really got me. Hearing him at the point I was entering into adulthood was also a massive relief. Here was an adult with a child alive and well inside. You&apos;re meant to suppress your inner child as you grow older, to gain approval, to be accepted, but he didn&apos;t. His was the biggest original rebellion. He didn&apos;t want to conform. He just enjoyed himself. I&apos;ve always found his music almost medicinal. If I&apos;m on the road, emotionally bereft in yet another airport, I&apos;ll play Ivor and I&apos;m calm. His harmonium&apos;s really magical too, as it sort of sounds like a person \u2013 I&apos;ve played it on a few records because of that, and it&apos;s an incredibly human instrument. Ivor&apos;s songs remind me of the storytelling of Roald Dahl or Dr Seuss \u2013 they&apos;re all about simplicity, beauty and joyfulness, qualities usually belittled in rock music. Qualities people often see as weak, but which are anything but.     Robert Wyatt.    Robert WyattSinger-songwriter, former member of Soft Machine and a friend of Cutler&apos;s. He recorded him on his 1974 Rock Bottom album track Little Red Robin Hit the Road I first knew of Ivor after hearing Gruts For Tea on the radio. After that, [Soft Machine] would invite him to be our &quot;supporting group&quot; at gigs. We did not yet know about his Noise Abatement Society tendencies then or we wouldn&apos;t have dared ask. In person, Ivor was friendly, dry and funny. His music spoke to me as being neither quite comedy or tragedy \u2013 his work simply took you to another place, more like a sort of east European Samuel Beckett. In fact, he was dead chuffed when a radio producer said his silences were even longer than Samuel Beckett&apos;s. His was a totally de-cluttered art, with self-imposed disciplines \u2013 he told us he preferred to finish a story by the end of the first page. Even in his longer stories, he avoided adjectival and adverbial clauses. He was all meat and no potatoes. As a singer he admired Paul Robeson, but the influence of the Jewish cantors in his own ancestry is also clearly detectable. I think Ivor&apos;s connection with musicians took his work out of the poetry ghetto, too \u2013 and I like to think he&apos;s still known by people who appreciate his uncategorisable range.

Me and Douglas from BMX Bandits were in a school band together, making sort of absurdist pop music \u2013 some people say that we still are. Our main influences were Jonathan Richman&apos;s Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll with the Modern Lovers and Ivor Cutler&apos;s Jammy Smears and Velvet Donkey. There was a wonderful simplicity to that music \u2013 Ivor and harmonium, Ivor and piano \u2013 that really spoke to us, and lyrically it made you feel like you could write anything you wanted. And it was\u00a0fun. I think that the people in Scotland who know his work will view him as a national treasure, although I&apos;m not sure how many people are actually aware of him. He spent most of his life outside of Scotland anyway, and the themes in his work are universal. He is probably remembered mostly for his eccentricity and for his more outlandish and abstract work, but he wrote some really beautiful love songs. One of my favourites is Darling Will You Marry Me Twice? It&apos;s about a minute long, has five lines, and is heartfelt and incredibly moving. I never met him but I saw him perform at the Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh in the early 80s. Just him and the harmonium \u2013 an amazing show. At one point he, rather curmudgeonly, asked the sound person to turn the PA off. &quot;Too loud!&quot; I loved\u00a0that.     Kathryn Williams, singer-songwriter.    Kathryn WilliamsSinger-songwriter;covered Beautiful Cosmos for her 2004 album, Relations I was managed by Alan McGee for a few years, and he assumed that I would want to meet his big successes, Oasis. I was all, I don&apos;t give a shit about Oasis, you put out Ivor Cutler on Creation! And he went, &quot;Ahh, there&apos;s a reason I did that, then\u2026 &quot; When I listen to Ivor Cutler, it makes me feel excited. It&apos;s a secret pleasure in a way, because you don&apos;t have people round for dinner parties and stick his stuff on. He also defines what it&apos;s like to be a proper eccentric. There&apos;s loads of people these days who think, &quot;Oh, I&apos;m a bit mad&quot;, and they&apos;re usually just loud people who talk a lot, and say things you know they&apos;re going to say. Ivor was the opposite of that. He made your brain turn around and flip over and think in a very gentle way, by creating these simple, beautiful, honest moments and sentiments. I really love Ivor&apos;s quietness too. I take a lot of inspiration from him in trying to be brave enough to be myself, which is a quiet person, really. I played a gig recently where the crowd was pretty loud, and I thought, no, I&apos;m going to do the quieter, odder, more heartbreaking songs anyway. Ivor had that really beautiful vulnerability in him which most people won&apos;t put across, but I&apos;ve always followed his lead. He shows you how to be when there&apos;s nowhere to hide.     Jim O'Rourke, US musician and producer    Jim O&apos;RourkeUS musician and record producer; covered Cutler&apos;s Women of the World on his 1998 album Eureka Like a lot of people, I first encountered Ivor seeing Magical Mystery Tour. And as both of my parents are Irish, when I first heard Life in a Scotch Sitting Room, it wasn&apos;t that far from the sense of humour I had grown up around. His way with words, the darkness behind the seeming gentleness, made me think here was someone after my own heart. I have as much [of his music] as I&apos;ve been able to get my hands on, even his early album Who Tore Your Trousers? from 1961. I bought all the books of his I could in London, and they are still with me here in Tokyo \u2013 they&apos;re practically the only ones here. Probably, my favourite record is Privilege too. It&apos;s flawless. When I was in London, I used to go into his local bookshop in the hope of meeting him, but that was well before I covered Women of the World. I doubt that he would have liked it anyway. A little too loud probably.     Glaswegian singer-songwriter Alasdair Roberts treats us to a live performance of the title track to his album, Farewell Sorrow Photograph: guardian.co.uk    Alasdair RobertsFolk musician inspired by Cutler; has covered his music at tribute gigs and on record  I first heard Ivor Cutler in the early 90s. There&apos;s a lot of humour in a his work, but I like his stuff that&apos;s not humorous at all. There&apos;s a poem on A Wet Handle called Flat Thin Chests, which is quite spooky and haunting; it influenced me a lot. His music puts across a real understanding of young people and children, from when he worked with them as teacher, and I respond to that too. He was also really inspired by pibroch, this very traditional Highland bagpipe music. The folkiness of his music comes out of that, really. There&apos;s real subtleties and complexities to his work that I see as I get older as well, a real wisdom to his work. Such as, he was wise enough to realise that you can be silly, and that doesn&apos;t have to distract from intelligence. I went to a few of his gigs in Edinburgh in the late 1990s, and got his autograph once. I remember he had very beautiful eyes. I just said thank you, as did he, and we both scuttled away, as it was meant to be.     George Martin, Beatles producer.

But Babymetal, a trio of Japanese teenage girls, have paired rah-rah skirts and hair ribbons with infernal metallic riffs to produce what could be the most unlikely music phenomenon of the year. The band&apos;s eponymous debut album is No 3 on iTunes&apos; US rock chart and has made the online top 10 in six other countries, including the UK. The video for their new single, Gimme Chocolate, has received more than 3.7m views on YouTube, and their dramatic arrival on the international metal scene won them a place on the cover of the latest edition of Kerrang! magazine. Babymetal&apos;s music owes more to the uncomfortable marriage between the J-pop perennials of Lolita fantasy than to the bare-bones metal sound of, say, Slipknot. In the Gimme Chocolate video, the guitarists and drummer are practically invisible, while the catchy chorus will sound more familiar to fans of J-pop girlband AKB48. Babymetal \u2013 Suzuka Nakamoto, 16, Moa Kikuchi and Yui Mizuno, both 14 \u2013 grew out of the all-girl band Sakura Gakuin. Their mission \u2013 to fuse the saccharine sound of J-pop with thrash metal \u2013 was daunting, given none of the girls had even heard of metal before being thrown together by executives at the Amuse talent agency. But they have handled their tricky musical brief with ease. The band&apos;s first major single, Ijime, Dame, Zettai, sold 19,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number six in the Japanese Orion weekly singles chart. Steve McClure, the executive director of the online music site McClure Music, described &quot;karaoke-friendly&quot; Gimme Chocolate as &quot;well done for what it is&quot;. &quot;Babymetal have some clever marketing and slick production values behind them. They&apos;re a good example of a spin on the &apos;kawaii&apos; [cute] template. The song is a bit formulaic in the sense that it&apos;s a knock-off of the AKB48 kawaii genre, but it&apos;s a catchy tune.&quot; Despite the phenomenal domestic success of AKB48 and other girl bands, J-pop has struggled to make an impact outside north-east Asia. Korea&apos;s Girls&apos; Generation and Co, however, is riding a global K-pop wave. And yet McClure does not forsee Babymetal as the new face of Japan&apos;s pop industry. The critic has drawn an unfavourable comparison between the band and rival outfit Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, whose viral success led to a sellout concert at the Japan Expo in Paris in 2012 and a world tour the following year. &quot;I see them more as a novelty act, and by definition that means they&apos;re probably going to be a one-off,&quot; he said. &quot;And Babymetal aren&apos;t really being marketed as a Japanese act. They&apos;re coming out of leftfield, so I&apos;m sceptical about this being the start of something bigger for J-pop.&quot; Just as South Koreans had been listening to Psy for years before he became a household name with Gangnam Style in the summer of 2012, Babymetal are hardly new \u2013 they formed three years ago \u2013 and have since appeared on Japan&apos;s festival circuit, performing twice at Summer Sonic in Tokyo and Osaka. At the end of last year, they performed overseas for the first time, in Singapore, on the back of their Death Match tour of Japan.

In a report published on Tuesday, the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and the Humane Society International (HSI) called on Japan&apos;s biggest online retailer to stop selling the items. According to the groups, Rakuten&apos;s website carries more than 28,000 advertisements for elephant ivory and 1,200 for whale products. Many of the whale products originated from species that have been protected since 1986 under the moratorium on commercial whaling established by the International Whaling Commission, the groups said in their Blood E-Commerce report. The species receive the highest level of protection by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which prohibits international trade, the report said, adding: &quot;Despite this, a number of companies were selling endangered fin whale imported from Iceland.&quot; Fourteen of the products did not list the names of the species used, in violation of Japanese labeling laws, it said. &quot;We call on Rakuten subsidiaries in the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Austria and elsewhere to urgently press Rakuten headquarters in Japan to ban all ads offering ivory and whale products,&quot; said Kitty Block, vice-president of HSI. The firm, with operating profits of US$244m in 2012 and more than 10,000 employees worldwide, has expanded its international presence in recent years. Its acquisitions include Buy.com [now Rakuten Shopping] in the US and Play.com in the UK. It owns the Canadian e-book reader Kobo and is a major shareholder in Pinterest. The company did not respond to the Guardian&apos;s requests for comment. Clare Perry, head of EIA&apos;s cetaceans campaign, said sales of whale meat and ivory cast doubt on Rakuten&apos;s commitment to sustainability. &quot;We are committed to promoting policies which will prevent global warming and protect the environment,&quot; the company&apos;s website says. The firm&apos;s claim that it wished to protect the environment &quot;can only be cynical lip service as long as it banks the profits of products derived from threatened or endangered species,&quot; she said. Rakuten, which has expanded its online presence overseas, has so far resisted international pressure to drop the sale of products made from whale. Japanese supermarket chains, including Ito-Yokado and Seiyu, have prohibited the sale of whale and dolphin products in thousands of stores, while Amazon and Google have stopped all sales and advertisements of whale, dolphin and ivory through their Japanese e-commerce sites. Last May, a farm outside Tokyo agreed to stop selling luxury pet food made from endangered fin whales following a campaign by conservation groups. Campaigners said tests had revealed that some cetacean products advertised by Rakuten contained high levels of mercury. Eight out of nine whale products the groups ordered through the site last year exceeded the Japanese national limit for total mercury concentration of 0.4 parts per million (ppm). One sample of pilot whale had a mercury concentration of 9.5ppm, more than 20 times higher than the Japanese regulatory limit. The average mercury level of the nine products was 4.2ppm, more than 10 times higher than the regulatory limit.     28,000 listings for ivory were found on the Japanese site Rakuten. Tusks in Japan are often used to create personal seals, known as as hanko    About 22,000 African elephants were killed in 2012, a rate that conservationists warn could lead to their extinction in local areas. About 80% of tusks in Japan are used to make hanko, personal seals that are commonly used to sign documents. Other items on the Rakuten site included a large carved tusk selling for 2.94 million yen [US$28,186]. &quot;Rakuten&apos;s ads are effectively as deadly as giving bullets to elephant poachers and harpoons to whalers,&quot; said EIA&apos;s president, Allan Thornton. &quot;[It] must act immediately to ban all ads selling elephant and whale products, or its global brand will be irrevocably tainted with the ongoing mass slaughter of these species.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["They enjoyed Tokyo, with Tony Blair in tow, while Fukushima\u00a0was still on the boil."], "tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "Vladimir Putin", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-18T23:00:00Z", "title": "Hugh Muir's diary: Behold the perils of giving advice to President Putin", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/18/hugh-muirs-diary-putin-tourism", "article": "\u2022 Not long now before about 1,000 bigwigs from the World Travel &amp;\u00a0Tourism Council jet into Hainan in the South China Sea for the body&apos;s next\u00a0global summit.

But then he has always had particular ideas about\u00a0how to draw a crowd. \u2022 Another day, another revelation. We know that undercover cops were deployed to spy on those around the Stephen Lawrence family and, thanks to the BBC, we have good reason to suspect that a &quot;lorry load&quot; of info about police corruption was shredded. We also know attempts were made to coerce students to spy on each other, and that anti-racist protesters were urged to act as copper&apos;s narks. For every action a reaction, and here it manifests as a series of training courses teaching lawyers how best to bring court cases against errant police forces. Places are hard to secure; the first actions against the police (advanced) course sold out quickly, and a &quot;policing the police&quot; session scheduled for June seems just as popular. &apos;Twas ever the case; where&apos;s there&apos;s murk, there&apos;s brass. \u2022 And ever was the case that revellers head for the Irish embassy expecting to make a good night of it. They are rarely disappointed. The high point came in 2006, when the then Bishop of Southwark drank a bit, got into a stranger&apos;s car and sustained a mystery head injury. Everyone still speaks of it. At a St Patrick&apos;s Day reception, ambassador Daniel Mulhall boasted that the embassy still puts on the best party in town. And the guest of honour was Pat Rabitte, Irish minister for communications. He behaved impeccably. But in keeping with tradition, one guest tripped down the open staircase, knocked himself out and had to be carried to an ambulance. At the party&apos;s end, guests were shown out via the back stairs.

The gonzo J-pop star\u2019s videos are an all-out assault on the senses, bombarding the viewer with an overwhelming sense of cuteness (or kawaii \u2013 the notion that cuteness and innocence, usually non-threatening, is desirable in Japanese society).  Princess dresses, platform boots, multicoloured farts, childish exclamations and dance movements, dancing blackberries, puppies, polar bears, manga imagery, fluorescent colours clashing, cutesy ghosts, floating brains: psychedelic as imagined by the makers of Hello Kitty.  \u201cWhen you see little kids or animals you think they are kawaii,\u201d the singer explains from Tokyo, before she heads to Sydney to play a live date this Sunday. \u201cIt pretty much depends on your sensitivity. Most of all I am attracted to a world of fantasy with a grotesque aspect to it.\u201d             In this sense, Kyary is subversive. Her creations \u2013 and videos like the ones to her iconic (and insanely catchy) 2011 debut single Pon Pon Pon and unsettling Candy Candy (the opening sequence is a shot of her running down a grey suburban street in pink platform boots with a slice of dry toast in her mouth) \u2013 jolt the viewer out of the normalcy of everyday life. In this, she recalls Lady Gaga; but Gaga is overt in her desire to unsettle, her fondness for S&amp;M imagery. Kyary Pamyu Pamyu is scarier somehow, because her imagery is so surface unthreatening. Like when Dumbo breaks into that wonderful pink elephants on parade sequence, the endearing becomes threatening.  \u201cEven with a Disney movie you cannot keep your eyes away from it,\u201d agrees Kyary, \u201cpartly because there are some scary scenes. I like something like that very much, something unbalanced.\u201d  On the surface, it would be easy to dismiss Kyary\u2019s music as irredeemably happy \u2013 it\u2019s relentless and chirpy enough \u2013 but there\u2019s much more to it than that. She\u2019s like My Little Pony as reimagined by Tim Burton, as evinced by the video to her most recent single, 2013\u2019s Mottai Night Land, which combines manga with garden demons and some really quite disturbing bikini-clad dancers in ghost masks.             \u201cI love horror movies, and I do have lots of dark sides. It shows up on daily basis,\u201d she says. \u201cSome ideas are from kind of my fun and dark side. I like eyeballs and blood.

When I go to Harajuku, I dressed normal when I went out and I changed in a public bathroom.\u201d  Based in a trendy district of Tokyo, Harajuku fashion is characterised by its brashness and outlandish sense of colour, where elements of the bizarre and the absurd mix in with fantastical western pop star-inspired clothing. \u201cHarajuku is a place where people enjoy their favourite fashion as they wish,\u201d says Kyary. \u201cEspecially there is no rule when it comes to Harajuku fashion.\u201d             Kyary, with her attraction towards kawaii and her sense of the grotesque, naturally pushed at its limits. \u201cVery individualistic people gather in that place and you can easily find unique shops everywhere. The spirit is that I am not the same as others. I don\u2019t want to be the same as Harajuku culture, I think.\u201d Her name came about while she was still in a high school because, \u201cI often hung out wearing a blonde wig so my friends teased me and called me \u2018Kyary\u2019 like a foreigner.

She was scouted as a street fashion model, later writing a blog documenting her everyday looks and exploits for the Japanese website Ameba. This, in turn, led to guest spots as a DJ which eventually resulted in a chance meeting with producer Yasutaka Nakata, the man behind her debut album 2011\u2019s Moshi Moshi Harajuku, and Pon Pon Pon, an immediate hit both in Japan and abroad. \u201cOne day [Yasutaka] was like \u2018Do you want to sing?\u2019 Then time passed and when I realised I am singing and dancing like I do now.\u201d            There are indications of a western pop influence upon Kyary\u2019s videos \u2013 notably Lady Gaga (witness the mask and throne used in Tsukematsukeru) and Katy Perry, something which the singer is happy to acknowledge. \u201cI always look up to artists who blend their music with fashion, and I want to be one,\u201d she says. \u201cI am not just trying to imitate what they are doing. I want to express my own version of music and fashion with a happy spirit.\u201d So how does Kyary view the attention she is receiving from western audiences?

However, the requirement for market positioning can sometimes lead to books being labelled as crime fiction when they have only a tangential connection with what this label is, even\u00a0in a very general way, supposed to represent. Parade, the first novel by\u00a0Shuichi Yoshida, translated from the Japanese by Philip Gabriel (Harvill Secker, \u00a312.99), is a good example of\u00a0this. Four dysfunctional twenty-somethings share a Tokyo flat. The\u00a0girls are Kotomi, who watches television and waits endlessly for her actor boyfriend to call, and Mirai, who gets drunk every night in gay bars. The boys are Ryosuke, who is obsessed with his friend&apos;s girlfriend, and film buff Naoki. Each takes his or her turn as narrator, together with homeless rent boy Satoru, who is brought back one night\u00a0by Mirai and takes up residence. Something very strange is happening in the flat next door, while out in the streets, women are being attacked, seemingly at random. So far, so creepy, but unfortunately, not enough else happens. It&apos;s a sharply observed slice\u00a0of urban alienation, but, unlike Yoshida&apos;s wonderful Villain (written later, but published in the UK in 2010), Parade simply doesn&apos;t have enough of the right kind of narrative welly to develop into a crime novel.     Baba this    Subverting the genre is, of course, quite another matter. Babayaga by\u00a0Toby Barlow (Corvus, \u00a312.99) does that all right, with splatter-gun plotting set in cold war Paris. It features Will, an adman, whose best friend and fellow American, literary journalist Oliver, turns out to\u00a0be an agent for the CIA, and\u00a0Zoya, a beautiful and eternally youthful witch who has just murdered her lover. Elga, Zoya&apos;s elderly mentor, keeps the police off both their backs by\u00a0turning them into fleas. Oh, and there are strung-out jazzmen, weaponised hallucinogenic drugs, caches of hidden rifles and hefty dollops of Russian folklore. The whole\u00a0thing is weirdly riveting.     No Regrets Coyote    Very much dependent on the sharp observations and wry humour of the central character, No Regrets, Coyote by John Dufresne (Serpent&apos;s Tail, \u00a310) might not be to everyone&apos;s taste, either. As professional therapist, volunteer forensic consultant and resident of south Florida, Wylie &quot;Coyote&quot; Melville himself states: &quot;A\u00a0lack of narrative structure, as you know, can cause anxiety.&quot; However, despite the author&apos;s tendency to go haring off in all\u00a0directions \u2013 Coyote&apos;s father&apos;s Alzheimer&apos;s, his new kitten Django, his\u00a0therapy sessions, the magician friend who can slice a banana in half with a Frisbeed playing card and\u00a0the homeless man who has taken up residence on his front lawn. But this wonderful, off-beat novel, in which our\u00a0hero is called to a Christmas Eve massacre at a family home where the father has apparently shot his wife and children before turning the gun on himself, is bold, funny, and extremely enjoyable.     Someone Else's Skin    Those with a taste for\u00a0something more conventional will find themselves on safe ground with Sarah Hilary&apos;s first novel, Someone Else&apos;s Skin (Headline, \u00a313.99). A London-based police procedural featuring an investigator, DI Marnie Rome, who carries the requisite emotional baggage \u2013 in her case, the murder of her parents by her foster-brother \u2013 and a sidekick with impeccable outsider credentials, it begins when, on a visit to interview a\u00a0potential witness at a women&apos;s shelter, the pair find one of the inmates&apos; husbands lying stabbed on the floor. With a well-managed drip-feed of information and a genuinely intriguing plot that revolves around various types of domestic violence, Someone Else&apos;s Skin is, despite a tendency to trip over its own feet in some of the descriptive passages, an intelligent, assured and very promising\u00a0debut.     irene-pierre-lemaitre    Ir\u00e8ne is the debut novel from Pierre Lemaitre, translated from the French by Frank Wynne (MacLehose, \u00a316.99). It&apos;s the prequel to Alex, which was published in the UK last year and won\u00a0the crime writers&apos; association international dagger, and the first outing of the small but perfectly formed Commandant Camille Verhoeven, who, when the novel opens, is happily married and expecting his first child with wife Ir\u00e8ne. Investigating a series of particularly savage murders, Verhoeven is confronted with crime scenes that are literal recreations of passages from James Ellroy, Bret Easton Ellis, John D MacDonald, and the like. When he engages with the killer through a series of advertisements, things start to get personal ...

An era \u2013 often fleeting, enjoyed by some more than others \u2013 when new ideas and technologies and economic systems burst into view. When things that were solid start to\u00a0melt. When the future is at once thrilling and terrifying \u2013 and seems to have landed suddenly in the present. In Delhi, according to Rana Dasgupta (right), that time was around the turn of the millennium. The novelist, who had been raised in England and later worked as a marketing consultant in the US, came to the Indian capital on account of love. The hype surrounding the Bric countries, to\u00a0say nothing of the grand folly and world stage-strutting represented by the 2010 Commonwealth Games, still\u00a0lay ahead. For all his scepticism about the urban transformations unleashed by finance minister Manmohan Singh&apos;s 1991 decision to liberalise the economy, Dasgupta \u2013 and the young writers, artists and intellectuals with whom he\u00a0plotted and debated through long nights \u2013 felt imaginatively insurgent: &quot;The old was dying, the new was in preparation, and we were living in the\u00a0in-between, when nothing was resolved, everything was potential.&quot; Dasgupta&apos;s conceptually rich fictions\u00a0Tokyo Cancelled and Solo deal\u00a0with ruptures and accelerations, disappearances and displacements, the circuits and psychological wiring of globalisation. Those themes appear in\u00a0Capital, too, where Delhi time is described as &quot;macabre&quot; and &quot;fast-dissolving&quot;: &quot;To be here is to exist in that kind of time in which everything is old even when it is new, in which everything is always already lost to decay and obsolescence.&quot; This emergent Delhi, its population having shot up at least 20% to over 16\u00a0million in the last decade, is hard to grasp. It&apos;s not walkable in the way that Calcutta is: cars, which are increasingly dominant, allow the city to be seen as &quot;a strobe-lit succession of unrelated glimpses&quot;. The opulence of new compounds is so strange it requires descriptive language straight out of science fiction: a building is likened to\u00a0&quot;two space stations&quot;, one of which\u00a0&quot;floats free of the\u00a0earth&quot;. Dasgupta is well-connected enough to have access to the city&apos;s gilded movers and shakers, those CEOs, entrepreneurs and aristocrats who would never normally talk to the press. They&apos;re golf-playing, Lamborghini-owning global types, whose families are educated at Oxbridge and Ivy League colleges, who zip about from Paris to Tokyo to Geneva, and who think nothing of buying 700,000 acres of Ethiopian land to develop sugar and flower plantations. His most entertaining informants include a homosexual fashion-designer who observes that &quot;The gay scene is amazing now. When I came here there was none of that. The only way I could have sex was to fuck a taxi driver because his wife was in the village and\u00a0he was horny.&quot; There&apos;s also a drug\u00a0dealer who laments not only the passing of bohemian MDMA-fuelled parties, but the way his 24-hour city now runs on cocaine. &quot;That fucking politician \u2013 he doesn&apos;t sleep for two or three days. He just finishes the night, puts some water on his face and a suit on, and then he turns up at meetings fucking hyper, you can tell, you know.&quot; It&apos;s common for writers about Indian cities to be appalled by the disparities between the rich and poor. Dasgupta is unusual in highlighting the damage to the middle classes wrought by deregulation. Many of these people, according to one dismaying chapter, have begun to forgo state-run hospitals in favour of private centres, which are as pricey as luxury hotels and whose well-paid surgeons, forced to bring in revenue to their employers, subject patients to multiple MRI\u00a0scans, increase rates of Caesarian births because they can be timetabled more efficiently, and prescribe treatments pushed by pharmaceutical companies. The new economy is propelled by a\u00a0real\u2011estate boom that means three\u2013bedroom flats in south Delhi cost $500,000, 50% of which has to be paid in cash, a requirement that suits &quot;black-money businessmen, criminals, or corrupt public servants&quot;. Meanwhile, perhaps half the city&apos;s population lives in slums, squatted dwellings, on the street. Dasgupta contrasts poor womengathering water from dripping faultlines and from flooded potholes with the wealthy who illegally dig private wells for their washing machines and swimming pools. Capital is full of wounds. Some date\u00a0from Partition, when more than a\u00a0million people were slaughtered or starved. Their silences are characterised as &quot;residual trauma, like DDT in the food chain, and became more concentrated with time&quot;. Some date from Indira Gandhi&apos;s state of emergency in\u00a0the 1970s and the anti-Sikh pogroms in 1984. Together these served not only to destroy a culture of inter-religious conviviality but to diminish a quality that Dasgupta prizes in his friends: &quot;a fierce intelligence searching for a better arrangement of the world&quot;. Traditionally, Indian women have been obliged, not least during periods of upheaval and turbulence, to act as symbols of domestic spirituality, unchanging purity. Now growing numbers are more independent, out\u00a0working, living with unmarried partners. Dasgupta, in one of many fascinating forays into psychosexual speculation, suggests that Delhi&apos;s status as India&apos;s rape capital has nothing to do with migrants or the underclass. Rather it represents a &quot;war against women whose new mobility made them not only the icons of India&apos;s social and economic changes but also the scapegoats&quot;. By the end of Capital, Dasgupta finds Delhi&apos;s magic, just like its rate of\u00a0GDP growth, on the wane. Twilight masquerades as dawn. The Commonwealth Games, which at $4bn cost 16 times more than originally budgeted, failed to deliver the long-term spike in\u00a0public serotonin levels that had been\u00a0promised. Quite the reverse: it highlighted levels of corruption that meant toilet paper was supplied to organisers at $80 per roll. &quot;Middle-class people worked and prospered in this society,&quot; he observes, &quot;but they had no image of what, who, how or why it was, and this left them fretful and unmoored.&quot; That&apos;s surely true not just of Delhi, but of cities all around the world. Dasgupta&apos;s combination of reportage, political critique and oral history is mordant rather than dyspeptic, sorrowful rather than castigatory. But\u00a0what makes it more than a local study, what makes it so haunting, is that its textured, tart accounts of the privatisation of public space, of the incestuous relationship between the political and business classes, of the precarity that renders daily life so fraught all apply as much to Britain and\u00a0the west as they do to the Indian capital. In fact, as Dasgupta spells out: &quot;To look at contemporary Delhi is to look at the symptoms of the global 21st century in their most glaring and advanced form.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["They might be traditionally religious spots, but they needn&apos;t be: Weiner&apos;s personal list includes Istanbul&apos;s Blue Mosque, but also Hong Kong airport and a\u00a0hole-in-the-wall Tokyo bar."], "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Psychology", "Leonardo da Vinci"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-22T09:00:00Z", "title": "This column will change your life: where heaven and Earth collide", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/22/this-column-change-your-life-heaven-earth", "article": "I was in Milan, alone, for work, with time to kill, so\u00a0I\u00a0bowed to tourist cliche and went to see the Last Supper. The only slot available was early on Sunday, and just after sunrise the city was deserted; I\u00a0reached the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie as the priest was welcoming the first worshippers. Minutes later, I was escorted, with 20\u00a0others, through security doors to\u00a0the dim convent hall where Leonardo&apos;s painting fills one wall. The hour added something otherworldly to the atmosphere. None of us seemed fully awake; the silence felt tangible. I&apos;m\u00a0aware this was a boringly predictable location in which to feel the spine-shiver of something beyond words (transcendent? divine?). But I did, and powerfully. I&apos;m no expert, but maybe there&apos;s a\u00a0reason this particular picture of some guys eating some bread is more celebrated than any other. There is a name for spaces such as this: &quot;thin places&quot;, a Celtic Christian term for &quot;those rare locales where the distance between heaven and Earth collapses&quot;, as Eric Weiner puts it in his spirituality travelogue, Man Seeks God. They&apos;ve been called &quot;the places in the world where the walls are weak&quot;, where another dimension seems nearer than usual. They might be traditionally religious spots, but they needn&apos;t be: Weiner&apos;s personal list includes Istanbul&apos;s Blue Mosque, but also Hong Kong airport and a\u00a0hole-in-the-wall Tokyo bar. The Irish origins of the phrase won&apos;t surprise anyone who&apos;s stood on windswept Donegal cliffs or watched dolphins off the Sheep&apos;s Head peninsula, when thought falls away and only a\u00a0luminous quality remains. Non-religious people, like me, seek non-religious explanations for what&apos;s going on, and psychologists have tried to help. Perhaps it&apos;s related to &quot;emotional residue&quot;, which describes the way we can&apos;t help thinking of rooms previously occupied by sad people as having a sad vibe. In Milan, was I imagining the residual raptures of 15th-century Christians? In her book The Power Of Place, the science writer Winifred Gallagher even suggests that electromagnetic fields, generated by certain kinds of rock, might make some locations feel strange. She quotes one neuroscientist speculating that mystical visions at a Coptic church near Cairo might have been related to\u00a0seismic activity nearby. Maybe. But I&apos;m not sure I want to know what brain scans tell us about thin places, or how people respond to psychology questionnaires right after visiting the Grand Canyon. We&apos;re in the territory, here, of the ineffable: the stuff we can&apos;t express because it&apos;s beyond the power of language to do so. Explanations aren&apos;t merely useless; they threaten to get in the way. The experience of a thin place feels special because words fail, leaving stunned silence. &quot;Anybody who goes through life with open mind and open heart will encounter these moments of revelation,&quot; writes Roger Scruton, the philosopher. &quot;Moments that are saturated with meaning, but whose meaning cannot be put into words.&quot; My Milanese moment was swiftly punctured. I&apos;d rented an audioguide handset, and on my way out left it in a tray marked &quot;audioguide return&quot;. Inexplicably, this enraged the attendant, who yelled at me for not handing it to her instead. &quot;Why you do that?!&quot; I was back to ordinary life with a jolt. Outside, the sunlight was bright; the traffic was building. With the Last Supper fading into memory, I went to find some breakfast. \u2022 oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com Follow Oliver on Twitter."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Receiving this prize is a great honour, and with it, I must be careful,&quot; said Ban, who splits his time between offices in Tokyo, Paris and New York."], "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-24T21:58:37Z", "title": "Japanese architect Shigeru Ban wins 2014 Pritzker prize", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/24/japanese-architect-shigeru-ban-wins-2014-pritzker-prize", "article": "Paper and cardboard have long been part of an architect&apos;s toolbox for drawings and models of buildings, but for Japanese architect Shigeru Ban they are good enough to make the real thing.

Photograph: Didier Boy De La Tour/AP    Beginning with temporary exhibition designs, his experiments with cardboard engineering soon expanded in scope, from undulating grid-shell pavilions to the geodesic frame of his temporary office in Paris. Strapped limpet-like to the roof of the Pompidou Centre, this cardboard-framed tunnel was his base for designing the gallery&apos;s outpost in Metz, completed in 2010, itself conceived as a rippling rattan hat of bamboo and oiled paper. But it is for his humanitarian work, as much as for his houses and museums, that Ban caught the Pritzker jury&apos;s eye. &quot;He is a force of nature,&quot; said the jury chairman, Lord Palumbo, &quot;which is entirely appropriate in the light of his voluntary work for the homeless and dispossessed in areas devastated by natural disasters.&quot;     Ban's cardboard cathedral in Christchurch, New Zealand.

After founding the Voluntary Architects&apos; Network in 1995, he has tackled disaster relief in Turkey, India, China and Haiti, most recently erecting a magnificent cardboard cathedral after the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, rising in an elegant A-frame next to the ruins of George Gilbert Scott&apos;s stone building.

So when I was invited to Japan as part of a European Union delegation to learn more about Abenomics, this seemed the obvious thing to do. For those unfamiliar with Abenomics, it is the impressive brainchild of prime minister Shinz\u014d Abe, designed to shift the country once and for all out of its two-decade deflationary slump. The programme consists of three &quot;arrows&quot;: aggressive monetary policy, flexible fiscal policy and a new growth strategy. Arrows one and two flew from the bow last year and are widely judged to have hit their targets. The government has already spent 10tn yen (2% of GDP, \u00a360bn) on public projects and plans to spend a further 5tn yen in 2014. At the same time, the Bank of Japan aims to double Japan&apos;s monetary base within two years. Although some may quibble about the detail, none would argue that progress so far has been striking. According to the British Embassy in Tokyo, inflationary expectations are rising; business and consumer sentiment are at their highest level in six years; the Nikkei (a stock market index for the Tokyo stock exchange) has risen by 80% in what is expected to be its best year since 1972; employment levels are noticeably higher, while the unemployment rate is stable at 4.1%. The real test, however, is the third arrow: the new growth strategy. This consists of an ambitious package of structural reforms: to liberalise the electricity and pharmaceutical industries, to radically restructure Japanese agriculture, to reform the social security system, and to get more women into the workplace and into senior positions. There are no fewer than 30 supporting bills going through the Japanese parliament this year. Yet here the consensus is more mixed. Japan has a tortured history implementing structural reform, with the blame often pinned on an over-bureaucratic civil service. In the words of a former kyaria (fast stream) civil servant, professor Ko Mishima, &quot;Japan is a showcase of bureaucratic paralysis.&quot; As a former civil servant, responsible in my latter years for innovation at the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), I was struck by the parallels with regular criticisms of the British civil service. Indeed it is a common refrain across most advanced economies, as nations and trading blocs wrestle with the challenges of an ageing population and flatlining public sector productivity. I wanted to explore this further, and visited various government buildings. What struck me was just how quiet they were. Even DCLG in the dog days of 2010 seemed to have more energy. The second thing that struck me were the corridors and the offices. Corridors and offices? Not open plan? It felt so \u2026 20th century. Of course, this might be no more than the common bias and prejudice that comes from a superficial exposure to a foreign culture. Yet when I talked for example about the UK government&apos;s recent attempts to embed continuous improvement in Whitehall (remember, Japan is the home of kaizen) I was met with a combination of incomprehension and incredulity. More than one civil servant told me how they regularly worked well into the night \u2013 seeing this as a badge of pride rather than a potential signal of low productivity. To its credit, Japan has barely a third as many civil servants per capita as the UK. Yet even here, its approach to personnel management felt antediluvian. Once civil servants have passed their entrance examination, they choose which department they will work for and remain with it for the rest of their careers. Mishima talks of &quot;departmentalism, collusion with special interests, manipulation of administrative knowledge and ... lack of accountability&quot; as some of the more obvious consequences of this approach. Yet despite these differences, I came away from Tokyo with a profound sense of the similarity between our two public sectors. Both are staffed by bright, dedicated and hardworking people. Both are clearly imbued with a strong public service ethos. And both are struggling with the complexities of modern government. In any event, by pinning their worries on the civil service, I suspect the critics of Abe&apos;s third arrow are themselves missing the point. A bit like early-years Thatcherism, it is wrong to think about Abenomics purely in terms of economic and institutional reform. It is just as much about &quot;faith&quot;, about &quot;the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen&quot;, to quote Saint Paul. Abenomics is about showing faith in the Japanese people that the country can shake off its torpor and return once again to the forefront of the world economy.

Think of some of the things now taken for granted that felt bold at the time: the inaugural Rugby World Cup (1987), the five-point try (1992), the advent of professionalism (1995). When people blithely trot out the cliche that rugby will never take off in the US, they do so with the same confidence the Flat Earth Society used to exude in the good old days before satellite technology spoiled everything. Look at the evidence and make up your own mind. The population of the US is more than 310 million. Olympic recognition for rugby sevens has freed up the sort of national funding that had been a distant dream. There are thousands of American footballers and basketball players who are not going to gain a professional NFL or NBA contracts but who are increasingly realising there is a global sport that potentially suits their skill set perfectly. Perhaps the most feared forward in the Premiership, Northampton&apos;s Samu Manoa, is an American international. The All Blacks are set to play a Test in the States \u2013 the likely venue is Soldier Field, Chicago \u2013 on 1 November. Stick it all together and you have a country that, one day, really could play ball with the best of them. The $60m question, surely, is when rather than if. The 2016 Olympics in Rio will have the American women&apos;s sevens team pushing for a medal. In last week&apos;s Tokyo leg of the HSBC Sevens, the American men beat Samoa and drew with the eventual champions Fiji. There are 25 rugby players training full time at the US Olympic training centre in California; the vast majority are sevens players but not exclusively so. Premiership clubs will also once again be flying out to monitor the national college sevens in Philadelphia at the end of May, an event screened by NBC Sports. A company called RugbyLaw is trying to establish a professional club tournament in the US and is holding trials in Minnesota early next month \u2013 presided over by the former Ireland coach Eddie O&apos;Sullivan \u2013 for gridiron athletes keen to pursue a union career. They include a former wide receiver named Yamon Figurs, who apparently makes the American sevens blur, Carlin Isles, look pedestrian. The concept of &quot;crossover&quot; athletes is definitely on the rise. All it needs is for something \u2013 or someone \u2013 to stoke public interest on a wider scale. It could just happen this Saturday. If the USA Eagles defeat Uruguay in Atlanta, Georgia, they will qualify for next year&apos;s Rugby World Cup in England \u2013 in the same group as South Africa, Scotland, Samoa and Asia 1 (probably Japan), and kick-start all kinds of fresh star-spangled possibilities. The International Rugby Board believes American-based rugby supporters are already in the top three in terms of numbers when it comes to travelling abroad to watch Rugby World Cups. It does not require much imagination, should they make it to next year&apos;s tournament, to foresee Eagles fans enjoying themselves in Brighton before and after their potential opening pool game against Samoa, or relishing a trip to the Olympic Stadium, where they would be facing South Africa. Yes, the flat-earthers will say, but the Americans were stating this in the early 1990s and they are still nowhere near becoming a consistent international force. But steady on. In November, the Eagles defeated Georgia the week before their opponents beat the not inconsiderable might of Samoa. They should also have beaten an (admittedly weakened) Ireland last June and are already licking their lips at the prospect of Scotland&apos;s visit to Houston on 7 June. Admittedly, they only drew 27-27 with Uruguay in last week&apos;s first-leg qualifier, almost falling foul of their hosts&apos; superior scrummaging muscle, but their European-based pros were still blinking away their jet lag. This week, with Northampton&apos;s Manoa, Leicester&apos;s Blaine Scully, Saracens&apos; Chris Wyles et al able to enjoy a full week of preparation, they will fully expect to make home advantage pay. In the background, too, there is increasing private money being invested to try to strengthen the grassroots of American rugby, with some other interesting organisations doing their best to accelerate that process. Among them is Serevi Rugby, who count the former Rugby World Cup tournament manager Ross Young and the former England sevens international Ben Gollings as chief executive and lead coach respectively. Armed with corporate and private equity investment, Young and his group hope to fill the gaps that USA Rugby, presided over by the former England captain Nigel Melville, cannot always reach. &quot;Until I came across I didn&apos;t realise rugby is as big as it is, especially around the smaller colleges in the US and in terms of the women&apos;s game,&quot; Young says. &quot;Our role is to drive awareness further, get kids involved from as young an age as possible and help provide a pathway through to national representation.&quot; Representing the US at the Olympics is an obvious carrot but, stresses Young, there is also recognition that progress is not only about the top of the pyramid. &quot;The long-term goal is to make rugby successful in the US. It took soccer a long while but they certainly have a strong foothold here now.&quot; The thousands of Samoan and Tongan ex-pats in the Bay area of San Francisco where Manoa grew up offer obvious raw material; there is also a growing belief the spatial awareness of basketball players could make them even better rugby assets than more programmed gridiron linebackers or tightends. In the past few days, a New Zealand company, The Rugby Site, has sold its coaching modules to USA Rugby, which means any affiliated US coach can download tips from such names as Wayne Smith, Joe Schmidt and Richie McCaw to a mobile phone and instantly use them at training. The rugby world is changing fast. So, no pressure on the Eagles to get the job done in Atlanta this Saturday. &quot;Rugby World Cup qualification is massively important,&quot; Young says. &quot;NBC showed the 2011 tournament on terrestrial television for the first time and there&apos;s talk about them doing more. They&apos;ve put on Premiership games prior to Premier League football on a Saturday morning. Sport is hugely aspirational over here and success at national level is crucial.&quot; It might take another two decades for the American dream to be realised fully but to insist it will never happen in a million years is the kind of nihilistic thinking rugby union needs to eradicate. Wilko and out No one could fail to wish Jonny Wilkinson all the best when he finally hangs up his boots \u2013 and kicking tees \u2013 at the end of the season. After all the injuries he has sustained, no modern player is more deserving of the luxury of picking his preferred time to go. The only faint alarm bells surround what precisely he will do next. He is brilliant with children and would make a brilliant Beckham-esque role model/ambassador but Leigh Halfpenny&apos;s kicking coach at Toulon?

Even though Kazancheev is originally from the town of Tashtagol in southern Siberia, these two men only started making music seriously when they found themselves living on neighboring streets in Moscow.

Following their 2012 debut release, Canyon, the duo has made its comeback with Crystal, dDropping more than a clubby element that marked their previous offerings to focus, instead, on warm guitar riffs.

On Please Dream Again Wilson\u2019s vocals are crystalline and beautifully complimented by the simplicity of the keyboard and synth. As the track grows, a whistle echoes the tonality of his vocals and growling synths begin to wash over the rest of the track. The ending is, deep, momentous and closes out with a final return to quiet simplicity in synths.

Her third solo album in as many years, we\u2019re slightly ashamed that we\u2019re only just coming across the Norwegian Grammy nominated artist now but there\u2019s nothing quite like making up for lost time. Built around Kolst\u00f8\u2019s distorted, ever so slightly off key vocals One Plus One Makes One Out Of Two is as beautiful as it is ugly. Shuddering into life with creeping electronic noises and rolling percussion claps, the quietly poppy offering is soon bolstered by looping synths before a string of harsh yet irresistibly smooth and jubilant hooks escape Kolst\u00f8\u2019s lungs as if her life depended upon it.

And there\u2019s always that weird indie stigma that comes along with it. And mainstream Japanese music is so candy coated and manufactured, that while despite all the fun it does get a bit grating after a while. So it\u2019s nice to occasionally find good pop music that\u2019s as sincere and unironic as Awesome City Club. Inspired by disco, soul and R&amp;B, along with American indie and Britpop, Awesome City Club formed late last year. But don\u2019t let any of that fool you; these guys have all honed their chops through various bands, such as Thatta and This Is Panic, and are anything but amateurs. They\u2019ve only released two music videos so far, Children and now Lesson, but it\u2019s clear that with their clever, rhythmic arrangements and beautiful melodies that Awesome City Club are definitely a band to look out for.

Loud, uncompromising noise, machine-bred in a pit of hellish improvisation. Celebrating a decade of operation this year, their discography so far numbers only two full-fledged records, yet is nonetheless regarded as some of the most intriguing and simultaneously challenging musical output in the land. The live acoustic version of Drumtree sees them abandon the frenetic abrasiveness of the album recording, instead crafting fragile melodies with light rhythmic flourishes.

Growth, however is slowing down year over year and the task of convincing consumers who have not yet invested in a tablet to take the plunge will become increasingly more difficult. 53% of US consumers interviewed in 4Q13 said they will not buy a tablet in the next 12 months while 34% were unsure.

The electronic holy war &gt;&gt; The New Yorker  In May, 1997, IBM&apos;s Deep Blue supercomputer prevailed over Garry Kasparov in a series of six chess games, becoming the first computer to defeat a world-champion chess player. Two months later, the New York Times offered machines another challenge on behalf of a wounded humanity: the two-thousand-year-old Chinese board game wei qi, known in the West as Go. The article said that computers had little chance of success: &quot;It may be a hundred years before a computer beats humans at Go \u2013 maybe even longer.&quot; Last March, 16 years later, a computer program named Crazy Stone defeated Yoshio Ishida, a professional Go player and a five-time Japanese champion. The match took place during the first annual Densei-sen, or &quot;electronic holy war&quot; tournament, in Tokyo, where the best Go programs in the world play against one of the best humans. Ishida, who earned the nickname &quot;the Computer&quot; in the 1970s because of his exact and calculated playing style, described Crazy Stone as &quot;genius&quot;.  The victory was not quite a Deep Blue moment; Crazy Stone was given a small handicap, and Ishida is no longer in his prime. But it was an impressive feat.  Terrific piece by Patrick House. 40-pound calculators, the birth of Ethernet, and a $100bn mistake: a conversation with Bill Krause &gt;&gt; Andreessen Horowitz Krause explains the birth of the Ethernet jack:   When we did demos we also explained the technology this way: Ethernet worked the same way as human beings having a conversation. We are using the same medium, we are sharing the air. You talk, then I talk. If we start talking at the same time, we both stop, and someone re-initiates one side of the conversation. The reporters got it right away, and understood the advantage over other technologies, but it was Steve Jobs that added a critical piece that led to Ethernet&apos;s success. We had put Ethernet on a card, and instead of having to screw a tap we had a connector that looked a lot like the one you screw into your cable box and TV. And were all excited about it. We set up four PCs, and we called Steve Jobs who was a good friend and told him, &quot;You have to come over and see this demo.&quot; Steve comes over and we hook it up and show it to him. It was a classic Steve response: &quot;Who&apos;s the brain-dead asshole that came up with this shit? This is dreck, this is crap. You want to make it easy to install, just plug it into the telephone jack for cryin&apos; out loud.&quot; Why didn&apos;t we think of that? No one knows to this day that Steve Jobs deserves the credit for creating Ethernet the way it is today, and it is a part of why it beat out other competing technologies. It was another one of his brilliant insights around user interface.  Whole interview is great. Toshiba unveils &apos;industry&apos;s smallest&apos; white LED chip &gt;&gt; Tech-On!  Toshiba Corp developed what it claims is the industry&apos;s smallest (0.65 x 0.65mm) white LED for lighting applications. With the company&apos;s wafer-level CSP (chip scale package) technology, the footprint of the LED, &quot;CSP-LED,&quot; is 50% or more smaller than those of its competitors&apos; LEDs. Because the new LED allows to drastically reduce the size of light source, it enables to design lighting equipment more freely as well as to make use of space in which a conventional light source cannot be installed. Toshiba will start shipping samples of the LED in late April 2014.  Way better than CFL.

Iwao Hakamada was sentenced to hang in 1968 for the murders two years earlier of a company president, his wife and their two children in Shizuoka prefecture, central Japan. Hakamada, who was also convicted of burglary and arson in the same case, is thought to be the world&apos;s longest-serving death row inmate. The 78-year-old looked frail and unsteady as he emerged from the Tokyo prison with his sister Hideko, 81, who has campaigned for his release. Hakamada initially admitted carrying out the murders, but retracted the confession and insisted he was innocent throughout his two-year trial. The supreme court denied his first appeal for a retrial in 1980. In their most recent appeal to the Shizuoka district court, Hakamada&apos;s lawyers said the results of DNA test on items of bloodstained clothing belonging to their client proved the blood was not his. The presiding judge, Hiroaki Murayama, revoked the death sentence and ordered Hakamada&apos;s release pending the retrial. &quot;It is unjust to detain the defendant further, as the possibility of his innocence has become clear to a respectable degree,&quot; Murayama said.     Hideko Hakamada with a picture of her brother as a young man. Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images    Murayama said he was concerned that investigators could have falsified the evidence against Hakamada. &quot;There is a possibility that [key pieces of] evidence have been fabricated by investigative bodies,&quot; Murayama said in his ruling, according to Jiji Press. Courts in Japan rarely order retrials in cases involving capital punishment. Hakamada will become only the sixth death row inmate in the country to secure a retrial. In the five other cases, defendants were acquitted, while another is still pending. Ms Hakamada thanked dozens of her brother&apos;s supporters who had gathered in front of the court. &quot;Everyone, really, really thank you,&quot; she said through a loudspeaker. &quot;This happened thanks to all of you who helped us. I am just so happy.&quot; Before going to the Tokyo prison, she said: &quot;I want to see him as soon as I can and tell him: &apos;You really persevered.&apos;&quot; Media reports indicated that prosecutors would appeal against the ruling, ignoring pleas from defence lawyers who pointed to their client&apos;s failing health after decades on death row. Members of Hakamada&apos;s family say he is displaying symptoms of dementia and suffers from mental health problems. Campaigners against the death penalty have used Hakamada&apos;s case to draw attention to Japan&apos;s &quot;secret&quot; executions, accusing authorities of driving prisoners insane and subjecting them to &quot;cruel, inhuman and degrading&quot; treatment. In its latest annual review of the death penalty around the world, Amnesty International said Japan&apos;s use of capital punishment &quot;continued to be shrouded in secrecy&quot;. Death row inmates spend many years in solitary confinement, and only learn of the timing of their execution, by hanging, hours before it takes place. &quot;The Japanese authorities should be ashamed of the barbaric treatment Hakamada has received,&quot; said Roseann Rife, east Asia research director at Amnesty International. &quot;For more than 45 years he has lived under the constant fear of execution, never knowing from one day to the next if he is going to be put to death. This adds psychological torture to an already cruel and inhumane punishment.&quot; Critics have also voiced concern over the harsh tactics interrogators use to obtain confessions, which are then used as the basis for verdicts in the vast majority of cases. Japan has a conviction rate of about 99%. &quot;It would be most callous and unfair of prosecutors to appeal the court&apos;s decision. Time is running out for Hakamada to receive the fair trial he was denied more than four decades ago,&quot; Rife added. &quot;If ever there was a case that merits a retrial, this is it. Hakamada was convicted on the basis of a forced confession and there remain unanswered questions over recent DNA evidence.&quot; One of the three judges who convicted Hakamada has publicly stated he believes he is innocent. \u00a0 A total of 130 people are awaiting execution in Japan, which has resisted growing calls to abolish the death penalty. Executions resumed in March 2012 after a 20-month gap, with eight people hanged last year, the ninth highest number of any country. Pro-hanging politicians cite opinion polls in which a majority supports capital punishment, although campaigners say the surveys are worded in such a way as to play on the public&apos;s fear of crime. In a 2010 poll, 86% of respondents said the use of the death penalty was &quot;unavoidable&quot; \u2013 a sentiment that strengthened after a doomsday cult carried out a gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995, killing 13 people and injuring thousands more."}, {"sentences": ["Justin McCurry in Tokyo Italy  Italy&apos;s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is more than just an iPhone user \u2013 he is an Apple devotee who once had himself photographed beside the sign at the entrance to the company&apos;s headquarters."], "tags": ["Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "BlackBerry", "Apple", "BlackBerry corporation", "Computing", "iPhone", "Telecoms", "Samsung", "Angela Merkel", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Matteo Renzi", "LG", "Vladimir Putin"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-28T15:27:49Z", "title": "Which phones do world leaders use?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/28/which-phones-world-leaders-use", "article": "For years, the well-connected world leader would use nothing but a BlackBerry to get their email on the move \u2013 and it is still Barack Obama&apos;s phone of choice.

But the news earlier this month that the White House Communications Agency is testing other phones, including models by Samsung and LG, sent shivers through fans of the struggling Canadian smartphone company, which has just announced an annual loss of $5.8bn. For a world leader, security is much more than just having a passcode on your phone; it also means protecting it against attempted incursions from all the amateur and professional hackers, and more importantly spy agencies, who want to know to whom, when, what and where you have been speaking and reading. For a country&apos;s leader to have their phone eavesdropped is the ultimate failure of their national spy agency, and a huge loss of face. With enhancements, BlackBerry has been the spy agencies&apos; phone of choice to guard against that so far. Now, though, Apple and Samsung \u2013 the two largest makers of smartphones \u2013 are starting to knock on the security services&apos; doors. And what if BlackBerry goes away?

Jon Boone in Islamabad Russia      Vladimir Putin looks at a phone. He claims not to use one himself. Photograph: Ria Novosti/Reuters/Corbis    The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is famous for claiming to not have a mobile, unlike the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, who is known for his love of Apple products and became one of the first owners of an iPhone 4 when Steve Jobs gave him the still-unreleased phone in Silicon Valley. In 2006, Putin reportedly said he had many mobile phones but did not use any of them because he did not have time and preferred to use other methods of communication. But in 2010, the president said he did not have a phone at all: &quot;If I had a cellphone, it would ring all the time.&quot; But Putin&apos;s aversion could also be tied to security concerns ingrained in him from his time as a KGB spy. The president is also known to avoid the internet, instead preferring to get his information from regular reports by his intelligence agencies. A television documentary from Putin&apos;s office in 2012 showed red folders on his desk \u2013 probably intelligence reports \u2013 and a bank of old-fashioned beige telephones. Alec Luhn in Moscow France      Fran\u00e7ois Hollande on his phone. Photograph: Ruet Stephane/Story Box Photo/Rex    The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is inseparable from his iPhone 5. He is reported to be in constant contact via text messages with his girlfriend Julie Gayet. But the presidential iPhone is supposed to be for personal use only. Even before the Edward Snowden revelations about the US National Security Agency spying on French citizens, which forced government ministers to abandon smartphones and tablets for official use from last August, the French head of state was given an ultra-secure Teorem phone with encryption capabilities. But Hollande&apos;s predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, found the Teorem phone cumbersome, and refused to use it because it took 30 seconds to dial a connection, which &quot;took too long for him&quot;, according to an aide. Sarkozy, who had a BlackBerry addiction, did not seem too worried about cybersecurity in his early days as president: he was photographed handing his mobile to Vladimir Putin at the 2007 G8 summit in Heiligendamm as they shared a phone call. These days, the former president has become more circumspect. In order to (unsuccessfully) avoid phone taps, he bought a new mobile under the borrowed name of Paul Bismuth. The real Paul Bismuth is threatening legal action against the former president and his lawyer, a school friend of the French businessman who says his identity was stolen. Meanwhile, a French government memo advises ministerial phone users to adopt long passwords, which should be changed every six months, never to leave their phone unattended, particularly when travelling abroad, and never, ever, to use a smartphone for transmitting sensitive information, including in a text message.

Photograph: KNS/AFP    Speculation about Kim Jong-un&apos;s mobile phone use grew after he was photographed at a national security meeting in January 2013 with a smartphone that appeared to be made by the Taiwanese company HTC. South Korean media said the North Korean leader probably used his handset to call members of his family and senior officials in the Workers&apos; party of Korea. Kim is one of an estimated 2 million mobile phone users among North Korea&apos;s 25 million people. The country markets handsets as its own, but they are all made in China and rebadged with local brand names, according to Martyn Williams, who runs the North Korea Tech blog. Foreign models are also popular, but expensive. Use of mobiles in the North is confined to officials and their families, wealthy residents of the capital, Pyongyang, and, increasingly, businesspeople and traders with ties to China. Most phones run on the domestic 3G cellular service Koryolink, a joint venture between Egypt&apos;s Orascom Telecom and North Korea&apos;s Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, although users near China can pick up a signal from carriers across the border. North Korean subscribers are not permitted to access the internet via mobile phone \u2013 only to make calls and send texts inside the country. There is no international access. Foreign residents can use mobiles to communicate among themselves and make overseas calls, but not to contact local North Koreans, Williams said. Justin McCurry in Tokyo Italy  Italy&apos;s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is more than just an iPhone user \u2013 he is an Apple devotee who once had himself photographed beside the sign at the entrance to the company&apos;s headquarters.

Renzi has used his iPhone to send text messages of more than one sort.

Great Britain have not won the Davis Cup since 1936. They have played in a final once since 1937, when they lost 4-1 to the United States in 1978. Nearly all the nation&apos;s tennis history is buried in the past \u2013 except that made last summer by Andy Murray. The Wimbledon champion will again lead the team, more enthusiastically now, it has to be said, than he once did; when he declined to travel with them to Buenos Aires in 2008, his brother, Jamie, could not hide his displeasure. But Murray has since committed to the cause with rousing success, contributing significantly to the squad&apos;s sense of self-worth, and now palpably enjoys the experience, which is something of a safety valve in his grinding schedule on the Tour. He has long contended that the other players would develop more quickly were they not so dependent on his efforts, asking the awkward question: what did the country want \u2013 for him to win a grand slam title or help Great Britain in the Davis Cup? When he burst into tears after sealing a win over Luxembourg in Glasgow in 2011, partnering Jamie in the doubles, his priorities seemed to be reconciled to everyone&apos;s satisfaction. This time Murray has for allies the experienced doubles specialist Colin Fleming, James Ward and Dan Evans. Also travelling is Murray&apos;s close friend Ross Hutchins, fully recovered from cancer. If the tie looks safe after the opening singles, Hutchins could partner Fleming in the doubles, with the insurance of Murray to play again in the reverse singles on the final day. But Smith will not let sentiment cloud his judgment \u2013 not even for one player he could legitimately claim to have rescued from mediocrity. Since the shrewd Glaswegian took hold of the team in April 2010, Evans, who previously made more noise in bars around Birmingham than on any court, has responded to his quiet brand of encouragement only fitfully. He did not travel well. Indeed, he did not travel much at all, preferring to idle in domestic anonymity. Success on the ATP Tour has been fleeting, hitting a high point at the US Open last year when he pushed Tommy Robredo all the way in the third round (Robredo went on to beat Federer). But he was unabashed in revealing he felt most comfortable in the team environment and it is there where he has played his best. That Evans is no certainty to play in Naples is, paradoxically, one reason he will travel with enthusiasm rather than resignation. Once cushioned by grants and the praise of friends, he no longer feels entitled. He knows he has to earn his place. Smith, for instance, wanted him to stop off in Hawaii after the Australian Open to get accustomed to clay before the tie against the United States a few days later but Evans preferred to go home. He did not get picked. He is back in the picture, though. If he plays \u2013 especially with the vim he showed against Russia in Coventry last year \u2013 he will not leave much on the Neapolitan clay, even though it is not his favourite surface. Great Britain are accustomed to travelling as underdogs and it will be no different here \u2013 but they might have been handed a break with the likely withdrawal of Italy&apos;s best player, the world No14, Fabio Fognini, with the recurrence of a chronic thigh injury. The team captain, Corrado Barazzutti, who won the deciding match the last time Italy played Great Britain, at Telford in 1984, will wait until Thursday before ruling him in or out. If see Naples and die means anything, it surely does in a setting redolent of faded glory. The Carlo d&apos;Avalos centre court looks across the Viale Antonio Dohrn towards the Bay of Naples, where Caligula landed. Mount Vesuvius slumbers in the distance. At the entrance to the club, founded in 1905, graffiti and lime adorn the statue of a man on a horse. There is a whiff of history about it all. It is a good place to make some more.

The UN court\u2019s decision, by a 12-4 majority among a panel of judges, casts serious doubt over the long-term future of the jewel in the crown of Japan\u2019s controversial whaling programme. It also marks a dramatic victory for the Australian government, whose four-year campaign to ban the hunts rested on whether it could convince the court that Japan was using scientific research as a cover for commercial whaling. In its 2010 application to the court, Australia accused Japan of failing to \u201cobserve in good faith the zero catch limit in relation to the killing of whales\u201d. Under the International Whaling Commission\u2019s 1986 ban on commercial whaling, Japan was permitted to kill a certain number of whales every year for what it called scientific research. The sale of meat from the hunts in restaurants and supermarkets, while not illegal, prompted accusations from Australia and other anti-whaling nations that Japan was cloaking a commercial operation \u201cin the lab coat of science\u201d. In a lengthy ruling, the presiding judge in the Hague, Peter Tomka, said Japan had failed to prove that its pursuit of hundreds of mainly minke whales in Antarctic waters every winter \u2013 under a programme known as Jarpa II \u2013 was for scientific purposes. \u201cThe evidence does not establish that the programme\u2019s design and implementation are reasonable in relation to achieving its stated objectives,\u201d Tomka said. \u201cThe court concludes that the special permits granted by Japan for the killing, taking and treating of whales in connection with Jarpa II are not for purposes of scientific research,\u201d he added, before ordering Japan to cease its whaling programme \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d. Noriyuki Shikata, a spokesman for the Japanese delegation to the ICJ, said Japan was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the court\u2019s decision but would abide by it \u201cas a state that places great importance on the international legal order and the rule of law as a basis of the international community.\u201d \u201cIn terms of a future course of action, people in Tokyo will examine that, but we have made our position clear - that we will abide by the judgment,\u201d Shikata told the Guardian.  He said the ruling would not affect bilateral ties with Australia.  \u201cJapan and Australia are close economic and strategic partners with shared values and interests,\u201d he said. \u201cWe enjoy mature bilateral relations in many areas, so now it is important to ensure that our differences over whaling do not affect very good Japan-Australia relations as a whole.\u201d  Shikata said he did not interpret today\u2019s verdict as an attack on Japan\u2019s culture. \u201cWe made references to cultural differences and dietary traditions, but this case was about the legality of the programme under the whaling convention,\u201d he said. \u201cThe court ruling referred, for example, to a lack of scientific basis for sample sizes ... it wasn\u2019t about cultural differences.\u201d Campaigners welcomed the ruling. \u201cThis is an historic decision which lays to rest, once and for all, the grim travesty of Japan\u2019s so-called \u2018scientific\u2019 whaling and exposes it to the world as the blatant falsehood it clearly is,\u201d said Clare Perry, head of the cetaceans campaign at the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency. \u201cWith this ruling, Japan must clearly cease its whaling activities in the Antarctic.\u201d The court ruled that Japan had not complied with its obligations covering scientific research as set out in article 8 of the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. Japan, though, had maintained that its annual slaughter of 850 minke whales and up to 50 endangered fin whales every year was necessary to examine the age, health, feeding habits, exposure to toxins and other characteristics of whale populations, with a view to the possible resumption of sustainable commercial whaling. Officials in Tokyo said the data could not be obtained through non-lethal methods. Tomka, however, said Japan had not offered sufficient scientific justification for the slaughter of a large number of minke whales, while failing to kill enough fin and humpback whales to be of any scientific value. It had also failed to explore the possibility of gathering certain scientific data without resorting to killing the mammals, he added. In its defence, Japan cited only two peer-reviewed scientific papers relating to its program from 2005 to the present, during which it has harpooned 3,600 minke whales, a handful of fin whales, and no humpback whales. Tuesday\u2019s decision, though, leaves room for Japan to revamp its whaling programme to meet an international whaling treaty\u2019s requirements for scientific whaling. And it does not mean the end to all whaling. Japan also hunts a much smaller number of whales in the northern Pacific, while Norway and Iceland continue to kill whales for their commercial value, in defiance of the IWC ban. Japan has slaughtered more than 10,000 whales since the IWC moratorium came into effect, according to the Australian government. Japan had questioned the court\u2019s right to rule on the case, but said before the ruling that it would accept its verdict. The court\u2019s judgements are binding and cannot be appealed. Monday\u2019s ruling is unlikely to have much impact on the Japanese public, whose appetite for whale meat has declined dramatically since the immediate postwar period. In recent years, stocks of whale meat have remained unsold, with almost 4,600 tonnes stored in port freezers at the end of 2012, according to Japanese government statistics. Campaigners said they hoped the verdict would result in a permanent end to Japan\u2019s whaling programme in the southern ocean. \u201cThe myth that this hunt was in any way scientific can now be dismissed once and for all,\u201d said Willie MacKenzie, oceans campaigner for Greenpeace UK. \u201cWe urge Japan to abide by this decision and not attempt to continue whaling through any newly invented loopholes.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["The ruling was handed down less than a week before the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, is scheduled to visit Tokyo in a bid to finalise a free-trade agreement with Japan, Australia\u2019s second-largest trading partner."], "tags": ["Whaling", "Australia news", "Japan", "Marine life", "Conservation"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-31T23:12:36Z", "title": "Halt to whaling program will not harm Japanese relations, says George Brandis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/01/whaling-program-ban-will-not-harm-japanese-relations-says-george-brandis", "article": "The attorney general, George Brandis, has said the decision by the International court of justice to rule in Australia\u2019s favour, ordering a halt to Japan\u2019s whaling program in the Southern ocean, will not affect relations between the two countries. The UN court ruled 12-4 on Monday that Japan\u2019s whaling program was not, as it claims, conducted for scientific research, and should cease \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d. The decision comes after a four-year legal campaign by Australia to convince the court that Japan\u2019s whale hunt was a commercial operation &quot;in the lab coat of science&quot;. &quot;The relationship between Australia and Japan is an excellent relationship,&quot; Brandis said in Perth on Monday. He said the fact Australia and Japan could differ on this \u201cnarrow issue\u201d but remain close was testament to the \u201cendearing\u201d nature of the ties between the two nations. The ruling was handed down less than a week before the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, is scheduled to visit Tokyo in a bid to finalise a free-trade agreement with Japan, Australia\u2019s second-largest trading partner.  Asked if the ICJ decision could scuttle the long-awaited agreement, Brandis said he was \u201csure it wouldn&apos;t&quot;. Outside the court in The Hague, the Japanese government\u2019s chief negotiator, Koji Tsuruoka, said Japan would comply with the decision. &quot;As a state that respects the rule of law ... and as a responsible member of the global community, Japan will abide by the decision of the court,\u201d he said. The former federal attorney general Mark Dreyfus told the ABC the decision, which he said was the first time the ICJ has ruled on an environmental treaty, \u201cstrengthens the international rule of law\u201d and was \u201cvery significant\u201d. \u201cIt brings to an end the killing of thousands of whales in the Southern ocean that Japan has been conducting for many years,\u201d he said. Dreyfus praised Japan as a \u201cfantastic international citizen [and a] good friend of Australia\u2019s\u201d, but said its ongoing, smaller, whaling program in the northern ocean is \u201ca matter of concern to people throughout the world as well\u201d. Dreyfus admitted the case was \u201cvery expensive to run \u2026 but Australians en masse would agree that it\u2019s worth the effort\u201d. Norway and Iceland, along with Japan, continue to conduct commercial whale harvests in the northern ocean in breach of a 1986 global moratorium. The two Nordic countries have formally challenged the moratorium, but Japan justified its program with reference to a legal loophole that allowed limited amounts of whaling to collect scientific data.  Japan has killed more than 14,000 whales under the guise of scientific research since the global ban on commercial whaling was introduced in 1986, including 10,000 in the Southern ocean.  The Greens leader, Christine Milne, singled out the efforts of the \u201cchampions\u201d at Sea Shepherd, whose vessels, including the Bob Barker and the Steve Irwin, have regularly clashed with the Japanese Southern ocean whaling fleet while trying to stop the annual hunt.  \u201cHuge congratulations to everyone who has worked for an end to whaling over many decades, in particular to Sea Shepherd. We now call on the Japanese to honour the decision and end once and for all their whaling operations,\u201d Milne said. \u201cWhen Tony Abbott visits Japan in just over a week, whales must be top of the agenda,\u201d Peter Whish-Wilson, the Greens\u2019 spokesman for whaling, said. Sea Shepherd Australia\u2019s managing director, Jeff Hanson, said the court decision vindicated the marine activist group for upholding Australian and international law, by defending the Southern ocean whale sanctuary \u201cfor the whales and for future generations\u201d. &quot;In the absence of law enforcement in the Southern ocean, Sea Shepherd has been the only organisation upholding the law in defence of the international whale sanctuary,&quot; he said.    A whale of a win!  Paul Watson is a global hero and Australians can all feel proud.&mdash; Bob Brown (@BobBrownFndn) March 31, 2014    The chairman of Sea Shepherd, Bob Brown, praised the group\u2019s founder, Paul Watson. \u201cA whale of a win! Paul Watson is a global hero and Australians can all feel proud,\u201d the former Greens leader posted on Twitter. The former environment minister Peter Garrett, who was instrumental in Labor\u2019s decision to bring the case in 2010, said he was \u201cabsolutely over the moon for all those people who wanted to see the charade of scientific whaling cease once and for all\u201d. &quot;I think [this] means without any shadow of a doubt that we won&apos;t see the taking of whales in the Southern ocean in the name of science,\u201d he told the ABC. The decision was read over two hours by the ICJ\u2019s presiding judge, Peter Tomka, but Greenpeace activists said the ban was years in the making. &quot;In the run-up to this Australia said they would try every diplomatic means possible to convince Japan to stop whaling in the Southern ocean and they would only go to the ICJ as a last resort,&quot; a Greenpeace spokesman, John Frizell, said. &quot;They followed that through over years and years, with a lot of people very concerned that they should have moved more quickly, but they exhausted every possible diplomatic channel before finally going to this.\u201d &quot;Their judgment has now been spectacularly vindicated.&quot; New Zealander Peter Bethune, who was detained by Japanese authorities for five months in 2010 after he boarded a whaling ship intending to arrest the captain, said outside the Peace Palace, which houses the ICJ, it was \u201can amazing day\u201d. &quot;I was paraded around like a common criminal [in 2010] and yet I was fighting something that I always knew was illegal and to have it proven here today, in the highest court in the world, I couldn&apos;t be happier.&quot; The ANU\u2019s professor of international law, Don Rothwell, said the court had provided &quot;significant guidance&quot; on how a legal whaling program could be run in the future. \u201cFirst of all, Japan\u2019s current whaling program in the Southern ocean, Jarpa II, has been declared illegal under international law ... However, the judgment gives some guidance as to how article eight of the whaling convention could be interpreted. The critical words are \u2018for the purposes of scientific research\u2019. \u201cUltimately it goes to the scientific methodology and credibility of the research program. A country would need to be able to fairly rigorously justify the stock samples that were being proposed to be taken, and also the whale species that were being proposed to be taken.\u201d Rothwell said the court would be likely to consider the capacity for a proposed research program to be carried out in a non-lethal manner, but noted that even Australia conceded lethal research could sometimes be justified, giving the example of a study of whale stomachs. \u201cObviously non-lethal research won\u2019t assist you to study the stomach contents of whales. At that point it becomes a numbers game: how many whales can you legally take to justify such a research program.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["In a series of events from Stockholm to Tokyo, Eliasson poured powder into rivers running through the urban centres colouring the water green."], "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability", "Art and design", "Climate change"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-01T15:26:00Z", "title": "Climate change communication: lessons from art and Modern Family", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/climate-change-hbo-modern-family", "article": "Our disconnect between knowledge and actions has been alarming for years. We know there is a need for cutting emissions and protecting natural resources, but on the other hand, the adoption of sustainable lifestyles is too slow. The signs are clear: the important message of climate change is not resonating with audiences at large. On the contrary, the pace of climate changes and whether or not they are man-made have appealed to the extremes of the political spectrum. The result is heated rhetoric that ejects the vast majority of people from the conversation. With extreme opinions dominating, the prime target groups of the current climate change communication unintentionally become either a concerned advocate group that is more than aware of the importance, or a group that is never going to acknowledge the importance. And this leaves the current communications unable to connect with whom this really concerns: you. This is why one of the single greatest dangers to our planet is our poor conversation about climate change. It is about time we invite the people of the planet back into the conversation. And we do this best by giving them a new language to speak up. To bridge the important message with a larger global audience, there is a need for a new kind of player to enter the scene bringing new tools and ideas for how to create impact. It is time to set loose the creative forces on sustainability. One artist who has already experimented with the impact of art in sustainability is the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson. With his solar lantern Little Sun, Eliasson didn&apos;t just apply his artistic abilities to the status quo of solar light. By presenting the work to audiences around the word as a piece of art that opens multiple options for light experiences, Little Sun was never just a sustainable source of light for off-grid residents. It is a playful experience to all. Art&apos;s ability to make new connections became apparent in Olafur Eliasson&apos;s project Green River. In a series of events from Stockholm to Tokyo, Eliasson poured powder into rivers running through the urban centres colouring the water green. When something we take for granted suddenly changes shape or colour, we react. And so did the citizens of the cities that underwent the experiment. Eliasson gave back a space to connect with our surroundings and to reflect over the things in our everyday life we have come to think of as stagnant and permanent. New creative forces can create an individual space of reflections for each of us, where we can connect with new impressions, feelings of change and imagery. More importantly, they can create a personal and tangible connection to topics that seem abstract. It is important, however, that the message doesn&apos;t become too narrow or elitist. A strong climate change message should appeal to a broad audience using many kinds of tools and effects. To achieve this, different change makers will need to come together: designers, artists, performers, filmmakers, scriptwriters, innovators, branding experts etc. Consider the movement for gay rights. Here the conversation has shifted drastically. Over the course of relatively few decades, homosexuality has gone from being associated with abnormality to being a subject in the popular US TV show (and Barack Obama&apos;s favourite show) Modern Family which depicts three families, one of them a gay couple and their adopted child. A March 2013 ABC News/Washington Post poll showed that 58% of Americans support marriage equality, the highest ever seen in a mainstream national poll. This support followed a record year with LGBT characters representing 4.4% of characters on broadcast TV. According to a survey by The Hollywood Reporter, 23% of Americans indicated that they were more open to same sex marriage, because they had seen it on television. This is not an argument that one development automatically causes a given effect. This huge conversation change is not due to a couple of TV shows. But after entering the cultural sphere, the connotation of gay rights has gone from politically sensitive to cultural entertainment, and the conversation is including a new and broader audience. Though it is impossible to copy the game changers of the gay rights movement and apply directly to climate change communications, this case makes our mission clear. It proves that the broader public related to same sex equality after the cultural sphere started gaining interest in the dramas and narratives related to the topic and its history. It tells us that even the most controversial topics can be discussed and brought to a broad audience. To complicate the mission a little, we are on a tight deadline. On 2 November in Copenhagen, the chair of the UN panel on climate change, IPCC, will present the much-anticipated fifth assessment report that outlines the scope and pace of climate change. From the leaks and news around the report, we already know that the report will have critical findings. If we don&apos;t create a compelling and clear language, the message and the necessary actions and solutions will not last more than one press cycle. We must report on the importance of safeguarding resources with the same appeal as a TV show. To craft, tell and visualise a compelling narrative, good artisans and narrators are needed.

Through our plethora of sharing tools and instant transmission, unlikely ideas can catch the collective imagination in the morning and be around the world by teatime. And the key currency amid this meme madness is animals \u2013 well, usually cats, but not exclusively. And so we come to Goat Simulator.  \nGoat Simulator is and was a joke, the product of developer Coffee Stain studios entering a game jam and creating a knockaround sandbox that promises to fulfill all of your goat-based fantasies (not that one). The title of the game \u2013 which has been the subject of some frankly adorable confusion over at the Daily Mail \u2013 references the recent explosion in popularity of more straight-laced sims like Euro Truck Simulator and Farming Simulator. It is a parody both of gaming and of itself.  \nGames are a fertile area for this kind of self-reflexive success. Most recently we've seen Flappy Bird and Twitch Plays Pokemon. In fact there's a version of Flappy Bird called Flappy Goat. The phenomenon is about being part of the joke: look at Goat Simulator's user tags (a Steam feature that lets players assign words to games) and the top four are \"Masterpiece\", \"Beautiful\", \"Art\" and \"Simulator\".  \nWhile this is pretty funny, it also leads to the unedifying spectacle of everyone wanting to be in on the joke and outlets, without a trace of irony, awarding Goat Simulator the kind of decent scores and writeups that may tempt people towards a purchase. This is where I have to say baa humbug. The joke with Goat Simulator is that it's crap. And while this is a funny joke for 10 minutes, it becomes a different thing when the game's on the front page of Steam for \u00a37.  \nBeing billy \nYou control a goat in thirdperson, and walk it through a small open-world area butting things from people to gas canisters. Butt a petrol station and, as in Goat Simulator's trailer, you can cause an explosion that sends our little friend careening across the map. Happen upon a barbeque party and you can cause chaos by butting the participants, perhaps kidnapping one with your tongue and dragging them up a nearby scaffold. Jump over a fence towards the Zero-G testing facility and, as well as the legend \"Fuck the police\" being blazoned across the screen, your goat can float around therein.  \nThrough various means you can transform the goat into an alien, a robot, a giraffe, a whale, or \u2013 by dragging five humans onto a pentagram in a corner of the map \u2013 \"Devil Goat\". It is important to emphasise that all of this stuff sounds better than, in practice, it feels. Goat Simulator is a knowing piece of shonk, where the fact that the controls don't feel great and the physics are ludicrous is part of the appeal. This is a game where the screenshots are better than the experience, and comparisons being made to score-attack games like the Tony Hawk's series are ludicrous.  \nThe selfish meme \nWhile it wouldn't be strictly accurate to call Goat Simulator a meme, its sudden prominence does owe everything to that kind of virality. Last year Richard Dawkins gave a talk on how his original concept behind memes no longer applied to modern usage of the term; his point being that memes, in his original definition, are ideas that survive because they transmit culturally useful information. Now the term \"meme\" is more often used to refer to instant but transient success, something that is permanent only so far as countless news stories on the internet are permanent.  \nThe sad thing about Goat Simulator is that it demonstrates how social media and the internet amplify our supine tendencies; this is a silly thing, and that's fine, but now it is somehow also a cultural moment. People are encouraging each other to spend money on it in their droves. In the desperate scramble to tease a meaning from such popularity \u2013 because surely there must be some reason for this behaviour \u2013 we produce only paeans to banality.  \nNo one likes to be the curmudgeon pointing out that, actually, a joke isn't all that funny. But with Goat Simulator now a real product selling for real money on Steam I'll take the hit. This is a 10-minute laugh, if that \u2013 the kind of thing that's here today, gone tomorrow, but for a brief moment in history is the talk of Shoreditch and Twitter. It's the gaming equivalent of a novelty single and even the developers, to give credit where it's due, recommend you don't buy it.

Great Britain, who have lost 10 of their past 11 Davis Cup matches against the Italians but have not played them since 1984, are bidding to reach the semi-finals of the world group for the first time in 33 years. Were they to do so, their opponents in a home tie in September would almost certainly be Switzerland, led by Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka. Evans \u2013 at his best on fast, hard courts \u2013 revealed in a frank interview with his local paper, the Birmingham Mail, that he was not happy when Smith dropped him for the qualifying tie against the United States on drop-in clay in San Diego, where Ward performed heroically to beat Sam Querrey. Nor does he think Ward, who is ranked 28 places below him at 156, should be an automatic selection against Italy. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say James is the man in possession,&quot; Evans said. &quot;Querrey is hardly a clay-court specialist. The surface over there wasn&apos;t really clay, it was a slippery, dry surface.&quot; He admitted homesickness probably cost him his place, after excellent performances in helping the team beat Russia in Coventry last year. &quot;After [the Australian Open] I had been away for a long time,&quot; Evans said. &quot;I had been doing a pre-season in America and was only home over Christmas for three days. When I was in Australia I felt I wanted to go home, I wasn&apos;t playing well and didn&apos;t feel too good so I asked him if it was all right to come home and practise.&quot; Smith instead asked Evans to prepare for San Diego by entering a clay court tournament en route in Hawaii, but he declined. &quot;He said my decision wouldn&apos;t hinder my chances, but it obviously did. &quot;That was his choice. I wasn&apos;t happy with the decision but there was no argument or anything. I told him my thoughts, as you can imagine, but it&apos;s similar to if I don&apos;t play at the weekend, I still want the team to win. &quot;I respect his decision. It&apos;s sport.

But everything&apos;s fine at the minute and I am ready to play. &quot;I think I have got a very good chance of playing, to be honest, but that&apos;s just my thoughts. Whoever plays No2 [to Andy Murray] is going to have a hard job whatever way you look at it. I think I have got reasons why I would play and James has got his reasons. &quot;I think we have got a good chance of winning the rubber. There are going to be some rallies, they don&apos;t exactly power you off the court. It&apos;s going to be hostile and, while I can&apos;t speak for anyone else, that&apos;s the sort of thing I love to play in. I am looking forward to a very good atmosphere out there and giving it back in their face a little bit when hopefully we come back and win.&quot; The five-match tie over three days is due to start on Friday, although the forecast is for intermittent rain. A win would put Great Britain into a home semi-final on their return to the world group after an absence of 28 years. Switzerland are firm favourites to beat Kazakhstan in Geneva. On the other side of the draw, the Czech Republic are without the injured Tomas Berdych and could find Japan tough to beat in Tokyo.

Cramped and with a strange smell. &quot;Why is the fridge in living room?&quot; I asked the perky estate agent, who sensed my alarm. &quot;Well, it&apos;s more rentable that way. Do you know the area? It can only go up.&quot; I did indeed know the area, inside out. The flat I was looking at had been mine just over 20 years ago. It was a two-bedroom council flat in King&apos;s Cross and I had loved it. It was spacious compared with the one-room squat I had come from. My daughter now had a bedroom; it was a joy to have my own place. Seven years after I moved in, Camden council gave me \u00a315,000 to leave it. The biggest sum of money I had ever had enabled to me to enter the property market via shared ownership and the rest as we know is \u2026 endless boring on about loft conversions, fireplaces, kitchen tiles and water features. So let&apos;s not. The thing is, I bought a house. My old flat was on the market for more than half a million pounds. It is an investment because anywhere in London is an &quot;investment&quot;. This is the way to think. A house now has to be multifunctional: a home, a pension pot or a buy-to-let. The last budget has made it easier to release pension funds to buy property. A house in London, everyone says, just keeps going up in price whatever you do to it. Every viewing is full of anxious, desperate people whispering about storage space while eyeing up the enemy: people just like them. I am not above or beneath this behaviour, as I have bought into it too, but as I sit in my goldmine and read of the booming London prices I don&apos;t feel smug. I feel afraid. And sad. House prices, like Saharan smog or the Ebola virus, are just one more thing beyond my control and understanding. As demand outstrips supply, the capital becomes unmoored from the rest of the country: the buzz feels hollow, showy, over-caffeinated. Once you have signed that mortgage application, you have already bought into free-market madness, whatever your vague notions of an alternative may be. Because you wanted a home of your own. Some kind of permanence. Because whatever your views on Little England-style conservatism, home owning feels like some kind of freedom after renting. Without rent controls, which won&apos;t happen under this government, without tackling extortionate letting agents&apos; fees, which Shelter is asking for, rents will spiral up while conditions worsen. International finance moves into the centre of London as families cling to its edges. Money is spent on commuting. It&apos;s still worth it to get on that ladder. You can&apos;t fall. Or look down. Keep the faith and the bubble will not burst. Wages will not rise much but huge personal debt is being encouraged. Off-plan schemes sell shares in flats before they are built. Old council estates are spruced up. The dread basement dig-outs clog the pavements with skips of earth. They symbolise the trap we are in. Dig underneath your own foundations so you can rent bits out. Cling on tightly to your castle, which is not just a place to live but is now decorated to reveal your inner soul and has to provide an income when work dries up. My old flat was lovely because all it had to be was a home. How simple that sounds. As people overstretch themselves, gazump each other, go frankly barmy to buy places in London, we can only look to other cities to see what can happen. New York, where I lived cheaply in the 80s, drove out artists and creatives through its rents. In Tokyo, the bubble burst in the late 80s. Yet few here talk as if property prices will crash. This is some kind of madness. Ordinary people without much clue are encouraged to think of ourselves as super-smart investors. We are not. London&apos;s housing market is pulling so far away because of foreign capital. Saudis, Russians, Chinese, Brazilians and Indians want to protect their assets from risk. They want access to London&apos;s schools, shopping and financial markets. This class of globalised super-rich people are not the same as couples who want a place so their child can sleep in a separate room. Such investment is not sustainable as a strategy for growth, or for the ecology of communities. London lives by its social bonds as well as its bond traders. Imagine a time when it becomes a theme park for the global rich, its youth and artists forced to leave. You don&apos;t have to imagine. It&apos;s here. Your home is meant to be the place where you feel safe to dream. So what happened? As Fight Club had it: &quot;The things you own end up owning you.&quot; For that is very much how this bubble feels. And I am one of the lucky ones. This wealthy centre, with its huge restaurant barns booked out every night by frenetic monied people, is now ringed by outer boroughs of those on low incomes. It&apos;s all too jittery. Not a cosy feeling at all. My old flat went for way over the asking price. Of course it did. The whole of London is now way over its asking price."}, {"sentences": ["She did this at an International Peace Tribunal in Tokyo.", "In Tokyo, she was approached by a group of concerned former Japanese military men who said they were just obeying orders when they used the &quot;comfort stations&quot;."], "tags": ["Australia news", "Japan", "Second world war"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-03T03:25:24Z", "title": "'Comfort women' deserve a memorial: their ordeal must not be forgotten | Carol Ruff", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/03/comfort-women-deserve-a-memorial-their-ordeal-must-not-be-forgotten", "article": "I am supporting the proposed &quot;comfort women&quot; statue, by the respected Chinese artist Pin Hsun Hsiang, to be erected in Strathfield in Sydney. My mother would be one of three former &quot;comfort women&quot; depicted in the statue, holding hands with a Chinese and Korean woman, as they looked when they were young girls during the second world war. Three weeks ago my 91 year old mother, Jan Ruff O\u2019Herne, former &quot;comfort woman&quot; or sex slave, was featured in The Age newspaper in response to a statement by prime minister Abe of Japan, who declared that &quot;comfort women&quot; were all voluntary prostitutes. This was not the case. 200,000 women, from Korea, China, the Philippines and the Netherlands, were enforced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military. One was my mother. She was not a voluntary prostitute. My mother was a Dutch colonial girl born in Java. She was interned in a prison camp when the Japanese invaded Java in 1942. In 1944, when she was just 21 years old, she was taken away and forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military. She was repeatedly raped and beaten for a period of three months, along with other Dutch girls. She was then returned to the prison camp with threats that her family would be killed if she revealed the truth about the atrocities inflicted upon her.  For 50 years, she told no one of her war-time experiences but in 1992, when she saw the Korean war-rape victims making appeals for justice on television, she finally spoke out. She did this at an International Peace Tribunal in Tokyo. She then spent 15 years working tirelessly to protect the rights of women in war and armed conflict. Her testimony was instrumental in rape being declared a war crime by the United Nations. Not all Japanese people agree with prime minister Abe. When my mother spoke out, she was approached by many Japanese organisations and individuals, peace groups, students, religious groups and the media. They wanted to learn the truth about things that happened in the war. In Tokyo, she was approached by a group of concerned former Japanese military men who said they were just obeying orders when they used the &quot;comfort stations&quot;.  After she spoke out, my mother&apos;s story was in the world news, on Australian story, a documentary, and in countless magazines and papers. She was inundated with letters from women who had been raped in war. Her story was for all of them. They thanked her for her courage. Some women then also spoke out for the first time. On behalf of my mother, I would like to point out that we have a number of monuments and bridges for former soldiers who suffered, but women are often the forgotten heroes of war. The pain and humiliation of sexual servitude is great. They did not go voluntarily into those terrible places. Two thirds of the women died. The lives of the survivors were ruined forever.  This proposed statue would be a milestone artwork in Australia. This is not a vindictive act towards the Japanese people. It is a gesture towards reconciliation and healing of the wounds of the second world war. Only through truth can we move forward and learn from the past.

I&apos;m caught between both reactions \u2013 which is a decidedly uncomfortable place to be \u2013 but I have to admire his sheer stamina.  Horvath has impeccable and unique form in the field of the piano marathon: last year, also at the Palais du Tokyo, he played a complete performance of Satie&apos;s ever-vexating Vexations, an astonishing non-stop 35-hour stint at the keyboard that makes, say, John Ogdon&apos;s performance of Sorabji&apos;s four-hour Opus Clavicembalisticum look like a trifle. (There&apos;s also a version lasting nine hours and 41 minutes by Horvath that he recorded in Lagny-sur-Marne, in what must surely be one of the longest videos on YouTube.) So it&apos;s not the prospect of the seven hours that will faze Horvath, nor the possible monotony (or hypnotic brilliance, according to your taste) of all those major/minor alterations and enharmonically minimalistically moving arpeggios. Not content with playing le tout Glass, Horvath asked composers to write homages to Glass and his music, from which 92 new pieces have been produced; so many, in fact, that Horvath has to list his composers by their country of origin rather than in simple alphabetical order on his GlassWorlds site. He suggests in his description of the performance that all 92 will be played. That makes the concert even more epic: not just every note Glass has written for the piano, but also music inspired by him from composers that range from the post-minimalist to the post-complexity, and some of the other last posts of the avant-garde (from Christopher Hobbs and Joe Cutler to Bil Smith and Kyle Gann). It&apos;s a unique and tantalising idea. Book the Eurostar now \u2013 or if you&apos;re a Glassophobe rather than a Glassophile, content yourself with the aphoristic works of Anton Webern for an antidote to all that endless repetition."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Obviously we&apos;ve had to pay lot of money to get C\u00e1zares to come over here but we&apos;re giving the Belfast fans, who&apos;ve been very supportive of Carl, the chance to see another great fight.&quot; Frampton is reassuringly on edge for C\u00e1zares, who won his world titles at light-fly and super-fly, and has not lost in five bouts at super-bantam since Tomonobu Shimizu took his 115lb belt on a split decision in Tokyo three years ago."], "tags": ["Boxing", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-03T21:00:02Z", "title": "Carl Frampton aims to crush Hugo Fidel C\u00e1zares and set up world title shot", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/03/carl-frampton-needs-big-win-cazares-world-title", "article": "Barry McGuigan loved fighting in Belfast. He had some great nights away from home \u2013 none more memorable than at Loftus Road in 1985 when he ripped the world featherweight title away from the great Eusebio Pedroza \u2013 but he suffered on the road too, losing that belt a year later to Steve Cruz over 15 rounds in the hellish heat of Las Vegas. So he appreciates the value of the cool night air and the Belfast roar, which will reach another pitch for his super-bantamweight contender Carl Frampton in a packed Odyssey Arena on Friday. If Frampton beats the former two-weight world champion Hugo Fidel C\u00e1zares convincingly in front of a BoxNation audience and visiting representatives of Golden Boy Promotions, a world title challenge against the formidable WBC champion L\u00e9o Santa Cruz is the prize. How McGuigan and Frampton would love to lure the unbeaten Mexican \u2013 a star in a glittering division \u2013 to Belfast. But they know it is unlikely. &quot;There&apos;s no guarantee that we&apos;d be able to get it in Belfast, to be honest,&quot; McGuigan admitted. &quot;But either way, we feel Carl has a great chance against Santa Cruz and we are very comfortable about that fight. We&apos;re happy to travel but we&apos;d much prefer to be at home. The problem is getting an arena big enough, because Carl sold the place out in 10 days. I reckon we could have sold 15,000 for this one and we could certainly sell 20,000 for Santa Cruz.&quot; C\u00e1zares, like Frampton, lives where he was born, the boxing-rich city of Los Mochis on Mexico&apos;s northern coast \u2013 fellow citizens include Jorge Arce, the first Mexican to win world titles at four weights \u2013 and Hugo does not travel cheaply. &quot;Obviously we&apos;ve had to pay lot of money to get C\u00e1zares to come over here but we&apos;re giving the Belfast fans, who&apos;ve been very supportive of Carl, the chance to see another great fight.&quot; Frampton is reassuringly on edge for C\u00e1zares, who won his world titles at light-fly and super-fly, and has not lost in five bouts at super-bantam since Tomonobu Shimizu took his 115lb belt on a split decision in Tokyo three years ago. &quot;He&apos;s easily the most experienced guy I&apos;ve ever fought. It could be tricky for a while. He likes to switch and he throws wide shots, which could be dangerous. People say it&apos;s the ones that you don&apos;t see that knock you out, so I&apos;ll need to be careful. But I&apos;m ready to face a very high pace for 12 rounds. This guy really is tough. He hasn&apos;t been stopped since 1999. I want to get rid of this guy and I honestly think that I will.&quot; He has guarded against complacency with a 15-week training camp. &quot;I&apos;m beating all the personal bests in the weight room, feeling much stronger,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s probably the most comfortable I&apos;ve been on the weight and I think that&apos;s down to the long training camp. I&apos;m just itching to go. There&apos;s a real buzz around Belfast everywhere I go.&quot; C\u00e1zares, too, is focused, having arrived in Belfast a week ago. McGuigan cautioned against dismissing him as a shop-worn 36-year-old having his 50th fight and coming for a pay-day. &quot;This guy looks very fit and very strong. And he&apos;s completely convinced he&apos;s going to knock Carl out. We love it that way because Carl really gets switched on in those circumstances. It&apos;s not just about winning. It&apos;s about the way you win, and we want Carl to win emphatically and dynamically.&quot; Frampton&apos;s priorities, meanwhile, have switched from a domestic showdown with Scott Quigg \u2013 who holds the WBA&apos;s &quot;world&quot; belt and defends it on Sky Sports against Nehomar Cerme\u00f1o in Manchester on 19 April \u2013 to the equally intriguing challenges in America. &quot;I&apos;ve been crying out for the Quigg fight for a long, long time,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be a shame if that didn&apos;t happen. But look, I&apos;m not going to wait around and call him out for the rest of my career, for a fight that might not ever happen. I have to get on with things and \u2013 and that&apos;s why we&apos;re looking at L\u00e9o Santa Cruz.&quot; He senses Cruz wants the fight too. &quot;Santa Cruz has been talking about me as much as I&apos;ve been talking about him, which is great. It doesn&apos;t usually happen that way, the champion calling the challenger out. I think Golden Boy sees the potential in a massive showdown with Santa Cruz. But, in saying that, C\u00e1zares is the man to take care of first. If I don&apos;t, then there is no Santa Cruz fight or potentially any other big fights.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Kids read my books on the Tokyo metro."], "tags": ["Russell Brand", "Children and teenagers", "David Walliams"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-05T16:00:01Z", "title": "Should celebrities stop writing children's books?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/05/celebrities-writing-childrens-books-debate", "article": "Tom Lamont is a writer and commissioning editor for the Observer A celebrity \u2013 Kylie, Sting \u2013 announces his or her intention to write for children, and I instinctively feel for the career-pledged writers who have been huffing away with their thesaurus and watercolour brushes for years.

They&apos;ve noodled out an idea on a Groucho Club napkin. Their agent has swivelled at the bar to arrange a six-figure deal. The published result, you can bet, will absorb more than its share of publicity budgets, review space, shelf space. Given the subject under discussion, I&apos;ll express this in short sentences. Stop it, celebrities. Go away, celebrities. John Travolta has written a children&apos;s book. Katie Price has written a children&apos;s book. Frank Lampard, Katie Price&apos;s former kiss-and-tell, has written a children&apos;s book. Some that I&apos;ve read are good; others as sluggish as the career lull that inspired them. But if just one Mini Grey or Anthony Browne has been lost to children&apos;s literature thanks to Geri Halliwell&apos;s Ugenia Lavender or Gloria Estefan&apos;s Noelle the Bulldog, it hasn&apos;t been worth it. Robert Muchamore is author of the multi-million-selling Cherub series of books, and of Henderson&apos;s Boys We like to pretend we&apos;re reasonable souls, but most of us are way more petty and jealous than we&apos;d like to admit. I mean, we may hate bankers, but if someone offered you two million a year to wear a snappy suit and yell, &quot;Buy, buy, buy!&quot; down a telephone you wouldn&apos;t say no, would you? When it comes to petty jealousy, David Walliams pushes all my buttons. He started off making a heap of money out of puke jokes and dressing up as a woman. He does a [affects Harry Enfield voice] lot of work for charity. What reasonable person wasn&apos;t hoping for a mass jellyfish spawning when he swam down the Thames? Then he starts writing children&apos;s books, tops the charts, and now sells way more books than I do. I&apos;ve never met him, but I&apos;m convinced he moved into children&apos;s fiction exclusively to annoy me. But when the green mist clears, I reluctantly realise that I have no more right to tell Mr Walliams whether or not he can write children&apos;s books than I had to enact my fantasy to drop a studio light on his head during Sport Relief. And let us not forget: publishing is not just about authors, it&apos;s a huge industry. Successful books pay the wages of editors, agents, printers, lorry drivers and booksellers \u2013 and, of course, in the case of the vast majority of celebrity books, the person who actually writes them. TL And the reader? Are celebrity voices, however mangled by good intention or bad writing, really the ones we want murmured into children&apos;s ears before they nap? I&apos;m amazed we haven&apos;t already called a moratorium on this. It&apos;s been 25 years since the Duchess of York published Budgie the Little Helicopter. Forget steam trains or farm animals, kids: private helicopters are adorable. I love, by the way, that so many celebrities enter literature through the children&apos;s section. It says so much \u2013 not about the children&apos;s section itself, too easily belittled, but about the rapacious needs of the famous. I imagine the thinking goes: &quot;I&apos;m a bloody brilliant singer / comedian\u00a0/ model / footballer / royal. Look at my shelf of Brits and Baftas and Elle Style Awards and Coca-Cola Cups. Everyone chuckles at my jokes and quivers at my meaningful statements. I can get an invite on to Alan Carr: Chatty Man whenever I want. Why haven&apos;t I written a really good book?&quot; But a really good book is hard to write. And even a shit book takes ages. Now, a children&apos;s book\u2026 How many words were there in Goodnight Moon? A hundred? It&apos;s seen as easy work, a short cut to reputation-padding bibliography. And this is offensive (isn&apos;t it?) to the children&apos;s authors who devote themselves to writing for developing minds; who agonise; who know that, actually, those 100 words of Goodnight Moon are just perfect. RM Amid actors, politicians, TV chefs and, very occasionally, authors invited to headline the top literary festivals, another species exists way down the pecking order. Facing the summer heat in giant fur costumes, dressed as aliens, giraffes and pandas, publicists entertain the little kids. There&apos;s no point sending the authors of picture books to festivals, because until age seven or eight, kids want to see Kipper the Dog or Elmer the Elephant. So while a celebrity name might sway a few parents into buying a picture book, the kids who read them not only don&apos;t know who the celebrity is, but usually don&apos;t even understand what an author is. Are older kids who choose books for themselves more vulnerable to the pull of celebrity? Are the children&apos;s book charts clogged with celebrity names? Nope! Everyone from Theo Walcott to Ross Kemp has made a stab at children&apos;s novels, and the vast majority ended up being loaded on return carts and gobbled by skip-sized shredding machines inside publishers&apos; warehouses. David Walliams&apos; success as a children&apos;s author is an anomaly. He actually writes his own books, and as anyone who has ever sat a 10-year-old boy in front of an episode of Little Britain will attest, he knows how to make kids laugh. Real authors like me have little to fear! Celebrity status may get your foot in the publisher&apos;s door, but you won&apos;t get a kid past chapter one if your story doesn&apos;t cut the mustard. TL Well, let&apos;s hope they don&apos;t get to chapter three of Perfect Ponies: Secret Surprises (Katie Price, 2009) anyway. &quot;I just wish I was rich and famous, or there was something I was really good at that I could make loads of money from.&quot; Or see the cover of Madonna&apos;s The English Roses, with its promotional offer of &quot;exclusive VIP membership&quot;. There have been a few terrific celeb-written kid&apos;s books, among them Ricky Gervais&apos; Flanimals series and Harry Hill&apos;s Tim the Tiny Horse (&quot;He didn&apos;t always say &apos;neigh&apos;, but when he did he meant it&quot;). But I&apos;ll leave you with this, perhaps more representative \u2013 Frank Lampard&apos;s conclusion to chapter six of Frankie&apos;s Magic Football. &quot;[Frankie] lifted his right foot, twisted his hips, and connected sweetly... The volley flew between the posts.&quot; Welcome to your reading lives, children. RM The London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony highlighted children&apos;s literature as a cornerstone of British culture. Kids read my books on the Tokyo metro. I&apos;ve been honked in the street in Lisbon, had the biggest book signing in Sydney since Ian Thorpe and had gendarmes organising fans who were blocking an (admittedly narrow) Parisian street. If I&apos;d sold eight million albums I&apos;d be all over the tabloids, but after eight million kids&apos; books I can pick 3-for-2s in the Crouch End Waitrose without fear of molestation. It&apos;s time we recognised our top kids&apos; authors for the cultural icons that they really are, and rewarded them with their rightful place in the celebrity limelight.

Champagne and canap\u00e9s had been laid on for the 70 staff, but Blumenthal himself was not there. He was in Australia, preparing to address his team via Skype. When he had finished talking there was silence. &quot;It was only when they all started cheering and clapping that I realised they weren&apos;t stunned. It was just a few seconds&apos; delay,&quot; Blumenthal says. The rapturous response was understandable. He had just announced that at the end of the year the restaurant would close for building works lasting more than six months. During that time the entire business, including almost all its staff, the sign outside, the leather from the seats, dishes like his snail porridge and salmon poached in liquorice, and perhaps even the front door, would be relocating to a hotel in Melbourne. &quot;We needed to close the restaurant but I didn&apos;t want to lay off all the staff,&quot; Blumenthal says. &quot;I couldn&apos;t guarantee to get them back.

It&apos;s not uncommon for high- end chefs to do one-off nights in restaurants a long way from home, but complete relocations are a different matter. Meals on wheels has suddenly taken on a new meaning. While the chefs cite specific reasons for their bursts of wanderlust, many in the restaurant world believe that underlying the current vogue for restaurant relocation is the long-term impact of the 50 best restaurants list, which they have all topped. The list, published each spring since 2002 by Restaurant magazine, has its critics. Questions have been raised over the way restaurants solicit votes by offering not just free meals but, in conjunction with tourist boards, all-expenses-paid tours of whole countries. However, the list has always been best justified by the regard in which the world&apos;s top chefs hold it. Each year dozens of them fly to London from around the world for its announcement and, from that, relationships have been born. &quot;I can&apos;t think of any event in the world that brings in so many chefs,&quot; says Richard Vines, chief food critic for Bloomberg and current chair of the UK judges. &quot;It&apos;s not just one evening. It&apos;s three days of events, and a lot of collaborations have grown out of these friendships developed in London.&quot; Blumenthal acknowledges that events such as this one and the yearly Madrid Fusion gastronomic conference have played a part in the creation of both an international audience for his brand of modernist cooking and of a new relationship between top cooks. &quot;In the 1980s and 1990s there was a lot of backstabbing,&quot; he says. &quot;But now there&apos;s a real camaraderie.&quot; Renowned Australian chef Tetsuya Wakuda was one of the first to call Blumenthal to congratulate him when the move to Melbourne was announced. In this case, however, Blumenthal says, a lot of the impetus behind the relocation was his work on four of the past five series of MasterChef Australia, and his product lines in the country&apos;s Coles supermarket chain. &quot;We had actually been looking at a way to do something like this for five years because of the work we needed to do to rebuild our kitchen. We were approached by establishments in Saint-Tropez, Las Vegas and Lake Geneva. We even considered using a bunch of articulated lorries like we were a Formula One team and going on tour.&quot; The deal he made \u2013 with James Packer&apos;s Crown Resort Hotel in Melbourne \u2013 works, he says, because it is part of a longer-term plan. Blumenthal had been looking to open a foreign outpost of his Dinner restaurant, specialising in a modern take on historic British food, which is already a success at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in London, where it holds two Michelin stars of its own. So a new Dinner will be built in Melbourne, and the temporary Fat Duck will be located inside it like a stage set, so that when they leave, Dinner will remain. &quot;Commercially it works for us,&quot; he says. But it goes beyond that: &quot;Although I will be shuttling back and forth, overseeing building works, I told my team I will actually be in the kitchen with them much more.&quot; He is also looking forward to working with Australian ingredients. &quot;The meat in Australia is just fantastic,&quot; he says. New dishes will be created as a result of the produce available. For Ren\u00e9 Redzepi of Noma, which made its name with a very precise Nordic menu, the ingredients are the whole point. They will be using only local produce. &quot;Our food will have the same sensibility but it will be very different,&quot; he says. &quot;It will have to be \u2013 when you are using, say, lily bulbs from Hokkaido rather than potatoes from North Zealand.&quot; Redzepi says his move grew out of a growing fascination with Japanese food since his first visit there five years ago, along with a thirst for personal development. &quot;I had become interested in fermentation and realised that I needed to do what all young chefs do, which is intern in a restaurant somewhere, like Korea or Japan.&quot; He wanted to take what&apos;s known as an unpaid stage. &quot;But I can&apos;t do that. I am a head chef with two kids. I can&apos;t just disappear off. This made me very sad.&quot; The solution was offered by highly regarded Japanese chef Yoshihiro Murata, who will rent Noma the space in Tokyo. &quot;It&apos;ll be our business,&quot; says Redzepi. &quot;Normally you&apos;re approached first and decide the terms of the deal. In this case we&apos;ve been courting our partner in Japan. The only cost we won&apos;t have is accommodation, which they are handling. Everything else is ours.&quot; It does have to make financial sense. Though prices have yet to be set they will be higher than the 1,600 kroner (\u00a3177) charged for the set menu in Copenhagen, because costs are higher in Tokyo. But that is not what&apos;s driving it. &quot;The main motivation is to have life experiences,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a way of rebooting ourselves.&quot; But will these relocated restaurants be the same as at their original addresses? In 2012 Noma moved for 10 days to Claridge&apos;s hotel in London. &quot;We were quite consciously not trying to replicate Noma,&quot; says Thomas Kochs, general manager of the hotel. &quot;It was Nomaesque \u2013 the outcome of him putting his mind to our produce.&quot; It is, he adds, all about offering experiences to people which would not otherwise be available. &quot;I&apos;m sure the Japanese and Australian foodies are very excited.&quot; So why does he think the chefs are doing it? &quot;Obviously they need their restaurants to be occupying consumers&apos; minds. They have seats to fill. But they are also getting an education.&quot; Maintaining a restaurant with three Michelin stars can be arduous and very repetitive. &quot;It&apos;s about being out of your comfort zone.&quot; There can be little doubt that there is an audience for it. Bookings for the Fat Duck in Melbourne do not open until September. Even so, within a few hours of the announcement they had 3,000 phone calls."}, {"sentences": ["I&apos;ll never forget going in to a Tokyo record store and seeing a remix of Millionaire Hippies [aka DJ Danny Rampling] that Pete and I had done displayed in a prominent position on the wall, on sale for what seemed like an extraordinary amount of yen."], "tags": ["Frankie Knuckles", "Dance music", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-05T23:05:17Z", "title": "Frankie Knuckles, 1955-2014 \u2013 an appreciation by Terry Farley", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/06/frankie-knuckles-1955-2014-appreciation-terry-farley", "article": "Last Saturday night, Pete Heller and I had the honour and pleasure of warming up for Frankie Knuckles at the Ministry of Sound in London. On Tuesday morning, I awoke to the numbing news that Frankie had passed away on Monday afternoon at his home in Chicago. My mind quickly went back to Saturday night, when Frankie had arrived in the DJ booth as we were playing. He gave us a warm welcome with his amazing smile, but he somehow seemed distant and reflective. Since his passing, friends have told me they knew he was very ill and was close to not flying to England last weekend. I dearly wish someone had made us aware of this. While we played he sat quietly on a stool, flashing that smile whenever old friends or fans came up to greet him, but you could sense something was wrong. I&apos;m gutted I didn&apos;t get a chance to say goodbye to him properly last Saturday and wish him a safe journey home. As I was leaving, Frankie was deep in the mix, and after waiting a while to see if the moment was right, I decided to slip off and not disturb the maestro while he was at work, sending the very young dancers in front of him into raptures. I&apos;ve learned never to take it for granted that there will be a next time to show some love. My relationship with Frankie goes back a long way. Twenty-five years ago, Frankie championed the early music Pete and I made and released on Junior Boys Own. He turned two British suburban white boys who were obsessed with New York club culture into DJs who got to travel the world \u2013 simply by his patronage. I&apos;ll never forget going in to a Tokyo record store and seeing a remix of Millionaire Hippies [aka DJ Danny Rampling] that Pete and I had done displayed in a prominent position on the wall, on sale for what seemed like an extraordinary amount of yen. I asked the guy behind the counter to translate the Japanese description on the front of the record and he said, &quot;It says: &apos;Frankie Knuckles played this last week at Yellow.&apos;&quot; That was all they needed to say, and it was more than enough for me and Pete. Frankie Knuckles was a native New Yorker born in the Bronx in 1955 and he probably had more &quot;house&quot; credentials than anyone else in dance culture today. He started out playing soul and funk records at the hedonistic and decadent Continental Baths, a gay sauna in an Upper West Side hotel basement, alongside his teenage friend Lawrence Philpot (who later changed his name to Larry Levan and became synonymous with NYC&apos;s Paradise Garage). In the late 70s Frankie moved to Chicago to become resident at the Warehouse club, the club that gave house music its name and its soulful side. In the 80s, Frankie became the first dance music superstar DJ. He played worldwide, at clubs such as the Ha\u00e7ienda in Manchester and Delirium in London. More famous residencies in NYC followed, at seminal clubs such as the Sound Factory, where Frankie would preach to his disciples from Saturday night through to mid-Sunday morning, with his trademark gospel vocals, tough basslines and beats programmed to make you a better dancer than you ever imagined possible. The crowd were predominately gay and black, plus the famous Voguers and joined around 4am by dancers from Broadway, whose high kicking and twirls would cause dance-offs around the floor. This was New York&apos;s last golden clubbing period before gentrification and Mayor Giuliani tore out its hedonistic soul\u2026 Frankie provided the soundtrack. Later, he took no notice of the plastic EDM world, with its naff 18-30 antics and its overpaid, underskilled DJs crowd surfing, chucking cakes about and generally acting like idiots. In Frankie&apos;s world the focus of the party was the centre of the dancefloor. He was the godfather of house but for Frankie it was about the music he played, not about him. He provided the soundtrack to most of my life and to that of many, many others around the world. Last week, Facebook was full of tributes from world-famous DJs and big-time promoters, as well as ordinary fans and bedroom DJs. Had he met them, Frankie would have treated them all the same.

That melting image is what makes them exciting places to be. But for some twenty and thirtysomethings in London, it&apos;s not the pace but the kind of change that is worrying.  The capital is becoming more expensive, and for those without family money or very highly paid jobs, the rising cost of living is pushing them to think the unthinkable: it\u2019s time to leave London.  According to figures released by the Office of National Statistics last week, London was the most expensive area in the UK for average house prices in 2013, at \u00a3428,000. This was a 4.2% increase from 2012, the largest across all regions. Meanwhile in the rental sector, a recent report in the Observer showed that private landlords have bought up half of the former council homes in some of London&apos;s poorest boroughs and private rents can cost as much as \u00a3230 a week more than council rents. As the special report in today&apos;s New Review in the Observer shows, housing has become one of the key issues of the political age. Nor is it a problem confined to London. As Matthew Ashton writes in today&apos;s comment section of the Observer, young Britons are struggling everywhere. In the 80s and 90s young people in low paid public sector jobs or aspiring creative types could find decent, affordable housing. \u201cWhen I was in my 20s, if you were a writer, a musician or an actor, you could access council houses or cheaply rented private accommodation - it was easy, they were giving it away,&quot; said Les Back, 51, professor of sociology at Goldsmiths University. &quot;As London&apos;s housing economy has shifted that&apos;s not possible anymore. These people will inevitably be priced out, how can it be otherwise?&quot;  There is no question that people in the centre are moving to poorer parts of the city and changing the fortunes of places like New Cross, Peckham and Walthamstow. But even in these areas, which were once considered affordable for most, prices are high, journeys are expensive, and it can take hours to get across town.  Others are thinking why live like a student in a room the size of a cupboard, just to be near Dalston, when you can move away altogether.  For Claire Marsh, 30, a teacher from Stoke Newington, London isn&apos;t worth it anymore. This summer she is moving to Manchester with her boyfriend James, a DJ. At the moment, they are paying \u00a31,100 a month for a room in a shared house. In Manchester, they are hoping to get a three-bedroom detached house with a garden for around \u00a31,000. They will also be able to save the \u00a3550 per month that James spends on renting a music studio.      Manchester Town Hall Photograph: Christopher Thomond    &quot;In the past, East London was a bit more chilled, not quite as clean as other parts, but you could go to a local pub and get a cheap drink, but now, where we live, run down pubs are being renovated to look flashy and hipster-like and prices are going up.&quot; If you can get work elsewhere, then the choice is obvious, says Amelia Handle-Clark, 29, a solicitor who has recently moved to Bristol. \u201cLife is so much cheaper,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhat me and my husband are paying now for our own one bed flat, with a car parking space and its own little garden, is the same as I was paying for a small room in a flatshare with two others in London. I cycle around the city, rather than spending all that money on my oyster card, and because of how big London is I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll see my friends any less.\u201d  While those moving feel the benefit of being able to relocate elsewhere, many do not have this option and are suffering as a consequence at the hands of unscrupulous landlords at the very bottom end of the housing market.  As Back says, this movement of young professionals will &quot;displace others&quot; and hollow out central London socially.The situation is set to get worse. Although London is not densely populated, if you look at it compared to central Paris, New York or Tokyo, this is changing and it is starting to get more high rise blocks - more than 230 buildings of at least 20 floors are in the pipeline, most are for luxury flats - which is likely to create pressure on schools, infrastructure and space.

Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    Sue Heath, professor of sociology and co-director of the Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life at the University of Manchester, thinks that the issue of space, especially in shared housing, is very important and makes a huge difference to quality of life.  \u201cIt is very difficult for any sense of communality to emerge in houses lacking shared communal spaces, or where the only space to interact is a cramped kitchen,&quot; she said. &quot;London is experiencing some of the worst effects of the housing crisis on young people. Landlords are increasingly offering shared bedrooms, never mind shared houses.\u201d Despite this, London is where the jobs are. It&apos;s prized for its buzz, creativity and universities. It will always have the status and kudos to attract young people.  &quot;Yes it&apos;s expensive, but for me it&apos;s worth it because you have so much on your doorstep and there&apos;s the potential to earn more,&quot; said Jessica Stephens, 26, who works for a bank.  But for how long? Already, for some, there is one looming question - is a cramped and expensive space a price worth paying for living in London? @tessreidy"}, {"sentences": ["\u201cWhile we certainly are throwing everything we have at it, and while the best brains and the best technology in the world will be deployed, we need to be very careful about coming to hard and fast conclusions too soon,\u201d he told reporters in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Plane crashes", "Air transport", "Australia news", "China", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-06T14:44:42Z", "title": "MH370: possible black box 'pings' spur on search for missing airliner", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/06/mh370-search-continues-after-black-box-ping-claim", "article": "Australian and Chinese vessels have both picked up acoustic &quot;pings&quot; that could be from the black box of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, search officials have announced. The hunt for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 continued as Australian authorities responded to reports that a Chinese patrol ship had detected ultrasonic \u201cpings\u201d matching the frequency put out by the beacon on a flight recorder. Angus Houston, the Australian retired air chief marshal in charge of the search, announced on Sunday that underwater detection gear towed behind an Australian navy ship, the Ocean Shield, had also detected a sound. Up to 12 aircraft and 13 ships were sent out on Sunday, focused on three large stretches of ocean about 2,000km from Perth. News that a black-box detector aboard a Chinese patrol ship, the Haixun 01, might have detected an ultrasonic pulse first emerged late on Saturday night via the Chinese state media agency, Xinhua. The ping had a frequency of 37.5kHz \u2013 the same as that emitted by flight recorders \u2013 and was detected at about 25 degrees south and 101 degrees east, within the 216,000 square kilometre search zone. A reporter for Xinhua said the signal was heard for about 90 seconds.   Houston said on Sunday that there had been another \u201cfleeting\u201d signal picked up 24 hours earlier by the Haixun 01, on Friday afternoon. The two detections took place about two kilometres apart. \u201cIn an ocean that size two kilometres is not a large distance,\u201d Houston said, adding that the lead was \u201cencouraging [but] unverified until such time as we can provide unequivocal determination\u201d.The third signal was detected on Sunday morning by the Australian navy ship Ocean Shield, located around 300 nautical miles away from the Chinese ship.   Houston said he did not know at this stage whether the acoustic signal detected by Ocean Shield was 37.5kHz, the frequency emitted by a black box locator beacon, but the lead was \u201csomething that needs to be investigated\u201d.  The HMS Echo, a British navy ship carrying a towed pinger locator, was being sent to assist Haixun 01 but would take 14 hours to arrive at the rendezvous, said Commodore Peter Leavy of the Australian navy. The Ocean Shield would further investigate the signal in its own area before heading to join the Haixun 01 and Echo, Leavy said.On Saturday China&apos;s state media reported that a Chinese air force aeroplane involved in the search had photographed several white objects floating in the search zone. Houston said the sightings were 90km from the area of the pings detected by Haixun 01 but no connection to the plane had been confirmed.   Houston said the area being searched by Haixun 01 was extremely deep \u2013 \u201cfour and a half kilometres straight down\u201d \u2013 and any recovery operation would be \u201cincredibly challenging\u201d.  If the black box recorder beacon was close then the signal picked up by ships would be uninterrupted. \u201cIf you get close to the device we should be receiving [the signal] for a long period of time, not just a fleeting encounter,\u201d Houston said. \u201cUnderwater the environment is quite difficult. There will be lots of occasions when noises will be transmitted over long distance, depending on the temperature layers in the water.&quot; Houston said a correction to satellite data being used to calculate the possible flight path of the missing plane had steered the search towards a southern part of the zone of interest in the Indian Ocean. The two detections by Haixun 01 had taken place inside this higher-priority southern search zone.Pinger locators are being used by several ships scouring the remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean where investigators believe the aircraft crashed after disappearing from civilian radar screens en route to Beijing on 8 March.   Relatives of the 239 people on board have repeatedly had their hopes raised and dashed by reported sightings of debris and other clues as to the aircraft\u2019s fate \u2013 first in the South China Sea, the initial focus of the search, and now the Indian Ocean. Almost a month after the aircraft vanished, no confirmed trace of it has been found.  Houston on Saturday warned it was \u201cgetting pretty close\u201d to the point at which a signal from a black box might be picked up. There should have been enough battery power to emit pulses for 30 days, although experts have said they often continue for another 14 days or so. Anish Patel, president of Dukane Seacom \u2013 which says it manufactured the black box beacons used on MH370 \u2013 told CNN that the signal reportedly detected by the Haixun 01 was \u201cidentical\u201d to the standard frequency emitted by its pingers. David Gallo, an oceanographer who helped in the search for Air France flight 447 in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, said the pulse detected was unlikely to occur naturally. \u201cIt could very well be one of the beacons,\u201d he told the Observer. It would not be unusual for the sound to come and go, he said, because of factors such as thermal currents. Even if pinger locators could not detect the precise location, they might narrow it to an area of about 10 square kilometres, at which point teams would map the seafloor using robots and towed systems, Gallo said. \u201cWhen you find [recorders] there is a sense of satisfaction but it is also a very sombre moment \u2026 it brings the end that the families and loved ones of passengers have been praying and hoping would not come.\u201d The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, on Sunday reiterated that the search was the most difficult in \u201chuman history\u201d. \u201cWhile we certainly are throwing everything we have at it, and while the best brains and the best technology in the world will be deployed, we need to be very careful about coming to hard and fast conclusions too soon,\u201d he told reporters in Tokyo."}, {"sentences": ["Osaka was set up to test the Japanese market before the attempt to take on Tokyo, a city of 13 million people.", "Where it works Hailo currently operates in London, across Ireland, Madrid, Barcelona, Boston, Chicago, Washington, New York, Atlanta, Toronto, Montreal, Tokyo and Osaka."], "tags": ["Entrepreneurs", "Technology", "Apps", "Technology startups", "Transport", "London", "UK news", "Small business", "Business", "Internet", "Cities", "City apps"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-06T16:42:00Z", "title": "Hailo app proves a virtuous circle for London's black-taxi drivers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/06/hailo-app-cabbies-entrepreneurs-london-black-taxis", "article": "To anyone passing, the meeting of six men might have seemed incongruous amid the normal hustle and bustle of a busy central London cafe, with customers tucking into full-English breakfasts and mugs of builders tea. It was in Double J&apos;s Cafe on Charlotte Street in November 2010 that three taxi drivers, trying improve the lot of the average cabbie, first met with three entrepreneurs who were eager to bring mobile technology to black taxis. The modest beginning, which stretched over three hours, cemented the idea for Hailo, the taxi app that has spread to more than a dozen cities across three continents and raised more than $90m (\u00a355m) in three years. The app appears simple \u2013 a tap on the trademark yellow button hails a nearby taxi and journeys can be paid for using credit-card information that has already been uploaded to the system. More complicated was getting together a network that worked for drivers and passengers. Hailo was the eighth app of its type to launch in London, according to Ron Zeghibe, the company&apos;s chairman and one of the three founder\u00a0entrepreneurs. &quot;We could have the best 21st-century technical solution in the world but, unlike a lot of tech startups, this is grafting technology on to a 400-year-old industry. If you think for a minute that you can walk in and slap this technology [on] and get [drivers] all to say &apos;wonderful, you saved our lives&apos;, you are smoking dope,&quot; he said. &quot;You really do need to understand how that business operates, its mindset and how we can work best for [the\u00a0drivers].&quot; The answer was delivered in the form of the three cab drivers \u2013 Russell Hall, Gary Jackson and Terry Runham \u2013 who had set up a company called Taxilight to arrange deals on journeys for the 40% of the time when black cabs are empty, typically on their way into London or returning home. The meeting in Double J&apos;s between the drivers and Zeghibe was set up by Jay Bregman, who had a company that electronically tracked couriers, and was also attended by Caspar Woolley, a former Liberal Democrat election\u00a0candidate. By January 2011, Hailo had offices on HMS President, a converted first world war ship on the Thames at Blackfriars, with Bregman as chief executive and Woolley as chief operating officer. &quot;We were the eighth app to launch in London. Addison Lee had [had] an app for two years. You had Kabbee and GetTaxi [among others]. All these guys had a headstart and should have been able to get the market share. &quot;The problem, I think, was that most of them looked at getting the customers. We flipped that on its head. With the help of these guys on the inside we realised that what it is really about is building the loyalty [of] the driver base,&quot; Zeghibe said. Credit-card facilities were included to counter the fact that two-thirds of London taxis at the time could not take cards, a social networking function was added to tell drivers which areas were busy with work, as well as accounting features to show how much they had\u00a0earned. Drivers pay 10% of the cost of the job when they pick up a customer, while the app got rid of additional costs such as &quot;run-in&quot; fees (charged from when a driver takes the booking) to market black cabs as being value for money. Meanwhile, the three drivers worked to bring their fellow cabbies on board using the catchline &quot;winning back the\u00a0work&quot;. By the time they launched the app in the latter half of 2011, they had 800 drivers signed up. Today, that stands at about 14,000 in London. Expansion to Dublin happened in July 2012, which has a large over-supply of drivers. Of the city&apos;s 10,000 around 6,000 are signed up to Hailo. One month&apos;s profits from Dublin was used to launch in Cork, Galway and Limerick. Toronto and Chicago followed although there were legal stumbling blocks in New York that caused a delay. Osaka was set up to test the Japanese market before the attempt to take on Tokyo, a city of 13 million people. Zeghibe said: &quot;The ambition from the start was a global network. The taxi booking business is the first step in building that network. We are not spending millions of dollars to build a social network.

San Francisco is similar with 1,400 cabs \u2013 fewer than Cork in Ireland. &quot;Chicago, however, is a taxi town. The old chequered cab? That is where they were built.

Australia has signalled in negotiations it will drop the car tariffs imposed on imported Japanese vehicles in return for securing a breakthrough on Japanese tariffs on Australian beef exports. Pointing to progress, Abbott noted on Monday: \u201cMore affordable Japanese consumer products will be good for Australian families. More affordable Australian food will be good for Japanese families.\u201d The prime minister acknowledged that lowering barriers to free trade would lead to \u201cdomestic adjustment\u201d. But he said free trade made all countries richer, and \u201ceven in the short term more trade means more jobs\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s public optimism suggests the FTA will be unveiled before he departs Japan. Ahead of the detail of the final agreement being made available, Labor urged Abbott to ensure he emerged with a \u201chigh quality\u201d agreement. The shadow trade and investment minister, Penny Wong, said an agreement was only as good \u201cas the outcomes for Australian firms and for key industries\u201d. \u201cObviously, as has been widely reported, the Japanese are holding out when it comes to beef,\u201d Wong said Monday. \u201cI think there was an outcome in Korea that got a reasonable position for our beef producers.\u201d \u201cIf that position in any Japanese deal that Tony Abbott signs up to is worse than what he got in the Korean deal I think he has some explaining to do,\u201d she said. The National Farmers Federation has also warned the government to either get a good deal, or walk away from the table. Speculation about the contents of the new trade agreement suggest Japan might agree to cut its current 38% beef tariff to 19%. The peak farm lobby suggested that level of progress might not be good enough. \u201cWe want the tariffs down to zero over a period of time,\u201d the NFF\u2019s trade manager Tony Maher told the ABC on Monday morning. \u201cWe need to hold the line on these negotiations to make sure we get good outcomes.\u201d Abbott used his lunchtime address to note that economic partnerships led to deeper friendships between nations. He also reflected more broadly on Australia\u2019s relationships within the region. In a framing speech ahead of his north Asian visit a fortnight ago, the prime minister pointed to the current international co-operation to find the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 as a positive case study about mature relationships within the region. Abbott repeated those observations on Monday, pointing to specific co-operation that subverted the conventional foreign policy analysis, which tended to focus on territorial tensions between key players, particularly China and Japan. \u201cWe can achieve so much more together than apart,\u201d the prime minister noted. \u201cOur futures are inextricably linked. The countries of the Asia Pacific will advance together or we won\u2019t advance at all,\u201d Abbott told the business lunch. Abbott sketched postwar history to make some values statements about regional partners and their respective development. \u201cHistory has many lessons but there are few more instructive or uplifting than Japan\u2019s emergence from war to become a liberal democracy and a model international citizen; Korea\u2019s emergence from dictatorship to become a beacon of democratic prosperity to its oppressed brothers and sisters in the north; China\u2019s emergence from a century of turmoil again to take its place as one of the world\u2019s leading nations; and also the United States\u2019 generosity to former adversaries and preparedness, for the good of the wider world, to engage with countries that have quite different systems,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory is important. It shapes how we think and feel. The past should guide and inform our actions, provided we learn the best lessons of history, not the worst,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cLord Palmerston was only partly right when he said that England had no permanent friends or enemies; just permanent interests. It is, in fact, the permanent interest of every country to have more friends and fewer foes.\u201d Abbott said the rest of the world was watching and relying on the region to choose productive co-operation over destructive competition. \u201cThe rest of the world expects us to grow together, not apart. It\u2019s our collective duty not to let them down. The world is looking to our region to drive global prosperity.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["The Australian trade minister, Andrew Robb, confirmed the bilateral pact had been signed late on Monday afternoon in Tokyo, and he pointed to a looming reduction in car prices for Australian consumers as a consequence."], "tags": ["Australia news", "Tony Abbott", "Japan", "International trade"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-07T07:50:31Z", "title": "Australian free trade agreement with Japan will end tariffs on car imports", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/07/australian-free-trade-agreement-with-japan-will-end-tariffs-on-car-imports", "article": "Australia has sealed a free trade agreement with Japan after seven years of negotiation.

In a press conference on Monday night in Tokyo to mark the conclusion of seven years of bilateral trade negotiations, the Australian prime minister declared this was the first time Japan had \u201cnegotiated a comprehensive economic partnership agreement or free trade agreement with a major economy, particularly a major economy with a strong agricultural sector\u201d. The agreement finalised over the past 48 hours will reduce the tariffs on Australian beef imports to Japan from the current 38.5% to 19.5% (for frozen meat) and 23.5% (fresh meat). The reduction is a concession from the Japanese, who are fierce protectors of their agricultural sector, but the tariff cut for fresh meat is due to take effect over a very long time frame \u2013 15 years. Going into the final stretch of the talks, Australian farm groups, such as the National Farmers Federation (NFF), warned they wanted to see the punitive Japanese beef tariff reduced to zero. The NFF on Monday urged the government to cut a good deal or walk away. Australian beef exports to Japan were worth $1.4bn in 2013.  Trade minister Andrew Robb said the new pact would also deliver beneficial quotas for Australian dairy and cheese. In a statement released on Monday night the government said the deal would provide \u201csignificant new duty-free access\u201d for Australian dairy products. The statement said immediate tariff reductions would also apply to Australian horticultural products. \u201cThe tariffs on canned products such as tomatoes, peaches and pears, as well as fruit and vegetable juices, will also be eliminated,\u201d the statement said. The agreement also raises the screening threshold at which private Japanese investment in non-sensitive sectors is considered by Australia&apos;s Foreign Investment Review Board from $248m to $1.078bn.  &quot;Australia has reserved policy space to screen proposals for investment in agricultural land and agribusinesses at lower levels,&quot; the FTA document says. Australia for its part will remove the 5% tariff on Japanese cars and manufactured items, improving market access for Japanese goods and making them cheaper for Australian consumers. Abbott made much on Monday night of the history of trade ties between Australia and Japan, and of the shared values between the two countries.  \u201cWe have a deep, shared commitment to the universal aspirations of democracy, freedom and the rule of law,\u201d the prime minister said at the Tokyo press conference. \u201cAnd the relationship between Australia and Japan is about much more than economics and trade and growing wealthy together. It\u2019s about respect, it\u2019s about values. I hope that thanks to this agreement that has been finalised today, that Australia can be pivotal to ensuring that in the years and decades to come, the people of Japan have energy security, resource security and food security,\u201d he said. Abbott had made an election pledge to achieve free trade deals with key regional partners within 12 months of taking office. John Howard first kicked off the negotiations with Tokyo in 2007 \u2013 his final year in office. The talks have been painstakingly slow, largely because Japan is such an implacable protector of its agricultural sector. Before the planned withdrawal of Australia\u2019s remaining car manufacturers, Holden and Toyota, who will quit Australia in 2017 \u2013 a development that followed the election of the Abbott government last year \u2013 Australian governments had also been conscious of the need to provide some protection for local manufacturing. Labor welcomed the conclusion of the agreement, but said it would be scrutinising the details closely. The opposition said it would be concerned if the deal contained \u201cinvestor state dispute settlement provisions\u201d \u2013 provisions that potentially allow Japanese firms to take the Australian government to court, and which are controversial with free trade opponents. Labor&apos;s trade and investment spokeswoman, Penny Wong, said on Monday night Australian beef and dairy were already strong exports to Japan and improvements in market access would be an important boost for agricultural industries.  \u201cHowever, Labor notes reports that the Abbott government has agreed to tariffs which appear less beneficial than those secured for Australian beef in the recent free trade agreement with Korea,\u201d she said. Wong said a critical issue would be the extent to which the FTA document tackled the non-tariff barriers applying to Australian exports to Japan \u2013 such as quotas, statutory import licensing and marketing arrangements and subsidies. \u201cA genuinely comprehensive trade agreement needs to go beyond the focus on cows and cars by covering a wide range of goods and services as well as trade rules and mechanisms,\u201d Wong said."}, {"sentences": ["The All Blacks-Eagles Test has been mooted since November 2013, when the NZRU chief executive Steve Tew told a New Zealand website, stuff.co.nz, the union was looking to expand on that month&apos;s trip to Tokyo.", "On Sunday, the Herald said a fixture against Ireland in New York or Boston remains on the NZRU&apos;s agenda, despite doubts about the commercial viability of playing Test matches at neutral venues instilled by the experience of taking Bledisloe Cup Tests against Australia to Tokyo and Hong Kong."], "tags": ["Rugby union", "New Zealand rugby union team", "USA rugby union team", "US sports", "Sport", "Chicago Bears", "NFL"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-07T16:29:55Z", "title": "All Blacks set to meet US Eagles at Soldier Field in Chicago", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/07/all-blacks-us-eagles-rugby-soldier-field-chicago", "article": "The long-rumoured game between the US Eagles and the New Zealand All Blacks, the world champions who went undefeated through 14 Test matches in 2013, is set to take place at Soldier Field in Chicago on 1 November.

The cited date, a Sunday, allows for New Zealand time, which is 17 hours ahead of US central time.  The report added: \u201cThe expectation is that a minimum 40,000 tickets will be sold, which should enable USA Rugby to make a sizeable profit after they have paid the New Zealand Rugby Union a guaranteed sum, believed to be $1m to cover their costs.\u201d The NZRU and USA Rugby are both sponsored by the insurance giant AIG, which has mounted a campaign to grow the All Blacks&apos; US profile. Last month, the Showtime programme 60 Minutes Sports broadcast a special on the team. Soldier Field, the home of the NFL&apos;s Chicago Bears, can hold 61,500 spectators. Last year, the Eagles lost 29-19 to the Maori All Blacks \u2013 New Zealand&apos;s de facto second team \u2013 in front of an 18,500 capacity crowd at PPL Park, the home of the Philadelphia Union MLS franchise. The Eagles&apos; last two home summer Tests, defeats by Italy and Ireland at Houston Dynamo&apos;s BBVA Compass Stadium, attracted 17,241 and 20,181. They will play Scotland at the same venue in June.

This year they will follow their trip to the US with Tests against England, Scotland and Wales.  The All Blacks management, led by head coach Steve Hansen, is reported to value games against \u201ctier two\u201d countries in terms of preparation for World Cups, in which weaker teams are played before knockout games against more established nations. The Eagles last month qualified for the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England, after drawing 27-27 with Uruguay in Montevideo and winning 32-13 in the return game in Atlanta. The Eagles will play in Pool B, alongside South Africa, Scotland, Samoa and (in all likelihood) Japan.  New Zealand are drawn in Pool C, with Tonga, Georgia, an African qualifier and one of the weaker major nations, Argentina. The All Blacks will expect to face Ireland or France in the quarter-finals.

Photograph: Branden Camp/AP    In November, asked about the likely opposition for the planned US game, given its falling outside the official autumn Test window, Tew said: &quot;It&apos;s likely to be against some sort of invitational side.\u201d  On Sunday, the Herald said: \u201cUSA Rugby is moving towards agreement with relevant English Premiership clubs about player release.\u201d Given full access \u2013 which is by no means a given for 1 November, given the strict rules which govern player release for international rugby \u2013 the Eagles can field a number of players employed by top-flight clubs. New Zealand, however, are likely to be overwhelmingly stronger than even a full-strength US XV, not least in the crucial front row of the scrum. Pondering what the NZRU&apos;s next step in the US might be, Herald rugby writer Gregor Paul said: \u201cIt&apos;s questionable, given the gulf in quality between the All Blacks and Eagles, whether another Test between the two would be a credible exercise.\u201d Chicago was not initially discussed as a venue for the game. In November, Tew said: \u201cWe&apos;re looking at some options \u2026 Our first preference is the east coast and to play somewhere close to New York, but we&apos;ve got to find the appropriate stadium. It&apos;s got to be available that weekend, and it&apos;s got to be big enough.\u201d Like all NFL stadiums, Soldier Field has a playing surface that is too narrow for international rugby. The Herald said \u201csome tinkering\u201d would take place to \u201censure it is wide enough to host the fixture\u201d. On Sunday, the Herald said a fixture against Ireland in New York or Boston remains on the NZRU&apos;s agenda, despite doubts about the commercial viability of playing Test matches at neutral venues instilled by the experience of taking Bledisloe Cup Tests against Australia to Tokyo and Hong Kong.         Showtime's 60 Minutes Sports considers the All Blacks.    In the US, meanwhile, Saturday and Sunday saw the first scouting combine staged under the auspices of the National Rugby Football League, an enterprise aiming to convert athletes from the major US sports into rugby players and to start a professional US rugby competition.

On any other day this would be perceived as a positive, however with 26.2 miles or 42.195km to get round, blazing sunshine for the first two hours made the first half a little tougher than anticipated, with runners lunging through water sprinklers and taking full advantage of the water buckets and sponges on route. While not a World Marathon Major (London, New York, Boston, Chicago, Berlin and Tokyo), Paris is now a firm fixture on the international marathon circuit, and deservedly so, as the course is splendid, starting at Champs-Elys\u00e9es with the Arc de Triomphe providing a photogenic backdrop, before heading down the Rue de Rivoli, and to the outskirts of east Paris into the aptly nicknamed &quot;Paris Lungs&quot;, the leafy Bois de Vincennes, which is also Paris&apos; largest park. Shade here provided welcome relief, as I&apos;d mistakenly not bothered to apply sun cream or bring a cap.  Lesson learned - even if you think you don&apos;t need it, bring gear to cover all weather eventualities in your race bag, as its not fun being sunburnt or freezing cold for 26.2 miles. When in doubt, bring old layers that you&apos;re happy to peel off and chuck to the side as you warm up (these are generally collected by the race organisers and donated to charity), also, bring something warm to wear for the journey home as it often involves a bit of trek, and you&apos;ll find you cool down and feel chilly very quickly after finishing. Paris was my third marathon, but after a six-month injury layoff during the first half of 2013, I was going into it with no real aim, other than to run and enjoy the sights \u2013 just thrilled to be running long-distance again. That said, there are very few runners who go into a race without secretly hoping to achieve a shiny new PB. This is where I broke the golden rule of marathon running and charged off at an unsustainable pace in my eagerness to get going, after frustratingly getting herded into the wrong starting pen and ending up in a slower group. Unsurprisingly, I paid for this later, when the banoffee flavoured energy gels \u2013 don&apos;t go there \u2013 I had sucked down in the first half, made a reappearance (apologies to the French family I charged through, leaping off the course). I&apos;d not actually tested this particular gel in training \u2013 I&apos;d used the same brand, so thought I&apos;d be fine with a different flavour. Lesson learned \u2013 don&apos;t try anything new on race day, as this definitely isn&apos;t the time to experiment. Stick to what you know works for you and don&apos;t deviate from the game plan. The main course highlights, Notre Dame Cathedral and the Eiffel Tower, are always a treat to behold, however the tunnel rave at mile 17 \u2013 complete with techno lights and music - was an unexpected thrill, reminiscent of a scene from 28 Days Later as shadowy figures of runners danced and flickered along the tunnel walls. Support along the route was excellent \u2013 despite a brief collision with a woman in heels strutting across the course and the man who nearly caused a pile-up casually wheeling his moped through runners, I didn&apos;t find the route too troublesome. However, I did waste valuable energy frantically dodging and overtaking runners \u2013 my Garmin showed I ran nearly 27 miles. Another lesson learned \u2013 don&apos;t waste too much energy rushing to overtake slower runners at crowded spots, as the course will open up and you&apos;ll be able to pass safely and with less risk of being tripped or knocked in the face by a flying elbow, which happened on several occasions. Overall, I found Paris well-organised and enjoyable, with the live bands and entertainment giving the event a festival atmosphere. Final lesson \u2013 draw support from the crowds and entertainers as they really do give you a boost when mentally and physically you feel yourself start to flag. Smile at the volunteers, as most are doing it for free and most importantly have fun and don&apos;t take it all too seriously \u2013 running is a hobby for most of us and while scoring a new PB is nice, it&apos;s not everything. I&apos;d definitely return to run Paris again \u2013 I hope more women do, as the number of male entrants currently outweighs female entrants 79% to 21%.

Amid complaints that the agreement offered very little for dairy, sugar and grain farmers, the prime minister admitted on Tuesday that his government had failed to secure the farm industry&apos;s main target of reducing the Japanese beef tariff to zero. But he claimed the new bilateral agreement to halve the existing 38.5% tariff was the most generous Japan had yet offered to any of its trading partners and that there was &quot;a big drop in the first year\u201d. \u201cSo, this is a very significant improvement, and it&apos;s far better than many people expected, and it&apos;s far better than anything that Japan has ever been prepared to offer any other country,\u201d Abbott said in an ABC radio interview before leaving Tokyo for South Korea. The new bilateral FTA \u2013 seven years in the making \u2013 will see the Japanese tariff on imported frozen beef drop over time to 19.5%, with an 8% fall in the first year of the agreement. The tariff on fresh beef will drop to 23.5% over 15 years. The deal has prompted a degree of restiveness within Coalition ranks. George Christensen, a north Queensland government backbencher from a sugar-growing region, has queried the value of the new agreement.  \u201cI appreciate that negotiating FTAs, particularly with Japan, is tricky business. But I wonder about the value of an FTA with any nation unless there&apos;s significant benefit for Australian agriculture,\u201d Christensen told the ABC on Tuesday. NSW National senator John Williams told Guardian Australia he welcomed the enhanced market access for beef producers achieved under the new trade deal. \u201cIt will give us an edge,\u201d he said Tuesday. But Williams warned he would be paying close attention to new foreign-investment caps in order to ensure that strict curbs apply to the purchase of Australian farmland by Japanese investors. The new FTA raises the screening threshold at which private Japanese investment in \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d sectors will be considered by Australia\u2019s Foreign Investment Review Board, from $248m to just over $1bn. But the government has not yet released precise details about the new thresholds for farmland and agribusinesses that will apply in the new trade pact. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard a squeak about that,\u201d Williams said, adding that he wanted a low FIRB trigger, such as the $15m trigger for farmland that applies in the Korean-Australian FTA. \u201cI would expect that to be in the Japan FTA and any China FTA,\u201d the NSW senator said. The president of the National Farmers Federation, Brent Finlay, said the new trade pact with Japan had fallen short in several respects. \u201cThe ultimate objective with any trade agreement is to obtain tangible benefits to farmers. Agreements must be comprehensive. That means no sector carve-outs and elimination of tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Japanese agreement falls short of the mark on a number of fronts in this regard. The agreement does not improve \u2013 or marginally improves \u2013 market access and terms of trade for a number of sectors such as dairy, sugar, grains, pork and rice.\u201d The Cattle Council expressed similar sentiments. While welcoming the finalisation of the agreement and the improvements secured by the negotiators, the Cattle Council\u2019s president, Andrew Ogilvie, expressed disappointment \u201cthat substantial tariffs will still exist on Australian beef after the phase-out period, unlike previous free trade agreements; and also that different tariffs apply to chilled and frozen beef.\u201d United Dairy Farmers Victoria president Tyran Jones said the agreement had mainly ignored Australia&apos;s $13bn dairy sector. &quot;Dairy farmers currently pay $116 million a year in import tariffs on $511 million of processed dairy products going into Japan,&quot; Jones said. &quot;This really doesn&apos;t bode well for a meaningful trade agreement with China,&quot; Mr Jones said. &quot;The track record&apos;s there. We didn&apos;t get much out of Korea, and we got even less out of Japan.&quot; Fruit farmers were happier with the deal. Fruit Growers Victoria deputy chairman Gary Godwill said the agreement, which eliminates tariffs on a range of canned fruit and vegetables, put them on a level playing field with other players in the market. &quot;Access to the Japanese market is a wonderful thing,&quot; he told AAP on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters in Sydney, the deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, conceded the government had not delivered everything the farm sector wanted \u2013 and he suggested the deal negotiated by his cabinet colleague, the Liberal trade minister, Andrew Robb, did not deliver everything he wanted. Truss said he would like to see all artificial trade barriers removed \u2013 and he said the agreement provided options to reconsider elements of the undertakings every five years. But he counselled it was impossible in trade negotiations to emerge with everything that you might wish. The FTA did not achieve everything, but it did deliver \u201csubstantial gains\u201d. The new agreement will also see Australia cut the 5% tariff it imposes on imported Japanese cars and other high-end manufactures. This should see prices drop for Australian consumers if the tariff cut is passed through. Australia has agreed to cut the tariff within 12 months of the agreement taking effect. The head of the Australian Automobile Association, Andrew McKellar, reasoned on Tuesday that companies would pass through the tariff cut to consumers. \u201cWe&apos;ve seen from past experience, when there has been a tariff reduction, it has been passed through in prices to consumers fully and quite quickly,\u201d McKellar said. With the US president, Barack Obama, also due to visit Tokyo in a fortnight, the former US assistant secretary of state for East Asia, Kurt Campbell, told the ABC\u2019s Lateline program the FTA was \u201ca massive victory for prime minister Abbott\u201d. \u201cCountries, industrialised countries in Europe and the United States and elsewhere, have been trying to get this kind of agreement from Japan for 30 years,\u201d Campbell said. He reasoned the structure of the new Australia/Japan agreement could break a deadlock in a more significant trade agreement: the trans Pacific partnership. \u201cThis is a major breakthrough and I believe it will open the door for the next phase of the trans-Pacific partnership [TPP] in which the United States is dealing directly with Japan.\u201d  Reports from the US indicate Obama hopes to announce his own bilateral economic partnership covering agriculture and manufacturing with Japan during his visit, as well as touching on the negotiations around the TPP, a regional trade pact between the US, Japan, Australia and other regional allies. According to a statement released by Abbott, the Australian and Japanese prime ministers discussed the TPP during this week\u2019s visit. A joint statement issued by Abbott and Shinzo Abe after their talks says: \u201c[The two leaders] emphasised the significant potential benefits of a high-standard TPP agreement in cutting trade barriers and harmonising trade rules across the region, and called for redoubled efforts to conclude the TPP negotiations.\u201d But a report in the Financial Times departs from the Campbell analysis. It suggests US trade officials are \u201cdownright dismissive\u201d of the new Australia/Japan FTA. US officials are pushing for the wholesale elimination of Japan\u2019s key agricultural tariffs within the framework of the TPP. The unnamed officials in the FT report have declared the new Australian pact \u201csignificantly less ambitious than what leaders agreed to seek in the TPP\u201d.

On the long plane ride home, Abbott granted an interview where we canvassed his views on a range of topics, including future free trade with Japan and China. During the course of our conversation, which was largely about economic philosophy and principles, it emerged that Abbott was coolish on a free trade agreement (FTA) with China, but warm on a trade pact with Japan. His position, when we unpacked it, wasn\u2019t complicated. It was a simple statement of values. This was all about affinity. Abbott favoured an FTA with Japan because Japan was \u201cvastly more of a market economy\u201d and, like Australia, a pluralist liberal democracy. China would be pursued of course, but this was a more problematic agreement because China was not like us. There were questions \u201cto what extent China is a market economy\u201d. This observation, while self-evident in one sense, was nonetheless a jolt. The prevailing official disposition towards China at the time of our conversation could probably be best characterised as schooled pragmatism. Differences in values and systems, while acknowledged, weren\u2019t laboured in public. Greater economic integration with Beijing was viewed as inevitable, not optional. Abbott\u2019s ambivalence, while mild and proportionate, was explicit. The story ran prominently in the newspaper I then worked for, and Abbott\u2019s remarks were picked up by the Xinhua news agency. Various foreign affairs pundits convened briefly in a tea leaf-reading huddle. Labor promptly accused Abbott of dabbling in rank populism. Abbott\u2019s staff tried to pretend he didn\u2019t say what he\u2019d very clearly said, or if he had said it, he didn\u2019t really mean it in the way I\u2019d construed it. Then Abbott went out the next day to one of his many pre-election events and repeated almost verbatim what he\u2019d said to me, putting the matter beyond doubt. We were back squarely to values and affinity. \u201cI just make the obvious point that it is probably going to be easier to conclude a free trade agreement with [Japan], a fellow market economy and \u2026 liberal democracy.\u201d I repeat this anecdote not as personal indulgence but in an effort to plot carefully the story thus far of Abbott and Japan, and China. The values statement of October 2011 was then tempered with a dose of disciplined pre-election pragmatism. The prime minister-in-training made more of a specific effort to project a more positive and non-ambivalent disposition about Australia\u2019s engagement with all comers in the region, including Beijing. Throughout 2012, Abbott conducted a positive pivot on the \u201cAsian century\u201d and found some durable language for the Australia-China relationship which was much warmer on the subject of the FTA, (a Howard government legacy that needed to be seen through to completion) \u2013 yet reserving his rights on the primacy of liberal democratic values and vexed subjects such as human rights. Abbott remarked in July 2012 that China should build on its economic achievements by embarking on political reform, making the point the bilateral relationship should move beyond pragmatic economic considerations to the \u201cshared values\u201d space. After the election, against a backdrop of prickly territorial disputes between China and its near neighbours, we\u2019re back in the values space. Japan has been praised early and often. Abbott evidently feels comfortable with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, and enjoys, as he put it on Monday, the \u201chistorical resonances\u201d associated with renewing a bilateral economic relationship that began in 1957 under the leadership of a conservative hero, Robert Menzies, and Abe\u2019s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi. Abbott in Tokyo was painting himself into history, inserting himself in the narrative of a shared relationship. The dividend of all this affinity and shared values has been a new trade agreement. What you think about this agreement depends entirely on where you stand. If you are a trade expert, conscious of Japan\u2019s long history of fierce and unyielding protectionism of its agricultural sector \u2013 it looks like progress. If you are an Australian cattle or dairy producer hoping for a bankable breakthrough on market access, it looks like suboptimal incrementalism \u2013 little more than spin and deft window dressing. If you are in the US, you might see Abe looking less at Abbott, and more over the Australian prime minister\u2019s shoulder to the White House, perhaps using the new Australian deal as a template or a public statement about what Japan might agree to on the much bigger play \u2013 the trans-Pacific partnership. If you are in China, you might see Abbott\u2019s assertive framing of his new trade pact, the public bonding with Abe, the fresh commitments on defence and security cooperation, the meeting with the Japanese National Security Council, the preferential deal on foreign investment (this development will be of considerable interest in Beijing) \u2013 as a message, and not a positive one. The Chinese might view all this pragmatically \u2013 seeing the political dance of the past few days as a message from Abe, not so much a specific message from Abbott. A pragmatic response from Beijing might yield a positive reaction to Australia\u2019s new government asserting itself, on its own terms. China might respect the geopolitical play Abbott is currently intent on constructing \u2013 or it might bristle and consider it an affront from an upstart from Canberra. Abbott\u2019s next stop after South Korea is China, on Wednesday. It will be interesting to see how the leadership responds to Abbott\u2019s considered pushback against cultural relativism which is now core to his \u201cAsian century\u201d messaging. Abbott is intent on projecting \u201cAustralian values\u201d as the norm, the baseline; and feigning a certain degree of ignorance that other nations might see the world rather differently. It\u2019s a message for domestic consumption. Abbott\u2019s telling voters back up that he will defend the national interest. This week, the prime minister has asserted that Australian values (which he defines as democracy, freedom, peace and the rule of law) are \u201cuniversal\u201d values, when they are clearly not universal values.

With Blasim and Ogawa&apos;s short story collections in the running for the prize, not to mention George Saunders&apos; recent Folio prize win and Alice Munro&apos;s 2013 crowning as a Nobel laureate, organisers are suggesting that the resurgence of interest in short fiction could be &quot;a global phenomenon&quot;. Blasim, whose books have been banned in Jordan and criticised for &quot;foul language and derision against religion and sect&quot;, uses reportage, memoir and dark fantasy &quot;to present Iraq, post-Saddam and post-invasion, as a surrealist inferno&quot; in The Iraqi Christ, the judges said. Knausgaard is shortlisted for A Man in Love, the second of his six-volume autobiography known as My Struggle, while French author Hubert Mingarelli joins the list with A Meal in Winter, which judge Alev Adil, artist-in-residence and a lecturer at the University of Greenwichcalled &quot;an elegant meditation on the holocaust&quot;. German writer Birgit Vanderbeke completes the lineup with a debut novel, The Mussel Feast, originally published in German in 1990 and now released in English for the first time. A &quot;modern German classic&quot;, it sees a mother and her children at the dinner table, waiting for the father of the family to come home. &quot;I wrote this book in August 1989, just before the fall of the Berlin wall,&quot; Vanderbeke has said. &quot;I wanted to understand how revolutions start. It seemed logical to use the figure of a tyrannical father and turn the story into a German family saga.&quot;     Japanese writer Y\u014dko Ogawa is nominated for her short fiction collection, Revenge. Photograph: Masaaki Toyoura/AP    &quot;This is a shortlist of intriguing contrasts, works that push the conventional boundaries of the novel with short stories as intricately interwoven as [the] shibari knots from Ogawa in Revenge and digressive quotidian detail from Knausgaard in A Man in Love,&quot; said Adil. &quot;Fiction in translation offers us the most intimate and powerful medium for making sense of politics, of trauma and the aftermath of war. Blasim&apos;s The Iraqi Christ is an unforgettably surreal and powerful insight into contemporary Iraq, and shows us so much more than we could ever understand from televised news.&quot; She also praised The Mussel Feast as &quot;a taut portrayal of a family tyrannised by their father&quot;, and the Kawakami as &quot;a haunting romance&quot;. The foreign fiction prize is unique because it honours both author and translator, who each receive \u00a35,000 to recognise &quot;the importance of the translator in their ability to bridge the gap between languages and cultures&quot;. Adil&apos;s fellow judge, translator Shaun Whiteside, praised this year&apos;s selection for confirming &quot;just how valuable translators are in bringing the unfamiliar home to us, and capturing a music that we would never otherwise be able to hear&quot;. &quot;Stephen Snyder and Allison Markin Powell brilliantly capture the delicate, dark surrealism of Hiromi Kawakami and Y\u014dko Ogawa, while Jamie Bulloch and Sam Taylor channel a particularly European chill in their renderings of Birgit Vanderbeke and Hubert Mingarelli. Don Bartlett deserves applause for further inhabiting the mind Karl Ove Knausgaard, while Jonathan Wright vividly conveys the raw grit of Hassan Blasim&apos;s Arabic.

Afterwards, one of the writers, Andy Paterson, was being interviewed by Jon Ronson, the curator of the event. They discussed how Colin Firth&apos;s character, Eric Lomax, had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of his torture by the Japanese during the second world war. Paterson had just returned from Tokyo, where it became clear to him that most Japanese people have not got to grips with what happened on the Thai-Burma railway. I wonder how long it will take us to understand what we are continuing to do to Shaker Aamer in Guant\u00e1namo Bay? I have represented Aamer unsuccessfully for a long time, and we have just received the first independent medical evaluation of him in 12 years. Dr Emily Keram, a respected psychiatrist, despairs for him as long as he remains in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Her report makes for devastating and depressing reading. Because of society&apos;s eternal prejudices, I am loth to discuss Aamer&apos;s mental health status, but ultimately I must. So let me preface it with an admission: I, too, suffer from PTSD, albeit on an inconsequential scale when compared with either Aamer or Lomax. My own flashbacks, black-and-white negatives of what I witnessed, stem from watching six of my clients die \u2013 two each in the electric chair, in the gas chamber and on the lethal injection gurney. The hardest was Nicholas Ingram. I was born in the same hospital as him, and he was electrocuted in a gratuitously grotesque manner. For Aamer, yes there was all the physical abuse, from beatings, to strappado (dislocating the shoulders by hanging by the wrists), most of which happened to Lomax. But it was the second degree torture (originated by the Spanish Inquisition) that got to Aamer most \u2013 when the torturer singles out someone else for abuse and plays on your mind. The American interrogators assured him that they had his family, and they described what they were going to do to his daughter, then five years old: &quot;They are going to screw her. She will be screaming, &apos;Daddy! Daddy!&apos;&quot; I have a five-year-old myself. No wonder Aamer told Keram he felt powerless, guilty that he had failed his kids, his mind imploding. He described the &quot;microwave&quot; where the abusers finally break your mind: &quot;It&apos;s easy to crack an egg from the outside. It&apos;s hard to blow up the egg from the inside. They let you recover so you think you are strong again. But you don&apos;t know your thoughts any more \u2026 The shell looks strong, but if you crack the egg inside you will see charcoal.&quot; Keram also diagnosed Shaker as chronically depressed, but that is hardly surprising: he has been held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay since Valentine&apos;s Day 2002, the day his youngest child, Faris, was born. Aamer is a very proud father; he speaks of the reservoir of love that a parent can build up for a child, and how important those early years are. Aamer was cleared seven years ago. If that promise had been honoured, he could have met Faris at the age of five; the child is now 14 and Aamer has no idea when they might finally be together at last. Aamer also suffers from special housing unit (SHU) psychosis. This stems from the months and years he has spent in solitary confinement. Of course, the Guant\u00e1namo authorities will insist they have no isolation cells, but that is because their latest euphemism is the &quot;single cell operation&quot;. It is just another of the Orwellian lies that pepper the Guant\u00e1namo lexicon. Aamer has never been on a hunger strike according to them; it&apos;s just a &quot;long-term non-religious fast&quot;. I should stress that Aamer&apos;s mental health will inexorably improve as soon as he is released back to his family in London. His SHU psychosis will be a thing of the past when he is no longer in a special housing unit; his depression will lift when he sees his wife and four children; and his PTSD will gradually fade into the background when we get him therapy. Likewise, his physical health will improve when he is treated by the NHS rather than by a doctor who will only provide him with a blanket for his arthritis if Colonel John Bogdan says he has been sufficiently &quot;compliant&quot;. As yet this is not to be, even seven years after Aamer was cleared. Imagine that the Americans had marched into the prison camp holding Lomax in 1945, several years into his torture and confinement; imagine that they said he was free to leave, but continued to hold him; imagine it is 1952 and he is still there, being terribly abused. One thing is certain: the Conservative prime minister of the day, Winston Churchill, would have put Lomax&apos;s predicament rather higher on his agenda with his American allies than does David Cameron."}, {"sentences": ["Taxis are a steal if you compare them to London or Tokyo, fares start at 14 yuan, which is the most expensive in China."], "tags": ["Cities", "China", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-09T10:59:13Z", "title": "An urbanist's guide to the best and worst of Shanghai", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/apr/09/shanghai-urban-guide-best-worst-china-city", "article": "Shanghai in brief Everyone should live in Shanghai at one point in their life. There is no better city to experience the energy and complex rise of China. Shanghai has always prided itself in being very open to foreign ideas and investment, and is a leading choice for expats in China, which adds to its cosmopolitan allure. Despite its 24 million population, Shanghai\u2019s comprehensive transportation system still allows the city to stay manageable, while its charismatic old neighbourhoods help maintain a local community lifestyle. Still, the city\u2019s frenetic pace of skyscraper construction is unlikely to slow, and continues to feed rising housing prices that have forced many locals into distant suburbs, and compromised green public space. Like the rest of the country, Shanghai continues to grapple with water and food security, as well as pollution. Best building      The Astrid Apartments. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    It\u2019s hard to single one out. I\u2019d point to The Astrid Apartments as an example of the many lovely heritage Art Deco buildings dotted around Shanghai\u2019s former French Concession area that were built in the 1920s and 1930s at the height of the movement. Shanghai is home to a diverse collection of Art Deco architecture and has even influenced shikumen architecture \u2013 East-West hybrid row housing with Chinese courtyard style interiors - of the same period. In fact, the modern Jinmao Tower in Shanghai\u2019s financial district skyline is a contemporary rendition of Art Deco flourish on a Chinese pagoda. Thanks to its status as Art Deco capital of Asia, Shanghai will be hosting the World Art Deco Congress in 2015. Worst building      Many shikumen neighbourhoods have been demolished. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    In 2008, a group of Shanghai urban planning academics and advisers, led by the respected preservationist Professor Ruan Yisan (responsible for championing the Bund restoration), proposed to local authorities to preserve 111 historically significant shikumen neighbourhoods. Since then, a third of them have been demolished, some of which I\u2019ve documented on my blog. Some of the flattened shikumen neighbourhoods were in fine condition, nothing that a bit of sprucing up could not fix. So it\u2019s a bit of a shock when you see a bulldozer just ripping them through. But the worst are shikumens, no matter how historically significant or beautiful, that have become so decrepit and grimy from decades of overcrowding, heavy communal usage and minimal infrastructural investment by residents and local authorities. These buildings never stood a chance; demolition seemed inevitable because any historical value they had was diminished and the cost of preservation was deemed unworthy. And so, a generation of Shanghainese continues to lament the growing loss of their living history. How clean is Shanghai?     A sign proclaiming Shanghai to be clean and beautiful. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    Overall, I\u2019d say Shanghai is quite clean thanks to the sheer number of street cleaners working round the clock. Civic awareness is slowly improving with ongoing government campaigns against spitting, littering and promoting better personal hygiene. But old habits die hard: you still hear the hair-raising sound of someone clearing their throat and projectile phlegm on the sidewalk. That gets to me every time. In terms of air quality, Shanghai had its worst pollution this past winter when the city was trapped by a thick layer of smog - you could feel the dirt particles lodged in the back of your throat. Expats started talking about moving their families out of the city; more middle class Chinese were contemplating migrating abroad. The air is back to \u201cnormal\u201d now, which is a light haze every other week. What&apos;s the best way to get around?     Bikes are still ubiquitous in the city. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    Shanghai\u2019s metro system is the best way to navigate the city as it\u2019s fast and reliable. It is now the longest in the world with 14 metro lines, 540 kilometres in length, covering 300 stations. Fares start at three yuan (around 30p). But mind you, the crowds are positively heaving at peak hours. Daily ridership is over 8 million on average and has gone as high as 9 million. That\u2019s like a small country on the move! Taxis are a steal if you compare them to London or Tokyo, fares start at 14 yuan, which is the most expensive in China. Buses are an even cheaper option at one or two yuan per ride. Bikes are still ubiquitous and a favoured mode of transportation for everyone from migrant worker to hip advertising executive. Unfortunately, you\u2019ll have to watch out for aggressive motorists if you\u2019re not used to driving habits in China. The unspoken rule is that pedestrians and bikes give way to cars even at a zebra crossing \u2013 which is obnoxious, not to mention dangerous. What does Shanghai sound like?     Community living in Shanghai's lane neighbourhoods. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    Cacophonous and comforting all at the same time. This is a city of business. At its worst, you have this ubiquitous mix of honking, heavy construction, loud individuals shouting on mobile phones or at each other, blaring commercials in the metro, on public buses and in the streets. It can be quite an assault on the senses but how is that any different from any major urban city? But the unique (and my favourite) soundtrack of Shanghai is in the lane neighborhoods where the rest of the city melts away a little. Residents usually keep their doors or windows open when they are at home so you can hear life happening: Mahjong tiles being shuffled, the latest variety show on TV, the strains of Chinese opera on the radio or someone practicing the violin. The squeals of children and their pattering feet up and down the alleys are normal and welcome. As the sun slowly sets, you can catch pockets of chatter as neighbours catch up with the local gossip, the sound of running taps as they rinse vegetables in public sinks, and woks being fired up for dinner. Best place for a conversation     An elderly man exercises in a park downtown. Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters    With close friends, a chat while meandering through the idyllic and leafy former French Concession area is very ideal. I\u2019d end the day on the cozy patio of the cafe Ginger by The Park which is in the quiet part of town. I\u2019ve also written up a list of stand out cafes and teahouses around Shanghai here. But if you want to interact with older Chinese folks to gain a better insight into local culture, I\u2019d head to any large public park at dusk like People\u2019s Park or Lu Xun Park. They might be singing in groups, dancing the waltz or fox-trot, or practising calisthenics, and are very open to newcomers. What one thing is indispensable for life in Shanghai?     A Shanghai street with the Pearl Tower behind it. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    Patience, ironically because most people here don\u2019t seem to have enough of it. In Shanghai, everybody wants everything done and delivered not now but yesterday. They are always in a rush, pushing and prodding when they don\u2019t get what they want now. As a result, manners tend to fall to the wayside and it\u2019s easy to start behaving as rudely as the harried person you\u2019re dealing with. A little bit of patience will go a long way for all of us in this city.  Are you optimistic about Shanghai&apos;s future?     Shanghai hosted the World Expo. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    Yes, it\u2019s hard to contemplate otherwise. China\u2019s ongoing financial liberalisation will only benefit Shanghai in its long-term ambitions to be a global financial city on par with New York and London. No doubt the opportunities will translate into larger talent and migration flows into Shanghai, a higher standard (and therefore cost) of living, and even greater pressure on the use of land in prime areas. In my view, Shanghai as a city has always been very confident about looking forward, which is why the local authorities should be very aware of the socio-economic and urban planning challenges that will accompany their successes.

Marker&apos;s many other works included a pioneering run of essay films (including the magnificent Sans Soleil), documentaries on Tarkovsky and Kurosawa, and everything from essays to photo diaries to a virtual museum in Second Life.

The original marathon man ran from the battlefield of Marathon to Athens and died from his exertions. If only he&apos;d had the right gear. Tragically, compression tights made of supportive memory fabric with state-of-the-art temperature management and engineered gradient systems that enhance the blood flow and reduce lactic acid buildup were not available in 490BC. Nor was a GPS watch connected wirelessly to a heart-rate monitor and a satellite system supplying data to an analytical website tracking everything from gradient to wind speed. Nor were carbohydrate gels, whey protein shakes, caffeine blocks or beetroot shots. Nor, indeed, were ultra-lightweight running shoes with segmented crash pads, arch locks, power grids, full-length ventilation systems, welded overlays, torsion control and TPU cages, all built on carbon soles that promise an innovative fluid ride and superb flexibility. The uninitiated could be forgiven for thinking that running has changed little since Pheidippides&apos;s fatal first marathon. But, as the large crowds milling around last week&apos;s London Marathon expo confirmed, things have moved on in the past 2,500 years. For every runner yearning to return to natural running and reconnect with their former hunter-gatherer selves, there are plenty more seduced by the latest performance-boosting products flooding the market. Their faith in innovation is not misplaced. Man is irrefutably getting quicker. In 1896 the fastest time for a marathon stood at 2:58:50. Today the record, set by Kenya&apos;s Wilson Kipsang in Berlin last year, is down to a jaw-dropping 2:03:23. Kipsang will be running in London in one of the most eagerly anticipated races in history. It features an all-star cast, including last year&apos;s winner, Ethiopia&apos;s Tsegaye Kebede; the London course record holder, Kenyan Emmanuel Mutai; the Olympic champion, Stephen Kiprotic from Uganda; and, of course, Mo Farah, who is on course to break the British record. The fact that almost an hour has been slashed off marathon times in little more than a century suggests that running is benefiting from the application of new scientific and technological approaches. But experts counsel against swallowing this line unquestioningly. John Brewer, who is professor of sport at the University of Bedfordshire and the exercise nutrition adviser for the London Marathon, points out that more people than ever are running marathons. Last year, for the first time, six marathons \u2013 New York City, Chicago, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo and London \u2013 had more than 34,000 finishers, while 31 marathons worldwide had more than 10,000 finishers. Marathon running is no longer a niche sport. &quot;Inevitably, with a broader base, you will get more people developing and getting through to the highest level,&quot; Brewer said. It is at the elite level, where geography and science have collided, that there has been the most noticeable improvement in performance. &quot;There has been an increase in the domination of Kenyan, Ethiopian and Tanzanian athletes who have really pushed the boundaries of elite running,&quot; Brewer said. &quot;But they&apos;ve also been exposed to the top-level coaching. They&apos;ve come over and lived in America and this country; they&apos;ve had access to sports science and sports nutrition.&quot; Dr Steve Ingham, director of science and technical development at the English Institute of Sport, which worked with most of Team GB&apos;s Olympic and Paralympic medallists at the 2012 Games, said east African runners had a clear physiological advantage when it came to distance running: &quot;The calf and the lower shank of the leg are extraordinarily thin and slim on most east African runners. What that means is when they are swinging their leg forward in the recovery phase of a running action, there is a much smaller cost to that movement, so the efficiency of running is much better.&quot; But this is not to say anyone born outside the Great Rift Valley should despair. &quot;Give me an athlete, and a sports scientist should be able to make them go faster,&quot; Ingham said. On his blog, he plots a graph tracking the deployment of physiologists against medal positions at the 2012 Games. The bottom line? The more physiologists \u2013 scientists who study the performance of the body \u2013 the more golds. And now much of what the elite athletes have learned is being shared with mere mortals. In terms of nutrition, Brewer believes the great breakthrough came in the 1970s, when the running world turned away from high-protein diets. &quot;There was a realisation that carbohydrate, which comes from starch and sugars and is stored in the muscles as glycogen, is effectively the petrol for marathon running. If you could manipulate your diet, so that you could boost those glycogen stores, then maybe you could enhance your performance. Maybe by only one or two percentage points but that could be one or two minutes.&quot; The evolution of isotonic drinks has also helped. &quot;The science will show they provide the optimal rate of both fluid and fuel,&quot; Brewer said. &quot;It could be the difference between really struggling over the last three or four miles and getting over the finishing line before you dehydrate. High-carbohydrate gels can play a part, too. The average marathon runner can make it around 17 miles before they run out of fuel. A typical gel will supply enough fuel for a mile of running. Physiologists have a tried and tested theory for bridging the gap. &quot;The secret is a combination of training and pacing. The training will get you more aerobically fit, and the pacing will make sure that you set off at a lower percentage than your maximum. So you will burn a bit of fat as well as carbohydrate. Most of us have enough fat for about 40 consecutive marathons! The problem is that the body doesn&apos;t draw on fat when you are running because it can&apos;t supply fuel at a fast enough rate. But if you set off slowly, you can supplement the glycogen with some fat, so instead of using up your carbohydrate stores you might be able to get them to 21 miles or beyond.&quot; Tests can determine a runner&apos;s lactate threshold \u2013 the point at which debilitating lactate in the blood begins to accumulate during exercise \u2013 as well as the maximum amount of oxygen they can consume, known as VO2 max. Fitter runners have higher VO2 max values and can exercise more intensely. And then there are the gadgets. It cannot be long before some runners start copying Farah and sleeping in oxygen tents on the nights leading up to a big race. And many runners swear by their GPS watches and heart-rate monitors. So would they all benefit if they spent \u00a33,000 on a hypoxic generator? Surprisingly, Ingham believes that for around half, the answer is yes. But how much of this improvement is physiological and how much psychological is debatable. &quot;The mere presence of somebody with perceived expertise makes a runner feel a personalised benefit akin to a placebo,&quot; Ingham said. &quot;You put fancy gizmos on somebody, look like you&apos;re a scientist, nod several times and say, &apos;why don&apos;t you try this?&apos;.&quot; But as Farah, a man who spends large parts of his life altitude training and is surrounded by the world&apos;s best sports physiologists, knows better than anyone, science can get you only so far. Although he will have pacemakers , he will be running without a watch. &quot;I&apos;ll just go with the feeling,&quot; he said."}, {"sentences": ["Central bankers in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and especially in the Federal Reserve will make sure it all works smoothly."], "tags": ["Global economy", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "World news", "Christine Lagarde", "Economics", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-12T23:04:04Z", "title": "Someone wake up the IMF.

Despite some dire warnings about risky trading and the threat posed by overly indebted banks, the mood last week at the International Monetary Fund&apos;s spring conference was one of calm. We have turned a corner since the financial crisis, the Washington-based organisation says. Normality is returning. And this will mean establishing normal interest rates (up from 0.5% in the UK to 2%-3%, according to Mark Carney), restoring normal inflation and generating steady growth in the west of 2%-3%. Officials expect the US to lead the way. As consumer-in-chief, it will propel the world economy and global growth much as it has in the last 60 years. The dynamism of the US economy and its huge capacity to buy stuff will make life better for everyone, goes the rather tired argument. The legacies of the crash will be disposed of quietly. Having spent north of $3 trillion pumping funds into its economy and maintaining the cheapest borrowing costs in more than 100\u00a0years, the US central bank will find a way to sell this money back to the market, while at the same increasing rates, without much more than a ripple disturbing the markets. Central bankers in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and especially in the Federal Reserve will make sure it all works smoothly. Suddenly officials at the IMF are using the term &quot;finely calibrated&quot; in their discussions. No longer are governments involved in crude, large-scale pump-priming to rescue bankrupt banks. Today they execute technical exit strategies that magically restore the old order without any losses or panic. One official called this the &quot;Goldilocks exit&quot;, by which he meant the transition would be one that involved the patient getting neither too hot nor too cold, but with a temperature that was just right. George Osborne revealed himself a cheerleader for the technocratic answer to debt and financial risk. The chancellor declared on Friday that central banks and regulators would make sure the west&apos;s economies had a bright future, as they withdrew the post-2008 stimulus and locked down risky lending. It would be a neat trick. And the betting must be that it will fail. It will fail because policymakers will be unable to cope with more fundamental forces at work. First there are the debts: government debts and household debts across the developed world. Put simply they are still too high. Bank debts in the eurozone and corporate debts in many emerging-market economies are similarly at risk from small financial shocks. The eurozone poses a particular problem. Spain is growing, but only with the help of government cash. Like Ireland, its banks are still in a parlous state. France is staggering on, but Italy is in permanent recession. Inflation is falling to the point that many worry it will go into reverse. Deflation means not only falling prices but also falling wages. The Germans have blocked initiatives that might boost output, especially in weaker countries, and are preventing the European Central Bank (ECB) from printing money to boost spending. ECB boss Mario Draghi may break free of German control, but any action will be too late. Casualties already lie everywhere. Another part of the problem is the legacy of savings generated in Asia. That savings glut has had to find a home, and one that provides a good return. There is about $70tn-$80tn invested in assets of various kinds from government bonds to property and exotic derivatives. The IMF highlighted how a $300bn market in US credit mutual funds in 2000 has grown to $2tn today. These funds are invested in junk bonds that are difficult to sell when the panic starts, making the panic even worse. Andy Haldane, soon to be chief economist at the Bank of England, told an audience of economists in Toronto last week that we were &quot;still in the intellectual foothills in terms of dealing with potential financial risks&quot;. He pointed out that while there was some good news \u2013 for instance that banks in 2006 had borrowings worth 32 times their balance sheets and now &quot;only&quot; about 21 times \u2013 the problem had shifted to exotic derivatives, which accounted for $19tn of bank portfolios in 2006, but total $31tn today. Then there is the fact that 90% of trades in New York are generated by algorithm-driven computers, making the financial system prone to extreme\u00a0volatility. Savings are generally seen as benign and the result of virtue and thrift, but they are dangerous when handed to investment managers under pressure to produce high returns. The IMF wants a financial system with airlocks that can contain panics, but knows there are instruments of contagion everywhere it looks. Its boss, Christine Lagarde, has warned of the threats, but without accusing those whose complacency she fears. It is time for some straight talking."}, {"sentences": ["We go around \u2013 to New York, Paris, London, Seoul, Tokyo \u2013 and we look at books, look at vintage."], "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-12T23:05:00Z", "title": "Why the Kooples are every couple's best friend", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/apr/13/perfect-kooples-fashion-brothers-paris", "article": "Paris&apos;s Place Vend\u00f4me used to be famous for its dressmakers \u2013 Madame Ch\u00e9ruit had her headquarters here, as did Schiaparelli \u2013 but few remain. Now it&apos;s known best for the Ritz and the last sad journey of Princess Diana. However, a new breed of fashion designer has moved in. In a hotel off the square&apos;s north-east corner is a suite of monochrome rooms filled with skulls. Skulls are incorporated into the lamps, stamped into candles and visible in the features of Keith Richards in a vast photograph. &quot;In the end, we are all skulls,&quot; said one of the three black-clad brothers who greeted me. In the photograph Richards isn&apos;t alone. Anita Pallenberg lies across a chair beside him, all legs and gold wedges. The brothers in front of me \u2013 Alexandre (37), Laurent (36) and Rapha\u00ebl (26) \u2013 are inspired by this picture, and by the couple at its heart. The Elicha siblings know that people want to emulate couples like Richards and Pallenberg and have ridden this hunch through the recession with their brand the Kooples.            To many, theirs is an unlikely success story. Arriving in the UK in 2010, the Kooples was part of a wave of French fashion brands \u2013 such as Sandro and Maje \u2013 that invaded the British high street and became arguably the best known, thanks to their advertising onslaught showing ridiculously cool couples telling us how long they&apos;d been together. It seemed a\u00a0little smug. Today you&apos;ll struggle to miss their shops full of skinny jeans, crisp shirts and well- tailored rock-star jackets on the posher high streets. The Elichas have boutiques across Europe and are currently launching in New York and LA (having tested the market in Bloomingdales). After that comes Seoul. &quot;The concept touches everyone,&quot; says Laurent. Walking around Paris, it is clear from the number of couples carrying bags from Kooples how many buy into the concept. They now have 321 &quot;points of sale&quot; in Europe and the US and 17 stores in London alone, &quot;which is a lot for such a young brand in the recent economic climate,&quot; says Honor Westnedge, a\u00a0senior retail analyst at Verdict. Backed by a\u00a0private equity firm, the Elichas are picking their spots carefully \u2013 and ensuring there are more of the bigger (they say &quot;athletic&quot;) sizes \u2013 as they go into the US. We are now in a room filled with the new season&apos;s collection. Women can have a boyfriend shirt in floral print for \u00a3120, men a linen &quot;skullhead sailor&quot; T-shirt for \u00a370. &quot;Is your ideal a world where you are walking down the street and all the couples are dressed alike?&quot; I ask. &quot;That would be nice,&quot; says Alexandre. &quot;That would be funny,&quot; says Raphael. Their look is unashamedly retro. Laurent, who designs the womenswear, is dressed in leathers and seems to be channelling Marlon Brando via fashion&apos;s favourite architect, Peter Marino. Alexandre, responsible for the menswear, is smooth in good English tailoring (their creative director is the Savile Row tailor Patrick Grant). And Rafael, the baby, who is in charge of the branding, comes across as a bit of a geek. Good at koopling, they are all married and their wives, they assure me, wear the brand.     Alice and Matt wear the Kooples' new rockabilly look.    What interests them, Alexandre says, is stories. And the Elicha story, of taking often unspoken truths about people&apos;s behaviour and profiting from them, comes from their parents. Tony and Georgette founded Comptoir des Cotonniers in 1995, the hugely successful womenswear brand which plays on the idea of being chic yet unthreateningly trendy enough to sell simultaneously to mothers and daughters. &quot;It was our mother who had the idea,&quot; says Alexandre. &quot;We were there at the beginning. We didn&apos;t know how to do marketing so we went to see one of the biggest agencies with the concept and they said: &apos;No, mothers and daughters never want to dress like this.&apos; But we did it, and it was a phenomenon. Because of that we wanted to continue to do things with real stories.&quot; I ask whether it&apos;s hard working together as a family. &quot;I have a lot of friends who say they couldn&apos;t do it,&quot; says Alexandre. &quot;But I don&apos;t think I could work with anyone else. You can disagree on a\u00a0lot of things, but as long as you are not blocked you can work together. There are a lot of great things. You can trust your family. And things go faster because if you&apos;ve grown up together, you know each other so with two or three words, my brothers know what I want.&quot;     Val and Ani wear this season's Kooples collection.    He points to the collection: &quot;We try and find common inspiration. This collection, we have a rockabilly, teddy boy thing. We go around \u2013 to New York, Paris, London, Seoul, Tokyo \u2013 and we look at books, look at vintage. We talk and find the good idea. Build something with colour, range and great fabric. We build something that can inspire men and women.&quot; We discuss the candles and lamps \u2013 the homeware they are getting into \u2013 and finally come back to the skulls. &quot;It&apos;s a big spiritual story,&quot; says Alexandre. &quot;It will always be the big question. What&apos;s under this life? What&apos;s happening besides this?&quot; You are discussing these sort of questions? &quot;Of course! The skull reminds you that you don&apos;t have the time you want. There is an end.&quot; Which is something to think about next time you turn on a lamp."}, {"sentences": ["He was delighted to be posted in 1979 back to Japan as director of the British Council in Tokyo, but an increasingly bureaucratic management and the grey mood created by financial cuts took its toll."], "tags": ["Books", "Crime fiction", "Japan", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-13T14:34:52Z", "title": "Peter Martin obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/13/peter-martin", "article": "Our father, Peter Martin, who has died aged 83, was a cultural diplomat and author of many books, from histories to mysteries, often centred on Japan.

After a stay in Indonesia, it was a posting to Kyoto in 1963 that began a long and productive relationship with Japan. Kyoto attracted a wide range of British dignitaries and, as the only &quot;official&quot; British figure there, Peter entertained them all. The list included Tony Benn, Iris Murdoch, Angus Wilson, Bridget Riley and Dame Janet Baker. He managed to spill drinks, not once but twice, on Princess Margaret. But he found the time to learn Japanese, open a new office and supervise the British pavilion at Expo 70 in Osaka, and was rewarded by being made an MBE.

Between then and 1992, he produced 13 fast-moving intrigues, full of vivid detail and insights into Japanese life and culture. Early retirement in 1983 enabled him to write full-time. He wrote spy stories, historical novels, including The Imperial Way about the 1936 Japanese military coup, and a history of the Japanese emperors. Peter enjoyed the writer&apos;s life, Crime Writers&apos; Association events and the status of having his papers archived by Boston University. His marriage to Catherine ended in separation, and he spent his retirement years with Carole Rawcliffe, a medieval historian, in Norwich. They travelled extensively. After a stroke, he stopped serious writing but learned ancient Greek rapidly from scratch, followed Norwich City football club, helped Carole with research and enjoyed life to the full, although deeply affected by the early death of Natasha, one of his four grandchildren.

Protest banners on a Shanghai house. 'Chairman Mao, the people miss you. Corrupt officials are scared of you,' reads one. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    The process of demolishing an old neighbourhood can take several years from notification to the first swing of the wrecking ball. Local district officials hire relocation companies to negotiate with residents to arrive at acceptable compensation, which can be used to acquire alternative new housing in distant suburbs. Surrounded by the daily reminder of the gulf between rich and poor in Shanghai, where Louis Vuitton stores and Ferraris are common, residents lament that the compensation they receive is paltry. Among the older generation, many retired on modest pensions or running small businesses, a handful have resorted to open protest about being short-changed, refusing to vacate their premises even as neighbouring houses begin to be taken apart. Eventually, their homes become lone structures, like small boats in a sea of rubble. The local media coined the term &quot;nail houses&quot;, similar to obtrusive nails that are stuck and irremovable in wood \u2013 or, as some citizens point out darkly, to be pounded into submission with a hammer. Intimidation and forced evictions of nail-house residents by hired thugs or employees of demolition companies are not uncommon. Sometimes they even result in deaths. A few years ago, the central government passed laws prohibiting the use of violence in the housing relocation process; in larger cities like Shanghai, residents who are more likely to be well-versed in their constitutional rights have involved the police and courts to guard against any unlawful action. But intimidation and forced seizure are frequently reported. The issue of relocation is complex, and the choice to protest is sometimes frowned upon by surrounding neighbours who have been bought out. There is a clear generational divide over how residents feel about relocating homes. Younger Shanghainese tend to be more eager to upgrade from crumbling stairs, poorly lit communal kitchens and public toilets for more spacious and modern apartments in fresh-aired suburbs. The older generation, having adapted to decades of cramped living conditions and the convenience of nearby hospitals and parks, are more reticent about leaving the tight-knit communities they grew up in. Taking a stand All afternoon, crowds came and went as a repertoire of old Communist party songs played on a loop from the old house. A man in his 50s shrugged when asked how long the homeowner had been protesting, as if inured to such developments. &quot;Weeks now, months \u2026 maybe a year? This isn\u2019t the only nail house in the neighbourhood.&quot; An old man in a Mao cap, who had relocated from this area to the eastern suburbs a year earlier, told me he still returned weekly to his old local barbershop to chat with his former neighbours. Pointing to the banners, he said: \u201cOrdinary people like us will never prevail against the [real estate] developers. These residents take a stand to make a point, but in the end they inevitably have to accept reality and move on.\u201d His words captured the common dilemma of Shanghai\u2019s lower urban classes, left behind during Shanghai\u2019s boom years. They are stuck living around a modern city they cannot afford and which them out of the way.     Some older Shanghainese  are reluctant to leave the cramped but well-connected inner city areas they grew up in.

To cope with neglect and injustice, some of Shanghai\u2019s older generation are harking back to old symbols of authority to remind people of the party\u2019s once-utopian roots of class equality, social harmony and corruption-free society as championed by the Great Helmsman himself, Mao Zedong. The death and violence caused by the Cultural Revolution is a blind spot; instead, these residents focus on the nostalgia of what they believe to be fairer and better days from socialism\u2019s past. Caught in the shifting sands of Chinese megacity development, no one, it seems, is speaking out for Shanghai\u2019s urban poor as they are removed from their homes and priced out to distant corners they never imagined visiting, much less living in. Their call for Mao feels not so much like a genuine cry for history, but for the sense of loss of a community lifestyle \u2013 and the city they call home."}, {"sentences": ["Our man in Tokyo, Justin McCurry, says: &quot;In Japanese someone who has achieved something noteworthy might say temae miso nan desu ga ...

The confusion, and subsequent hilarity, was the result of my English-first speaking brain, translating the wordplay into a context that has no existence in Bengali. Play as in &quot;I will play a game&quot; (khelbo) simply cannot be used in the way we say &quot;I will play the xylophone&quot; (bajabo), and certainly not any others: &quot;I will play a part&quot; (hobo) in a, well, play (natok). This has gone down in the annals of my family as one of many comical tales of my mangling of Bengali in my youth along with &quot;wearing&quot; insect repellent (in Bengali you &quot;spread&quot; it) and attempting to &quot;comb&quot; a cousin&apos;s hair (comb is never a verb; literally translated, you &quot;scratch&quot; someone&apos;s hair). But say it was the other way around \u2013 if Bengali was my first language, and I witnessed something and was interviewed by an English-language newspaper, saying &quot;I was just scratching my hair when I saw the crash&quot; \u2013 that would make me sound rather foolish, wouldn&apos;t it? When it comes to journalistic quotes there is a fine line between being accurate and being fair to the person speaking: the difference between quoting verbatim and conveying their point. When it comes to people speaking in a second language, or more precariously, conducting a conversation in another language and then translating the quotes, it&apos;s barely a meniscus. Every journalist irons out an interviewee&apos;s responses to make them structurally make sense \u2013 yet when it comes to people who are expressing themselves in a second tongue, an obsession with perceived accuracy can inadvertently make them sound confused, ignorant or, worst of all, dense. In a recent Guardian interview with Venezuela&apos;s President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, conducted in Spanish, he waxed lyrical about his love of the rock and hippy culture of the 1960s and 70s. &quot;We listened to Robert Plant, Led Zeppelin, and listened to and lived through the life of John Lennon.&quot; The unedited story had him saying &quot;and listening to and living through the life of John Lennon&quot; which reads oddly, but is an exact translation. So which is more &quot;accurate&quot; \u2013 the exact words used by an educated man, a head of state no less, speaking in a second language, that make him seem doddery? Or our very slightly adjusted interpretation, which conveys his meaning in complete sentences? In some instances, using [sic] seems to me barely more than a nudge and a snigger. With politicians, celebrities and experts, while the wording can often be crucial, we can assume they are likely to have a degree of media savvy about them that we cannot for members of the public. I canvassed opinion from the Guardian&apos;s foreign correspondents \u2013 that urbane group of polyglots who have to deal with several languages, time zones and cultures simultaneously to bring us the news. They overwhelmingly agreed that when it came to quoting non-native English speakers, either they themselves or our various editorial desks should help them along. As Suzanne Goldenberg, who has reported from India, the Middle East and the US, says: &quot;If it&apos;s a charming but odd use of idiom \u2013 &apos;I feel like a donkey out of water&apos; or something \u2013 then I just don&apos;t use it. I guess my bottom line is we shouldn&apos;t set out to make people look dumb, especially if they are civilians.&quot; Idioms are by their nature tied to language and culture so can cause all manner of problems; and yet they can also result in magical copy, adding colour and atmosphere. It&apos;s the difference between a Colombian feeling like a fish out of water \u2013 a phrase so common it doesn&apos;t even need quotation marks \u2013 or feeling &quot;as lost as a cockroach at a chicken dance&quot;. I know which my editors would prefer. Rory Carroll, our LA correspondent, previously based in Caracas, agrees we should clean up grammar, &quot;except when someone&apos;s imperfect English is relevant or adds context and flavour, like crowds in Liberia chanting &apos;we is hungry, we is dyin&apos;.&quot; Tania Branigan, our Beijing bureau chief, says: &quot;People whose English is not &apos;standard&apos; can be much more eloquent than those who supposedly speak it perfectly.&quot; This is especially pronounced in Commonwealth countries, where English can be taught in a more florid and formal manner. Indian newspapers, for example, regularly refer to &quot;swashbuckling innings&quot; in their cricket reports. David Smith, Africa correspondent, knows this only too well with so many various former colonies on his patch: &quot;Somalis and Zimbabweans speak a very distinct and lyrical form of English. Zimbabweans in particular have an ornate, almost Edwardian English. But it&apos;s not so pronounced that it appears incongruous when quoted.&quot; When it comes to other languages, you simply have to trust the people in the field. Our man in Tokyo, Justin McCurry, says: &quot;In Japanese someone who has achieved something noteworthy might say temae miso nan desu ga ... (&apos;there is some miso paste on this side, but \u2026 &apos;) which makes no sense at all. I feel within my rights to translate that as: &apos;Well, I don&apos;t want to blow my own trumpet \u2026 &apos;.&quot; Ian Black, Middle East editor, adds: &quot;In colloquial Arabic bukra fil mishmish translates as &apos;tomorrow when the apricots bloom&apos;. What it actually means is something akin to &apos;and pigs might fly&apos;.&quot; Sometimes there&apos;s simply no way around a direct translation. Philip Oltermann, based in Berlin, says: &quot;I wrote about the Heidegger notebooks recently. The exact wording was so important there that I just had to accept that some of the sentences would be very long and very clunky.&quot; We are of course past the days when &quot;pressmen&quot; telexed dispatches from exotic locations; the onslaught of globalisation has made news, and in some senses language, a more universal and accessible currency. Harriet Sherwood, recently returned from a stint as Jerusalem correspondent, says: &quot;I was always awed by the fact that so many Israelis and Palestinians speak English.&quot; Kim Willsher, Paris correspondent, acknowledges who keeps us honest when it comes to linguistic gymnastics \u2013 our readers. &quot;There are, thankfully rare, occasions when I&apos;ve had a complete language malfunction, and you can be sure that a bilingual/polyglot Guardian reader will pick it up and we&apos;ll have to think again.&quot; I think she hits the nail on the head, or mathar opore perek mereche in Bengali in case you&apos;re interested \u2013 and no, it doesn&apos;t make any sense.

These range from economic downturns and changing demographic trends, to deepening social divisions and a growing strain on the environment. Local citizens increasingly expect and demand local authorities to address such challenges proactively. And while some cities have embraced long-lasting and impactful changes such as mobility sensors, energy efficiency systems and new telecommunications architectures, others have fallen short by only focusing on band-aid strategies. To help cities develop more effective solutions, we created an index that captures the dimensions in a single indicator and ranks 135 cities around the world. The IESE Cities in Motion Index looks at 10 key dimensions that define a city: governance, public management, urban planning, technology, the environment, international outreach, social cohesion, human capital and the economy. The ranking analyses the dimensions, which encompass a wide and integrated vision of how well a city is performing overall, and identifies strong and weak aspects. The 2014 index reveals that successful cases are scant due to the short-term and piecemeal approach of many institutions expected to drive change. But there was good news for some of the world&apos;s urban hubs: Tokyo (1), London (2) and NYC (3) rise victorious in the test of being cities ready to embrace the future. The three global centres have a good understanding of their current situation, a clear vision and consistent implementation of their strategic urban plans. At the bottom of the list were cities struggling in these areas. Key challenges faced by many of those ranked poorly include a lack of collaboration among public and private entities, civic institutions and citizens; the inability to promote new business models that provide financing for new enterprises; and a myopic view of smart cities. Many civic leaders still see technology as the main ingredient of an intelligent city and fail to consider other critical dimensions that define the reality of a city. We also looked at key challenges and risks cities are facing in the near and distant future. For example, although London excelled in the overall ranking, could social upheaval be a threat to its position? Should Londoners worry that their governments are not doing enough to ease social divisions? The answer is yes. Our index traces where some cities could be if authorities took the right decisions or if, in the contrary, they rested on their laurels. We categorised the cities in the ranking into four distinct groups: High potential: cities showing a very fast-paced rate of positive change, although they depart from a relatively low position. In the first set, we can find Latin American capitals such as Buenos Aires, Quito or Lima, as well as Asian cities like Shanghai or Guangzhou. Challenger: Beijing, Toronto and Barcelona are included in this group. These cities show a rapid rate of improvement and have already reached the upper to high zone of the ranking. Vulnerable: The lower-left quadrant shows cities growing at a slower pace and being at the medium to low position within the overall ranking. Cities in this group include Caracas, Cairo and Athens. Consolidated: The last quadrant is that of consolidated cities such as New York, Paris, London, Oslo, Tokyo and Seoul. These are cities with a generally medium to high positions, but whose growth rate has remained relatively low. So what can be learned from the study? First, there is no single model for success. Even though successful cities have some common features, the same strategy will not work for all cities. It is not enough to be good in just one dimension. Some cities rank at the top in certain dimensions, yet don&apos;t meet acceptable minimums in the full set of dimensions. It is vital to understand the different criteria examined in the ranking and how they interrelate. Unfortunately, the perfect city still does not exist. Even those that are placed in the top ranks have weaknesses. As we have seen, the top three cities in our ranking (Tokyo, London and New York) have a long way to go in terms of social cohesion. Finally, change is slow. Time-based analysis indicates that changes in a city&apos;s placement within the ranking were not significant from one year to the next. This is because major projects usually take significant time to take hold. Cities that want to become smart and sustainable should adopt long-term policies as soon as possible. The overarching goal should be to develop urban spaces where people can live and carry out their activities with the greatest opportunity and probabilities of success, within a liveable, creative and socially responsible environment. Cities should work towards creating more attractive places and generating healthier, happier and more prosperous lives for all citizens.

Where there are people on Okinawa, a Japanese island almost 1,000 miles south of Tokyo, the distinctive tones of the three-stringed instrument are never far away. Music is deeply rooted in Okinawa&apos;s tragic place in Japan&apos;s history and the conduit for its modern grievances against the glut of US military bases on the island. As Barack Obama prepares to visit Tokyo to meet Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, later in April, the anti-war message of sanshin players such as Shoukichi Kina and Misako Oshiro is back in vogue as the subtropical island confronts its biggest political challenge since it reverted from US to Japanese rule in the 1970s.. In his mid-60s, Kina cuts a controversial figure as spiritual leader of Okinawa&apos;s activist musicians. Since the release of their first single Haisai Ojisan (Hey, Man!) in the 1970s, Kina and his band Champloose have done more than any other artists to secure Okinawan music against competition from mass-market Japanese J-pop and the more innocent musical motifs of the mainland folk genres minyo and enka. &quot;Our job as musicians should be to celebrate the good and do something about fixing the bad,&quot; said Kina, who some have called Okinawa&apos;s answer to Bob Marley. &quot;That&apos;s why I hate the military bases here, but I love Americans.&quot; Though it accounts for less than 1% of Japan&apos;s total area, Okinawa is now home to about 75% of US bases in Japan and half its 50,000 troops. Military facilities take up a fifth of the island. Obama and Abe are expected to discuss the controversial relocation of Futenma, a sprawling US marine base, from a heavily populated part of Okinawa to an unspoiled location on the island&apos;s northeast coast, as the allies attempt to lessen the island&apos;s military burden. The move is opposed by most islanders, including the residents of Nago, whose city lies near the proposed site for the new base.     Shoukichi Kina is one of Japan's biggest folk rock stars. He and his band Champloose have done much to promote Okinawan music amid competition from mass-market Japanese J-pop. Photograph: Itsuo Inouye/AP    The spirit of resistance pioneered by Kina is to be found in the more eclectic music of Tatsumi Chibana, a quietly spoken 33-year-old university graduate and perhaps the most visible of Okinawa&apos;s new generation of rebel artists, fusing traditional sounds with rock, reggae and hip-hop. After a US military helicopter from the Futenma US marine base crashed into Okinawa International University in 2004, Chibana was moved to write his best-known song, Tami no Domino (People&apos;s Domino), a collaboration between his band Duty Free Shopp and local rapper Kakumakushaka. The incendiary lyrics reflect the feeling of many residents towards the ever-present threat to safety posed by the island&apos;s 27,000 US troops and their hardware: &quot;Surrounded by weapons in the land of disorder; what the hell can you tell me about peace in a place like this?&quot; Most of Chibana&apos;s music eschews the sanshin and other traditional instruments, but his background looms large, he said. &quot;I&apos;m always aware of my Okinawan identity when I make music. OK, so I wasn&apos;t brought up listening to folk songs, but the spirit of that old music is in mine. It doesn&apos;t matter whether I play reggae, hip-hop or rock, it&apos;s still Okinawan music.&quot; Despite appearances at concerts organised to protest against the Futenma relocation, Chibana is reluctant to be pigeonholed. &quot;The base issue is huge, but my protests songs aren&apos;t anti-base, so much as pro-community. I&apos;m not interested in the ideological battles between left and right. The theme I really want to explore through my music is that no matter what happens, local people&apos;s way of life must be protected.&quot; Like Kina, Chibana occasionally sings in the Okinawan language Uchinaguchi \u2013 an artistic choice that renders his lyrics unintelligible to many Japanese, but which exemplifies the island&apos;s historical and emotional sense of detachment from the mainland. In the 16th century, where the sanshin&apos;s origins lie, Okinawa was part of the Ryukyu kingdom, which, while politically independent, had tributary relations with Ming dynasty China. Forced annexation by Japan came in the late 1800s, followed in the 1940s by the carnage of the Pacific war. Less than a century after it was forcibly made part of Japan, Okinawa was the scene of one of the second world war&apos;s bloodiest battles. An estimated 240,000 Japanese and Americans died, including more than a quarter of Okinawa&apos;s civilian population, after US forces invaded in June 1945. Japanese troops distributed grenades to civilians, urging them to commit suicide or risk being raped and murdered by American soldiers. &quot;There are lots of songs about how terribly the Okinawans were treated in the war,&quot; said John Potter, the author of the only English-language book on Okinawan music and a prolific blogger on the subject. Okinawa&apos;s return to Japan in 1972 \u2013 almost three decades after the war \u2013 fuelled the local sense of &quot;otherness&quot; from the mainland. Not all Okinawan musicians draw inspiration from the island&apos;s bloody past, Potter said. &quot;Many songs come back to what a fantastic place Okinawa is. Lots of artists sing about their culture and being island people, and their pride in being different.&quot; Poverty \u2013 Okinawa is Japan&apos;s poorest prefecture \u2013 and the looming clouds of conflict sent many people in search of new lives overseas, creating a diaspora whose youngest members are making their presence felt on the island&apos;s contemporary music scene. Lucy Nagamine, a Peruvian-born singer whose grandparents left Okinawa shortly before the war, learned classical Ryukyu music from her grandmother and picked up her deceased grandfather&apos;s sanshin at the age of 10. Before settling in her ancestral homeland several years ago, Lucy often sang for Okinawan immigrants in Peru who were desperate to preserve the emotional ties with home. &quot;Now I&apos;m here in Okinawa, away from the country of my birth, I know how my grandparents and other immigrants felt,&quot; she said in between songs at her regular venue, a restaurant in Naha. &quot;In those days immigrants had nothing to do except sing and play the sanshin. It was a central part of their existence, and why music and the Okinawan lifestyle are closely intertwined, even today.&quot; Less polemic are Nenes, a group of four whose lineup has gone through several reincarnations since they were formed by the legendary artist and producer Sadao China in 1990. Nenes perform classic Okinawan songs for groups of tourists from the mainland. One rare departure from their otherwise &quot;safe&quot; repertoire is their stirring version of Keisuke Kuwata&apos;s Heiwa no Kyuka, which simmers with resentment over Okinawa&apos;s bloody wartime sacrifice. &quot;Who decided this country was at peace,&quot; the song asks, &quot;Even before the people&apos;s tears have dried?&quot; &quot;Now that we&apos;re confronting the base issue again, this is a good time to sing about peace,&quot; said 24-year-old Mayuko Higa. &quot;It&apos;s important that the people who come to see us perform know why it&apos;s an important subject here.&quot; Nenes&apos; tourist-friendly melodies can seem a world away from Kina&apos;s ceaseless quest for social and political change, an artist who implores the world&apos;s armies to swap their weapons for musical instruments. His decade-old feud with NHK, Japan&apos;s national broadcaster, proves that Japan&apos;s mainstream media and firebrand politics can be uncomfortable bedfellows. &quot;They demanded that I drop any references to peace from my performance,&quot; Kina said, his arms in motion again as he recalls his incredulity. &quot;I refused, of course, and they haven&apos;t invited me back since. The message for Okinawan musicians has always been that if you want to get on in this industry, then keep your mouth shut. But I&apos;ll say what I like.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["It stocks mainly second-hand vinyl \u2013 from rockabilly 45s to Australian garage oddities \u2013 and has the best collection of Japanese prog you\u2019ll find outside Tokyo (but don\u2019t quote me on that)."], "tags": ["Record Store Day", "Music", "Australia news", "Vinyl"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-18T04:50:39Z", "title": "Record Store Day: out with the CD racks, in with the vinyl crates", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2014/apr/18/record-store-day-out-with-the-cd-racks-in-with-the-vinyl-crates", "article": "My local is Licorice Pie, a tiny shopfront wedged between a milk bar and graphic design business in a shabby little corner of the Melbourne suburb of Prahran.

New customers always appear starting their record collections, regular customers slowly fade away for various reasons. Some relocate, some can&apos;t afford to build an extension on their house to contain 20,000 records.\u201d Chris Sammut, who\u2019s run Sydney\u2019s Repressed Records for the past 12 years, describes it as a community. \u201cThere\u2019s a loop between us, the bands and the labels,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople who are part of that scene are more likely to shop with us than, say, JB Hi-Fi.\u201d Repressed started out in Penrith, but now finds itself in the inner-west suburb of Newtown. It\u2019s staffed by Sammut and Nic Warnock, who got the job because he was wearing a Stooges T-shirt. Not even Nick Hornby could script that better. He started his own record label, RIP Society, with Sammut\u2019s blessing at Repressed\u2019s old shopfront on King Street. One of Warnock\u2019s early releases was the 2011 self-titled debut by Royal Headache, which remains the shop\u2019s biggest seller.  \u201cNic releases a lot of music and people like to support him,\u201d Sammut says. \u201cWe\u2019re always happy to put people on to stuff. It\u2019s only me and Nic here, so we know what we\u2019re ordering. Obviously we like to open it up to other people \u2013 we\u2019re not trying to be elite or anything like that. It\u2019s just a niche and you have to fill it, otherwise there\u2019s no point even trying to do this if you don\u2019t have that loyal customer base \u2026 The vinyl market is quite niche itself \u2013 and we\u2019re another niche within that niche.\u201d Repressed is only one of three stores left in Newtown, following the closures of So Music and Fish Records a couple years back due to gentrification and the resultant rise in rent. And while these effects are being felt all over Australia \u2013 old stalwarts such as Rocking Horse in Brisbane and Missing Link in Melbourne were on the brink a few years back, while Brisbane lost punk hangout Kill the Music in November last year \u2013 a sense of stability seems to have crept into the scene. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s gotten better,\u201d says Sammut. \u201cWhen we initially moved to Newtown, we were paying too much rent. We\u2019re in a better spot now. Sales have gotten better and better. It\u2019s probably me growing and learning as a business owner, too.\u201d Nate Nott from Melbourne\u2019s Polyester Records agrees \u2013 even though he\u2019s currently clearing out his CBD store for a new tenant. \u201cThey\u2019ve just come to pick up the CD racks and take them to scrap metal, because that\u2019s where CD racks go,\u201d he jokes. After six years at their pricey Flinders Lane address, Polyester have decided to downsize back to one store in Fitzroy.  The ever-increasing rise in city rent and the gradual erosion of the CD market has made them rethink their model. \u201cCD sales started to dip and last year they really bottomed out for us. It\u2019s a difficult thing to start changing over a lot of your stock \u2013 you\u2019ve still got to sell it, you can\u2019t just throw it out.\u201d Nott and his business partner Simon Karis seem up for the challenge, though. They\u2019re making plans for a return to the city in a more suitable spot and are \u201cputting some love\u201d into their Brunswick Street institution. That includes more vinyl, cosmetic changes to keep up with the ever-changing area and making room for their popular in-store performances. \u201cYou have to think of ways to diversify the business while still making records the majority of what you do,&quot; says Nott. &quot;You have to think outside of just selling a product over a counter, because those days are dead.&quot; Ten great Record Store Day rarities Many records are for being specially printed for Record Store Day.

Fifty years ago on Sunday, standing in the dock aware that he could be hanged for treason, the leader of South Africans&apos; struggle against racial apartheid responded with one of the greatest speeches of the 20th century. &quot;During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people,&quot; he told the supreme court in Pretoria. &quot;I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.&quot; Today the courtroom in which Mandela \u2013 who would be sentenced to life imprisonment at the end of the Rivonia trial \u2013 spoke these words is still hearing cases beneath the austere grandeur of a stained-glass ceiling, ornate sconce lamps, a carved dark wood dais for the judge and a jury box with red leather seats that have been empty since South Africa scrapped juries in 1969. Fourteen grey steps below the dock is a spartan concrete corridor leading to the holding cells where Mandela and his fellow accused were held. Chief among them is 5m x 7m room with walls coated in graffiti by generations of political prisoners. But after decades of neglect, the paint is cracking and peeling and in terminal decline, meaning this little-known historical treasure trove could soon be lost to the world.     The Freedom Charter at the Palace of Justice in Pretoria. Photograph: Nelson Mandela Foundation    Lawyer George Bizos, part of Mandela&apos;s defence team from 1963 to 1964, is leading calls to save it. &quot;It does worry me,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s part of the historical event and part of our culture and certainly a site that should be preserved.&quot; Bizos called for the cell to be recognised as a national heritage site, adding: &quot;This is where we had consultations with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki and others. There should be respect to protect these things. I hope the people who have control take notice of it.&quot; The cell has a bare concrete floor, one narrow barred window, a wide ventilation shaft against one wall, and the original heavy door with turn handle and peephole. The wall graffiti includes the yearned for freedom charter, a set of principles including &quot;South Africa belongs to all who live in it&quot;, as well as phrases such as &quot;Mandela no easy walk to freedom&quot;, &quot;My dream is to be free, one love&quot; and &quot;Luthuli says the road to freedom is via the cross&quot; a reference to former African National Congress (ANC) president Albert Luthuli. There is also a description of an ANC &quot;terrorist&quot; trial in 1978 \u2013 &quot;State closes the case. Defence starts its case&quot; \u2013 and a list of prisoners who have come through the cell, including Tokyo Sexwale, later a government minister. There are drawings of unknown faces and a haunting image that depicts a stick man hanging from gallows; between 1961 and 1989, some 134 political prisoners were executed by the apartheid regime at Pretoria central prison. The cell fell into disuse, and out of public consciousness, in the early 1990s. Since then, court facilities officer Chris Labuschagne estimates, only about 60 people have visited it, and the Guardian was the first this year. &quot;It&apos;s part of history but you can see what&apos;s happening to the paint,&quot; he said. &quot;They&apos;re supposed to put a Plexiglas screen over it. One day it will be gone and when it&apos;s gone, it&apos;s gone, and that will be sad.&quot; Labuschagne, who has photographed the walls for posterity, said he would like the cell to be turned into a museum but added: &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to happen, not the way this paint has been damaged. There&apos;s not enough value given to history.&quot; The cell lies in the bowels of the 19th-century Palace of Justice, a monument to colonial opulence incorporating British floor tiles, Dutch stained glass and wood from east India. A statue of former president Paul Kruger stands in the adjacent square. Three courts are still operating, including court C, which hosted what remains the most significant political trial in South African history \u2013 one that puts the circus around Oscar Pistorius, a short walk over the road, into some kind of perspective. The 50th anniversary of the late Mandela&apos;s &quot;speech from the dock&quot; will be marked at the former Liliesleaf farm in northern Johannesburg on Sunday with a performance by musician Sipho &quot;Hotstix&quot; Mabuse. Nicholas Wolpe, chief executive officer of the Liliesleaf Trust, said the holding cell must not be allowed to decay. &quot;The fact that we are allowing a revealing aspect of a key moment in our history to disintegrate and fade away goes to the core of our battle to keep our history alive and real,&quot; he said. &quot;It is indicative of our ambivalence and attitude towards our liberation struggle and our history in general. &quot;That is why commemorating events like the 50th anniversary of the raid on Liliesleaf and Nelson Mandela&apos;s &apos;I am prepared to die,&apos; statement from the dock is essential in our struggle to keep not only the memory of our history alive, but also our understanding.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Nomura was responding to a wave of child-abandonment cases in a rapidly industrialising and socially dislocated 1970s Japan; the events of The Demon, via a 1958 short story by Nomura&apos;s regular collaborator Seich\u014d Matsumoto, are based on a real case recounted to the author by a Tokyo detective."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Drama", "Japan", "World news", "Society", "World cinema", "Children"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-18T13:13:39Z", "title": "The Demon \u2013 the film that breaks the last cinematic taboo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/18/the-demon-yoshitaro-nomura-child-abuse", "article": "The little boy is lying back in a woman&apos;s arms. &quot;Eat, you brat!&quot; His screams are stifled because she is palming clods of rice into his mouth. &quot;I said eat!&quot; There&apos;s rice smeared about his face, in his eyelashes, his hair. She glares at her husband, who is standing impotently back. &quot;You spoil him. I&apos;m teaching him a lesson.&quot; That&apos;s the first of several highly distressing scenes from Yoshitaro Nomura&apos;s 1978 melodrama The Demon, which stars Ken Ogata as a pathetic, philandering printer whose wife is outraged when his mistress dumps three illegitimate children on them. The wife initially vents her anger, then bullies him into abandoning his offspring, and worse. Scenes like the above are an utter shock to the modern cultural palate. With extreme violence ubiquitous, and porn creeping into the mainstream, they shatter what&apos;s perhaps the last remaining cinematic taboo: the direct depiction of cruelty to children. It&apos;s not the kind of taboo film-makers rush to break: no bigger cold shower exists for a film&apos;s box-office chances than child abuse. But what&apos;s extraordinary about The Demon is not only that it got made at all, but the realism with which it depicts such grotesque deeds, and the human conclusions it supplies about them. Usually, abuse of children, when it makes it on to the screen, is safely penned into stylised genres, such as the horror of Ringu (in which Sadako of the cursed videotape is a murdered child). Or it drags more real-world dramas in that direction, as with Carrie&apos;s explosion from harried daughter into telekinetic avenger, or Mystic River&apos;s fairytale allusions to the &quot;wolves&quot; who destroyed Tim Robbins&apos;s character&apos;s childhood.     Close to the edge \u2026 Yoshitaro Nomura's The Demon tests the boundaries of cultural acceptability. Photograph: BFI     There&apos;s also a tendency for films to gravitate towards the blackest instances of such behaviour, ie sexual abuse. Nomura \u2013 a veteran director for Shochiku studio whose psychological acuity is being celebrated in a season at London&apos;s Institute of Contemporary Arts \u2013 said he didn&apos;t want to make a dark, dismal movie about child abuse, but wanted to present an &quot;everyday evil&quot;: how a weak character was forced into dire circumstances. Nomura was responding to a wave of child-abandonment cases in a rapidly industrialising and socially dislocated 1970s Japan; the events of The Demon, via a 1958 short story by Nomura&apos;s regular collaborator Seich\u014d Matsumoto, are based on a real case recounted to the author by a Tokyo detective. Hence Nomura&apos;s steadfast realism, which, apart from some Bernard Herrmann-esque trembling on the soundtrack, never wavers. So we&apos;re confronted with scenes like the force-feeding, or its later echo when the crab-faced Ogata trembles with derangement as he attempts to cram a cyanide-laced bun into his eldest son&apos;s mouth. Which begs the question: we all know that some children&apos;s vulnerability is horribly exploited \u2013 but why watch something like that? One answer is that such works aren&apos;t just a reminder of the banality of evil, but also of the power of images. Jonathan Glazer&apos;s Under the Skin effectively weaves unsettlingly raw frames of an abandoned child crying on the beach into its emotional tapestry, but The Demon goes further. Witnessing these acts feels like a dangerous violation, with a shocking immediacy that prose would lack. Taboo-breaking here forces us to think about what the responsible limits of representation are in a way (now that the censors rarely censor, but mostly classify) we&apos;re rarely called to do. We examine what we should show, for how long, and why. Unlike most modern film violence, there&apos;s nothing exploitative, no sense of boundary-pushing for its own sake. Evil isn&apos;t some cheap Voldemortian blood-right here: the printer and his wife are dragged down into a hellish moral vacuum, one link leading plausibly and inexorably to the next in a chain of events too heavy for them to resist. Ogata had been understandably reluctant to play the role, but he made his character horribly sympathetic \u2013 winning a Japanese Academy award for it in the process \u2013 and it became the first in a series of trademark extreme roles. The Demon carefully humanises the printer&apos;s craven nature, suggesting he was also abandoned as a child. Whether you think this kind of moral statement is a strong enough justification for such unsparing imagery probably depends on where you stand on the political spectrum. If it&apos;s further to the right, then the real-life case might please you better: Ogata&apos;s counterpart apparently died insane in prison. So Nomura arguably shows restraint. But it&apos;s possible he wasn&apos;t responsible in every quarter. A one-year-old couldn&apos;t possibly fake the kind of anguish displayed in that initial scene, and there&apos;s some evidence the child actors were affected by their work. The cinematographer Takashi Kawamata claims that Shima Iwashita, who played the wife, kept away from the children during shooting; when she attempted to give them presents at an early public screening, &quot;they were frightened by seeing her, and the youngest child even started to cry&quot;. I wonder how they feel about this lone silhouette of a film nearly 40 years on. Unlike us, they&apos;ll surely never forget that, to the child inside, the image is always real. \u2022 The Yoshitaro Nomura season is at the ICA, London from 18-23 April, with The Demon screening on 23 April.

Tokyo-based MtGox dealt a severe blow to bitcoin&apos;s reputation when it fell victim to an apparent digital heist in February in which $480m (\u00a3286m) worth of the virtual currency disappeared. The exchange is under threat of liquidation after a Tokyo court dismissed an attempt to resuscitate the business this week, triggering a last-ditch attempt to save the platform. &quot;We need your help to stop a liquidation, which would be good neither for MtGox creditors nor bitcoin&apos;s reputation with the general public and regulators,&quot; wrote the investors on the Save Gox website. The company had 127,000 customers at the time of its closure, and each of them is now a creditor with little hope of recovering all the money they lost. The Save Gox group is attempting to halt the liquidation by reviving the exchange. &quot;Under our proposal, MtGox&apos;s remaining assets would be distributed to customers immediately. Creditors would be made whole over time by sharing revenue generated from business operations and from other recovery programmes, such as participating in the upside if they continue doing business with the rebuilt exchange.&quot; Exchanges like MtGox offer a way to convert official currencies such as dollars into bitcoins. Each virtual coin represents a unique solution to a complex cryptographic problem, aimed at preventing duplication and forgery. However, the safety of the currency has been questioned by officials at the central banks of the US, the Netherlands, Denmark and China. The head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, has flagged concerns about the currency being used for money laundering and has warned that the Fed &quot;doesn&apos;t have authority to supervise or regulate bitcoin in anyway.&quot; But that has not deterred supporters of bitcoin, who are attracted to the concept of a currency that operates outside the conventions of the global financial system. The MtGox investor group has received backing from many creditors and hopes to persuade the court to reconsider its rehabilitation proposal. When MtGox closed, it held 2,000 bitcoins, despite having a debt to its customers of 850,000 bitcoins. Since then, the company has announced it discovered 200,000 bitcoins in an unused computer wallet, but is still far from being solvent. The company is reportedly liable for more than $20m in fiat currency that it does not have. Since the closure of MtGox, the price of bitcoin has hovered at around half its December peak of $1,150 a coin. The decline began in the months before MtGox shut its website, as it halted withdrawal of bitcoins in an effort to prevent hackers stealing more. But since MtGox finally collapsed, the price has been held down over fears that the Chinese government \u2013 one of bitcoin&apos;s most vocal opponents \u2013 will move against the currency. Founded in 2009 by American software hacker Jed McCaleb, MtGox was originally a site for people to trade cards for a game called Magic: The Gathering. MtGox is short for &quot;Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange&quot;. Only 1,000 of MtGox&apos;s 127,000 creditors are Japanese. At the time of MtGox&apos;s collapse, its founder, Mark Karpeles, a French national, said the furore would not dent the currency&apos;s popularity. &quot;The bitcoin industry is healthy and it is growing.

Updates on the Ashes, which England won, and prominent television coverage of the World T20 in Bangladesh, where Australia gained some revenge in the final. Now, right off the bat, it must be noted that this interest is long overdue and absolutely the least it should be. But it does start you thinking: why now? England&apos;s women cricketers have been pioneers for a while and the best team in the world for most of the past decade. So what changed? There have to be multiple contributing factors, beginning with an overall increased awareness of women&apos;s sport in Britain. Bouncing off the Olympics and Paralympics in 2012, the argument that there is no appetite for watching women compete has been shown resoundingly to be misinformed. Historically, around 5% of media coverage has been dedicated to female sports \u2013 the majority of it tennis \u2013 but last year the BBC broadcast more than 1,000 hours of women&apos;s competition, almost 20% of their sports coverage. We also can&apos;t ignore the drip-drip effect: if you do something good enough for long enough, people will eventually take notice. This is certainly true with women&apos;s cricket, where the skills of Charlotte Edwards, Sarah Taylor and Katherine Brunt have been obvious for a while. England becoming the first full-time salaried women&apos;s team from 1 May is both proof and reward of that. Something similar can be seen in women&apos;s cycling, which will belatedly now have a five-day Women&apos;s Tour across England in May and a one-day race alongside the Tour de France in July. Sadly, another factor cannot be discounted \u2013 largely because it was brought up so recurringly in the news reports. The dominance of the England women&apos;s cricket team has come at a time when their male counterparts are getting stuffed by the Netherlands \u2013 a team whose star performer was a former assistant manager of Burger King at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport. Desperate for a silver lining, the logic follows, we have turned to the motivated and cohesive women for some consolation. Does this mean we should only be interested in a sport when we are not losing at it? In recent times, Britain has enjoyed unprecedented sporting success: punching above its weight in global competitions such as the Olympics and winning events where we had been making up the numbers for decades, such as Wimbledon and the Tour de France. It has been so intoxicating that it is almost hard to remember a period when Britain did not bestride almost every sporting arena we entered. You could argue that the nation&apos;s self-esteem has been bolstered, we have walked a little taller because of these victories. And the results have certainly had a direct impact on how sport is funded. When UK Sport had to decide how to allocate \u00a3200m for Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020, it rescinded all financial backing for basketball; a sport that more than 300,000 British people (70% of whom are under the age of 25) play every month. As part of a policy called &quot;no compromise&quot; \u2013 in short: no medals, no money \u2013 water polo and synchronised swimming were also cut adrift. Cycling and boxing were among the beneficiaries \u2013 as well as low\u2011participation sports such as shooting, sailing and modern pentathlon. The policy led one newspaper to compare Britain to the former East Germany: the country is equating medals with success, and confusing that sporting success with national wellbeing. This hard-headed philosophy loses sight of what sport is meant to stand for. In a week in which British Basketball has confirmed that it will not appeal against its loss of \u00a37m funding, it is hard not to feel that perhaps the country&apos;s priorities have become skewed. Team\u00a0GB may not enjoy a comparison to East Germany \u2013 it would prefer Australia in the 1990s \u2013 but the gold rush has turned into a stampede with weaker sports trampled underfoot. Britain, you may have noticed, is not a country of wildly fluctuating meteorological extremes. We do not have a magnificent spine of mountains running the length of the land. This has always made the Winter Olympics something of a low-stakes novelty for us, like singing karaoke when you don&apos;t know anyone in the audience. But now we are the all-conquering, limitation-defying Team GB; we demand results from the \u00a313.4m that UK Sport invested in the recent Sochi Olympics from lottery and exchequer funding. And in a sense we got it: the four medals (a gold, silver and two bronzes) equalled the previous best tally, which Britain claimed at the inaugural Winter Games in 1924. We were reminded of this historic achievement every hour on the sports bulletins and each evening in a jaunty graphic on Clare Balding&apos;s wrap-up programme. Just don&apos;t mention that the haul was scarcely better than Norway achieved in one event: the women&apos;s 30km cross-country. It wasn&apos;t always quite so jingoistic: self-deprecating eccentrics such as Eddie the Eagle and Frank Bruno would not become sporting heroes in modern Britain. Perhaps that&apos;s right and proper: if we are never going to be the best at, say, basketball, what&apos;s the point of pumping money into it? But now there&apos;s little doubt that it&apos;s not the taking part, it&apos;s the winning that counts. The problem with allocating money depending on success is that it ignores the cyclical, fast-changing nature of sport: Manchester United cannot dominate for ever, just as Liverpool couldn&apos;t in the 1980s. A decade ago, Britain had no culture of road cycling, now our riders have won the world&apos;s greatest race twice.

That much looked obvious when the American champion Porter, a formidable brawler, was as easy to read as the Sun in demolishing Paulie Malignaggi in four rounds in Washington DC on Saturday night to keep his IBF version of the 10st 7lb championship, although his deficiencies hardly diminish his threat. He somehow packs a middleweight&apos;s strength into a welterweight body, and moves like a small Mike Tyson \u2013 but he is far from unbeatable. Having taken the title from Devon Alexander last December, Porter also inherited the obligation to defend against Brook by 19 July. Had Malignaggi won, the fight would almost certainly have been in Sheffield, as the New Yorker has a sound fan-base in the UK. Wherever it ends up, Brook, surely, will have been encouraged by the crudeness of the champion Porter&apos;s bomb-throwing against a smaller, older opponent \u2013 and, if he is as ring-smart as he appears to be, he will also be wary of his power when they meet. It is five years since the Boxing Writers Club voted Brook our young boxer of the year. He turns 28 on 3 May. It is time for him to make a move. A win over Porter, who has growing cachet, would be the ideal calling card to drop in front of American TV executives. As for Malignaggi, the show is surely done. He lost to Ricky Hatton and Amir Khan, did brilliantly to win a world title, took Adrien Broner desperately close and has won a bigger audience with his quick New York tongue than his fists. His next trip to the UK will be on 31 May, when he will work the Wembley Stadium extravaganza for Sky Sports. Matchroom are expected to release another 20,000 tickets for that Carl Froch-George Groves fight on 1 May, and the 80,000 attendance target looks a given. As for what might have been Malignaggi&apos;s last ring performance, the smart-moving stylist with fragile fists had nowhere near enough strength to discourage his tormentor and looked a finished fighter after the battering that put him down and out in the fourth. &quot;Everybody in the studio is in shock,&quot; Steve Bunce told his BoxNation audience. I&apos;m not sure how many people were in the studio at that hour \u2013 apart from the excellent Barry Jones, Steve Lillis and the crew \u2013 but they shouldn&apos;t have been that shocked. &quot;I came back to the corner of the first round and my dad said, &apos;Use that jab&apos;,&quot; Porter said. While you do not need a master&apos;s degree in boxing science to come up with stuff like that, the fighter delivered for his dad. He gave Malignaggi no peace, bullied him to the ropes and thrashed through the remnants of his defence. Malignaggi said later, &quot;I told him, &apos;Go be great.&apos; If this was my last fight, I want to know I lost to a great champion. I wish him all the best. He deserves everything.&quot; The boxing skills for which Porter has to strive come far more easily to Bernard Hopkins, and the old boy had them all on show against the willing but bewildered Beibut Shumenov in the main event in DC. Hopkins, at 49, became the oldest fighter to unify a world title \u2013 for what that is worth in the shifting currency of the sport, given Shumenov held the WBA&apos;s &quot;Super World&quot; title, and Hopkins the straight-up IBF belt. It was way short of a classic, but Hopkins rolled the left shoulder, twisted and turned his opponent inside, calibrated millimetres of distance and angle, his punches landing unannounced and hurtful often enough to give him nearly every round in my book. He even had Shumenov over in the 11th. Yet it will come as no surprise to readers of these pages that one judge, Gustavo Padilla of Panama, scored it 114-113 for the Kazakh. Judge CJ Ross disappeared from the scene after scoring Floyd Mayweather&apos;s walkover against Saul Alvarez a draw. Padilla should follow her. This was the second world title fight in a row when he was significantly at odds with his colleagues, having scored Danny Garcia&apos;s clear-cut win over Mauricio Herrero a draw. These people, week in, week out, are shredding the sport&apos;s already dubious integrity. Not only should the governing bodies publish full scorecards immediately after each bout, they should require consistently poor judges to justify their reasoning \u2013 publicly. It is the fighters and the public who are short-changed and hoodwinked. The embarrassment of a paid official should not be a consideration. They are well-paid, lead a comfortable, well-travelled existence and, unfortunately, some of them are useless. Murray overpowered by Crolla There was no reason for anyone to be embarrassed in Manchester on Saturday night \u2013 even the losers, who gave of their best on another high-quality Matchroom show. Eddie Hearn is gambling and delivering on a regular basis with his growing stable, and the fans love it. He pretty much could not miss with what was the real main event, Anthony Crolla&apos;s thrilling 10th-round stoppage of his Manchester mate and rival, John Murray. I tipped Murray to win because I reckoned he would break his man down. I was wrong. It was Crolla&apos;s strength that prevailed. Murray, who trained as hard as he has done in a while for this bout, has some tough thinking to do. He&apos;s had one world title shot; is he motivated enough to grind away for another? Few fighters better exemplify the virtues of dignity and steel a true champion needs than Crolla. If he gets a world title shot at lightweight, he might have to travel; if he comes home a champion, there would not be a more popular boxer in the land. Scott Quigg looked superb in blowing away the once-dangerous but now weight-drained South African veteran Tshifhiwa Munyai in two rounds to keep his &quot;world&quot; version of the WBA super-bantamweight title. The clamour will grow for him to fight Carl Frampton, but it is obvious that will not happen until the Belfast fighter has his own world belt; to get that, he will have to beat probably the slickest of the super-bantam champions, L\u00e9o Santa Cruz. Rendall Munroe, the Boxing Binman who is 34 in June, took the WBC champion Toshiaki Nishioka the distance in Tokyo in 2010 and fell in six when he challenged Quigg two years ago, has nowhere to go after losing his Commonwealth featherweight challenge to the unbeaten Josh Warrington in seven rounds. He&apos;s been some servant of his tough business \u2013 and I&apos;m not talking rubbish."}, {"sentences": ["Eric Talmadge @erictalmadge Recently appointed Pyongyang bureau chief for Associated Press, based between Tokyo and Pyongyang."], "tags": ["North Korea", "Twitter", "Dennis Rodman", "Instagram", "Academic experts", "Media", "Associated Press", "Reuters", "Asia Pacific", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-22T08:00:29Z", "title": "North Korea experts on Twitter", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/22/the-top-north-korea-experts-on-twitter", "article": "North Korea is probably one of the hardest places on the planet to tweet from.

Obama will arrive in Tokyo on Wednesday at the start of an eight-day tour of Asia that will include South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. On Tuesday about 150 Japanese politicians risked further souring ties with China by visiting Yasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo that honours Japan&apos;s 2.5 million war dead, including 14 leaders hanged for war crimes by the allies. Three years after the US announced it would shift its attention from Europe and the Middle East towards the Asia-Pacific, Japan is seeking US support at a time of record Chinese military spending and concern over North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. Discussions between Obama and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, are expected to focus on Tokyo&apos;s longstanding dispute with Beijing over the Senkakus \u2013 known in China as Diaoyu \u2013 a group of uninhabited islands claimed by both countries. The US is bound by a bilateral security treaty to defend Japan, although so far it has refused to take sides in the dispute in an attempt to avoid creating additional friction with China. &quot;The American objective is to reassure countries that \u2026 America is here to stay and is going to keep a strong interest in dealing with China together with those countries,&quot; said Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo. A recent report by the Senate foreign relations committee urged Obama to &quot;upgrade&quot; US alliances in the Asia-Pacific and demonstrate &quot;an enduring US commitment to the region, assuring our partners that we are in it for the long haul&quot;. Abe, who took office in December 2012 with a nationalist agenda, will also seek US approval for his plans to bolster Japan&apos;s military, which for decades has operated in the shadow of the 50,000 American troops based in the country. &quot;I would like to send a message to the world that the Japan-US alliance will play a leading role in ensuring peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,&quot; Abe told visiting US officials this week. On Monday White House officials reiterated that the US &quot;will always honour its obligations to the defence of Japan&quot;. However, a joint statement that the leaders are due to issue on Thursday is likely to omit any mention of the Senkaku islands by name, according to Japanese media. In a sign of how anxious Japan has become over potential threats to its thousands of outlying islands, it began its first military expansion in more than 40 years at the weekend, starting construction of a new base on the southern island of Yonaguni, which is located near the Senkakus. Japanese and Chinese navy and coastguard ships have been involved in regular standoffs around the uninhabited islands since Japan bought them from their private owners in 2012. The purchase sparked riots in several Chinese cities. Last November China raised the stakes when it unilaterally declared an air defence identification zone that overlaps Japanese airspace over the Senkakus. Japanese military aircraft scrambled jets a record 415 times in the year to March in response to flyovers by Chinese planes. Obama&apos;s four-nation tour is supposed to demonstrate his commitment to following through on plans announced three years ago to pivot US influence towards the Asia-Pacific, a region with huge economic potential but beset by historical disputes and potential threats to stability. The Obama administration at times has appeared disengaged from the Asia-Pacific, according to some critics, who point to last year&apos;s crisis on the Korean peninsula, when the US was wrong-footed by weeks of sabre rattling by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Abe&apos;s election just over a year ago, which coincided with leadership changes in China and South Korea, has clearly caused anxiety in Washington as Japan&apos;s relations with its neighbours have sunk to their lowest level in decades. Abe and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, have yet to hold formal talks. The depth of their animosity was in evidence on Tuesday when Beijing denounced the Japanese MPs&apos; Yasukuni visit as a &quot;slap in the face&quot; to Obama. A rare public show of US displeasure over Abe&apos;s pilgrimage to Yasukuni last December may have been a factor in his decision to forgo a second visit as leader. Japanese media said the joint statement to be released by the leaders would stress the importance of the Japan-US alliance and commit both countries to resist any attempt to change the regional status quo by force, a reference to repeated incursions by Chinese ships into waters near the Senkaku islands, the Yomiuri Shimbun said. White House officials have stressed that Washington&apos;s security commitments extend beyond Japan to include countries embroiled in separate disputes with China over territories in the South China Sea. In a move likely to cause alarm in Beijing, Obama is expected to reach an agreement with the Philippines on better access to the country&apos;s airbases and ports for the US air force and navy, more than 20 years after the US closed its huge naval base in Subic Bay. Obama&apos;s visit to South Korea will centre on security ties, but he is also expected to pay his respects to the 300 people believed to have died in the Sewol ferry disaster. &quot;As I will underscore on my visit to Seoul next week, America&apos;s commitment to our ally South Korea\u00a0is unwavering \u2013 in good times and in bad,&quot; he said last week. US pressure succeeded in bringing Abe and his South Korean counterpart, Park Geun-hye, together for a meeting with Obama during the recent nuclear safety summit in The Hague. But South Korea, where the US has 28,500 troops, and Japan remain at odds over ownership of the Takeshima islands \u2013 known by Koreans as Dokdo \u2013 and Japan&apos;s apparent lack of remorse over its use of tens of thousands of mainly Korean sex slaves before and during the second world war. In Malaysia, where Obama will be the first sitting US president to visit since Lyndon Johnson in 1966, Obama will attempt to strengthen ties with the leadership despite concerns over its treatment of opposition politicians. US officials said there were no plans for Obama to meet the country&apos;s opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim. Security was tight in Tokyo before Obama&apos;s arrival, with 16,000 police officers deployed in anticipation of the first state visit by a US president since Bill Clinton in 1996."}, {"sentences": ["Justin Bieber has apologised after posting a photograph that showed him standing in front of the controversial Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo.", "Pilgrimages by Japanese politicians provoke angry outbursts from China, which sees the visits as evidence of Tokyo&apos;s failure to atone for atrocities committed on the Asian mainland, including in parts of China, in the 1930s and 40s.", "Earlier in the week, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, sent a ritual offering but stopped short of visiting in person, in an apparent attempt to avoid controversy on the eve of Barack Obama&apos;s arrival in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "Justin Bieber", "Second world war", "China", "South Korea", "Music", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-23T12:27:47Z", "title": "Justin Bieber apologises for posting Tokyo war shrine photograph", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/23/justin-bieber-apologises-yasukuni-war-shrine-tokyo-photograph", "article": "Justin Bieber has apologised after posting a photograph that showed him standing in front of the controversial Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo. The Canadian pop singer removed the image but only after it had been tweeted to his 51.1 million followers and attracted 660,000 likes on Instagram. Bieber, who earlier in the week made a trip to the less politically combustible Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, later said he had been unaware of the shrine&apos;s controversial role, and issued an apology. &quot;While in Japan I asked my driver to pull over for which I saw a beautiful shrine,&quot; he wrote on Instagram. &quot;I was mislead to think the shrines were only a place of prayer. To anyone I have offended I am extremely sorry. I love you China and I love you Japan.&quot; China and South Korea regard Yasukuni, which honours leaders executed for war crimes among 2.5 million Japanese war dead, as a potent symbol of Japanese militarism. Pilgrimages by Japanese politicians provoke angry outbursts from China, which sees the visits as evidence of Tokyo&apos;s failure to atone for atrocities committed on the Asian mainland, including in parts of China, in the 1930s and 40s. Bieber&apos;s &quot;impromptu&quot; stop at Yasukuni came a day after 150 Japanese MPs paid homage at the shrine. Earlier in the week, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, sent a ritual offering but stopped short of visiting in person, in an apparent attempt to avoid controversy on the eve of Barack Obama&apos;s arrival in Tokyo. One Instagram photo showed Bieber, dressed in a white baseball cap, long hoodie and boots, standing in front of the shrine next to an unidentified person who has his head bowed. The caption reads: &quot;Thank you for your blessings.&quot; In another, the 20-year-old&apos;s hands are clasped together in prayer as he stands beside a shrine employee in religious robes. The posts prompted a flurry of comment online. &quot;Hey Justin, do u even know where that is?&quot; wrote Instagram user vivien\u2014kong. &quot;Yasukuni shrine is the place where to worship the Japanese WWII soldiers. And do u have any efing idea that how the Japanese Nazi killed American and other Asian countries innocents?&quot; Others were more critical. &quot;Maybe you are a giant in Japan and thats the reason why you like Japan,&quot; a Chinese user commented. &quot;Anyway, please dont come to China forever, we really dont like stupid people.&quot; Another pleaded with him to remove the image. Officials in Beijing said they were unaware of the visit, and appeared to give the singer the benefit of the doubt. Qin Gang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said he hoped Bieber had left Yasukuni with &quot;a clear understanding of Japan&apos;s history of invasion and militarism, and of the source of Japan&apos;s militarism&quot;. Mercifully, Bieber was not required to write in a visitor&apos;s book.

The broadcasters were gushing, their enthusiasm striking. World Series Darts is coming to Perth. Woo hoo, Australian darts champion Simon &quot;The Wizard&quot; Whitlock \u2013 that dude with the mullet and goatee \u2013 will be making the trek to the Wild West in August! I shouldn\u2019t be so flippant. It\u2019s great that Perth is starting to attract international sports events. And smaller sports are probably a way for Perth to gain much-needed credibility as a destination for major spectacles. In July, two ice hockey matches between Canada and USA will be staged in Perth. True, the teams will be lacking most of their NHL firepower but there\u2019s already been sufficient public interest, the first scheduled game a sell-out.  Left-field initiatives are emerging, including a proposal to redevelop Perth\u2019s dilapidated baseball stadium \u2013 called, funnily enough, Baseball Park \u00ad\u2013 situated on the fringes of the metropolitan area. It has fuelled hopes international games could be held there in the future. The World Baseball Classic \u2013 basically the sport\u2019s world cup \u2013 is scheduled for 2017 and Australian Baseball League (ABL) officials plan to bid for matches to be held at a revamped Baseball Park. It seems like a pipedream but the WA government has put forward $1.5m for phase one of the master plan to redevelop the venue, with costs rising to $20m over eight years.  Other events in Perth\u2019s not-so-congested sports calendar include the Margaret River Pro, held in WA\u2019s south-west and featuring some of the world\u2019s best surfers, the V8 Supercar event and Australia\u2019s richest annual golf tournament, the Perth International.  Of course, there\u2019s also the summer mainstay, the Hopman Cup, which has been Perth\u2019s crown jewel because of its ability to attract tennis royalty. Unfortunately, the event\u2019s shine is fading with attendances dropping 20% during the last tournament in January. The Brisbane International has started to lure the big names \u2013 Roger Federer and Serena Williams headlined this year. Fears linger in the west on the tournament\u2019s viability and whether it will eventually find a new home on the east coast.  And that\u2019s Perth\u2019s constant bane. It has to battle with the east. Melbourne and Sydney are internationally renowned cities. The former is one of the premier sports destinations in the world, while the latter still radiates from its Olympics success 14 years ago.  Perth sports fans would not be startled if it lost another high-profile event. But some of Perth\u2019s woes have been self-inflicted. After all, in recent years the WA government did not rebid for the Red Bull Air Race and Rally Australia. It also balked at the chance to host Liverpool and Manchester United last year. Even worse, next summer Perth will not stage a Test match, although it was Cricket Australia who pulled the trigger on that decision.  Western Australians are notoriously one-eyed. It\u2019s a place where secession talk ludicrously becomes fodder for shock jocks on talkback. Yep, isolation can make some folk stir crazy. But even the most ardent Sandgroper isn\u2019t delusional when it comes to the state\u2019s sports infrastructure. Patersons Stadium \u2013 nee Subiaco Oval - is an aged facility. And I\u2019m being kind, I could unleash invective but there\u2019s no point because AFL matches will be moving to Perth Stadium in Burswood, apparently in 2018. The seats are uncomfortable, there\u2019s barely any leg room \u2013 it\u2019s worse than a budget airline. Fortunately, I\u2019m relatively young and emaciated, yet I still loathe sitting through hours of discomfort. I cringe seeing the pain the elderly and rotund people endure. Perth\u2019s other prominent sport venue is the Waca. A ground famous for producing pitches that made Dennis Lillee, a bevy of West Indian quicks and Mitch Johnson salivate. Regrettably, it\u2019s a horrible destination for spectators. Basic amenities \u2013 ahem, toilets \u2013 are inadequate and there\u2019s barely any shade provided for the bulk of the ground. That\u2019s unfortunate, considering the uncanny knack of interminable sweltering weather coinciding with Tests. During the Ashes last December, I remember wincing at the sight of English (and Aussie) fans walking around the city. Most supporters\u2019 faces were akin to WA\u2019s outback terrain of red dust. Sunburnt and dishevelled figures trudged around with second-degree burns. It was the catalyst for me having to turn down a ticket to Australia\u2019s final day triumph. Even the chance of watching Australia reclaim the urn wasn\u2019t going to propel me to bake under 40C heat.  Traditionalists may complain, but cricket needs to be moved to the Burswood locale. Despite the scepticism, the future for Perth sport lovers looks relatively promising. Perth Stadium is expected to have a capacity of about 60,000 (Patersons Stadium holds an underwhelming 43,000) and it is hoped it will finally become the international calibre stadium the city desperately craves. Perth Arena, which opened in 2012, has created a vibrant atmosphere during Perth Wildcats games. China v Australia basketball matches, exclusive to WA, were played there last year.  Perth does have one crucial geographical advantage over its eastern counterparts, and that&apos;s Asia. China is an obvious market to court, but south-east Asia is appealing too. Singapore\u2019s Sports Hub, with its centrepiece 55,000 seat stadium, is set to open mid-year and is expected to attract high-profile events. Kuala Lumpur is also emerging, which was highlighted when the city staged the Laureus World Sports Awards last month.  There should be enough scope for Perth to piggyback on these cities, and the state government seems to be heeding the message. The WA tourism minister, Liza Harvey, told Guardian Australia that Perth would take advantage of its geographical positioning  \u201cPerth is in close proximity to South East Asia and shares a similar time zone to many major Asian cities including Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo and Seoul,\u201d she said. \u201cThis provides many benefits.\u201d Perth is smeared with a dubious perception nationwide. For the uninitiated, &apos;Dullsville&apos; is Perth&apos;s ignominious moniker. Despite boasting beautiful beaches, lush greenery dotting its sprawling landscape and pristine weather, Perth can&apos;t unshackle its staid stereotype. Maybe, just maybe, it can through the power of sports.

Obama went further than some analysts had expected in reassuring the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, that Japan\u2019s dispute with China over the Senkakus \u2013 known in China as the Diaoyu \u2013 were covered by the allies\u2019 post-war security treaty.  But he reiterated Washington\u2019s refusal to take sides in the sovereignty dispute and called on China and Japan to resolve their differences through dialogue.  \u201cOur commitment to Japan\u2019s security is absolute and article five [of the security treaty] covers all territories under Japan\u2019s administration, including the Senkaku islands,\u201d Obama said during a joint press conference with Abe.  \u201cWe don\u2019t take a position on final sovereignty on the Senkakus but historically they\u2019ve been administered by Japan and should not be subject to change unilaterally.  \u201cMy hope is that Chinese will continue to engage with the US and other countries. We don\u2019t take a position on this piece of land or this piece of rock but we do take a position on the peaceful resolution of these disputes.\u201d  Obama\u2019s confirmation over the past two days that the Senkaku dispute falls under the US-Japan bilateral security treaty drew an angry response from China. On Wednesday a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said that China had &quot;indisputable sovereignty&quot; over the islands and that &quot;the so-called Japan-US alliance&quot; should be careful not to impinge on China&apos;s territorial rights.  &quot;The US should respect facts, take a responsible attitude, remain committed to not taking sides on territory and sovereignty issues, speak and act cautiously and earnestly play a constructive role in regional peace and stability,&quot; said Qin Gang.  China, which is not on Obama\u2019s itinerary, attempted to play down the significance of ties between Tokyo and Washington.  On Thursday a commentary carried by the official Xinhua news agency described Obama\u2019s visit &quot;a carefully calculated scheme to cage the rapidly developing Asian giant\u201d, adding that &quot;the pomp and circumstance Obama receives \u2026 cannot conceal the fact that Tokyo has become a growing liability to Washington&apos;s pursuit of long-term interests\u201d.  The state-run Global Times said in an editorial that the US had \u201cbasically recognised a stronger China\u201d, adding that while Washington \u201cexplicitly shows favour for Tokyo and Manila\u201d in territorial disputes it had also sought to avoid irritating China due to its economic importance.  Obama, who is making the first state visit to Japan by a US president for almost 20 years, instead he was simply repeating Washington&apos;s traditional position on the Senkaku dispute. \u201cThis is not a new position,\u201d he said. \u201cI emphasised to Prime Minister Abe the importance of resolving this peacefully, keeping the rhetoric low and not taking provocative actions.\u201d  The Senkakus have been a source of rising tension between the regions\u2019s two biggest economies since 2012 when Japan effectively nationalised the uninhabited islands, which are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and large untapped deposits of natural gas. The move sparked fury in China, where protesters took to the streets in several cities, forcing the temporary closure of some Japanese businesses in the country.  Obama has come under pressure to demonstrate that the US is serious about its promised strategic &quot;pivot\u201d towards the Asia-Pacific. But he has to tread a fine line between reassuring allies while avoiding harming US ties with China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy with a growing military presence in the region.  \u201cWe have strong relations with China, a critical country not just to the region but to the world,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe want to encourage the continued peaceful rise of China, and work together on trade and climate change.  \u201cBut what we have also emphasised is that all of us have responsibility to maintain the rule of law \u2013 large and small countries have to abide by what is considered just and fair and resolve disputes in a peaceful fashion,\u201d he added, in an apparent reference to China\u2019s dispute with the Philippines over islands in the South China Sea.  Abe and Obama met as speculation mounted that North Korea is preparing to conduct another nuclear weapons test.  Obama said he was \u201cnot optimistic\u201d that North Korea would end its irresponsible behaviour in the near future, describing the regime\u2019s pursuit of a nuclear deterrent as the \u201cthe most destabilising situation in the Asia-Pacific region\u201d.  He said: \u201cNorth Korea has engaged in provocative actions for the last several decades \u2013 it is an irresponsible actor on the international stage.  \u201cOur message has been consistent \u2013 they\u2019re the most isolated country in the world, subject to more sanctions and condemnation than any other country. If you are serious about North Korea being a normal nation you have to start with normal behaviour, and that starts with denuclearisation. China\u2019s participation in pushing North Korea in a different direction is critically important.\u201d  US-Japan ties have occasionally shown signs of strain since Abe took office in December 2012 with a broadly nationalist agenda. His December 2013 visit to Yasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo that honours Japan\u2019s war dead, including leaders convicted of war crimes, angered China and South Korea and prompted a rare show of concern from Washington.  On Thursday Abe repeated his contention that he had visited Yasukuni to pay his respects to Japanese who have fallen in battle and to renew his commitment to peace. &quot;Japan has been walking on the path of peace for seven decades after the war,&quot; Abe told Obama at the start of their talks. Attending an official welcoming ceremony by Emperor Akihito on Thursday morning, Obama was greeted by schoolchildren waving Japanese and US flags, and later inspected a military guard of honour. He was due to visit a science museum and the Meiji shrine before joining Abe at a meeting with relatives of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean spies in the 1970s and 80s."}, {"sentences": ["Kumiko the Treasure Hunter is the tale of a Tokyo office worker who becomes so obsessed with a VHS tape of the Coen Brothers&apos; film she heads off to Minnesota to find the stash of cash she believes is buried in the snow."], "tags": ["Fargo", "Drama", "Television & radio", "Television", "Culture", "Episode recaps"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-24T12:19:52Z", "title": "Fargo recap: season one, episode one \u2013 The Crocodile's Dilemma", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/apr/24/fargo-recap-season-one-episode-one", "article": "This blog is for Fargo viewers watching the Sunday night UK transmission on Channel 4 \u2013 if you&apos;ve seen ahead, please refrain from posting advance spoilers. &apos;Some roads you shouldn&apos;t go down&apos; A naked body in the woods, a high school bully passing on his skills to his oafish sons and a murdered washing machine \u2013 welcome to Fargo, or rather Bemidji, Minnesota, where the bulk of this first episode takes place. As a reworked version of the Coen Brothers&apos; classic film, the TV Fargo is a funny beast, kind of like watching another, very similar, case unfold in a nearby neighbourhood. There&apos;s that same balance of polite folks going about their small-town business, with their Minnesotan &quot;oh yah&quot;, &quot;you betcha&quot; quirks to remind us where we are, punctuated by extreme violence and some lingering shots of the snowy expanses. They&apos;ve shifted elements around (it&apos;s Chief Thurman&apos;s indecisive wife Ida who&apos;s pregnant rather than Marge Gunderson&apos;s replacement Deputy Molly, and Lester Nygaard&apos;s crime is less premeditated than Jerry Lundegaard&apos;s plot to kidnap his own wife). They&apos;ve also expanded on the world so we can explore it for 10 episodes, answering questions such as: who are the Fargo gunrunners? Who is drifter Lorne Malvo&apos;s next target in Duluth? What&apos;s in The Neverending Emporium? And there&apos;s the promise of more to come: in the trailer for episode two we get a brief glimpse of two new characters played by Adam Goldberg and Oliver Platt (any show that dangles a little Bob Odenkirk in front of Saul Goodman fans better have plans to deliver a lot more by the end of the series). &apos;What if you&apos;re right and they&apos;re wrong?&apos; Martin Freeman&apos;s patented side-to-side head shake of disbelief is put to good use here as insurance salesman Lester Nygaard. Lester is a man with a lot on his plate \u2013 he&apos;s dealing with a midlife crisis and still putting up with his high-school bully Sam Hess, and neither his wife Pearl nor his younger brother Chaz have any respect for him (&quot;If you were a better salesman I&apos;d a bought you a nicer tie,&quot; said Pearl. Chaz: &quot;Sometimes I tell people you&apos;re dead&quot;). When Lester is told he&apos;s just &quot;killed&quot; their washing machine, it appears he&apos;s so broken by life that he bludgeons Pearl to death (practically apologising as he swings the hammer in their basement). But there were signs by the end of the episode that he&apos;s beginning to shake off his fortysomething funk. Knocking himself out by running into the wall (to make Pearl&apos;s murder look like a double homicide) was a moment of self-awareness, Lester using his reputation for being the sort of schmuck who falls on a patch of ice to cover up his crime. &apos;You spend your whole life thinking there are rules. There aren&apos;t&apos; Billy Bob Thornton is more than good as quiet hitman Lorne Malvo (complete with a trademark Coen oddball haircut). He&apos;s happy to take a &quot;personal&quot; detour before his next job and relishes the chance to just mess with people (&quot;Would a fish cost me 10 dollars?&quot;; &quot;Guy insulted me once \u2013 I pissed in his gas tank. Car never drove straight again&quot;). Heleaves a trail of chaos in his wake as he travels through Bemidji. Lester&apos;s offhand comment during their conversation in the hospital (&quot;Heck, you&apos;re so sure about it, maybe you should just kill him for me&quot;) is more than enough of a verbal contract to pique Malvo&apos;s warped sense of malevolent justice (&quot;This is a man who doesn&apos;t deserve to draw breath&quot;) \u2013 but what will he want in return for killing Hess? Lester&apos;s argument that their chat wouldn&apos;t hold up in court doesn&apos;t cut it with Malvo \u2013 Lester: &quot;I never said yes.&quot; Malvo: &quot;You never said no.&quot; And Malvo seems to have a knack for instantly sizing people up \u2013 pitting the Hess brothers against each other with fake bad news about their father&apos;s will, threatening Officer Gus Grimly (Colin Hanks), and pushing Lester&apos;s buttons with his &quot;red mist&quot; line (&quot;The shit they make us eat \u2013 the boss, the wife, etc.&quot;) How long will it take for him to realise that Lester is trying to set him up for Pearl&apos;s murder? Notes, quotes and the like &quot;The morgue is full of guys who didn&apos;t think they needed life insurance.&quot; Will Lester be able to cash in on Pearl&apos;s policy? Did Lester&apos;s brother get &quot;The Piglet&quot; from Hess&apos;s syndicate of gunrunners working out of Fargo? &quot;You think it could be an organised crime thing? A hit or the like?&quot; The aptly-named Officer Molly Solverson seems a natural detective \u2013 but what are the bets she doesn&apos;t take over from her deceased boss Chief Thurman? &quot;Wife made spaghetti for dinner, seemed a shame to barf it up.&quot; The squeamish Deputy Bill Oswalt is full of charm. Who is Malvo&apos;s boss at Rundle Realty, and why does he have so many phones? The episode&apos;s title, &quot;The Crocodile&apos;s Dilemma&quot;, is a reference to a classic logic puzzle about a father whose child has been stolen by a crocodile; the crocodile promises to return the child, but only if the father can correctly guess if the crocodile will return him or not (a kind of damned if you do, damned if you don&apos;t scenario). Who is the crocodile here \u2013 Malvo? &quot;Bill cleans his gun with bubblebath.&quot; Thurman calls it as he sees it. &quot;Come on in, Chaz is working the ham.&quot; You don&apos;t get that on MasterChef. &quot;Was this you misunderstanding the other fella, or him misunderstanding you?&quot; Malvo likes to get things straight. &quot;You gonna hit me? That&apos;s a laugh.&quot; Famous last words, Pearl. Bruce Gold, the shadowy Hess family advisor, is played by Brian Markinson, last seen as Don Draper&apos;s neighbour Dr Arnold Rosen in Mad Men. And, on a side note \u2026 If you&apos;re in London this weekend, there&apos;s another very enjoyable Fargo-related offering premiering at Sundance London. Kumiko the Treasure Hunter is the tale of a Tokyo office worker who becomes so obsessed with a VHS tape of the Coen Brothers&apos; film she heads off to Minnesota to find the stash of cash she believes is buried in the snow.

Marketing departments are increasingly under pressure to deliver compelling customer experiences and are more reliant on effective and efficient technology. IT departments have traditionally provided large projects to support marketing activities. With the relentless speed of change required by ever-changing marketing campaigns, IT departments need to be flexible and fluid in supporting marketers. How do the two departments collaborate to achieve their goals or are the now merging? What do these changes mean for the role of marketers? Here on the Guardian Media Network a range of experts have recently been debating this issue. Corinne Sklar of Bluewolf has highlighted how the traditional role of the chief marketing officer (CMO) has evolved from simply building brand awareness to fostering greater customer engagement. Instead of the CMO, the role could be renamed chief customer officer, chief client officer, or chief experience office. Sherilyn Shackell of The Marketing Academy has explained how in the &apos;age of the customer&apos; new demands are placed on all parts of the business and it&apos;s the marketers who understand these demands better than anyone. With marketers growing in influence within businesses, they are perfectly positioned to move into the boardroom, once they&apos;ve broadened their knowledge. Lorna Walker of Regent&apos;s University London&apos;s Business School has also pointed out that as marketing jobs become increasingly technical and data-driven, both academic and practitioner-led courses are under pressure to remain relevant. Join our next live discussion from 1-3pm (BST) on Wednesday 7 May as we discuss the evolving role of marketers within business. Questions we&apos;ll cover include the following: \u2022 What factors are driving the changing role of marketers? \u2022 How is technology enabling marketers to drive customer engagement? \u2022 How can marketers keep up with constant technological change? \u2022 How are CIOs and CMOs working together? \u2022 What skills do modern marketers need to thrive today and tomorrow?

Almost 90 documents from the archives of the military police corps \u2013 part of Japan&apos;s Kwantung army, the occupying force that propped up a puppet regime in Manchuria in the early 1930s \u2013 include letters from Japanese soldiers, newspaper articles and military files discovered in the 1950s and kept at the Jilin provincial archives in north-east China. Documents from the regime&apos;s national bank were also included. &quot;Going through the bloodiest parts of these archives, many of us experts have succumbed to chronic depression,&quot; said the archive&apos;s director Yin Huai, according to the official China News Service. Zhao Sujian, 81, an archive employee since 1948, said that the documents were discovered by a People&apos;s Liberation Army unit in November 1953. The soldiers were digging near the remains of the Japanese base to lay pipes and fix electric cables when they stumbled on the buried cache. &quot;At the time, these documents filled an entire truck,&quot; he told the news service. &quot;Because they were buried for so long, most of them were stuck together, even rotted into one mass.&quot; The archive in Changchun, the provincial capital, began systematically analysing the documents in 1982, after it received them from a local law enforcement office. Most remain untranslated. Research has been slow, state media said, owing to the poor quality of the documents and a dearth of Japanese-speaking researchers.     Three former 'comfort women' recount their ordeal at a press conference in 1992. Photograph: Tao Chuan Yeh/AFP/Getty Images    It was not immediately clear why the body had chosen to release the documents this week, but Chinese state media speculated that the publication was in response to repeated claims by conservative politicians that the women were not coerced by government authorities or the military. Some historians believe that as many as 200,000 women \u2013 most of them from the Korean peninsula \u2013 were forced to work in frontline brothels between 1932 and 1945. The 25 previously confidential files relating to sex slaves include reports, telephone records and documents mentioning the sexual enslavement of women, according to Chinese media. Other documents give details of the Nanking massacre, in which Japanese soldiers killed as many as 300,000 people during their 1937-38 occupation of Nanking [now Nanjing], according to Chinese and western historians. Japan disputes the number of deaths, while far-right commentators in Japan have accused China of fabricating the slaughter. A 1944 telephone record taken from the national bank of Manchuria shows that the Japanese imperial army spent 532,000 yen on setting up so-called comfort stations, according to the Global Times. Other records show how the Japanese army abducted women from the Korean peninsula and forced them to work in occupied China, with brothels eventually appearing in 20 to 30 counties in the country&apos;s north-east. &quot;We can see from this file that the Japanese military made use of the national general mobilisation act to forcibly conscript Korean comfort women,&quot; Zhao Yujie, a research fellow at the Jilin provincial archives, told Reuters. &quot;And these Korean women were basically dispensed to high-ranking officials.&quot; One of the released documents records the number of women sent to have sex with Japanese soldiers in certain parts of occupied China over a period of 10 days from 1 February 1938. In Nanking, for instance, there were 141 women and 2,500 Japanese soldiers. &quot;That is to say, one woman had to be tortured 178 times within 10 days,&quot; said Su Zhiliang, director of the China research centre on comfort women. &quot;The archives of Kwantung army unveiled this time and other times showed clearly that Japanese military and government implemented sex slavery in the army. The mechanism was influential and forcible. It was against the personal wills of these women. Second, it was widely adopted,&quot; Su said. The release of the documents comes soon after Barack Obama called the use of comfort women a &quot;terrible violation of human rights&quot;. Japan sparked anger in China and South Korea this year when it said it would re-examine a 1993 statement in which Japan acknowledged for the first time the military&apos;s role in forcing women into sexual slavery, and apologising to those who &quot;suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds&quot;. Public figures seen as close to the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, added to tensions between South Korea and Japan with claims that Japan was being unfairly singled out for criticism of its wartime conduct. Abe has since said he does not intend to alter the statement, which has been upheld by successive Japanese administrations since it was issued by then chief cabinet secretary Yohei Kono. A reminder of the war&apos;s enduring role in souring Japan&apos;s ties with China and South Korea came on Monday, when a member of Abe&apos;s cabinet visited Yasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo that honours 2.5m Japanese war dead, including 14 leaders convicted of class A war crimes by the allies. The visit by Tomomi Inada, a state minister in charge of administrative reform, came days after almost 150 Japanese MPs made a pilgrimage to the shrine, which is viewed by Beijing and Seoul as a powerful symbol of Japanese militarism. Speaking in Seoul at the weekend, Obama called on Japan to give a full account of the sexual abuse of women by its military. &quot;This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,&quot; he said. &quot;They deserve to be heard. They deserve to be respected. And there should be an accurate and clear account of what happened.&quot; Japan has refused to directly compensate the women, saying all claims were settled by a 1965 bilateral treaty that normalised diplomatic ties. In 1995, Japan set up the privately run Asian women&apos;s fund, which drew on donations, but many women rejected any redress unless it came directly from the Japanese state. The fund was disbanded in 2007. During Obama&apos;s visit to Tokyo last week, Abe said Japan regretted the pain it had caused in the past, particularly in Asia. On Sunday, Abe told reporters the plight of the comfort women was &quot;heart-wrenching&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Building on the solid if workmanlike chassis of the 2001 original, heavily modelled on the lines of ur-guilty pleasure Point Break, successive mods \u2013 hip-hop and martial-arts stars; Bond-style global locations from Tokyo Drift onwards; the addition of Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson, a great jutting spoiler of a casting coup \u2013 have put F&amp;F in the entertainment big league."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Action and adventure"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-28T13:44:25Z", "title": "My guilty pleasure: the Fast and Furious franchise", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/apr/28/my-guilty-pleasure-fast-five", "article": "This is my favourite promotional photograph of recent years. Yeah boy! So what exactly is happening at this juncture of Fast Five, instalment num\u00e9ro cinco of The Fast and the Furious (F&amp;F) franchise? Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are both crouched low in the internationally recognised pose of shit&apos;s-going-down, but beyond that, who knows? Is Paul landing, or about to take off? Is Vin driving with his foot and, if so, is that legal? Is the car even moving? They look serious, atop their modified 1963 Corvette Grand Sport, like they&apos;re anticipating imminent delivery of a piece of heavy furniture. Whatever, don&apos;t sweat it; that&apos;s just how these guys roll. You know you&apos;re going to get certain things from an F&amp;F movie, and Juliette Binoche isn&apos;t one of them. Bombastic street-racing scenes filmed in juddering Shakycam like it&apos;s footage of a space shuttle exiting the upper atmosphere. Scantily clad women draping themselves over high-performance vehicles, as daydreamed by the tooth-grilled love child of Ali G and Jeremy Clarkson. The F&amp;F franchise is cinema&apos;s equivalent of those dodgy Urban Flava-type music compilations \u2013 brash, festively obvious, ruthlessly demographicked, impossible not to find yourself nodding along to at some point. I&apos;m completely hooked. They&apos;re reprehensible films in many ways. The petrolhead thing isn&apos;t exactly in tune with the times; it feels as if, film after film, Vin and Paul have been essentially unzipping the flies on their Evisus and copiously relieving themselves all over Lord Stern. And however much Michelle Rodriguez&apos;s stink eye is deployed to bolster the series&apos; girl power, the sexual politics remain, let&apos;s say, problematically booty-centric. One leading female Hollywood producer recently told me F&amp;F was her own guilty pleasure. This has only partially stifled my qualms over lapping up a franchise that ushers in its centrepiece romance to the dulcet strains of Ludacris&apos;s Area Codes. I get where that producer is coming from, though. They&apos;re well-made films, and they do whatever it takes to get the audience in the zone. Building on the solid if workmanlike chassis of the 2001 original, heavily modelled on the lines of ur-guilty pleasure Point Break, successive mods \u2013 hip-hop and martial-arts stars; Bond-style global locations from Tokyo Drift onwards; the addition of Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson, a great jutting spoiler of a casting coup \u2013 have put F&amp;F in the entertainment big league. They always hit the spot, and they&apos;re oddly progressive in their own way. I like to think that audiences have been attracted by the series&apos; embrace, to a far greater degree than any other Hollywood franchise, of the urban multicultural ideal as much as by all the pit-girl flesh on display. OK, OK, I&apos;ve clearly been at the nitrous fumes again. But if the series happily works inside its limitations, there&apos;s much to be enjoyed from doing the same as a viewer. As it&apos;s become more successful, the F&amp;F formula has hardened into a set of posturing and rituals as intricate and formalised as a Hapsburg court ball. The opening dance, affirming the protagonists&apos; keeping-it-real credentials, is usually the spontaneous street race. But my favourite part is Vin&apos;s inevitable flirty head-to-head with his female counterpart, packed to baroque distraction with foreplayish clutch-popping, coy cross-traffic glances and patronising, pretty-fly-for-a-girl nods. Despite the asphalt-paved vocal chords, Vin is, it has to be said, an awkward romantic lead, which makes the whole fandango even more hilarious. F&amp;F is also a curiously old-fashioned franchise; also, I think, responsible for its unexpected longevity. The only thing more sentimental than its glorification of property crime as morally superior to violent crime is its sense of family values. That&apos;s usually a good reason to give any film a wide berth, but there&apos;s something oddly comforting about the Toretto family soap opera that has taken root in the last three films; a parallel universe where there&apos;s no amount of coerced undercover police collaboration, or brutalisation at the hands of the local drug kingpin, that can&apos;t be smoothed over by a few Coronas and an al fresco chicken barbecue in the company of one&apos;s homies. That said, my man Vin did make the family-above-all talk look a bit hollow when he bailed on the franchise at the first opportunity in 2002, when playing a Maori-tattooed, extreme-sports-loving secret agent instead briefly seemed like a good idea. But, hey, now he&apos;s back, while the golden prince Paul is no more. Does anyone else sense a mawkish Tupac-esque posthumous cult, the likes of which the hip-hop caucus specialises in, in the making? Too cynical? Perhaps. But it doesn&apos;t matter \u2013 F&amp;F is completely irony-proof, which is good because my love for them lacks any irony anyway. The two-cars-tethered-to-a-bank-safe sequence in Fast Five is a masterpiece of destructive action choreography. The decoy-streetcar scramble at the end of No 2 is like a souped-up sequence from a golden-age Hollywood musical. The series trafficks the unrefined ingredients of why the movies were created: physical beauty, and watching objects move at high speed and then hopefully, spectacularly, not. It&apos;s pure spiritual contraband. They&apos;re the hip-hop Dukes of Hazzard \u2013 what&apos;s not to like? I&apos;m sorry about all the booty, but I can&apos;t pretend I wasn&apos;t looking.

It\u2019s certainly true on the Ghan, one of the world\u2019s great rail journeys. It runs north to south, almost the length of the Australian continent, over almost 3,000 kilometres of track and through some of the country\u2019s most varied and at times inhospitable terrain. But when you theme a four-day journey aboard the Ghan with Anzac \u2013 for all of its complex national significance and, yes, its jingoistic hyperbole and myth \u2013 time shifts into several other dimensions too.  First there is plenty of luxury train time in which to be hypnotised by the panorama, with its shifts in topography and variations of tone from Dorothea Mackellar\u2019s brown to Albert Namatjira\u2019s red ochre. And then there are the endless discussions among the 201 guests \u2013 including about 50 Australian veterans and descendants of the original Anzacs \u2013 that hinges on war and peace and how the living interpret the time separating the two.     A veteran outside the Ghan on the Anzac tribute journey. Photograph: Keturah de Klerk/Great Southern Rail    This was the Anzac tribute journey on the Ghan last week, a three-night and four-day trip, beginning in Darwin and ending in Adelaide, that took in stops at Katherine and Alice Springs for the Anzac Day dawn service. As Australia counts down to what the federal government chooses to commemorate as the centenary of Anzac (much of the rest of the world views it globally as the 100th anniversary of the first world war) it offered a compelling and instructive insight into Australian sentiments about war, remembrance and national identity. An admission: I boarded the Ghan as a trenchant critic of Australia\u2019s political, media and cultural inflation of Anzac\u2019s battlefield stories at the expense of the more prosaic, brutal truths about war, and of the jingoistic tendency to write Gallipoli as the birth of the Australian nation.  Nothing on board has changed my mind. If anything, the experience showed me that while Australians rightly revere the personnel who fought and died in all of our conflicts, few are attracted to the more jingoistic Anzac yarns, they want the politicians kept at greater distance from commemoration and they think deeply about notions of \u201csacrifice\u201d and death on the battlefield. Everyone I spoke to on the train, including former soldiers, would prefer to see an Anzac (or any other war-related) myth punctured rather than perpetuated. And so, as the train meandered across a continental red heart that is discomfortingly foreign to most of us Australians who live on the vast, temperate coastal plains, old soldiers sat in the bar and chatted about their service and, in some cases, reunited with those they\u2019d fought with. Meanwhile, descendants of those who died or whose lives had been scarred by service, reflected on the generational legacies of war that are always painfully resonant yet sometimes emotionally intangible.     Kevin Hamilton: 'War runs very deeply in my family.' Photograph: Keturah de Klerk/Great Southern Rail    Kevin Hamilton \u2013 former railway worker, unionist and Labor representative in the South Australian parliament \u2013 tells the story of his uncle, Sergeant Robert Hamilton of the 10th Battalion Australian Imperial Force. As a new enlistee Sergeant Hamilton, dressed in his tunic and broad hat and with his .303 resting on his left shoulder, literally became a poster boy for the recruiters. Decades later he was photographed at an Anzac Day parade with two battalion chums. He was feeling his way with a white stick, having been blinded on the front in France in 1917. Kevin\u2019s father (and Robert\u2019s younger brother) Cyril volunteered for the first world war and served during the next war in northern Australia \u2013 in some of the terrain we travel across on the Ghan.  There are few concrete clues to what happened to Cyril Hamilton, besides several reference in his service records to his \u201canxiety state\u201d. But he was highly dysfunctional afterwards. Kevin\u2019s maternal grandfather also served in the great war and his maternal great uncle died from a sniper\u2019s shot to the head in France. \u201cWar runs deeply through my family. It\u2019s hard to say exactly how it affects you ... except in my father\u2019s case, he was a very distant man \u2013 night after night I saw him very drunk on cheap wine and I felt embarrassed about him and I didn\u2019t understand what had happened to him,&quot; he says. &quot;I grew up in a house where there was no demonstration of affection and I can only surmise it was to do with the trauma of war on both sides of the family.&quot; His South African second wife, Maureen, enters the conversation: \u201cI can tell you that war has really affected his family so badly down the generations. When we met, Kevin was the same \u2013 distant, not good at expressing his emotions. But I had to make him realise, \u2018Darling this is not your fault \u2013 it\u2019s the legacy of war in your family.\u2019 \u201d By this stage Kevin is weeping. And then he becomes angry. \u201cIt is politicians and industrialists who make war and who force the working man to go to war ... it\u2019s why we have a debt of gratitude to those who sacrifice themselves for the wars that the politicians send to them to, and why the politicians should look after them properly when they return ... which doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d I tell Kevin that I\u2019ve never believed soldiers go to war intent on sacrificing themselves. He considers this and shakes his head. Then, a little later, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t believe our boys should ever have gone to world war one. And no, I don\u2019t think they sacrificed themselves. I think that they were sacrificed by the politicians.\u201d The Ghan\u2019s Anzac Tribute journey began in 2011 as an extension of the relationship between Great Southern Rail and the Returned and Services League. This year 201 guests paid up to $4,000 each ($100 from each ticket is donated to the RSL) for the full Darwin-to-Adelaide trip. The Ghan (originally named the Afghan Express after the Afghan cameleers who helped open up northern and central Australia) made its first journey in 1929 and played a critical role in the second world war, transporting troops to the north for training and deployment.

A welcome to country by the original inhabitants, the Jawoyn, who now once again control traditional lands including the Nitmiluk national park that incorporates the Katherine Gorge, evoked Australian history\u2019s long tail, before travellers boated along the ancient gorge that was created by the Jawoyn\u2019s Rainbow Serpent.

Photograph: Keturah de Klerk/Great Southern Rail    The Aboriginal actor Tom E Lewis chatted to the visitors, reminding them that the top end is more than barra and chips, crocodiles and Darwin stubbies. \u201cWe all have out stories,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe Indigenous Australians know about and respect Anzac. And we like the opportunity to tell you our stories of our history too.\u201d Back on the train, servicemen, including a number of Vietnam veterans, reminisced and shared war stories \u2013 more matter-of-factly than nostalgically. They included Robert Morrison, a former gunner from the 4th Field regiment, and Tony Halpin, an engineer. \u201cWe figured we were both 1970 [tour of Vietnam] guys,\u201d recalls Morrison. \u201cSo, we happen to meet up on a train, the Ghan, and naturally there\u2019s a few key questions over a few drinks like \u2018where were you on that day?\u2019 And it all pointed to a certain action that were both involved in.\u201d Specifically in Phuoc Tuy province, when Halpin was lending engineering support to infantry from the 7th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment. \u201cWe got in a bit of shit that day and I called in the [artillery] fire. When we talked, we figured out that Tony was the one that walked it in [directed the fire on to the enemy] that day. He put the fire onto the right spot, and we got out,\u201d Halpin says. The pair had never met before last week. Halpin says there are two days of the year \u2013 Anzac Day and Vietnam Veterans\u2019 Day, 18 August \u2013 when he stops to remember. What does he think about on those days? \u201cOld men have arguments and start wars and then they send young men away to do their bidding and the young men don\u2019t come home,\u201d he says. Halpin came home as a 20-year-old (too young to legally drink or vote) on 30 December 1970. He returned to Australia from Vietnam on a C130 Hercules. \u201cThere were 18 blokes on that plane and only five legs. I had two of them,\u201d he says. He immediately went to the local RSL and was told by an older veteran of another war: \u201cFuck off and come back when you\u2019ve got some war service, son.\u201d Halpin and I are speaking over drinks at an evening barbecue in an old quarry in the East McDonnell ranges outside Alice Springs township.

There are many Indigenous faces \u2013 a rarity at over-organised and politically dominated Anzac events in the eastern states. It\u2019s an earthy affair, where politicians don\u2019t get to speak, kids lay wreaths and the Last Post is trumpeted, not bugled.  But there is an incident that may well burden several local public officials who were intent on securing their moments of reflected Anzac eminence. A number of \u201cdiggers\u201d, including two world war two Australian members of the Royal Australian Air Force Bomber Squadron, which flew dangerous sorties over Europe, are seated in the front row close to the memorial obelisk. They are, unwittingly, in the wrong seats. So they are moved back, to the chagrin of many in the crowd, for a mayor (conspicuously clad in chains of office), local politicians and other dignitaries, who seem less self-important than lacking in self-awareness that this clumsy act, freighted with such offence, is worth a chapter in a text book about elected officials\u2019 own goals.

Located in the north-east of the city, it is home to 670,000 residents, of which 21% are over 65. In 2010, Adachi was at the centre of a national scandal when public officials visited their oldest resident, believed to have been 111, only to find a corpse \u2013 presumed to have been there for many years. The incident drew attention to the increasing numbers of kodokushi or &quot;lonely deaths&quot; in the country, where elderly people in particular die alone in their homes. Japan has one of the world&apos;s fastest ageing populations, and with the birth rate continuing to decline there is serious national concern about how Japan will support its elderly in the long term. Traditional family structures in which elderly parents remain in the family home are changing and, particularly in large cities, an increasing number of elderly now live alone. There are fears that without adequate community support these people may become socially isolated and unable to get the right care. The issue is a high priority for local authorities. Adachi responded by establishing the Power of Communities Promotion division in 2011. One of the main pillars of the division is the zero isolation project, which aims to prevent elderly residents from becoming socially isolated, and to make sure they feel safe in the area. The ward has drawn on existing partnerships with neighbourhood organisations and community-based groups. It has encouraged the sharing of residents&apos; personal data in order to put in place a comprehensive support system for those at risk. Beginning in early 2013, Adachi used the citizens register to identify households with a single person over 70, who did not currently subscribe to a public health insurance programme. With the support of 113 registered neighbourhood associations, they visited these households to establish the social conditions of the residents. Those who did not have a 10-minute conversation with someone from outside their household more than once a week, or who did not have someone to consult if they encountered a difficulty, were categorised as socially excluded and recommended to receive follow-up support. By the end of 2013, 6,100 households had been visited and 680 individuals identified as socially isolated. Information about these households is also available to relevant bodies such as the police and fire service and registered community-welfare organisations. Follow-up support is offered by local support centres, commissioned by the ward. At-risk residents are allocated a volunteer community link support worker who will make regular household visits, and match the resident to various sources of support, ranging from social and sports clubs to medical, welfare and care services provided by the ward. The programme is also an opportunity to identify any immediate or serious needs and refer the individual to the appropriate outlet. Residents can opt out of the scheme, but even those who elect not to participate will receive regular updates on available services by post. A secondary aim of the project is to encourage all residents to become more involved in community activities. There are currently around 500 volunteer community link support workers. However, Adachi&apos;s annual public opinion survey showed 40% of residents wanted to engage but did not have time. Publicity materials produced by the ward encourage younger residents to spare some time to call in on their elderly neighbours. While it is too early to say whether Adachi&apos;s strategy will combat social isolation, older residents have reacted positively to the scheme and public opinion surveys show that the number of residents expressing a sense of pride and attachment to their town is increasing. The scheme will now be rolled out to incorporate other residents vulnerable to social isolation, including the disabled and single parents.

All Shobukhova&apos;s results since 9 October 2009 have also been annulled after the Russian athletics federation announced they had found abnormalities in her biological passport. This includes her marathon best of two hours 18 minutes and 20 seconds, set in winning her third Chicago Marathon in 2011, as well as her first and second places in London in 2010 and 2011. The news was greeted with relief by Paula Radcliffe, the marathon world record holder, who tweeted that Liliya Shobukhova was &quot;finally exposed as a drug cheat. Fraud on so many levels, so much money effectively stolen in appearance fees, winnings and endorsements.&quot; However, the organisers of the big city marathons are determined to get their money back. If Shobukhova&apos;s ban is ratified, her financial repayments will be among the biggest for doping in athletics history. Under the rules of the World Marathon Majors race series \u2013 which comprises all of the big city marathons, including Tokyo, Boston, London, Chicago, New York, Berlin \u2013 any athlete found guilty of a doping offence is required to repay all prize and appearance money. In Shobukhova&apos;s case that is substantial. The Russian earned $1m (\u00a3595,000) alone for winning the 2009-10 and 2010-11 World Marathon Major series \u2013 a championship-style competition which awards points for an athlete&apos;s results in major city marathons, world championships and the Olympic Games. She also won over $500,000 in official prize money from competing in the Chicago and London marathons between 2009 and 2011. In 2011 she won $85,000 after finishing second in London and running under 2hr 22m, and $140,000 for winning the Chicago marathon and going under 2hr 20m. All big city marathons also pay appearance money to elite athletes in addition to secret time bonuses that are not made public. It is understood that these fees, in the high six-figures, will be reclaimed too if Shobukhova&apos;s ban is ratified. Meanwhile the London Marathon race director, Hugh Brasher, said Shobukhova&apos;s ban proved extensive testing of elite athletes was working. &quot;London Marathon is at the forefront of the fight against doping in our sport, and we are very proud to have been the first major marathon to introduce blood testing for all of our elite competitors, prior to each event,&quot; he said. &quot;This mandatory blood testing commenced at the London Marathon in 2002, and has continued with all our elite competitors throughout. We continue to work very closely with UK Anti-Doping, the IAAF and Wada with the aim of eradicating drug-taking in our sport.&quot; Nick Bitel, the general counsel of World Marathon Majors, also warned: &quot;We will continue to hold a stern line and support all measures to ensure the integrity of the athletes competing in their races. Cheats need to understand that they are not welcome in our sport and that they will be caught.&quot; Shobukhova, 36, has a right to appeal the decision but if it is upheld her suspension will be backdated to 24 January 2013 and will end on 23 January 2015."}, {"sentences": ["Crowds watching on Copacabana beach cheered as IOC members voted in 2009 to choose Rio over Tokyo, Chicago and Madrid.", "Although some within Olympic circles have joked about swapping the 2020 Tokyo Games with Rio, switching host cities with just over two years to go until the Games is not viewed as practicable."], "tags": ["Rio 2016", "International Olympic Committee", "Brazil", "Olympic Games", "Olympic games 2004", "Sport", "World Cup", "Football", "World Cup 2014", "Americas", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-29T19:54:14Z", "title": "Rio 2016 Olympic preparations damned as 'worst ever' by IOC", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/29/rio-2016-olympic-preparations-worst-ever-ioc", "article": "     Five years after Rio de Janeiro became the first South American city to be awarded the Olympics, preparations for the 2016 Games have been damned by a senior International Olympic Committee official as the &quot;worst ever&quot;. IOC vice-president John Coates has compared Rio&apos;s preparations unfavourably with the notoriously last ditch 2004 Olympics in Athens, amid rising concern about the rush to finish competition venues and associated infrastructure. The Australian, who has been involved in Olympic sport for more than 40 years, warned there was &quot;no plan B&quot;. &quot;The situation is critical on the ground,&quot; said Coates, who has been on six inspection visits to Rio. &quot;We have become very concerned. They are not ready in many, many ways. We have to make it happen and that is the IOC&apos;s approach. You can&apos;t walk away from this.&quot; The latest warning about Rio&apos;s readiness, all the more significant for coming from inside the IOC, comes less than 50 days before a Brazilian World Cup troubled by construction delays and mass protests is due to kick off. Crowds watching on Copacabana beach cheered as IOC members voted in 2009 to choose Rio over Tokyo, Chicago and Madrid. But with just over two years until the first athletics events in the Est\u00e1dio Ol\u00edmpico Jo\u00e3o Havelange, where the roof fell in last year, there are concerns that the Games will suffer a similar fate. Pressure has been steadily building on organisers as it became clear that the unwieldy relationship between city, state and national governments and the ambitious nature of the plans had caused delays and discord. The World Cup has also proved a distraction and provoked anger from those who believe resources have been diverted from public services to prepare for the unprecedented back-to-back hosting of the world&apos;s two biggest sporting events. &quot;The IOC has formed a special taskforce to try and speed up the preparations but the situation is critical on the ground,&quot; added Coates in a statement on the Australian Olympic Committee&apos;s website. &quot;The IOC has adopted a more &apos;hands-on&apos; role. It is unprecedented for the IOC but there is no Plan B. We are going to Rio.&quot; The IOC statement also paraphrased Coates describing the Rio preparations as &quot;the worst I have experienced&quot; and &quot;worse than Athens&quot;. He added that the host city also had &quot;social issues that need to be addressed&quot;. Experienced IOC executive director Gilbert Felli has been dispatched to lead a troubleshooting team and attempt to refocus on the most pressing issues. Although some within Olympic circles have joked about swapping the 2020 Tokyo Games with Rio, switching host cities with just over two years to go until the Games is not viewed as practicable. Some IOC insiders expressed exasperation with the public outburst from Coates, fearing it would provoke a backlash from the Rio&apos;s mayor, Eduardo Paes. They believe Paes, who is the only political player not to face re-election between now and 2016, needs to be kept onside if the project is to be delivered. Paes said recently: &quot;Don&apos;t ever in your life do a World Cup and an Olympic Games at the same time. I am not cut out to be a masochist.&quot; As it attempted to limit the likely fallout from Coates&apos; plain speaking, the IOC said in a statement that Felli had received a positive response to his presence. &quot;Now is a time to look forward to work together and to deliver great Games for Rio, Brazil and for the world, and not to engage in discussion of the past,&quot; it said. &quot;We continue to believe that Rio is capable of providing outstanding Games.&quot; At the Rio 2016 HQ, an impressive mural of the hugely ambitious plans \u2013 slated to cost $15bn when the bid was won in 2009 \u2013 dominates one of the corridors. New transport networks were designed to link four zones that will house an event often likened to hosting 28 simultaneous world championships. But the ambitious plans may now have to be downgraded. Hosting the Olympics was designed to showcase Brazil&apos;s confidence as one of the fastest growing world economies and turbocharge long overdue improvement to the city&apos;s infrastructure. But negative headlines about forced clearances of favelas to make way for construction projects and increasingly strident complaints from world sport federations about the readiness of facilities has dented confidence in its ability to deliver. Work has not begun at Deodoro, a complex of eight temporary Olympics sports venues, and is well behind on the course that will host golf&apos;s return to the Games for the first time in more than a century. Water pollution remains a concern for sailing and other sports. Providing enough accommodation for the army of media and spectators that will descend on the city for the duration of the Games is also a worry. The IOC has been working with organisers to identify the most pressing concerns and hopes once the World Cup is over they will accelerate their plans and that the feelgood factor of a Rio Games will carry them through. Rio 2016 organisers said the recent announcement of a $10.8bn budget for infrastructure and legacy projects, 43% of which will be met by private investors, together with the launch of the tender process for the Deodoro venues, were clear signs of progress. &quot;The time has now passed when general discussions about the progress of preparations contribute to the journey towards the Games. It is time for us to focus on the work to be done and on engaging with society,&quot; it said in a statement. &quot;We have a historic mission: to organise the first Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil and in South America. We are going to achieve this. In 2016, Rio will host excellent Games that will be delivered absolutely within the agreed timelines and budgets.&quot; Concerns over the readiness of Olympic hosts has become part of the traditional buildup to the Games, with critics also often taking aim at the long list of demands made by the IOC. But Coates said he believed the Rio Games were even more troubled than the preparations for Athens, which saw venues being finished right at the deadline and left behind little in the way of legacy. &quot;I think this is a worse situation than Athens. In Athens, we were dealing with one government and some city responsibilities. Here, there&apos;s three,&quot; said Coates. &quot;There is bureaucracy, there is little coordination between the federal, the state government and the city \u2013 which is responsible for a lot of the construction. The flow of funds from the federal government is not happening quickly enough. We think we need to help facilitate that.&quot; Within the IOC there are also fears that the ill will generated by Fifa&apos;s demands over the World Cup, which led a million protesters to take to the streets during last year&apos;s Confederations Cup warm-up, will make it more difficult to persuade the public of the benefits of hosting the Games. Five other host cities where panic set in Atlanta 1996 Pre-Games concerns over the lacklustre venues, most of which were built from scratch, and the likelihood of traffic gridlock during the Olympics were borne out. There was also criticism of the overbearing corporate nature of the Games. But that all paled into insignificance beside the impact of a bomb in the Olympic Park that killed two people and injured scores more. Athens 2004 Until now, Athens has been seen as the high water mark of panicked Olympic preparations. Following a last-ditch dash to finish the construction of the venues, some were still being completed on the eve of the Games. Also hit by doping controversies and the lack of a legacy plan that left many venues unused and dilapidated afterwards, Greece&apos;s subsequent economic woes led some to question whether the $11bn Olympic investment was a factor. Turin 2006 Having breathed a sigh of relief over Athens, the IOC faced another looming challenge for the Winter Games that followed. A $242m budget shortfall, corruption claims and concern over tight construction deadlines led it to issue a strident public warning with 18 months to go. London 2012 Determined to avoid the last ditch panics of previous Games, London&apos;s permanent venues were delivered and tested in plenty of time and yet it still almost fell victim to unforeseen events. With less than a year to go and with every Olympic sport visiting the capital to check on progress, London erupted in riots that left many questioning security plans. With weeks to go, torrential rain also left organisers facing a race against time to deliver the substantial temporary venues required. Sochi 2014 The run-up to the most expensive Olympics in history, winter or summer, was mired in controversy over the $51bn budget, jaw dropping corruption claims, protests over Russia&apos;s human rights record and mocking media stories over unfinished hotel rooms. While ultimately hailed a success, the reaction is said by some analysts to have hardened Vladimir Putin&apos;s resolve against the west."}, {"sentences": ["We&apos;re travelling KLM, going the scenic route, via Amsterdam and Tokyo.", "On the flight to Tokyo, Ireland&apos;s captain killed time watching Smith&apos;s portrayal of Muhammad Ali and was transfixed by the scene in which the boxer resists the urgings of his family, friends and advisers to accept the draft for the Vietnam war.", "Emboldened by what he had seen on his flight to Tokyo, Keane was unimpressed when Ireland&apos;s squad eventually arrived in Saipan for what was ostensibly a week of pre-World Cup relaxation with some light training, only to discover their hampers of training kit, footballs and medical supplies had not arrived on the island."], "tags": ["Republic of Ireland", "World Cup", "Sport", "Football", "Roy Keane"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-01T10:16:43Z", "title": "World Cup: 25 stunning moments ...

He saw. He went home.&quot; So ran the tag-line of the Irish box office smash hit comedy I, Keano, an epic musical melodrama about a Roman legion preparing for war. It was inspired by a real-life melodrama of even more epic proportions: arguably the most fractious falling-out in the history of Irish sport, a gripping and often amusing controversy prompted by Roy Keane&apos;s contentious departure from the Republic of Ireland World Cup squad in 2002. The captain&apos;s headline-grabbing exit from the squad briefly transformed the tiny western Pacific island of Saipan into the most famous places on Earth. It made a cute and goofy Labrador puppy named Triggs into a household name. It was the source of more pompous pontification in the bars of the British Isles than any number of budgets, general elections and scandals. It practically sundered a nation, driving it to the brink of something approaching civil war and prompted the Taoiseach (prime minister) of the day to offer his services as a mediator. It became the subject of more hand-wringing sanctimony and general tomfoolery than almost any incident before or since in modern Irish life. It was all about standards. Roy&apos;s standards. Depending on your point of view they were either too high or not high enough. Was Roy the perfectionist who wanted the best for his country or the traitor who abandoned it? In Ireland, 12 years on, the jury remains out.     Roy Keane was the only subject that mattered in Ireland in the summer of 2002. Photograph: Haydn West/PA    Everybody and nobody seems to know exactly what happened. The definitive version remains unconfirmed and even now, those who were privy to events as they unravelled remain understandably reluctant to talk about them in too much depth. Keane&apos;s detractors claim he walked. His supporters insist he was sent home. The truth seems to lie somewhere in between: he made his position untenable and forced his manager&apos;s hand. This much we know: Ireland&apos;s captain, then a 30-year-old volatile driving force who had almost single-handedly dragged his country through qualification for Japan and South Korea 2002 out of a group containing Portugal and Holland, decided to leave the camp out of frustration at poor preparation but then changed his mind. However, a newspaper interview he&apos;d given to the Irish Times rolled off the presses like a grenade and exploded, prompting the famous showdown at which Keane embarked on a character assassination of his manager, Mick McCarthy, that was so brutal, the object of his scorn felt compelled to say he could no longer work with his captain. In a chat with me for the Irish magazine Hot Press a few months after the event, the former Republic of Ireland international Niall Quinn insisted that &quot;Roy walked out&quot;. Later in the same interview he stressed that Keane had walked out &quot;twice in three days&quot;. He could not have been more clear: &quot;You must remember that,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re not talking about a happy bunny here, who suddenly said the wrong things for a few seconds. I think it built up and up in him. While the rest of us were prepared to get on with things, knowing how ramshackle things are, he allowed it to get in the way of his World Cup.&quot;     Roy Keane speaks to reporters before leaving Saipan on a flight home. Photograph:    Kieran Doherty / Reuters/Reuters    Keane tells it differently, stating in his autobiography that having originally become so exasperated by a rock-hard training pitch, the FAI&apos;s failure to get their squad&apos;s training kit to Saipan and a row about five-a-side goalkeeping arrangements, he decided to throw his hat at the whole jamboree and go home. A short time later, having been given time to cool down and review his position, he subsequently changed his mind only to be, in his opinion, ambushed at a team meeting called by McCarthy, who accused him of having faked an injury to avoid having to play the second leg of Ireland&apos;s successful qualifying play-off against Iran. That, according to Keane, was the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back and the cue for his outburst, which Quinn described as &quot;the most surgical slaughtering anyone has ever got&quot;. &quot;You&apos;re a fucking wanker. I didn&apos;t rate you as a player, I don&apos;t rate you as a manager and I don&apos;t rate you as a person. You&apos;re a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. I&apos;ve got no respect for you. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks.&quot;     Roy Keane keeps busy by walking his dog Triggs. Photograph: Reuters    &quot;Humiliation in front of the whole party was the result he was seeking,&quot; wrote Keane of McCarthy in his autobiography, stating that the meeting had been a set-up. Not too long after that, Keane received a phone call from his representative, the Irish solicitor Michael Kennedy. &quot;You&apos;ve been kicked out,&quot; he was told. At 6pm the next day, with the rest of the Republic of Ireland squad en route to Japan, Keane was on the next plane home. How had it come to this? Since his days as a youth footballer making a name for himself in Cork, Keane had never had much time for the FAI, an organisation that favoured players from Dublin clubs to those from elsewhere in the country. Upon becoming a senior international, he was increasingly perplexed by its amateurish approach to match preparation and was not alone, as a cursory flick through the autobiographies of any Republic of Ireland international who played through the Jack Charlton and Mick McCarthy eras will prove. Things began to go pear-shaped at the airport on the way to Saipan. Already annoyed that he had been criticised in some newspapers for missing Quinn&apos;s famously generous fundraising testimonial in Sunderland in favour of remaining in Manchester for treatment on a number of injuries that were threatening to rule him out of the World Cup, Keane was in understandably grumpy mood at Dublin airport and immediately buttonholed a couple of the journalists who had portrayed his non-attendance as a &quot;snub&quot;. The journey to Saipan had started badly and went quickly downhill. &quot;The trip is a shambles from the beginning,&quot; recalls Keane in his book. &quot;Dublin airport is packed, you can&apos;t move. We hump a month&apos;s luggage through the main concourse. Check ourselves in. We&apos;re travelling KLM, going the scenic route, via Amsterdam and Tokyo. Fans, journalists, players, officials all mingle together. The package tour image comes to mind again. Amid the chaos, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, arrives to give us a send-off.&quot; With Keane already seething, it was left to Hollywood actor Will Smith to make things worse. On the flight to Tokyo, Ireland&apos;s captain killed time watching Smith&apos;s portrayal of Muhammad Ali and was transfixed by the scene in which the boxer resists the urgings of his family, friends and advisers to accept the draft for the Vietnam war. &quot;They&apos;re all urging him to give in,&quot; recalls Keane. &quot;Take the draft. You won&apos;t have to fight. Just go through the motions, play the game, screw the things you believe in. Ali resists them all. I&apos;m doing what I think is right. It matters. You don&apos;t compromise on your principles. Watching this is very moving. I hadn&apos;t known this about Ali. Something in this scene strikes a chord with me. Don&apos;t put up with shit. I&apos;m not fighting a white man&apos;s war. It&apos;s an inspiring notion, a demonstration of conviction that I understand very clearly and I relate to my own life. Don&apos;t compromise the things you believe in.&quot; Nice one, Will. Emboldened by what he had seen on his flight to Tokyo, Keane was unimpressed when Ireland&apos;s squad eventually arrived in Saipan for what was ostensibly a week of pre-World Cup relaxation with some light training, only to discover their hampers of training kit, footballs and medical supplies had not arrived on the island. It was his nightmare scenario: Ireland preparing for a tournament in what he described as &quot;happy-camper mode with no real ambition, settling for second best&quot;. Visiting McCarthy in his hotel room, he voiced his disquiet and told his manager the team&apos;s gear should have arrived the previous week. The following morning, Monday, Ireland&apos;s players arrived at their training ground for a run to discover the surface was too hard. &quot;We could have watered it,&quot; Fifa&apos;s liaison officer told Keane. &quot;If anyone had told us you were coming down.&quot; Fail to prepare, prepare to fail. Things went from bad to worse. The missing equipment arrived that night and the following day the squad had a full training session on a pitch that was still too hard, apart from one section, which had been flooded by those responsible for watering the pitch. When the training session finished with a game, Keane was outraged to discover the squad&apos;s goalkeepers were unwilling to play on the grounds that they were too tired, having begun training half an hour before everyone else. In front of a couple of journalists, he got in a heated argument with the reserve goalkeeper Alan Kelly, one of the players in the squad he rubbed along with better than most. With Lee Carsley and Steve Finnan having picked up injuries on the training pitch, Keane decided he&apos;d had enough of Ireland&apos;s &quot;third world approach to the game&quot; and upon returning to the team hotel, he took McCarthy to one side and announced he wanted to go home. The way Keane tells it, he subsequently apologised to Kelly for the row they&apos;d had, went for a walk and was persuaded to stay on by team physio, concierge and agony uncle Mick Byrne. Upon being informed of the U-turn, McCarthy told Keane he&apos;d already asked the Celtic midfielder Colin Healy to come out as his replacement. Feeling bad for Healy, Keane left it up to McCarthy to decide what should happen next. &quot;I was indecisive,&quot; recalls Keane. &quot;I desperately wanted to play. Yet I couldn&apos;t stand the fuck-ups. There is no hero here.&quot; The indecision continued: Keane told Byrne he was definitely going, secretly hoping he&apos;d be invited to stay. With the news of his imminent departure breaking in Ireland, he spoke on the phone to his adviser Kennedy, then Alex Ferguson. His Manchester United manager told him he had earned the right to change his mind and remain in Saipan. With mere minutes to go before the Republic of Ireland were due to fax their World Cup squad to Fifa, Keane decided to stay and a potential crisis appeared to have been nipped in the bud. Determined to keep his head down and his mouth shut until the squad moved to their proper training camp on the mainland, Keane did exactly that \u2026 apart from honouring promises to give a couple of interviews to favoured journalists, one of which appeared in the Irish Times the day before the Irish squad were due to leave the island.. What could possibly go wrong? &quot;It expressed exactly what I felt,&quot; said Keane of the interview in his book. &quot;I believed the people at home had a right to know the truth. The Irish fans are celebrated for the support they give the team. Thousands of them were flying out on expensive packages to support us in the World Cup. My own brothers and cousin were coming. It was the trip of a lifetime for them. Millions more would be watching the matches at home, as I&apos;d done in 1998 and 1990. Were the people to be treated like mugs? They spent their hard-earned money, paid our wages and then we insult them with PR crap about all they&apos;ve done for us. Maybe we should do something for them to repay the debt we owed them. Like get our act together. And tell them the score now and then.&quot; The end was nigh. The interview caused a sensation in both Ireland and Saipan, prompting the team meeting which resulted in Keane&apos;s exile from the squad. At a hastily convened press conference, McCarthy confirmed the news of Keane&apos;s departure flanked by his new captain Steve Staunton, along with Kelly and Quinn in a show of solidarity. Upstairs in his room, Keane bade farewell to a procession of largely sympathetic team-mates at the door of his hotel room. His World Cup jig was very much up. Months later, Quinn expressed his regret at the manner in which events had unfolded. &quot;When Roy exploded like he did, we needed to have a 24-hour cooling off period,&quot; he told me. &quot;Looking back, I think the events of history would have been a lot different if we had done that. Roy walked out, Mick called a press conference and it seems like minutes later myself, Stan and Alan Kelly are in there with Stan [Steve Staunton] as the new captain. Obviously, at the time we were shocked by what Roy had done, but Mick had asked us to stick up for him because he knew there&apos;d be a hostile reception waiting for him. We knew we were putting ourselves in a dreadful position but we walked in with no other choice at the time. There was no way Roy was going to walk in and apologise a minute later, it was too intense for that. But at the same time, we might have prepared ourselves and structured ourselves for what was going to happen a little bit better. After that, I could give you a list of 20 other mistakes we made, all horrendous stuff. I&apos;m almost apologetic for the mistakes we made. I&apos;m certainly apologetic for the mistakes I made.&quot; Appearing at the press conference alongside McCarthy, Kelly and Staunton appears to have been Quinn&apos;s biggest mistake, as Keane saw it as an outright act of betrayal. Wounded at having been accused of disloyalty by McCarthy for feigning injury, he was outraged that none of his team-mates, particularly the more senior ones for whom Japan and South Korea represented a last international hurrah, had not spoken out on his behalf when McCarthy rounded on him. Having made his own travel arrangements with help from staff at Manchester United, he went home to a house under siege from reporters. Several daily dog-walks with Triggs around Cheshire later, with Ireland&apos;s World Cup opener against Cameroon looming, he granted an interview to RTE news reporter Tommie Gorman, who spoke of Keane&apos;s role model status, all but berated him for his use of industrial language at a private team meeting attended by grown men, pleaded with him to think of Ireland&apos;s children and urged him to reconsider his position. With the Irish football press pack listening in from Japan, courtesy of one of their relatives holding a phone up against a television in Dublin, the entire fiasco had officially entered the realms of high farce. &quot;If for one second I thought &apos;Maybe Roy, you were a little bit out of order, maybe there&apos;s a way back&apos;, I&apos;d be back on that flight,&quot; said Keane to Gorman. &quot;No doubts in my mind about that. But I went to my room and we had three players in a press conference within 20 minutes or half an hour of [the team meeting] saying they were behind Mick. People look at them as role models; they&apos;re cowards. If I went back I couldn&apos;t give 100% for my country. When they had their chance to speak up they didn&apos;t.&quot; Clearly bemused by a decidedly melodramatic interrogatory style in which Gorman pointed out that people in Ireland would be &quot;absolutely haunted&quot; by his departure from the squad, Keane was typically blunt. &quot;That&apos;ll pass,&quot; he said. &quot;People will get on with their lives. It&apos;s a football tournament.&quot; He was spot on. It did pass and most people did get on with their lives, but at the time in Ireland, such steely-eyed pragmatism went strangely unappreciated."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Most structures in, for example, Tokyo were destroyed, so everything had to be rebuilt from scratch,&quot; he says."], "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability", "Japan", "Housing", "Ethical business", "Architecture"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-02T06:00:00Z", "title": "Japan's disposable home culture is an environmental and financial headache", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/disposable-homes-japan-environment-lifespan-sustainability", "article": "It&apos;s time to move to a new city. You look at houses you might want to buy and finally settle on one that&apos;s in the right location and appeals to you. But in Japan, that appeal hardly matters: the average home only lasts for 30 years. That&apos;s because, as the economists Richard Koo and Masaya Sasaki show in a report, 15 years after being built the average house is worth nothing. &quot;It&apos;s a direct contrast to, for example, western Europe, where many of the most desirable buildings are 200 years old,&quot; notes Alastair Townsend, a British architect living and working in Japan. &quot;It&apos;s not environmentally sustainable but also not financially sustainable. People work very hard to pay off a mortgage that&apos;s ultimately worth zero.&quot; The disposable-home culture has led to a perverse market, where construction is in almost-perpetual boom without the number of homes increasing much at all. It has also produced a huge number of architects, who are kept busy by buyers wanting a new house that reflects their lifestyle. According to the International Union of Architects, Japan has almost 2.5 architects per 1,000 residents, whereas Britain only has half an architect per 1,000 residents. The US has only 0.33 architects per 1,000 residents and Canada has 0.22%. Japan, in other words, has 11 times as many architects per capita as Canada. The origins of this unusual approach to sturdy structures are the result of a long history featuring earthquakes and fires. The second world war exacerbated the situation. Jiro Yoshida, an assistant professor of business at Pennsylvania State University, specialises in the Japanese housing market. &quot;Most structures in, for example, Tokyo were destroyed, so everything had to be rebuilt from scratch,&quot; he says. &quot;The new buildings weren&apos;t very good, so after a while many had to be knocked down.&quot; But today&apos;s buildings are demolished even though they could last. That, says Yoshida, has a cultural explanation: &quot;The government updates the building code every 10 years due to the earthquake risk. Rather than spending money on expensive retrofitting, people just build new homes.&quot; That&apos;s good news for the Japanese economy, but less good for homeowners themselves. They seem to accept the situation, however, often even neglecting to properly maintain a home they know is on track for demolition. But the real victim is the environment: replacing the entire housing stock within a generation means a whole lot of construction waste. Granted, a law passed in 2000 requires that most forms of demolition waste be recycled, and more than 80% of it is. But recycling consumes large amounts of energy and yields less valuable materials than the ones being discarded. Consider concrete: though 98% is recycled and used as roadbed gravel, there&apos;s more discarded concrete than there are roads that need gravel. Then there&apos;s the problem of illegally disposed construction waste, which is estimated to account for 70% of all illegally discarded waste. The construction sector is also a major CO2 emitter. In 2011, Japanese manufacturing and construction emitted 244.78 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, compared with 587 million from manufacturing and construction in the US in 2010. Last year, Japan reneged on its pledge to cut its CO2 emissions by 25% compared with the 2005 level, instead announcing a 3.8% reduction target by 2020. The irony is that unlike their post-war hastily erected forerunners, today&apos;s homes are sometimes well built and could easily last for several more decades. &quot;Japan has a very efficient and sustainable way of mass-producing timber homes that are very good and can even withstand earthquakes,&quot; notes Townsend. &quot;And Japan is a heavily forested country, but it imports the wood, which is in itself unsustainable.&quot; Many other houses, though, are rather logically built using less robust materials as they won&apos;t have to last long anyway.&quot; The solution, argues Townsend, is for the government to stop promoting the dream of home ownership for everyone. Several years ago, Japan&apos;s parliament passed the so-called 200-year-home law, which reduces homeowners&apos; taxes if their homes are built according to strict standards. The law might not be enough to change the disposable-home culture, but other small changes are under way: more condominiums, which can by definition not be demolished based on the desire of a single homeowner, are being built. Recent research by Yoshida shows that homes built according to green building standards depreciate more slowly than regular ones, though they&apos;re more expensive to maintain. And renovation companies have spotted a market in promoting longer-lasting homes for the sake of the environment. As Yoshida notes: &quot;We know that we can move towards a better world with less construction.&quot; The circular economy hub is funded by Philips.

Remember that tingling feeling of anticipation and avariciousness? Or maybe it was just me, and that&apos;s why there are so few of them left. But anyway, at Tower Records (it lives! in Japan at least) in Shibuya, the seventh floor is one of classical music&apos;s last standing Alexandria, and what&apos;s astonishing about it is the range and depth of what they&apos;ve got on the shelves. You ain&apos;t seen nothin&apos; in terms of physically available CDs if you haven&apos;t been to this particular patch of classical-music paradise. There are unique-to-Japan releases from the major labels, some outrageously beautifully packaged complete sets of Toru Takemitsu&apos;s music, there are Bruckner symphony cycles by one of the world&apos;s greatest but least familiar conductors (at least in the west), Takashi Asahina, along with rare collections of previously unreleased recordings by familiar names including Glenn Gould or John Ogdon, like the collection I picked up.  But it&apos;s in the section devoted to &quot;collectors&quot; where you&apos;ll find the real booty: a 107-CD set of Furtw\u00e4ngler&apos;s recordings (just a fraction of his recorded legacy); concert bootlegs of everyone from Wilhelm Backhaus to Maria Yudina, and Yevgeny Mravinsky to Guido Cantelli. Then, right in front of me, was the stuff of a classical music fan&apos;s dreams made real: dozens of concert tapings of the great enigma himself, conductor Carlos Kleiber. Are some of these rare performances now available on YouTube? Yes. Is there any point buying multiple renditions \u2013 recorded at different times, at least \u2013 of Kleiber&apos;s Beethoven 4, Brahms 4, or Brahms 2? Of course! And is there a unique excitement at seeing these performances in some vaguely physical guise (including, at last, his Chicago Symphony performance of George Butterworth), a sense of possession and ownership that streaming stuff off the internet can never totally replace for? Absolutely!  In Japan, I&apos;m not alone. After every classical gig, hundreds of music-lovers queue for artists to sign their CDs and liner notes. These autographs are their most treasured possessions, and they&apos;re something you just can&apos;t get on a download. In terms of sales, the country is the last bastion of the classical-music obsession with CDs \u2013 and it shows no sign of abating. The Tower Records shop has recently been refurbished, and the staff know where to find the most obscure selections from their catalogue on their hundreds of shelves. It has the happy atmosphere of a place that is both loved by fans and is commercially successful, instead of the seedy excuses for collections that pass for the classical departments of Britain&apos;s few remaining large record stores. I only scratched the surface as far as Shibuya&apos;s classical riches were concerned, and as far as my bank balance and airline luggage restrictions would allow.

It&apos;s not at all like it, in fact. The size of a large detached house, it has just 10 rooms and no rides, although you can board a stuffed-cat bus if you&apos;re small enough to fit inside the windows. The best exhibits are not much more than piles of overflowing ashtrays, jumbles of books, huddles of knick knacks and dozens and dozens of drawings. It&apos;s less like a theme park, more like an exhibition celebrating the Untidy Victorian Of The Year. According to the museum&apos;s literature, the rooms belong to an anonymous individual. The abandoned offices are there simply to show visitors how animators work. Every visitor knows that&apos;s not entirely true, though. They know that just like everything else at Studio Ghibli, this anonymous character is more than partially inspired by the passions and talents of Hayao Miyazaki, perhaps the world&apos;s pre-eminent animator. But soon, just as in his museum (whose building he designed himself), the 73-year-old Miyazaki is about to vacate his desk. The great man has retired from making films and an awful lot of people are wondering what will happen next. To recap, Studio Ghibli is the animation studio founded by Miyazaki and his partner Isao Takahata in Tokyo in 1985. Over the 29 years that followed they have released 19 full-length feature films, eight of them directed by Miyazaki. Of these, 2001&apos;s Spirited Away is the biggest film of all-time in Japan and was the first to gross $200m worldwide before opening in North America (it also won the Oscar for best animated film). When Japanese consumers are polled as to their favourite brands, they often put Ghibli top, ahead of Toyota and Sony. But Ghibli&apos;s importance in its home country goes beyond financial success; in a way it has helped to define a sense of national character, creating new fables for the country such as the environmental parable Princess Mononoke. Ghibli has come to stand for both an aesthetic and moral code, continuing the practice of hand-drawn animation as everything else turns digital and creating stories for children that offer a more complex morality \u2013 and have a more vivid imagination \u2013 than its peers.            Reading this on mobile? Click here to view This month sees the UK release of Miyazaki&apos;s final film as a director, The Wind Rises. It tells the story of Jiro, a young boy in love with the concept of flight. An idealist and a dreamer, Jiro&apos;s innocent passion takes him to the top of his profession, but it also leads him to invent the Mitsubishi Zero fighter plane, a catastrophic instrument of war. The Wind Rises, based in part on the real-life inventor of the Zero fighter, Jiro Horikoshi, has received rapturous critical notices. It has also proven politically contentious both in Japan and America; at home for being anti-war and &quot;anti-Japanese&quot; and abroad for apparently absolving Jiro of guilt for his actions. Fans of Miyazaki&apos;s work may find it something of a departure, more adult in tone and certainly light on the fantastical creatures that usually populate his films (unlike in the earlier Porco Rosso, at no point do any of the pilots turn into pigs). But they will also find themes that are familiar: a belief in the virtues of pacificism and the glory of nature; a hero that will not waver from his path. And if you wondered whether Miyazaki sees anything of himself in his protagonist, you will find that Jiro, just like his creator, wears glasses that look like sawn-off Coke bottles. &quot;We exaggerated the glasses; we exaggerate a lot,&quot; says Kitaro Kosaka, the man who worked most closely with Miyazaki&apos;s vision as supervising animator on The Wind Rises. &quot;A lot of research went into it, too; we would compile portraits of Jiro Horikoshi and other photos of that era, but we didn&apos;t want just to reproduce. We would try to match the research with our own designs, try to blend it in so it would be coherent and seamless. It was a very interesting process for me. I don&apos;t wear them, but Miyazaki-san has very big glasses and has a sort of complex about it. I would say he&apos;s projecting a part of himself on to that character.&quot; Kosaka and I are talking in the offices of Studio Ghibli itself, an almost laughably humble campus a few miles down the road from the museum. Comprised of just four small buildings (Studios 1, 2, 3 and 5, the reason for the missing 4 being a company secret), it&apos;s nestled in a street of tiny houses and rusting minivans. There&apos;s also somebody else&apos;s garden centre right in the middle of it. It&apos;s not quite Pixar&apos;s sprawling California HQ with its scooters and complimentary breakfast bars. But, again, that&apos;s how Miyazaki likes it.     Hayao Miyazaki    &quot;Miyazaki&apos;s philosophy is defined by the way he responds to fear,&quot; Kosaka says. &quot;When a normal person encounters something that scares them they might try to run away. When Miyazaki encounters something he will be very brave and very bold and try to look them right in the eye. When life is hard in reality you still have to live up to high standards, to be proud. There is a saying we have that when a samurai has no food he will still use a toothpick. Miyazaki-san has that philosophy and hates anybody who isn&apos;t like that. He wouldn&apos;t have any characters like that in his movies.&quot; Amid the domestic controversy over The Wind Rises, there was a sense that Miyazaki had been out of step with contemporary Japan (He rarely does interviews). His movie was accused of preaching pacifism just as prime minister Shinzo Abe was looking to revise a pacifist clause out of the Japanese constitution. Miyazaki responded typically, devoting the entirety of Ghibli&apos;s house journal to a rebuke of militarism. It only earned him more rancour. Kosaka, meanwhile, observes that the young animators are not always as determined as Miyazaki to preserve the cel animation traditions that have made Ghibli distinct (&quot;For some people it&apos;s their dream job to work at Ghibli, for others they&apos;re not interested&quot;). Most talented young animators now head straight to Japan&apos;s gaming industry. If Ghibli and Miyazaki are so synonymous, can one survive without the other? Nick Park is one of the few animators who could be considered a peer; his Shaun The Sheep is graffitied on the wall of the Ghibli Museum&apos;s projection room. He says that Miyazaki&apos;s beliefs are not outmoded because they stem from a deeper place. &quot;I&apos;m not anti-technology, but he does remind you of the importance of the artist&apos;s hand, and a certain charm comes through in his work. His love of the art is there \u2013 and it&apos;s attractive, not mathematical. He has taken care about every shot and is enjoying the animation. Miyazaki is not afraid of wide-open spaces with nothing happening and wind in the clouds. This is refreshingly different from the Hollywood model and takes you to a different place inside yourself.&quot; That &quot;different place&quot; remains a distinct offering. With a fallow summer for the studio this year, domestic rivals still feel compelled to market themselves as the Ghibli alternative. Its international reach also continues to grow (the studio has just opened its first foreign office, in Hong Kong). On the day I visit, the Ghibli museum is host to a sizeable American school party. The 16-year-olds are all, without exception, on their phones. But those just slightly younger than them, those less concerned with looking cool perhaps, are rattling between the rooms wide-eyed and deep in conversation. Miyazaki&apos;s passion and imagination speaks directly to them, no matter the generational or geographical difference. It&apos;s that magic that&apos;s going to be missed.

Lotz has chosen to tell her story in the form of a non-fiction book by a journalist of the ordeal, jigsawing together a mix of interviews, an unfinished biography and even online messages slowly to fill out the disturbing details of what has happened since &quot;Black Thursday&quot; (the End Timers&apos; message catches on frighteningly quickly in her version of America). Lotz has previously written scary horror as one half of SL Grey, and she is skilled at piling on the dread and the paranoia, as looming black shapes on beds mutter: &quot;How could you let that thing in here?&quot; and as American investigators say things such as: &quot;Listen, Elspeth, this is going to sound as hokey as hell, but [his eyes] started to swim, like he was about to cry, only\u2026 Jesus\u2026 this is hard\u2026 they weren&apos;t filling with tears but with blood&quot; (OK, that last one&apos;s a bit corny).

Internal government briefing material seen by Guardian Australia suggests the Abbott government has told Shinzo Abe\u2019s Japanese government it wants the new thresholds for Japanese investment in Australian farms and rural businesses to be set at a fraction of the $1bn figure set for general investment. The material says the government has \u201creserved policy space\u201d to screen proposals for private Japanese investment in agricultural land at $15m, and agribusinesses at $53m. That would mirror the thresholds in the recently concluded trade pact with South Korea. So far the government has published only the general screening thresholds that will apply to investments in Australia by Japanese companies. Under the deal Tony Abbott struck in Tokyo last month, the screening threshold for future Japanese investment in \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d sectors will be raised from $248m to $1bn. Sensitive sectors in the Australia/Japan agreement include agriculture, media, telecommunications and defence-related industries. On farms and agribusinesses, documents released so far by the Australian government do not specify the investment thresholds that would trigger screening.  The lack of certainty about agricultural investment caused a degree of restiveness in Coalition ranks, given the FTA was largely given the thumbs down by farming groups such as the National Farmers Federation and the Cattle Council. The treatment of agriculture is politically sensitive in both countries. Japan historically has been fiercely protectionist of its agricultural sector. Australia has historically been at the forefront of efforts to achieve trade liberalisation, and its producers always want better market access for products such as beef and grains. Now the in-principle agreement has been reached, both countries will work on a legal text to conclude all the details, including the investment thresholds for sensitive sectors. The agreement is expected to be wrapped up by the end of this year, to take effect next year.

Assets and buzz were each graded out of 10; the numbers were added to produce a total score. (Scroll down for an interactive bar chart of the final ranking.) Although the research was not limited to English language results, the use of social media sites popular among western countries must be taken into account when digesting the list. In China, Renren and Weibo are used rather than Facebook and Twitter, which may go some way to explaining the poor showing of Shanghai, for example. Tokyo scores a buzz of just 2, again due partly to Japan using its own social media engines \u2013 yet Seoul does remarkably well on the same criteria.  \u201cThe western world is just not that in touch with the far east,\u201d says Ian Stephens of Saffron. \u201cTokyo remains, for most people, an alien place for an alien experience. [Its brand] is underperforming relative to its assets. Whereas Seoul&apos;s and Singapore&apos;s offerings are on a more global basis: visitors are very pleasantly surprised at what they find there, it&apos;s less &apos;foreign&apos; than they might have thought.  &quot;This brand list is all about how cities use their assets, how they do the best with what they have. Singapore, for example, is a transport hub and seems to be doing quite a lot with that basic thing.\u201d Mumbai and Mecca are two more examples of up-and-comers in the brand stakes, while European cities \u2013 with the exception of London and Paris \u2013 struggle. Venice isn&apos;t the only loser, just the most surprising. \u201cAll the European cities do relatively poorly, perhaps because there are so many crammed up against each other,\u201d says Stephens. On the whole, the results do show a clear correlation between asset strength and brand reputation. Cities hoping to buy themselves a bit of buzz should take this to heart. As Saffron founder Wally Olins, who died this month, liked to say: when it comes to brands, you can&apos;t just talk the talk, you have to walk the walk.

For ever. Most deserve their &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; label. Every so often, though, a novel rises from the grave to claim its belated fame. On 5 July last year, addressing the nation on the Today programme, Ian McEwan did a revival job on Stoner \u2013 a novel published to modest praise in 1965 and long out of print. John Williams&apos;s bleak, but exquisitely written, chronicle of a second-rate prof in a third-rate American university went on to become the 2013 novel of the year. What other dead and forgotten works would one dig up from the dusty vaults of the British Library? Everyone will have their own overdue for resurrection list: here&apos;s my top 10. Not all of them are what the critics would call &quot;great novels&quot; (a couple most certainly are) but they are, I can guarantee, great reads. And what more do you want from a work of fiction? 10. Nightmare Alley, William Lindsay Gresham, 1946      Nightmare Alley    Gresham killed himself in 1962, alone, in a one-night hotel room, his pocket full of business cards reading: &quot;No Address. No Phone. No Business. No Money. Retired.&quot; Gresham&apos;s novel popularised the term &quot;geeks&quot;. Forget Mark Zuckerberg. Gresham&apos;s grim story is about the carnival &quot;wild man&quot; (alias &quot;Geek&quot;), the luckless down-and-out employed to bite the heads off living chickens in travelling carnivals. Along with The Grapes of Wrath and They Shoot Horses, Don&apos;t They?, this is a great American Depression-era novel. Read and shudder. And relish. Keynote line: &quot;A third of life is spent unconscious and corpselike.&quot; 9. The Young Visiters, Daisy Ashford, 1919     The Young Visiters    Young Miss Ashford wrote novels after tea and before bedtime (a strict half-past six) for the delectation of her father, a Whitehall civil servant. Pater duly copied the stories out, retaining his clever daughter&apos;s quaint grammar and spelling and stunningly precocious plots picked up from romance novels left around by her older sisters. The narrative opens (imagine the ubiquitous &quot;[sic]&quot; after all the misspellings): &quot;Mr Salteena was an elderly man of 42 and was fond of asking peaple to stay with him. He had quite a young girl staying with him of 17 named Ethel Monticue. Mr Salteena had dark short hair and mustache and wiskers which were very black and twisty.&quot; Ethel has &quot;a blue velvit frock which had grown rarther short in the sleeves&quot; (so, one must suspect, did young Daisy have such a frock). She is given to &quot;sneery&quot; looks and a &quot;snappy tone&quot; when crossed. It gets funnier. And never fool yourself that nine-year-olds don&apos;t see what grownups get up to. Keynote line: &quot;My life will be sour grapes and ashes without you.&quot; (Mr Salteena, when Ethel marries elsewhere. The old lecher has to make do with one of the maids at Buckingham palace: &quot;a plesant girl of 18 with a round red face and rather stary eyes&quot;.) 8. The Book of Disquiet, Fernando Pessoa, 1991      The Book of Disquiet    Pessoa, a minor figure in the minor Lisbon literary world, kept body and soul together during his lifetime by office servitude. It was not a long lifetime. He died in 1935, aged 47, of cirrhosis. He was a &quot;discreet alcoholic&quot; \u2013 a discreet everything, in fact. In his remains was found a large trunk stuffed with 25,000 sheets of manuscript. The sheets were jigsawed together \u2013 rather like the Dead Sea scrolls \u2013 by a troupe of Pessoan disciples, who delivered it to the world half a century after the author&apos;s death. There is no plot, merely a thematically arranged series of world-weary aper\u00e7us and epigrams, of the deepest Portuguese gloom and existential perplexity \u2013 eg &quot;Who will save me from existence? It isn&apos;t death I want, or life, it&apos;s the other thing.&quot; The other thing? Answers, please, to a clerk mournfully drinking himself to death in Lisbon. Keynote line: &quot;All I ever asked of life was that it should pass me by without my even noticing it.&quot; 7. The Diary of a Mad Old Man, Junichiro Tanizaki, 1961      Diary of a Mad Old Man    Most of us read novels most intensely at two stages of life. First in early adolescence \u2013 when one lives with one&apos;s nose in a book. Secondly in late life, when one has time to &quot;get round&quot; to the books one has always promised oneself. I am struck in bookshops by racks, newly erected in the last decade, offering &quot;teen fiction&quot;. If walk-in, walk-through bookshops survive (not a certainty), I shall expect soon to see racks spring up labelled &quot;old guys&apos; novels&quot;. Junicho Tanizaki&apos;s (very) old-guy novel is set in 1950s Tokyo. The &quot;mad old man&quot;, Mr Utsugi, is in his late 70s. The author was in his mid-70s when he published the book, with only a couple of years to live. Utsugi is decaying \u2013 the last flickers of his life are &quot;mad&quot; sexuality: that flame never dies. In this terminal phase of his life, his geriatric lust is directed towards his daughter-in-law, who, in return for large amounts of cash, allows him to indulge his rampant foot fetishism on her tiny extremities. Grim and comic in tone, Tanizaki&apos;s novel does not once mention the second world war. Keynote line: &quot;I haven&apos;t the slightest desire to cling to life, yet as long as I live I cannot help feeling attracted to the opposite sex.&quot; 6. Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, Anne Tyler, 1982      Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant    There are novels so good that you pass them on to others to read. There are other novels so good that you want to keep them to yourself, as a kind of secret, like Silas Marner&apos;s gold under the floorboards. This is one for the floorboards. The novel takes the form of a mother&apos;s long flashback as she lies, blind, on her deathbed. She valiantly kept together what the world would think a happy American family. It wasn&apos;t. The Tull family&apos;s &quot;togetherness&quot; distils nothing but poison. The one amiable offspring, Ezra, sets up an eatery in the Tulls&apos; native Baltimore (Tyler&apos;s home territory) to which he gives the rueful name &quot;Homesick Restaurant&quot;. Their home is indeed sick. The last we see of Ezra, he may have cancer but he&apos;s afraid to go to the doctor in case it&apos;s cancer. Tyler believed this was her best novel. It&apos;s never, I think, quite received its critical due. Keynote line: &quot;You think we&apos;re a family. You think we&apos;re some jolly, situation-comedy family when we&apos;re particles, torn apart, torn all over the place and our mother was a witch.&quot; Ding dong.  5. Cockfighter, Charles Willeford, 1962      Cockfighter    Willeford achieved late-life fame with his Hoke Mosley crime novels \u2013 now regarded as classics of Miami noir. He himself regarded Cockfighter as his legacy book. Cockfighting (of which Willeford wholly approved) is presented as something archetypally manly (only male birds fight) and quintessentially American. &quot;As every cocker knows,&quot; the novel tells us, &quot;honest Abe Lincoln was once a cockpit referee.&quot; George Washington was a fan. The cockpit incarnates the American frontier spirit as symbolically as did the corrida for Hemingway. Cockfighting is illegal in the US, although it is still a very popular, particularly in the south. One closes the novel, almost wanting to see one of the horrible things. Keynote line: &quot;&apos;What matters is not the idea a man holds but the depth at which he holds it.&apos; Ezra Pound.&quot; (Cockfigther&apos;s epigraph). 4. The Ice House, Nina Bawden, 1983     The Ice House    This novel should carry a health warning for male readers. &quot;Read at your Discomfort, Men.&quot; Bawden&apos;s own, typically acidic, three-word summary was &quot;adultery in Islington&quot; \u2013 a joke on the scorned &quot;orgasm in Hampstead&quot; school of fiction. The main line of the plot is embroidered with subplots, all tending to the same jaundiced view about marriage and the visceral distaste which women (all of them, as we understand) feel for men. There is painfully lingering attention in the novel, for male readers, on the unaesthetic properties of the naked (but hirsute) male buttocks, unsightly paunches and general smelliness. Flesh of their flesh? Not for the missus. And the &quot;ice house&quot;? An image for the frigid prison that marriage with a man represents for every woman. Bawden raises female scorn to an art form. Keynote line: &quot;He was born second-rate.&quot; (They all are.) 3. The Dream of the Red Chamber, Cao Xueqin, 1792      Dream of the Red Chamber    This novel has been recommended as &quot;the best starting point for any understanding of Chinese psychology, culture and society&quot;. Mao instructed that it should be read five times. At twice the length of War and Peace, it is not a quick read (the Penguin Classics translation is split across five volumes, under the title The Story of the Stone). Nor is it very easy for occidental readers to get their heads round. It starts in heaven with a stone politely requesting passage to earth from a Taoist priest and a Buddhist monk. A child is duly born with a piece of jade in its mouth. The novel that ensues has a vast overarching narrative and a seething mass of episodes centred on some 600 characters \u2013 the population of a small town \u2013 and the up-and-down chronicle of two great clans. A strange and fascinating reading experience. You&apos;ll need five holidays, though, if it&apos;s your beach book. Keynote line: &quot;The Best Chinese Novel You&apos;ve Never Heard of.&quot; (John Minford, professor of Chinese literature) 2. Elective Affinities, Wolfgang von Goethe, 1809      Elective Affinities    This is not a novel that, on the face of it, has much going for it in the readability stakes. What the title means could be one of the tougher questions on University Challenge. The German is even more of a mouthful: Wahlverwandschaften. There&apos;s a nice surprise, however, for anyone who clambers through the titular barbed wire. What follows is a crystalline novella that poses a teasing everyday question: why do we fall in love with some people and not others? What &quot;chemistry&quot; is at work to create the sexual sympathies and antipathies which shape our lives? The plot of every Mills &amp; Boon romance is formulated in this novel with geometrical precision. Thomas Mann read Elective Affinities five times before embarking on the perverse compounds of paedophile love he chronicles in Death on Venice. One reading will convince you how good this novel is. Keynote line: &quot;Man is a true Narcissus; he delights to see his own image everywhere; and he spreads himself underneath the universe, like the amalgam behind the glass.&quot; 1. Oblomov, Ivan Goncharov, 1859     Oblomov    For my money (six shillings, when I first bought the Penguin Classic in 1957) the most enjoyable, and saddest, novel ever written. In the late 1940s \u2013 a peculiarly frantic period of British life \u2013 the critic VS Pritchett wrote a witty piece revolving around the paradox of what he called &quot;the Russian day&quot;. It must have been longer than our 24 GMT hours, Pritchett speculated. Russian upper classes seemed \u2013 if Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov and Turgenev were to be believed \u2013 to have so much burdensome time on their hands. Clocks moved slower; weeks dragged; months crawled under the vast Russian skies and across the endless steppes. Life, for the Sashas, Pierres and Myshkins, seemed permanently on hold. Goncharov&apos;s novel is set in the period shortly before the emancipation of the serfs \u2013 a period in which, as in the antebellum American south (&quot;Peel me a grape, Beulah&quot;), serfdom has rotted all willpower in the serf-owning class. Goncharov eponymously calls the Russian disease &quot;Oblomovitis&quot;. Oblomov is &quot;a gentleman by birth and a collegiate secretary by rank&quot; who could more accurately be called an upper-class layabout. Lying about is, in fact, his main occupation in life. He can barely be bothered to get out of bed (where he&apos;s discovered as the story opens), unless it&apos;s to lumber across to his sofa and pass the day there, dressing-gowned, doing nothing other than wait for bedtime to roll round. He lives on the revenue of an estate, a thousand miles away from St Petersburg. The estate is worm-holed by parasites more energetic than he can be bothered to be. Oblomov does not care. No landlord is more absentee. The novel describes, at extraordinary length, the Oblomovian day. He eats voraciously and unmercifully nags his luckless serf, Zakhar, who has &quot;boundless loyalty&quot; to the master whom nonetheless (like everyone else) he cheats whenever he can. Friends call. Oblomov never calls back. This &quot;sublime sluggard&quot;, as Pritchett calls him, is contemptible but lovable, and even \u2013 in a perverse way \u2013 admirable. He embodies &quot;the poetry of procrastination&quot;. In the climax (so to miscall it) of Goncharov&apos;s narrative \u2013 after nothing happening apart from gorging, loafing, bickering, not working and not marrying (his friend gets the girl, Olga) \u2013 Oblomov is found, years on, now living in reduced circumstances in the country, still loafing, still scoffing, still serenely at peace with his world. He is stuffed, nowadays, on homelier fare than in St Petersburg, by his housekeeper, Agafya, who treats him rather as French peasants might do a particularly valued Strasbourg goose. Oblomov has a stroke and is paralysed (had he ever been anything else?) and five slow years later dies, well short of the statutory three-score-and-10; although doubtless his lifespan felt positively Methuselean to him. Boredom makes life longer. Oblomov&apos;s departure happens off-stage. One cannot call it an &quot;event&quot;. In a sense it can barely be said to happen. So torpid is his life in his final years that it is indistinguishable from rigor mortis. He drifts out of life as he drifted into it, and through it, leaving nothing behind him but a word, &quot;Oblomovitis&quot;. His monument. The novel can be read as a parable of Russia in terminal pre-revolutionary decay. Or it can be read as high comedy (which is how Spike Milligan travestied it in his long-running 1960s stage version). Or one can read Oblomov as a profound allegory of the human condition. &quot;Oblomov? C&apos;est moi.&quot; Keynote line: VS Pritchett catches the charm of this novel, and of the long-day fiction of Goncharov and his ilk. It can stand as the novel&apos;s keynote line: &quot;In all those Russian novels we seem to hear a voice saying: &apos;The meaning of life? One day all that will be revealed to us \u2013 probably on a Thursday.&apos;&quot; \u2022 How To Be Well Read: A Guide to 500 Great Novels and a Handful of Literary Curiosities, by John Sutherland, will be published by Random House on 8 May, \u00a320.

Best known for his quasi-documentary films on Irish peace activist Bernadette Devlin and ill-fated car-maker John DeLorean, Duncan Campbell is nominated for his film installation in the Scottish pavilion at last year&apos;s Venice Biennale, It for Others. Campbell&apos;s film was concocted from a strange mix of footage: African masks and other artefacts, images of perfume bottles and snack packaging, and shots from a dance piece by British choreographer Michael Clark in which the performers, shot from above, contort themselves into the shapes of equations. Campbell&apos;s film was not without its pleasures, but was terribly long. It lost me somewhere. Bravely, and perhaps unwisely, he paired this work with a projection of Chris Marker and Alain Resnais&apos; 1953 film Les Statues Meurent Aussi (Statues Also Die), about the commodification of African sculpture.

Except to note the denial of pleasure in the censored images, and the sensual image-grabbing of the underwater shots, I didn&apos;t make much of this either. Richards, for me, is an unknown quantity. I have never understood Tris Vonna-Michell&apos;s melange of film and video footage, photographs and objects, which often entail a peripatetic quest: looking for obscure French artist Henri Chopin; revisiting the sites of his own adolescent rites of passage (including a trip to Japan where he slept rough for a while); and travelling to Detroit or Leipzig (where Vonna-Michell destroyed his entire archive of photographs and student work in a shredder). This comes together in his films, photography, objects, live performance and concrete poetry \u2013 and takes a lot of unpacking.

He&apos;s a cuddly fellow with avian roots, eyes like dinner plates and a beak fixed in a permanent smile. Yet most Japanese wouldn&apos;t recognise him if he went up and gave them a big hug. But Moppy has reason to count himself lucky because he is expected to escape a cull planned by authorities in Osaka of the region&apos;s most unproductive promotional mascots. It is a move certain to cause a ruckus in character-mad Japan. Japan&apos;s eclectic, and often bizarre, mascots \u2013 known as yuru-kyara (laidback characters) \u2013 are put to work promoting everything from local cuisine and sightseeing spots to tax offices, the police and military, and even prisons. The country&apos;s mascot industry is worth billions of dollars a year in merchandise sales, with Kumamon, an affable black bear who promotes the southern prefecture of Kumamoto, by far the most successful.     Kumamon, the official mascot of Kumamoto prefecture, entertains Japanese children.  Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun via Getty Images    Faced with the realisation that its own mascots don&apos;t come close to matching Kumamon&apos;s celebrity status, the Osaka prefectural government is to weed out the most ineffectual and push Moppy as its core representative. The prefecture is home to no fewer than 45 mascots, most of whom go about their business in near-obscurity. Last year, 13 did not appear at a single public event or hand out merchandise, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Osaka&apos;s array of yuru-kyara includes Kushitan, who promotes a type of Osaka cuisine, and Makki, who represents the town of Matsubara. There is no suggestion that either are among those earmarked for early retirement. The debate over how to humanely dispense with less successful mascots has gone right to the top of the Osaka prefectural administration. &quot;As I have said many times, we have too many characters,&quot; Osaka&apos;s governor, Ichiro Matsui, said recently. &quot;People do not know what they are promoting or what policy they are trying to raise awareness of.&quot;     Makki and Kushitan    Finding a new character able to compete with the likes of Kumamon and Funassyi, who promotes the fruit-producing city of Funabashi near Tokyo, must be a priority, Matsui added. &quot;We are all being beaten by this character. We&apos;ve got to do something.&quot; The task is expected to fall to Moppy, who is inspired by a bird native to the Osaka area and made his first public appearance in 1997. However, he finished a lowly 1,072 in a popularity vote for Japan&apos;s 1,580-member family of promotional mascots held last year. Matsui&apos;s solution is to give Moppy a family and, unusually for a mascot, a voice. &quot;I think it is a good idea for Moppy to have a family,&quot; he said. &quot;Moppy Junior could help promote child-rearing policies and Moppy&apos;s wife could help with women&apos;s employment issues.&quot; Not all Osaka officials share Matsui&apos;s enthusiasm for a yuru-kyara cull. &quot;Each department devoted energy to creating the mascots, and each mascot is loved by department officials,&quot; the Asahi quoted Yasuyuki Ogawa, the prefecture&apos;s vice-governor, as saying. &quot;I hope that will be taken into consideration.&quot; Experts point out that mascots, like football managers, should be given time to find their feet. &quot;Kumamon was not necessarily popular from the very beginning,&quot; Noriko Nakano, of the Japan Local Character Association, told AFP.

Photograph: Adam Rose/Disney Channel via Getty Images    America&apos;s next top TV actor? Why, Michelle Obama of course. The first lady has been doing the rounds on US television recently and is certainly notching up the cameos. Her latest appearance was in popular US show Nashville where she appeared via a taped video link at a charity concert organised by Connie Britton&apos;s character Rayna Jaymes. Only a few weeks ago, Obama was seen on the Parks and Recreation season finale and prior to that she made a guest appearance on the Disney sitcom Jessie. She was also seen poking fun at her role as America\u2019s health cop in a Veep skit shown at the White House Correspondents&apos; Dinner. Obama is usually on-message in her appearances, promoting her Let&apos;s Move campaign \u2013 a programme designed to solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation. Gerry Adams is released but the row over his detention goes on     Gerry Adams at a news conference after his release following four days of police questioning. Photograph: Paul Hackett/Reuters    After four days of questioning over the notorious 1972 killing of Jean McConville and alleged links with the IRA, Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams was released without charge on Sunday. But the row over his detention goes on. Michael McConville, one of the murdered widow&apos;s children, said that his family&apos;s fight for justice would continue after Adams, 65, was freed. McConville described how he had been warned by Adams of a backlash if he released the names of those he believed were responsible. Adams, who denies any involvement in the killing, criticised the police&apos;s handling of his arrest on Wednesday, which also triggered a bitter political row at Stormont. Sinn F\u00e9in accused an &quot;anti-peace process rump&quot; within the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) of orchestrating the detention with the aim of damaging the party ahead of European and local government elections later this month. We should be worried about polio     An Afghan child refugee receives a polio vaccine in Pakistan. Photograph: Muhammed Muheisen/AP    The spread of polio is an international public health emergency, the World Health Organisation said this week. Outbreaks of the virus in Asia, Africa and the Middle East were an \u201cextraordinary event\u201d needing an international response, the agency declared, naming Pakistan, Cameroon and Syria as the countries posing the greatest risk of exporting polio to other countries in 2014. Already, 68 cases of the virus, which is often spread via contaminated food and water, has been recorded by the WHO in 2014 by 30 April \u2013 up from 24 in the same period last year. The organisation also advised citizens of affected countries to carry a vaccination certificate when travelling abroad. Jobseekers are to be told they must take zero-hours jobs     Workers at a Hovis bakery protest against the company's introduction of zero-hours contracts. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    Only last week, the ONS revealed that the number of UK jobs offered on zero-hours contracts was 1.4m. Now plans have been revealed, via a letter from Conservative minister Esther McVey, for jobseekers to face losing their benefits for three months or more if they refuse to take zero-hours contracts under the new universal credit system. It is the first time that benefit claimants risk sanctions if they do not apply for and accept certain zero-hours jobs \u2013 currently those claiming jobseekers&apos; allowance do not have to apply for zero-hours contracts and do not face penalties for turning them down. More than one in 10 employers are using zero-hours contracts, with the figure rising to almost half of all employers in the tourism, catering and food sector. Police are trialling wearing cameras     Metropolitan police officers with body-worn cameras. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA    Police in 10 London boroughs were on Thursday given body-worn cameras in a \u00a3815,000 trial billed as the world&apos;s biggest. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, has admitted the cameras could have helped in the case of the shooting of Mark Duggan, which sparked riots in England in 2012 \u2013 there was conflicting evidence over whether Duggan was holding a gun when he was shot. The commissioner said that if officers regularly failed to switch on their cameras when needed to, they would face disciplinary action. Five hundred cameras \u2013 each roughly the size of a small cigarette packet \u2013 have been introduced to officers across London. A number of forces, including Hampshire, Staffordshire and Humberside, are trialling or planning to introduce the cameras. &apos;Too cute&apos; exists, even in Japan     Kumamon, the official mascot of Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan. Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun via Getty Imag    It turns out there is such a thing as &quot;too cute&quot;. Dozens of cuddly mascots in western Japan are facing the chop after a local authority found that the public does not recognise them. Thousands of state-funded yuru-kyara, or laidback characters, were created across Japan by police, traffic safety officials, libraries, tax offices and even jails in an attempt to inform the public of serious messages. However, some simply are not up to the job. The governor of Osaka, Ichiro Matsui, told reporters last month: \u201cAs I have said many times, we have too many characters.\u201d He is ready to cull the cuteness and reduce the 45 yuru-kyara of Osaka for a trimmer and hopefully more recognisable offering, which he hopes will be able to compete with the success of a pear-fairy mascot of Funabashi near Tokyo. \u201cWe are all being beaten by this character,\u201d he said. \u201cWe&apos;ve got to do something.\u201d The BBC has a major headache after Patten leaves     Lord Patten, who has stepped down as BBC Trust chairman.

His departure leaves vice-chairwoman Diane Coyle in place temporarily while a new candidate for the \u00a3110,000-a-year job is lined up. It surely can&apos;t be the most enticing of job adverts though; Patten&apos;s successor will have the (unenviable) task of steering the BBC through possible Scottish independence, the general election and lead negotiations to renew the BBC&apos;s royal charter and licence fee \u2013 just as some want to decriminalise fee evasion. The former Sony boss Sir Howard Stringer is among those tipped to succeed the Conservative peer. Conservative MP Rob Wilson, a longstanding critic, said Patten&apos;s controversial reign had again proved that the BBC Trust model of governance failed to hold management to account and &quot;lacked credibility and democratic legitimacy&quot;.

Much to the disappointment of those hoping for an action replay of the heady summer of 2012, the International Olympic Committee has rejected as &quot;totally unfeasible&quot; claims that London could step in for troubled Rio to host the 2016 Olympics. A report in the London Evening Standard has claimed that the capital had been secretly sounded out as a last-ditch replacement for Rio, whose preparations were damned as the &quot;worst ever&quot; by an IOC vice-president last month. But the suggestion was immediately knocked down by the IOC in the strongest terms. &quot;This is simply a non-starter \u2013 totally without foundation and totally unfeasible. Not a shred of truth,&quot; said a spokeswoman. Another IOC source said the story was &quot;total rubbish&quot;. When John Coates, the Australian IOC vice-president, sounded the alarm about Rio&apos;s troubled preparations \u2013 derailed by next month&apos;s World Cup and delays caused by political infighting \u2013 high-level IOC sources insisted there was no chance that another city could be asked to step in. &quot;Two years out, we have to work with Rio. There is honestly no plan B,&quot; said one. Others joked that the solution might be to ask Tokyo to host the Games in 2016 and allow Rio to stage the 2020 Games, given that the Japanese city was already better prepared than the first ever South American host. There are various practical things preventing London stepping in to host the Games, as it did previously in 1908 when Mount Vesuvius erupted, forcing the Games to be relocated from Italy at short notice. Not only is the stadium in the midst of a \u00a3200m reconstruction to prepare it for its new tenants, West Ham, but residents have begun to move into the complex of 2,800 flats that the athletes&apos; village has been converted into. Meanwhile, the &quot;wings&quot; that housed 15,000 spectators during the Games have been removed from Zaha Hadid&apos;s Aquatics Centre and the temporary venues around the Olympic Park have been demolished to make way for housing and play areas. &quot;The situation is critical on the ground,&quot; said Coates, who was later forced to tone down his comments amid fears that they would be counterproductive and antagonise the Brazilian authorities. He added: &quot;We have become very concerned. They are not ready in many, many ways. We have to make it happen and that is the IOC&apos;s approach. You can&apos;t walk away from this.&quot; Experienced IOC executive director Gilbert Felli has been dispatched to Rio to lead a troubleshooting team and attempt to refocus on the most pressing issues, including concerns over infrastructure and accommodation. The most pressing worry about venues concerns the Deodoro cluster of eight temporary venues, which is some way from the centre of Rio. International Rugby Board president Brett Gosper told the Guardian this week that he and other federation chiefs were very concerned about the amount of work that still had to be done. The IOC has been working with organisers to identify the most serious concerns and hopes plans will gain momentum once the World Cup is finished. Rio 2016 organisers insist the recent announcement of a $10.8bn (\u00a36.4bn) budget for infrastructure and legacy projects, 43% of which will be met by private investors, together with the launch of the tender process for the Deodoro venues, are clear signs of progress."}, {"sentences": ["I say we remove ourselves to a calm, quiet place and concentrate on another Japanese film-maker working in the days when Tokyo&apos;s skies teemed with the gargantuan bestiary that came in Godzilla&apos;s wake."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-12T05:00:00Z", "title": "Yasujiro Ozu: like Austen, he tells the same satisfying story again and again", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/12/yasujiro-ozu-japanese-minimalist-autumn-afternoon", "article": "Godzilla will no doubt scoff the global box office this weekend, and the roaring and gnashing of teeth on screen will find its analogue in the chaos of online debate between irate 1954 Gojira purists and whichever aficionados of the 1998 Emmerich-Devlin remake dare to reveal themselves. I say we remove ourselves to a calm, quiet place and concentrate on another Japanese film-maker working in the days when Tokyo&apos;s skies teemed with the gargantuan bestiary that came in Godzilla&apos;s wake. Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s last movie, An Autumn Afternoon (1962), is one of the most sublime swansongs in the history of cinema, and confirms my belief that the best way to approach Ozu is the same way the Japanese read poetry: start at the end and work backwards. That&apos;s because Ozu&apos;s career combines his growing formal and artistic confidence with an opposing urge to simplify, to strip everything down to an austerely gorgeous minimum, and deny himself the technical comforts of the film stylist. The stationary thigh-high camera, always with the 50mm lens; the rigorously segmented framing; the carefully, even obsessively layered depth of field. And every gesture, every dip of the head or raised chin, every sip of tea or sake or Sapporo \u2013 all is choreographed to the millimetre. For the decade of masterpieces that preceded An Autumn Afternoon, Ozu foreswore almost all technical innovation. With the exception of colour on six late features, there was not a single new formal-technical element in his movies after 1950. He wasn&apos;t adding, he was consciously subtracting. Thus when you work backwards through his career, the story becomes one of addition, enrichment, and after the exquisite plainsong of the later work, his early &quot;excesses&quot; suddenly seem hugely audacious and exciting. The first time I saw I Was Born, But\u2026 (1932), I was astonished to see majestic tracking shots and emotionally loaded forward-dolly movements, all long since winnowed away by Ozu in his search for formal exactitude and emotional precision. Ozu is anything but dry. His nearest (distant) familiar equivalent is Jane Austen. Both deal with families, fathers and finances, daughters marriageable or not, and life&apos;s disappointments. Both essentially tell the same perfectly satisfying story again and again, each with an abiding, accepting wisdom about human relationships. Get yourself into Ozu&apos;s oeuvre and you&apos;ll be eagerly asking: who&apos;ll be the meddlesome aunt this time round (it&apos;s always Haruko Sugimura), and who&apos;s the daughter&apos;s mischievous best friend (ditto the imperishable Chikage Awashima)? And then you&apos;re addicted. The difference? Austen wrote six novels and change. Ozu made 50 or more movies. You have the rest of your life for this man&apos;s work, and it will take you that long.

The news, which was first reported in April, was confirmed at a press conference in Chicago on Tuesday. Speaking to the Guardian before the event, USA Rugby chief executive Nigel Melville said: \u201cThis is more than just a game between two teams. It&apos;s an opportunity for us to showcase the world champions in our sport, in our domestic market.\u201d Questions remain about the strength of team the US will be able to field. The game, which will be played a week before the All Blacks begin their European tour against England at Twickenham, falls outside the International Rugby Board&apos;s window for mandatory player release. \u201cWe want to put out the best team we possibly can,\u201d said Melville, \u201cbut we realise there are some restrictions under [IRB] regulation nine. We&apos;ll do our best.\u201d Ordinarily, the Eagles can call on a number of professionals employed by European clubs, including the highly rated Northampton forward Samu Manoa and Leicester wing Blaine Scully. A spokesman for the English clubs&apos; governing body told the Guardian: \u201cPremiership Rugby clubs release players as per the requirements of IRB regulation nine for international matches and training.\u201d Clubs are not necessarily free to release players at their own discretion. In December, Premiership Rugby fined Northampton \u00a360,000 ($101,000) after the club allowed the Lions wing George North to play for Wales against Australia outside the window. Given the unique nature of the Chicago game, however, USA Rugby and the game&apos;s sponsor, the New York-headquartered insurance giant AIG, will hope agreement can be reached. On Tuesday, Daniel Glantz, head of global sponsorship for the AIG, told the Guardian: \u201cIt&apos;s exciting. We want to make sure this is a really good game to be presented to the US audience.\u201d         Highlights of the USA's 29-19 defeat by the Maori All Blacks    The All Blacks, who are also sponsored by AIG, have been considering a game in the US for some time. Last November they played a similar Test in Tokyo, beating Japan 54-6. The same month, NZRU chief executive Steve Tew told a New Zealand website, stuff.co.nz: \u201cIt would be very helpful for us to play in the American market.\u201d AIG will work around the game to introduce rugby to schools in the Chicago area. Also last November, an Eagles team without most of its overseas professionals lost 29-19 to the Maori All Blacks \u2013 New Zealand&apos;s de facto second team \u2013 at a sold-out PPL Park in Philadelphia. The Eagles&apos; standout performer, the No8 Cam Dolan, subsequently swapped Atlanta&apos;s Life University for a contract in England with Northampton. In June the Eagles will play Scotland at another Major League Soccer venue, BBVA Compass Stadium in Houston, which has hosted summer defeats by Italy (30-10 in 2012) and Ireland (15-12 in 2013). The Ireland game attracted a record crowd for a game of rugby in the US, of 20,181. The All Blacks game will be broadcast live by NBC. Soldier Field \u2013 which is available as its owners, the Chicago Bears, have a bye week \u2013 has a capacity of 61,500.  \u201cWe&apos;d love to sell out,\u201d said Melville, \u201cand I think the sports-mad Chicago community are going to want to go. It&apos;s an iconic stadium, a beautiful stadium and I think the local people will embrace the game and get behind it.&quot; \u201cCould we sell it out? That would be fantastic, but we hope to set a record crowd for rugby in North America and we&apos;ll see what comes with that.\u201d Concerns over a potential mismatch will linger even if the Eagles are at full strength and the All Blacks field fringe players. In November, the All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said: \u201cWhat approach we take to that game, we&apos;ll have to see where we&apos;re sitting.&quot; The All Blacks are the reigning world champions and No1 team on the IRB rankings. In 2013, they won each of the 14 international games they played \u2013 a feat unmatched in the modern era. The Eagles, who last month qualified for the 2015 World Cup in England with a sometimes fraught victory over Uruguay, are ranked 18th, at the bottom of the second tier of nations. In 2013, they lost to Canada (three times), Ireland, Tonga, Japan and Fiji before beating Russia and Georgia. The Eagles and the All Blacks have only met three times, and not since the 1991 World Cup. The All Blacks won that game 46-6 at Gloucester. It has been claimed that the 1913 All Blacks were responsible for the death of rugby as a major American sport. In a 12-match tour, the New Zealanders scored 457 points and conceded only one try, and won the only international of the trip 51-3. In the only other game between the two countries, in San Diego in 1980, a New Zealand XV won 53-6. Despite such an ominous record, which will no doubt weigh heavier on American minds should key players not be made available, Melville remained upbeat. \u201cThat&apos;s a significant thing for rugby in America,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone who knows rugby, or plays it, or is involved with American rugby in any way will be very excited, but it&apos;s also an event for American people to see [the All Blacks] and realise that this isn&apos;t just a pastime.&quot; \u201cThis is a global, incredibly athletic sport played by some tremendous athletes with tremendous skills. It&apos;s a complex sport, it&apos;s got everything the American sports fan loves.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["We are a long way from the man-in-a-rubber-suit who wobbled through a model Tokyo in the 1954 original."], "tags": ["Godzilla", "Culture", "Film", "Elizabeth Olsen", "Bryan Cranston", "Noah", "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-15T12:00:06Z", "title": "Godzilla is the latest blockbuster to punish the sins of mankind", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/15/godzilla-2014-elizabeth-olson-bryan-cranston-noah", "article": "My favorite quote from the trades last week was, &quot;Warner Bros has avoided making Godzilla out to be a monster movie.&quot; What else are they going to make it out to be?

Taylor-Johnson is a physical actor who likes to storm into a room and pace its four corners like a lion, but when faced with the sight of two giant nuclear mutants treating masonry like meringue, he wears an expression of mild consternation, as if remembering he\u2019d left the oven on. He spends most of the movie trying to catch a train to get back to Olsen, but we couldn\u2019t care less. Unlike King Kong, this was never a story scaled with a human adversary in mind. \u201cWhat are we supposed to do?\u201d asks Navy Commander David Straithairn. \u201cSit back and watch?\u201d         When even Walter White throws a hissy fit, you know things are bad    Well, actually yes. What makes Godzilla such a curious summer blockbuster is it rootedness in failure \u2013 specifically the feeling of stunned national impotence that gripped Japan in the aftermath of the second world war. Cultural studies professors like to peel back the keloid-scarred skin of the series to reveal the lurking atomic bomb subtext lurking underneath, but there\u2019s no \u201csubtext\u201d about it. That\u2019s what Godzilla was about. It\u2019s the text. \u201cThe theme of the film from the beginning was the terror of the bomb,\u201d said producer and Godzilla creator Tanaka Tomoyuki. Passing through the ruins of Hiroshima upon his repatriation to Japan, the 1954 film\u2019s director Honda Ishuro noted \u201ca fear the earth was already coming to an end\u201d. He filled his movie with visions that directly summoned the spectres of Nagasaki and Hiroshima: families pulling cart-loads of possessions, children being relocated in army trucks, hordes of injured refugees, churches of widows and orphans, hospitals overflown with the dead and the dying, the camera lingering on a little girl her eyes glazed in shock whose irradiated body sends the geiger counter off the scale.  \u201cGodzilla functioned not simply as a figure of war incarnate or a metaphorical admonition of nuclear annihilation, but also became a reproachful symbol embodying the spirit of Japan\u2019s war dead,\u201d writes William Tsutsui in his book Godzilla on My Mind: Fifty Years of the King of the Monsters. Very little of this, needless to say, made it through into the bowdlerized, American edit, which smoothed over the moral crisis of radiation with the calming tones of Raymond Burr recasting Godzilla as just another monster on the loose, recalled to the screen again and again for what amounted to prolonged bouts of monster-on-monster pro-wrestling. Mankind was relegated to the status of stupefied observer, like those cavemen that cowered in the corner of Ray Harryhausen epics while the dinosaurs duked it out above.  Edwards has more than honored the spirit of the original. Those hospitals are now filled with Americans and tended to by Elizabeth Olsen, while refugees collect in giant sports stadiums that recall the aftermath of Katrina. The American psyche wold appear to be in roughly the same state of disrepair as that of Japan in 1954. We\u2019re ready for Godzilla in a way we weren\u2019t in 1998, when Roland Emmerich rolled out his remake. If the cycle of disaster movies that gripped audiences in the 1990s were notable for their jocular oops-apocalypse tone \u2013 \u201cHa ha! It&apos;s the wonder of nature, baby!\u201d boomed Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as tornadoes ripped up the south in Jan De Bont\u2019s Twister \u2013 our contemporary variants are joke-free zones in which mankind isn\u2019t just threatened with extinction. We&apos;re told we deserve it. Not only do we bring our own nuclear doom upon our heads in Godzilla, but in a few weeks&apos; time, we stand in the dock once again, indicted for crimes against the primate in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. And this just a few Sundays after God annihilated the Earth on account of our wickedness in Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Noah. \u201cThe wickedness is not just in them, it\u2019s in all of us,\u201d insisted Russell Crowe\u2019s prophet. \u201cIt had to be what He wanted \u2013 a world without men. You see that, don\u2019t you?\u201d   The right went into its usual tizzy over Aronofsky\u2019s film, with Glenn Beck saying, \u201cit\u2019s just so pro-animal and anti-human, and I mean strongly anti-human,\u201d but for once, the nut fringe was basically right. The blockbuster has finally gone post-human. The Godzilla movies always tilted audience sympathy towards the monster, of course, but as Edwards&apos; lizard takes a bow and slips into the ocean once more at the end of the film, I felt something else: a nip of the old Avatar blues.

He called for a review of how Japan interprets its pacifist constitution to allow its military to participate in conflicts beyond its borders for the first time since the end of the second world war. In an apparent bid to address concerns in China and other parts of Asia where memories of Japan&apos;s wartime conduct remain strong, he said Japan would never again become &quot;a country that wages war&quot;. China, which is involved in a dispute with Japan over ownership of the Senkaku islands, which are known as the Diaoyu islands to the Chinese, is concerned by the prospect of a more assertive Japanese military. A foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said China had &quot;every reason to be highly vigilant on Japan&apos;s true intentions and its future development&quot;. She added: &quot;We urge Japan to respect the legitimate and reasonable security concerns of countries in the region, adhere to the path of peaceful development, earnestly face up to and reflect on history, and play a constructive role in regional peace and stability.&quot; Abe believes that the constitution, compiled by US occupation officials after the war, unfairly restricts Japan&apos;s ability to exercise its right to collective self-defence, or come to the aid of an ally under attack. Article 9 of the constitution, which has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize, renounces war as a means of settling international disputes and limits Japan&apos;s military to a purely defensive posture. Successive Tokyo governments have interpreted this to mean that Japan can only respond with force to acts of aggression against its territory and that it cannot fight alongside the US and other allies in overseas conflicts. Abe must now gain the support of his party&apos;s junior coalition partner, a Buddhist-backed party with a pacifist tradition, whose votes in the upper house he will need to push through new legislation, allowing Japan to reinterpret the constitution. While Barack Obama has recently voiced support for Japan playing a more active role in its security alliance with the US, the Japanese public is divided. Recent polls show a majority of voters oppose Japan&apos;s involvement in collective defence. One group of women has threatened to go on a &quot;sex strike&quot; to punish any man who supports Abe&apos;s move. In a report submitted to Abe a panel of advisers said Chinese activity in the South China Sea and East China Sea, and North Korean nuclear weapons meant the time had come to consider reinterpreting the constitution. The report said: &quot;We have reached a situation in which we cannot sufficiently maintain our country&apos;s peace and security or realise peace and prosperity of the region and international society under the current interpretation of the constitution.&quot; Scenarios that could prompt Japan to exercise collective self-defence included an attack on US navy vessels in or near Japanese waters, or the launch of a ballistic missile towards the US, the report said. Analysts said the public was right to be worried by Abe&apos;s attempts to remove constitutional restraints on military action. &quot;Abe is an advocate of changing Japan&apos;s postwar political regime \u2013 a liberal democracy guided by the principles of the constitution and its moderate pacifism,&quot; said Yasuo Hasebe, a professor of constitutional law at Waseda University in Tokyo. &quot;Conservatism means to preserve the prudence established over decades, but Abe is trying to dismantle the careful approach Japan has taken and lots of people are worried by that.&quot; Jiro Yamaguchi, a political scientist at Hosei University in Tokyo, said the lack of an effective opposition in parliament made it more likely that Abe would succeed: &quot;There are no big elections for another couple of years and no institutional barriers to [Abe&apos;s cabinet] changing its interpretation of the constitution. At the same time, the cabinet&apos;s general approval rating is still quite high, so I think Abe believes he can pursue his [constitutional reform] agenda even though the public is against it.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The 1954 movie Gojira, about a sea monster summoned from the deep by nuclear tests to lay waste to Tokyo was a potent myth and a brilliant, Swiftian satire."], "tags": ["Godzilla", "Thriller", "Action and adventure", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-15T13:59:00Z", "title": "Godzilla review \u2013 big, scary monsters but no bite in satire-stripped remake", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/15/godzilla-review-scary-monsters-boring-humans", "article": "Godzilla is back, for the first time in English since Roland Emmerich's blockbuster in 1998. The terrifying gigantic lizard has re-emerged from the oceans to menace the Pacific Rim in its entirety, sending everything flying in a&nbsp;shower of pixels. British director Gareth Edwards supervises some colossal creature-feature effects, but the human beings are on fantastically dull form and the storyline is a muddled and supercilious affair in which Godzilla may or not be the villain, fighting two other lesser CGI beasts. \nOf course, Godzilla has form in battling other monsters, but for me, it&nbsp;puts the humans in danger of being mere collateral damage, looking and feeling irrelevant in this great big skyscraper-wrecking punch-up of the mega-behemoths. More exasperatingly, the anti-nuclear satire of the original Japanese movie has been insidiously softened. In this film, it's not at all clear that nuclear power is really to blame for the terrifying eruption. This Godzilla is sitting on the nuke fence. \nGodzilla, like James Bond, was a 1950s fantasy phenomenon which grew out of national anxiety. The 1954 movie Gojira, about a sea monster summoned from the deep by nuclear tests to lay waste to Tokyo was a potent myth and a brilliant, Swiftian satire. The Brobdingnagian lizard allowed the Japanese to remember and reimagine the monstrous nuclear destruction of the war without the shame of military defeat, and then to confront the whole world with it: Godzilla told us that the nuclear age was not scientific or technological, but irrational and uncontrollable, a grotesque symptom of hubris, with the potential to amplify the smallest spasms of aggression to gigantic levels of annihilation. \nThis new Godzilla erupts from a modern catastrophe involving a Japanese nuclear power station that resembles Fukushima. Or does it? A strange narrative sleight of hand associates Godzilla with nuclear calamity but muddies the actual causal relationship. There's a new slant on that black-and-white newsreel footage of 1950s nuclear tests, which is ingenious, but weirdly comes close to making the nukes the heroes. It seems the monsters may fortuitously \"feed on\" nuclear energy, but the mighty blast of a good old-fashioned A-bomb might be what's needed to get rid of them. Or we could let Godzilla do&nbsp;the job and become bystanders. \nAaron Taylor-Johnson plays a young soldier, Ford Brody \u2013 a name Douglas Adams would have been proud to have invented. He is haunted by a personal demon, a big lizard of emotional pain lurking in the ocean of memory. Fifteen years earlier, his dad, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston), was involved at the quasi-Fukushima disaster, where he was a top nuclear scientist, working with a single-minded intensity that threatened his marriage to Sandra (a slightly preposterous role for Juliette Binoche). Now Cranston has become a lonely conspiracy theorist, obsessed with what the authorities are covering up. This brings him and Ford into contact with the existing top nuclear scientists, Dr Serizawa, played by Ken Watanabe \u2013 inevitably wasted in this bland role \u2013 and his assistant, Vivienne, played by&nbsp;Sally Hawkins, who does a bit of frowning, nodding and stammering like a character in a Mike Leigh film. \nSo what are they up against? Well, at&nbsp;first, the demon from the depths is not Godzilla himself but something the&nbsp;army is calling a MUTO \u2013 a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism. (Massive? Isn't that what Godzilla was supposed to be?) Unlike Godzilla, they don't get a name, just this acronym. The MUTO looks like a spider-pterodactyl with a face like one of the eagles atop New York's Chrysler Building, and&nbsp;there's more than one of them \u2013 one has what looks like a womb full of&nbsp;glowing eggs, or possibly a huge scrotum fill of glowing sperm. They could breed. Godzilla couldn't have turned up at a more dramatic moment. So should the US army blast all three of them to hell? Or gamble on Godzilla's potential for decency and let him deal with the MUTOs \u2013 which would be the ecologically correct, giant-lizard-hugging thing to do? \nIt all gets very tiresome, with dispiriting hints of Pacific Rim and the lumbering Transformers movies. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, so likable in the Kick-Ass films, is here dull and slow-moving beefcake. There's an awful moment when he hears the MUTO roar from afar and does an am-dram face and slooow turn, as if to say: \"Oh my God, that's not a towering lizard behind me is it?\" His demure wife, Elle (Elizabeth Olsen), is a hospital doctor, which means she doesn't get to do anything more than look fetching in green scrubs and watch the monster on wall-mounted TVs while the casualties pour in. The sleep of reason brings forth monsters, they say.

The most prosaic explanation is that China&apos;s state-owned National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the rig&apos;s owner, is keen to develop sources of oil and gas for the country&apos;s energy-hungry economy that do not depend on exploration agreements with western oil companies. China regards the Paracel Islands, near the drilling site, as its sovereign territory. It takes a similar view of 90% of the 1.35m sq mile (3.5m sq km) South China Sea. The fact that nobody else agrees does not seem to bother Beijing. &quot;Large deep-water drilling rigs are our mobile national territory,&quot; said Wang Yilin, CNOOC&apos;s chairman, in 2012. At the other end of the spectrum, China&apos;s move can be seen as a direct rebuff to Barack Obama, who recently completed a four-country Asia &quot;reassurance tour&quot; designed to strengthen regional alliances as part of his administration&apos;s so-called &quot;tilt&quot; to Asia. In Tokyo, the US president warned China against forcibly pressing its maritime claims, following Beijing&apos;s unilateral declaration last autumn of an air exclusion zone over Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea. Obama offered specific security guarantees to Tokyo and stepped up US military co-operation with the Philippines, which is embroiled in similar disputes. Obama denied his intention was the &quot;containment&quot; of China. Whatever the truth, China plainly is not ready to be contained. Its response to his strictures was to send a flotilla of 80 ships to escort the oil rig. When Vietnamese vessels challenged them, they were rammed and fired upon with water cannon. China&apos;s action may alternatively be viewed as a warning to the 10-country Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), with which it has repeatedly failed to agree a long-awaited, legally binding code of conduct on maritime disputes. China is also in effect ignoring the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. In response to Beijing&apos;s growing assertiveness, Asean member states such as Indonesia and Malaysia have been upgrading their weapons arsenals and pursuing new defensive alliances both within the bloc and with the US and Australia. &quot;South-east Asian states are working to enhance their so-called &apos;anti-access/area-denial&apos; capabilities. Vietnam [for example] has ordered six Kilo-class submarines,&quot; said an analysis by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Singapore and Thailand have also joined this mini-arms race. All the same, China&apos;s scare tactics appear to be working. Last weekend&apos;s Asean summit in Burma failed to agree on language criticising China for the final communiqu\u00e9. An earlier, separate statement called only for &quot;self-restraint&quot; in the South China Sea without mentioning China or Vietnam by name. This disarray reflects ongoing disagreements within Asean on how to handle an overbearing, militarily superior neighbour that is also their biggest trading and investment partner. The current China-Vietnam confrontation can also be seen as the by-product of a troubled past. That both countries are in effect one-party, Communist-run states, and that China supported Hanoi during the Vietnam war may give a misleading impression of their overall historical relationship. In truth, there is no love lost between the two. Vietnam was repeatedly invaded and occupied by imperial China for hundreds of years. The first Vietnamese nationalists defined their cause in relation to the threat posed by Beijing. After Vietnam&apos;s reunification in 1975, strains quickly emerged and the two countries went to war briefly in 1979. China again occupied the north while the Soviet Union backed the Vietnamese. More recently, Vietnam&apos;s lurch into Beijing-style communist-capitalism has been accompanied by deliberate attempts to mend fences with the arch-capitalists of the US. George W Bush visited in 2006, following in Bill Clinton&apos;s footsteps. Bilateral trade has grown rapidly in recent years, as has a tentative security relationship. The US remains wary of closer ties, however, maintaining that Vietnam must first improve its human rights record. The fact that John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Chuck Hagel, the defence secretary, are both Vietnam war veterans may also be a factor. This caution may be discarded if China continues to menace Vietnam and others in the region. Less than one year ago Li Keqiang, the Chinese premier, signed agreements with Vietnam on trade, infrastructure and maritime security, including recommitting China to a 2011 bilateral pact to manage peaceably their differences in the South China sea. The deals were supposedly part of a charm offensive by China&apos;s new leadership to woo Asean countries. This seems forgotten now, as old enmities and present-day ambitions create new grounds for confrontation."}, {"sentences": ["He was, after all, getting ready to play the world No1 Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals of the Italian Open, a clash so rare that it took a quick squint at the record books again to confirm they had not met on court since Murray beat the Spaniard in the final in Tokyo in 2011, bagelling him in the final set."], "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Rafael Nadal", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-15T19:19:00Z", "title": "Andy Murray into Italian quarter-finals with win over J\u00fcrgen Melzer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/15/andy-murray-jurgen-melzer-rome-open", "article": "Andy Murray has had worse birthdays. Two of them were spiritually and physically draining \u2013 when he had to quit a match for the only times in his career \u2013 while Thursday&apos;s here, his 27th, brought relief and encouragement, not to mention a strawberry cake heaving with enough calories to sink a gym. The lean-muscled Scot took not a celebrity slice, of course. He was, after all, getting ready to play the world No1 Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals of the Italian Open, a clash so rare that it took a quick squint at the record books again to confirm they had not met on court since Murray beat the Spaniard in the final in Tokyo in 2011, bagelling him in the final set. It was not just the bonhomie of a birthday away from home that brought a smile to Murray&apos;s face on Thursday but a return to something like his best clay tennis in a little while during a tricky 7-6, 6-4 win over the Austrian left-hander J\u00fcrgen Melzer. As for those birthday blues, Murray winced when he recalled: &quot;The two times I&apos;ve had to retire on the tour have strangely been on my birthday. One of them I was up 5-1 against Filippo Volandri in Hamburg [in 2007] and the other was here when I was a set all [last year against Marcel Granollers], so it&apos;s nice to have a more pleasant experience on court.&quot; Yet, even as Murray&apos;s cake was being demolished at unseemly pace by obliging reporters, the nearby TV screen showed Nadal in the early stages of a third-round dog-fight with Mikhail Youzhny, down a set and 0-2 and looking distinctly out of sorts, much as he had done before being handed the Madrid title on Sunday, when Kei Nishikori retired injured. Murray, though, said he was keen for a Nadal victory (he had no cause to worry: the Spaniard found his rhythm and won 12 of the last 13 games to destroy the Russian 6-7, 6-2, 6-1). &quot;It would not be a bad thing for me to play against Nadal,&quot; he said, &quot;because I haven&apos;t played him for three years. I haven&apos;t practised with him hardly at all either. I used to practise with him quite a lot. So I would actually be quite interested to play against him before the French Open and Wimbledon, to see how his game has changed and also the things I can do to make it difficult for him. &quot;I&apos;m sure there will be things also that won&apos;t work against him, that I&apos;ll need to change. So, better to play him now rather than in the French or at Wimbledon.&quot; So their 19th meeting in seven years on Tour rekindles a rivalry forged as teenagers in Spain, where their story began, the Mallorcan and the Scot, close enough to be regular hitting partners then fierce adversaries when the draw threw them together 15 times between 2008 and 2011, including a run of 10 events in a row when they were on the same side of the draw. Nadal leads 13-5. As for Nadal&apos;s continued struggle, the world No 1 said after seeing off Youzhny: &quot;Get used to it. With the years everybody suffers. It is part of the sport, part of everybody&apos;s career. It is normal in tennis. I will not suffer that much if I am serving for the set, but it was difficult [in the wind] today. You don&apos;t want to be that long on court like yesterday, but these things happen. It was tough. Conditions today were impossible. &quot;Tomorrow is going to be a very tough match. I am confident but I have to do the right things to give myself a chance to win, play with more control, a little bit more speed. It&apos;s going to be hard, playing one of the best players in the world after two tough days. If I don&apos;t take my chances I am going to be spending the weekend in Mallorca.&quot; Murray has always preferred the challenge of playing his peers, especially Nadal and Roger Federer rather than those below him in the rankings. For one it keeps him sharp \u2013 and it also removes the &quot;banana skin&quot; factor that can disturb a sometimes delicate mind-set. &quot;Obviously you want to be playing against the best players. If you are, it means you&apos;re in the latter stage of the tournament and that&apos;s where you want to be. I played against most of them close to 20 times [each], so it&apos;s just a bit strange not to have played the best player in the world just now for such a long period of time. We used to always get drawn in the same side of the draw as well. It was ridiculous.&quot; Murray said he has noticed minute changes in Nadal&apos;s game, although he wisely kept the public analysis to a minimum. &quot;I think the thing is the confidence. For example, his forehand looks similar to me but he was returning pretty short this week; when he is confident he tends to return a lot deeper. He has made some changes to his backhand during his career, so that might be the shot that breaks down a little more and you lose confidence in it \u2013 but I don&apos;t see major changes in his game. Maybe he didn&apos;t play his best tennis in parts of Rome and Monte Carlo but he looked pretty damn good last week.&quot; As we hoovered up the last crumbs of his cake, Murray reflected on the demands of his calling and he remains refreshingly upbeat, not at all ground down by the routine or the physical sacrifices, of which there are many. &quot;To be honest, it&apos;s not that tough. The only thing that is hard is spending a lot of time away from family. The rest of it? Great hotels, we go to the best cities in the world and the one thing tennis has given me is the opportunity to see the whole world, which I might not have been doing at my age if it wasn&apos;t for tennis. &quot;You do need to work very hard to stay at the top and you need a willingness to learn and keep improving. Guys get better and, if you only want to put in an hour and a half on the court a day and not do any of the physical work and just go through the motions, that&apos;s when it gets close to the end.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Photograph: Andrea Schaffer/Flickr    On the surface, this is similar to how Tokyo manages smoking, herding people into carcinogenic enclaves.", "The Tokyo system has a unique side effect: these smoking enclosures are regularly visited by police who enjoy harassing anyone lingering too long over a durrie.", "But Tokyo\u2019s smoking community still has the option of bars and restaurants that allow them to puff away."], "tags": ["Smoking", "Health", "Health policy", "Australia news", "Alcohol"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-16T02:46:25Z", "title": "Melbourne may soon be a smoke-free city \u2013 but at what price? | Amy Gray", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/16/melbourne-may-be-the-first-smoke-free-city-but-at-what-price", "article": "Melbourne city council has gone on its yearly health kick and, instead of vowing to jog more or investigate that whole clean eating malarkey, started muttering about banning smoking from the city centre.

My council \u2013 Melbourne city council, a council so eager to nag it will literally turn up on my doorstep if I\u2019m a day late to re-register my cat \u2013 wants to come between me and my smoking. Their plan is to ban smoking throughout the CBD with the exception of small shelters of smokey iniquity where we are supposed to confine ourselves.     Degraves street in Melbourne. Photograph: Andrea Schaffer/Flickr    On the surface, this is similar to how Tokyo manages smoking, herding people into carcinogenic enclaves. Unlike Melbourne, this measure is created out of courtesy, to avoid creating mess or accidentally burning others with a dangling fag. The Tokyo system has a unique side effect: these smoking enclosures are regularly visited by police who enjoy harassing anyone lingering too long over a durrie. But Tokyo\u2019s smoking community still has the option of bars and restaurants that allow them to puff away.  Melbourne city council\u2019s proposal is spectacularly stupid, as it is moralising against a legal substance. It\u2019s a completely unenforceable proposal that positions the public as police or will exist as a revenue-raising spree, like the occasional expensive reminder we\u2019re not allowed to jaywalk.  It also fails on the cause-and effect sense test: for all the novelty of creating the world\u2019s first smoke-free city, the council has effectively ensured that Exhibition and Treasury Gardens will also become the world\u2019s first largest heritage listed smoking lounges. What Melbourne city council also fails to consider is that this will waste the millions spent trying to convince people that the CBD is the perfect mix of retail, corporate, entertainment and residential precincts. Record numbers of people are moving to the CBD and it\u2019s set to double in the next decade, with people discovering it\u2019s cheaper to live here than in the suburbs. Residential developments continue at a rapid pace providing a rich variety of homes, from bland ghettoes for uni students to bland penthouses for the rich. As such, the city has changed to adapt, with an increasing array of supermarkets, home retail and residential services. It\u2019s the perfect city with options to get about, work, amuse yourself and grab a loaf of incredibly overpriced bread on the way home. This has been deliberately encouraged by Melbourne city council.  Yet, despite all the inducements, the council now wants people to stop smoking. It\u2019s like asking everyone to come to a party, promising it will be off the hook only to find it\u2019s actually a Baptist bake sale. You know, the people are nice and mean well, but you just can\u2019t be yourself and have fun because it is completely different to what was sold. Behind smoking, the second greatest (and also legal) killer in Australia is alcohol. Yet we still have one major street in the CBD devoted to getting bladdered and Melbourne bars are almost as ubiquitous as Melbourne caf\u00e9s. Or Pieface. Apparently some legal substances are more tolerated and profitable than others. Whatever attempts at prohibition from Melbourne city council, its residents will adapt. In fact, Melburnians are skilled at adapting with style to recreate an intriguing city despite the attempts of the council to curb our vices. The abortive and arbitrary lockout, which stopped people entering bars after 2am, affected smokers so much that rooftop bars were created in response to evade the council\u2019s nannying, allowing businesses to prosper.  When it comes to planning a city, Melbourne\u2019s residents are equal (and possibly more effective) city planners who can skirt the prudish attempts of the Council. Melbourne\u2019s rich laneway system is a great example \u2013 a response to existing interaction \u2013 and the ghost town status of Docklands an example of bad choices made disconnected from its population \u2013 a precinct to answer a need no one expressed.  So, if Melbourne city council are looking for a way to kill off its entertainment and residential options but quicker than cancer, it\u2019s going the right way. And while I can still (barely) afford cigarettes, the council must ask itself: can it afford this?

More than 100 submissions were sent via GuardianWitness from all over the world. From Japan to Russia and Germany to Bangladesh, here are some of the stories we received.  Bangladesh A country where the predominant religions say you are a sinner, the law of the land says you are a criminal, the social norms say you are a pervert, the culture considers you as imported; how should life be for LGBTs in Bangladesh? I call it living in a &apos;comfortable closet&apos;. Comfortable because it is actually &apos;easy&apos; when it comes &apos;doing it&apos;; the culture and social norms are so focused on preventing heterosexual acts between unmarried couples that man-to-man or woman-to-woman sexual acts go almost unnoticed. Even in some more conservative regions homosexual act between teenage boys is seen as the &apos;safer&apos; way of exploring sexuality; so long they get married at their adulthood, no one cares much. But it&apos;s a closet! The moment someone decides to leave that they&apos;ll face &apos;death&apos;, they fear. When the country&apos;s first magazine on lgbt issues, Roopbaan, was published, so harsh was the reaction from the majority.  When a group organised a rainbow rally on the first day of Bengali New Year as part of the bigger New Year&apos;s rally, it was highly applauded by the crowd as no LGBT banner or label was used. But the moment an online news portal tagged this as &apos;pride rally by homosexuals&apos; and Roopbaan as its organiser, the public reaction went brutal. But things are changing; very slowly but steadily. Amidst that darkness of hatred and threats there&apos;s a silver lining like support from various human rights groups and individuals. Online activism among the LGBT community is rising sharply with a steady offline/community movement by organisations like the Bandhu Social Welfare Society and Boys of Bangladesh. The government has very recently recognised &apos;hijras&apos; as a new gender. In a country where the whole concept of sex and sexuality is a taboo, we are learning to navigate our ways by highlighting &apos;love&apos; as the center of all, as a human right that can&apos;t be denied, hoping for better, and may be &apos;faster&apos;, acceptance.. some day!

Photograph: JOERG CARSTENSEN/EPA    Penal code \u00a7 175, outlawing gay sex, was of course abolished decades ago, we have openly gay foreign ministers and other openly lesbian and gay politicians - and it&apos;s been legal now to &quot;marry&quot; your partner by committing to a civil union (without some rights like the right to adoption as a couple etc.). But recent homophobic attacks against Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg&apos;s proposed new school curriculum that includes the teaching of sexual diversity shows there&apos;s lots of resentment under the surface. Of course, compared to having to fear for one&apos;s personal safety on a daily basis, things in Germany are pretty good. Nonetheless I find it annoying to have people take for granted that I have a husband just because I&apos;m a woman. And it&apos;s not just annoying but sad that in smaller German towns, gays and lesbians are practically invisible and are too afraid to be recognised by neighbours or bosses to join a gay parade, if there is one in the first place. I feel it is altogether tragic and shocking to hear, after having moved to a different town, that a young lesbian acquaintance of mine -- one of those who did not join the parade -- has committed suicide. So, on the surface lots of rainbow colours, but it&apos;s still pretty dark underneath. LydiaStiefzeh Japan     Drag queens at the Tokyo Lesbian and Gay Parade 2001. Photograph: ITSUO INOUYE/AP    Growing up in liberal, multi-cultural central Manchester, coming out barely raised an eyebrow. Naively, when I moved to Japan to live near Osaka, I assumed it would be equally tolerant, if not as open. After all, Japan was open to all kinds of subcultures right? All my Japanese friends and students had been utterly blase as well when I told them, which I took as indicative of general opinions. It was in our welcoming seminars when the Japan Stonewall representative warned us that coming out to our offices could potentially result in immediate termination of our contracts as their is no anti-discrimination legislation that it began to dawn on me that maybe it was going to be all rainbows and sakura from here on in. In Japan, attitudes vary depending on location. In metropolitan and international Kansai the response is usually one of surprise and shock, rather than outright hostility; friends living in the \u7530\u820e (inaka, countryside or the sticks), have been far less lucky. A strong streak of social conservatism runs through Japan. The major opposition to homosexuality (and lesbians in particular) is not so much that it is seen as `wrong` or `sinful` - Japan is a very secular country as a general rule- and more that it is just `different`. The overwhelming assumption of my female students (and male ones to a lesser degree) is that they will marry, have children, give up work to be a \u4e3b\u5a66 (shufu, housewife) etc, etc. Any lifestyle which shows potential deviation from that strict model is frowned upon- and no-one considers that gay people may aspire to this very model of matrimony and normalacy. I am comparatively lucky as there are two (TWO!) lesbian bars in the whole of Osaka, and another couple in Kyoto about an hour away. They are small, poky places with no identifying marks. The majority of Japanese queer women I have met are very firmly closeted, only one or two coming out to family members who respond with disapproval although not usually outight rejection. Another difference is that Japanese queer women clearly define themselves as `boi`s` or `femmes`, and partner up accordingly. If you don`t clearly delineate, like myself, you are met with bemusement. Gendered roles are still pretty reinforced on the LGBT scene. Its not all doom and gloom though. Although gay `scenes` tend to be limited just to Osaka and Tokyo, the local clientele are always welcoing. Queer foreigners also tend to band together and lots of events are organised through Stonewall Japan and others. I came out at my office and although people were surprised (`but you have long hair!`), they adjusted pretty quickly. I&apos;ve had responses from students, friends and colleagues ranging from `here, we think its a disease` (in a very helpful informative tone!) to `so what, its 2014`, Most of the stigma is bound up with rigid conceptions of gender roles, which is very gradually changing. Overall, Japan sees itself as a welcoming and kind society, so even if people are more embarassed than supportive, you are very unlikely to face any overt discrimination (well, that would be rude...). Also, of all the shiniest of silver linings, there is the Takarazuka Revue. Case closed. Lorna Petty UK     'The change in the UK since when I was a teenager being bullied on a daily basis due to my sexuality to where we stand today is incredible.' Photograph: andrewgrace89/GuardianWitness    Social attitudes have improved dramatically in the past decade, thanks to activism from the transgender community and growing understanding and acceptance from the younger generations; aided enormously by the web, and social media sites.  I am fortunate to live in country that has some legal protections for the transgender community especially, as harassment, violence and threatening behaviour are still all too common: with the hardest impact falling on those from poorer backgrounds and women from ethnic minorities in this country.  Casual social discrimination continues to set us back even when there is a measure of tolerance, and still closely impacts our careers and personal lives: everything from finding a flat, to finding and maintaining relationships. All the more when we exist at the intersection of socially marginalised groups.  Even with the privilege of my features and an excellent college education, I am caught on minimum wage, my degree shot to pieces dealing with mental health issues. My family is tolerant but not especially accepting, and I am fortunate even for that. I have met trans women who are thriving in spite of everything, but many who continue to struggle on multiple fronts, none of this helped by the current governments&apos; attitude to social support and benefits.  All this, and I live in London. The oppression transgender women, women of colour, face worldwide is shocking and heartbreaking.

Dumiso Gatsha submitted this video to GuardianWitness about the LGBT community in Botswana.    Northern Ireland I grew up in a very homophobic atmosphere in Northern Ireland, regular bullying, homophobic language and violence and no positive gay role models, gay life was hidden and not discussed. That was the 1980s. Although I now live in London, like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland has seen some amazing changes in 30 years which mean its much easier to be out, especially with family and friends. My experience is that day to day, and as individuals most Northern Irish people aren&apos;t homophobic anymore but it lags behind the rest of the UK in laws and the political culture is far from tolerant.  Like in other parts of the world affected by political homophobia there is a strong link to conservative religious groups and tribal politicians, who fight any positive move made for gay people as a way of motivating their core votes and followers.  Although living in London life is very free and beautiful I&apos;m always conscious of how just 500 miles away a very different less progressive culture still exists and that for any minority group, hard won freedoms are often easily reversed. Even in London we shouldn&apos;t think battles have been won forever. Johnpwray Mexico City     Gay couples celebrate as a mariachi band performs after getting married at a courthouse in Mexico City, Sunday, July 14, 2013. Photograph: Marco Ugarte/AP    I moved to Mexico City in November 2000 from Australia to live with my gay Mexican partner. It&apos;s been 14 years and I have never regretted a day. Mexico City is the capital of gay culture in Mexcio, attracting LGBT people from other parts of Mexico and Latin America. There is a generational problem that I have seen, regarding being &quot;out&quot;. Mexico City was a very conservative and homophobic place. This led to social and family pressure on gay men to establish a family, and therefore stay well and truly closeted. There are different bars in the city where older men meet and socialise in a gay setting. They then return to their wives and children. However, things have changed in many ways.  Although discrimination exists and violence is not unheard of, in Mexico City there seems to be less pull from the Catholic Church than other parts of Mexico. As a result, many people tend to be ambivalent about same sex or transgendered issues. They know what is going on but pretend that it doesn&apos;t exist. If there are gatherings of family, partners often attend. The partner, however, is introduced as a &apos;friend&apos;, but everyone knows that they are in a relationship. As in every society young people tend to be pushing the boundaries. Younger people just don&apos;t see it as a problem. There is still a very lively gay scene, but when you venture into different bars there are many places where everyone is mixing, and not even considering sexuality as an issue. One thing that has advanced life for LGBT people in Mexico City was the passing of laws to legalise gay marriage. Before the legislation was voted on, there was a mammoth struggle between the centre left local government and the catholic church. The law was important because it was the first time in Mexico that LGBT rights had been legally backed. There are still problems with Federal Government institutions accepting LGBT spouses, and Mexico City laws have had to be backed by the Supreme Court, but conservatives in Mexico have discovered that once a law is in place it is very hard to get rid of. One very strange thing for my partner and I is that we have not taken advantage of the laws, and remain unmarried. I would like to. Stephen Weir Russia     A gay rights activist raises his fist as he leads a gay rights activists march during May Day rally in St. Petersburg, Russia. Photograph: Anatoly Medved/Demotix/Corbis    We, Russians, are a pretty cold and closed people. Showing affections in public is something considered inappropriate even for your old heterosexual couples. And introducing same-sex unions is really unimaginable in this realm of stagnated conservatism.  People are scared to come out for various reasons starting from fear not to be understood by their own families (and maybe even disowned by them) and ending with a well-grounded caution for their jobs. The only remedy here is to stay quiet and keep one\u2019s own preferences to oneself. As even the \u201cgreat and powerful\u201d Russian language is likely turn against one as there is a wild range of insults based on abusing one\u2019s sexuality. Actually calling someone gay is one of the easiest ways to show a person\u2019s disregard and extreme contempt. At the same time it is not that LGBT don\u2019t exist. The clubs are there even if it is difficult to get inside if you don\u2019t know where exactly the door is. And there are proud gay people walking hand in hand even when suffering from the necessity of hiding in the closet and secretly planning an immigration to some more tolerant and happy place.  Actually in this land of thriving inequality it is still relatively easy to exist if one is prepared to keep one\u2019s mouth shut. And that is probably the key-point of the our most infamous \u201cgay-propaganda\u201d law. Shblsh What&apos;s it like being LGBT in your country?

He has, however, called for a review of how the country&apos;s unique pacifist constitution is interpreted, with the possibility that Japan may eventually engage in overseas conflicts alongside its allies.  Though Barack Obama has recently supported the idea of Japan taking a more active role in its security alliance with the US, the review divides the Japanese public and is causing concerns in countries, particularly China, with lingering memories of Japan&apos;s conduct during the second world war. We asked our readers in Japan and elsewhere their views on the proposed changes. You can read a selection below, and share your own views in the comments or via GuardianWitness. &quot;Self-defence means self-defence, not invasion.&quot; I agree with the necessity to review current Japanese constitution as there is a contradiction between Article 9 and the Self Defence Force. The currently debated approach to the interpretation of Article 9 is a first step forward to resolving the contradiction, and I\u2019m appreciative of it. I think the key point of this topic is the definition of \u201cself-defence\u201d. There are two conceivable definitions of it*. One is that the use of force only as a response to imminent threat or invasion, such as North Korea launching a missile to Tokyo or a country declaring war on Japan. The other one adds the use of pre-emptive action, such as dispatching the army to prevent a supposed attack, to the above definition. The current interpretation of Article 9 permits the use of the SDF in the first definition of \u201cself-defence\u201d, but not in the second one. The right to collective self-defence, which prime minister Abe tries to include in the mandate of SDF, seems to be based on the second definition of \u201cself-defence\u201d. The use of the right to collective self-defence was notorious during the cold war. It was used as a justification for interfering with the internal political affairs of other countries, as the examples of the US dispatching its army to North Vietnam and the former USSR to Czechoslovakia both showed. To put this action more crudely, it is invasion in the disguise of help. This kind of arbitrary interpretation of self-defence should not be accepted. The introduction of the right to collective self-defence will likely increase the chance of Japan dispatching its army abroad. So the current Liberal Democratic Party&apos;s approach towards self-defence has to be corrected. It is a direct contradiction to the Japanese constitution and also not something to be accepted from the point of national sovereignty. Self-defence means self-defence, not invasion. * I drew the two definitions from the successive debate on the interpretation of Article 9 and its relation to the right of collective self-defence. You can check it on the LDP website, though unfortunately it is only provided in Japanese. TomoyukiY &quot;The need and benefit to Japan would be questionable.&quot; While Japan&apos;s constitution formally renounces war and makes explicit statements regarding the maintenance of materials that could be used to wage war, the modern interpretation has been built around the concept of Japan as an island nation. Japan does not maintain any missile attack or defense systems currently, and instead is relying on treaties with the United States exclusively for ballistic missile defense and deterrence. Japan also does not maintain any navy material capable of long distance or logistical support, including aircraft carriers. Instead the Navy has a major focus on defensive attributes, deploying primarily destroyers and frigates with a specialization in anti-submarine combat. The Japanese self-defense force also lacks long distance air power, no bombers, only fielding air combat fighters, AWACs, and transport planes with a compliment of helicopters. The current situation leaves Japan in a region with high tensions and surrounded by countries who still consider the conflicts, occupations, and atrocities they suffered at the hands of the Japanese as recent events, with some countries openly (North Korea) or silently (China) spoiling for a conflict to prove themselves a world power. While Japan should be considering modification of its self defense force to account for a modern nature of conflict featuring long range missile attack and unified aggression from neighbors, the best way to reinforce Japan&apos;s ability to defend themselves while maintaining a Pacifist stance is probably not to commit Japanese forces to international &apos;peace-keeping&apos; conflicts. The most likely intention behind Abe&apos;s announcement is to promote and engage Japan as a world peace contributor, but Japan does not have the logistics currently to efficient provide this kind of engagement on a global scale at the moment, and even if they were to build that capacity, the need and benefit to Japan (and the world at large) would be questionable. Ultimately one could hope that Japan can re-evaluate the current implementation of the JSDF to account for the modern threat theatre without over-extending the country to become mired in international conflicts that accomplish little but draining the country&apos;s finances at a time where they are just now beginning to climb out of a 20 year recession. kochira &quot;I&apos;m not convinced this shift is being made for the right reasons.&quot; I no longer live in Japan, but I still follow the news cycle from a distance. Although Abe&apos;s economic policies originally bore (spectacular) fruit, it was his stance on the constitution that left me pessimistic when he won the election. The 1947 constitution is a wonderful document and, while I believe that we as people should always be reviewing and improving the laws and principles upon which we run our respective countries, I&apos;m not convinced that this potential shift towards belligerence is being made for the right reasons. I cannot speak to an expert level, but the generally accepted wisdom is that young people in Japan are becoming increasingly apathetic towards politics, and this was borne out during my time in the country. An educated electorate is vital in situations like these, and it seems that many Japanese are basing their pro-reform views on a vague worry that North Korea might go rogue, and that their sovereignty is being undermined by the continued existence of US bases on the Japanese landmass. The introspection and forethought required before making as monumental a decision such as this is simply not taking place. Although his legacy is questionable and the circumstances leading up to his arrival in Japan unfavourable, MacArthur was on the money when he claimed that in promulgating a constitution containing an article prohibiting warfare Japan was creating history and, through leading by example, providing the rest of the world with an opportunity to turn their backs on centuries of bloodshed. While the war-free utopia of which he spoke may not have materialised, if Japan rewrites article 9 then they turn their own back on a piece of constitutional law-making of which they should still be very, very proud.

I peer in and see strip lights blinking in the dark. This is just one of the theatrical and mystifying moments in Hiroshi Sugimoto&apos;s exhibition Aujourd&apos;hui, le monde est mort (Lost Human Genetic Archive) at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris. Part of a riveting cycle of shows that fill the building, Sugimoto&apos;s is both entertaining and a mournful experience. If the meteor doesn&apos;t get you, there are plenty more morbid, memorable moments in the clearings and corridors of his end-times phantasmagoria, installed amid a warren of rusted walls of corrugated metal sheeting. &quot;The world died today. Or maybe yesterday, I don&apos;t know \u2026&quot; Sugimoto writes, on the many handwritten notes that double as captions as we make our way round. Echoing the beginning of Albert Camus&apos;s 1942 novel The Stranger, which begins with almost the same words (&quot;Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday \u2026&quot;), the phrase keeps recurring, leitmotif and chorus. Swapping &quot;mother&quot; with &quot;world&quot; implies a final, universal end of fertility and the breaking of the primal bond. It&apos;s also fun.     Earliest Human Relatives (1994). Photograph: Gallery Koyanagi, Tokyo    Imagining the end of the world is a great creative conceit and has its own perverse fertility. The end is always with us \u2013 end of the novel, death of the author, death of painting, no more bees (in one section of the show, the beekeeper has hung up his clobber and the hive is empty). No more people, end of the world. The end. &quot;Imagining the worst conceivable tomorrows gives me tremendous pleasure at the artistic level,&quot; says Sugimoto. &quot;The darkness of the future lights up my present.&quot; He is best known for his bleak, empty and sometimes beautiful black-and-white photographs, and his remarks make me peer into his images more intently, looking for signs and tremors. This is an unexpected show from an artist associated with images of horizons, iceflows, collections of Buddhas and empty cinemas whose screens are filled with glowing blank voids (for these, Sugimoto left the shutter open for the duration of the projected film, recording only a luminous, numinous blank). Only a small number of Sugimoto&apos;s own photographs are included here. Instead, he presents us with scenes of apocalyptic, whimpering, cataclysmic and drawn-out finality. A 13th-century carved sculpture of Kaminari-sama, the Shinto god of thunder, stands atop a stone staircase, rescued from a ruined house and leering maniacally. On the wall opposite, ancient fossils sit in cabinets. Sugimoto sees these little cabinets as incubators. Maybe they&apos;re waiting for a flash of galvanising lightning to bring them back to life.     Thunder God by an unknown artist of the Kamakura period, with Sugimoto's Lightning Fields in the background. Photograph: Gallery Koyanagi, Tokyo    Sugimoto provides his own, using a hidden Faraday cage to create indoor lightning, and displaying camera-less photographs whose images are produced using electromagnetic charges. (He is only following Fox Talbot, the pioneer of early photography who used the same technique.) Artificial weather and lifelike artifice are part of Sugimoto&apos;s theme. His captions are as fanciful as they are informative, and not always easy to read. A guidebook would have been more helpful. Near a collection of Barbie dolls, one note claims: &quot;I wanted to be a Barbie when I grew up.&quot; Cosmetic surgery made this possible. &quot;Genes went haywire and made seedless melons out of everyone,&quot; the caption notes. All this leads, we later discover, to the creation of a race of hermaphrodites. Futuristic gender trouble is a favourite sci-fi ploy. Beneath a 1750s engraving of hermaphroditic genitalia, by the French anatomist and artist Jacques Fabien Gautier d&apos;Agoty, Sugimoto places a lifesize supine figure in a gorgeous, 16th-century geometric Noh play costume, with an equally old, androgynous Kassiki mask for a face. The figure&apos;s head sits under a glass dome. It is a wonderful and erotic thing, with arms outstretched like an immobilised angel. Beneath the clothes, the figure is bound like an Egyptian mummy. If it weren&apos;t for the quality of the exhibits in Sugimoto&apos;s wunderkammer, most of which come from his own collection, all this could be tiresome, teetering into kitsch. Instead it is a treasure trove of the marvellous, frightful and bizarre. It is also an extremely dense exhibition, full of odd things you don&apos;t notice first time round. Real space-programme vessels for astronauts&apos; pee and poo, an enormous stone phallus on a gurney, odd confabulations that refer to the works of Marcel Duchamp and Warhol. One display includes a greenish-brown lead-glass sphere, which was made as a window to inspect the reactions in making a &quot;Nagasaki-type&quot; atomic bomb in America&apos;s Manhattan Project. The timing device of a second world war Japanese torpedo, a map of Iwojima and a macabre US military &quot;Jap Hunting License (&apos;Open Season \u2013 No Limit&apos;)&quot; occupy the same display, while round the corner another strange gas-masked figure lies rigid on a stretcher.     Sugimoto's remaking of Duchamp's \u00c9tant donn\u00e9s.

The elements of Duchamp&apos;s work have been replaced \u2013 with a hyper-real sex doll, made by a Japanese company, on a couch, a gas lamp on the stool beside her, and a photographic backdrop of a rainforest by Sugimoto. The accompanying sound of a waterfall is reproduced by computer-generated white noise. It feels so alive, so real, so fake, so dead. Like life but not life, it has little of the mystery and none of the voyeurism of Duchamp&apos;s original. But I swear the thunder was real on my visit, even though it felt laid on. So, too, was the rain through the skylight. In the distance, at the end of a corridor, hangs one of Sugimoto&apos;s seascapes. Black sea, grey sky; it is an image of an unpeopled, indifferent world. It warms the heart. \u2022 Aujourd&apos;hui le monde est mort (Lost Human Genetic Archive) is at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris, until 7 September."}, {"sentences": ["Not many players have won 11 games in a row against Nadal but, after half an hour, that was the astonishing number next to Murray&apos;s name, given he was 5-0 up to go with the bagel he inflicted on the Spaniard to conclude his win in Tokyo the last time they met, in October 2011."], "tags": ["Rafael Nadal", "Sport", "Andy Murray", "Tennis"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-16T23:06:12Z", "title": "Rafael Nadal beats Andy Murray in gripping Italian Open quarter-final", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/17/rafael-nadal-andy-murray-italian-open-quarter-final", "article": "This was the match Andy Murray said he wanted before the French Open, a resumption of his war with Rafael Nadal after two and a half years without a shot being fired.

After being blown away in the first half-hour the world No1 held his nerve at 2-4 in the third set to win 1-6, 6-3, 7-5 in two hours and 40 minutes, his third three-setter of the week and a victory to calm his own recent jitters under intense if fitful pressure.

He demoralised Nadal in the first set, on the back of a ramped-up serve that brought him five aces and a stream of nagging shots to the Spaniard&apos;s backhand. The world No8 hit the spot, wide, deep or short according to need and there was little Nadal could do about it, apart from a nine-minute barrage in the middle of the set on Murray&apos;s serve. Not many players have won 11 games in a row against Nadal but, after half an hour, that was the astonishing number next to Murray&apos;s name, given he was 5-0 up to go with the bagel he inflicted on the Spaniard to conclude his win in Tokyo the last time they met, in October 2011. Nadal becomes almost indignant when he is being treated like this and, after saving a service game, resumed, &quot;playing angry&quot;, with extra bite on his forehand and more spring in his movement. When Nadal saved break point with a swinging ace to hold in the second set, the tone of the contest changed and soon he was 3-0 up, threatening to run away with the match. He served out the set to love and, after an hour and a half, we had the potential for a memorable finish \u2013 but a loose forehand and Murray&apos;s third double fault handed Nadal a break at the start of the third. A miracle save for deuce \u2013 from a foot behind him in the tram lines and in reverse gear \u2013 and a succession of high-grade exchanges got Murray back on level terms at the third attempt. He pinned Nadal deep for four break points in the sixth, cracking the deadlock with a wicked forehand return off his second serve for 4-2 \u2013 then handed him the advantage back when failing to put away a regulation smash, two break points down. The final shot of an enthralling and strangely uneven battle was Murray&apos;s forehand, drifting harmlessly long. On the first day after his 27th birthday he could at least celebrate stretching Nadal to the limit. Dimitrov got two birthday presents earlier in the day: a 6-1 retirement win against Tommy Haas, whose shoulder went on him again \u2013 and a strawberry cake shoved in his face by his eccentric Australian coach, Roger Rasheed. If he beats Nadal on Saturday and wins the final here on Sunday, Dimitrov, the youngest player in the ATP world top 20 at 23, could move up four places into the top 10. &quot;Very tasty,&quot; is how he later described his slapstick moment. &quot;It definitely was one of the most memorable days of my life. It was a bit unfortunate the way it ended up [not the cake-throwing; Haas quitting with a shoulder injury after 36 minutes and losing the only set 1-6]. But I&apos;m just a happy birthday boy today.&quot; He added: &quot;All the so-to-speak young guys, we are all fighting to come on court in big matches and challenge in tournaments. It&apos;s a step of progress for us but, at the same time,everyone is pushing his own way. Everyone wants to get to the top. It&apos;s a battle.&quot; The other semi-final is between Raonic, the second 23-year-old prodigy left standing, who took just over two hours to account for J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy 6-3, 5-7, 6-2, and Djokovic, who had a much tougher time of it against David Ferrer, outlasting the Spanish strongman 7-5, 4-6, 6-3."}, {"sentences": ["Kaito&apos;s parents are divorced: his dad, a tattooist, lives in Tokyo and his mum works in a restaurant."], "tags": ["Still the Water (Futatsume no mado)", "Film", "Culture", "Cannes film festival", "Cannes 2014"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-20T05:00:00Z", "title": "Cannes 2014 review: Still the Water - come on in, the daughter's lovely", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/20/still-the-water-cannes-review-2014", "article": "There&apos;s a Zen calm and a healing gentleness to Naomi Kawase&apos;s Cannes competition film Futatsume No Mado, or Still the Water, set on the Japanese island of Amami, south of the mainland. Like Kawase&apos;s other films, it displays a mystic spirituality and, as in her The Mourning Forest (2007), a profound belief in the therapeutic and redemptive power of nature to soothe our worldly pain. As one character says: &quot;You have to keep a humble attitude to nature; it&apos;s pointless to resist it.&quot; In the unending unity of nature, we can gain a perspective on the limited nature of our individual bodies. Kawase&apos;s film is sometimes beautiful and moving but I couldn&apos;t help occasionally finding it a little contrived and self-conscious. It juxtaposes a sensational and painful event with everyday emotion and everyday heartbreak. Kyoko (Jun Yoshinaga) is a confident, intelligent 16-year-old girl who is falling in love with the diffident, moody boy next door: Kaito (Nijiro Murakami). Kaito&apos;s parents are divorced: his dad, a tattooist, lives in Tokyo and his mum works in a restaurant. Kyoko is dealing with something even more painful: her mother, a delicate and beautiful woman, is dying, perhaps of cancer, although the film is a little too otherworldly to acknowledge the exact illness, the exact medical care or the ugly, un-Zen physical toll it can take. Set against this fraught situation is a shocking event: a dead body is washed up on the beach. Despite the film&apos;s title, the water is far from still \u2013 there are tropical storms and the waves and currents are dangerous. The dead man turns out to have a connection with Kaito&apos;s mother, and realising this forces him to re-evaluate his relationship with his parents and with Kyoko herself who cannot understand why he is so shy and reluctant to make love to her. Surrounding these characters and their trials is Kawase&apos;s distinctive ambient visual mood music. The underwater world is mysterious and wonderful \u2013 like the overwater world. The irrepressible Kyoko is actually seen going for a swim in the deep, fully clothed in her school uniform \u2013 an exotic and surreal scene, but a little preposterous once you realise that it is not a dream. It is difficult, however, to know what to make of two separate moments showing two separate goats being slaughtered, in explicit closeup. Perhaps it is all part of the rhythm of life on the island \u2013 but many in the auditorium covered their eyes, and audiences may wonder why the poor goats are not entitled to this quietist non-molestation of nature. Shouldn&apos;t vegetarianism be part of that? Despite that, Still the Water has an idealism and a tranquility. Kawase&apos;s distinctive serenity and generosity of spirit remain valuable qualities in the cinema."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said it had released 560 tonnes of groundwater pumped from 12 wells located upstream from the damaged reactors."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-21T11:08:33Z", "title": "Fukushima Daiichi begins pumping groundwater into Pacific", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/21/fukushima-groundwater-pacific-nuclear-power-plant", "article": "The operator of the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has started pumping groundwater into the Pacific ocean in an attempt to manage the large volume of contaminated water at the site. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said it had released 560 tonnes of groundwater pumped from 12 wells located upstream from the damaged reactors. The water had been temporarily stored in a tank so it could undergo safety checks before being released, the firm added. The buildup of toxic water is the most urgent problem facing workers at the plant, almost two years after the environment ministry said 300 tonnes of contaminated groundwater from Fukushima Daiichi was seeping into the ocean every day. The groundwater, which flows in from hills behind the plant, mixes with contaminated water used to cool melted fuel before ending up in the sea. Officials concede that decommissioning the reactors will be impossible until the water issue has been resolved. The bypass system intercepts clean groundwater as it flows downhill toward the sea and reroutes it around the plant. It is expected to reduce the amount of water flowing into the reactor basements by up to 100 tonnes a day \u2013 a quarter \u2013 and relieve pressure on the storage tanks, which will soon reach their capacity. But the system does not include the coolant water that becomes dangerously contaminated after it is pumped into the basements of three reactors that suffered meltdown after the plant was struck by an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. That water will continue to be stored in more than 1,000 tanks at the site, while officials debate how to safely dispose of it. The problem has been compounded by frequent technical glitches afflicting the plant&apos;s water purification system. Tepco and the government are also preparing to build an underground frozen wall around four reactors to block groundwater, although some experts doubt the technology will work on such a large scale. The utility is also building more tanks to increase storage capacity. Dale Klein, a senior adviser to Tepco, recently warned the firm that it may have no choice but to eventually dump contaminated water into the Pacific. The first groundwater release went ahead after Tepco assured local fishermen that levels of radioactive isotopes were far lower than those permitted in drinking water by the World Health Organisation. Tepco described the move as a &quot;major milestone&quot;, adding: &quot;The water&apos;s quality is monitored regularly by independent third parties using safety and environmental standards more stringent than those set by Japanese law.&quot; The release comes after a Japanese newspaper revealed that almost all of the workers who were at Fukushima Daiichi when a reactor building exploded in March 2011 panicked and fled, defying orders to remain at the site. The small number of workers, along with firefighters, and soldiers \u2013 nicknamed the Fukushima 50 \u2013 who did stay behind, working in shifts around the clock to cool nuclear fuel, have been f\u00eated for their heroics. But the Asahi Shimbun, citing leaked transcripts of testimony from the plant&apos;s then manager, Masao Yoshida, revealed this week that of the 720 workers present when a reactor building exploded on 15 March, 650 fled to another power plant about six miles (10km) away. Yoshida died of cancer last July. While the Fukushima cleanup continues, government plans to restart some nuclear reactors were in doubt on Wednesday when a court ordered the operator of a plant in western Japan not to put the facility back online, citing safety concerns. In a rare victory for anti-nuclear campaigners, the court in Fukui prefecture said Kansai Electric Power should not restart two reactors at Oi nuclear power plant. All of Japan&apos;s dozens of nuclear reactors are idle after being shut down for safety checks in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. &quot;Plaintiffs have rarely won. This is right in the middle of the restart process\u00a0\u2026 it could have very well have repercussions,&quot; said Aileen Mioko Smith, executive director of Green Action.

After six months working for one of the myriad subcontractors at Fukushima Daiichi, his exposure to radiation was already nearing the legal annual limit of 20 millisieverts, so he resigned. He left with a rare insight into the realities of life at arguably the world&apos;s most hazardous industrial cleanup site. Now he has framed his memories in graphic form in 1F (Ichi-Efu), a new manga whose publication comes as Japan debates the future of its dozens of mothballed nuclear reactors. As an insider&apos;s account, 1F: The Labour Diary of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, has proved popular among readers seeking an antidote to patchy information from the government and the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), and at times wildly speculative media reports.     Tatsuta draws the main character in his comic. Photograph: Koji Sasahara/Kodansha/AP    Drawing on a cast of characters loosely based on his former workmates, Tatsuta leaves nothing to the imagination. There are accounts of workers&apos; early-morning journey to the plant from their digs in nearby towns and cities, and intricate illustrations of the protective clothing they must change into, and remove, every day. The brisk dialogue is replete with vocabulary and work practices only an insider could know. As they start their shifts, workers tell each other to &quot;be safe&quot;; the manga&apos;s abridged title, 1F, is the little-known nickname given Fukushima Daiichi by workers and local people. Tatsuta says he did not consider his work dangerous and, despite the rigours of spending hours in protective clothing and a full-face mask, he never thought about quitting. His most uncomfortable moments, he said, were being unable to urinate while sheathed in his radiation suit. Although Tatsuta was unable to take notes or sketch scenes while at work, those who have visited the plant will attest to the accuracy of every painstakingly reproduced scene, from the layout of the rest areas where he worked to the abandoned neighbourhoods that encircle the stricken plant. &quot;I had done some work as a manga artist before then, but I didn&apos;t apply for the Fukushima job with the intention of writing a manga,&quot; Tatsuta, 49, told the Guardian at his studio outside Tokyo. He first considered writing a manga soon after he left the plant in late 2012. He drew and wrote the first chapter and started knocking on publishers&apos; doors, but failed to find an editor who was interested until he approached Kodansha. &quot;We could see straight away that it was highly original,&quot; said Kenichiro Shinohara, editor of Morning, a weekly manga magazine in which 1F first appeared in serialised form last autumn. &quot;It&apos;s surpassed our expectations and has obviously caught the attention of people who don&apos;t usually read manga.&quot; The initial print run of 150,000 copies was unusually large for a work by a relatively unknown manga artist, yet sales have been brisk since it appeared in book form at the end of April. Kodansha said there were plans for editions in English, French and German. But readers looking to Tatsuta for confirmation that the Daiichi cleanup has been left largely in the hands of unscrupulous firms with links to organised crime, and that workers are sent into dangerous areas with minimal training and substandard equipment, may be disappointed. &quot;As a group and as individuals, I found them all to be decent people,&quot; Tatsuta said. &quot;I don&apos;t have a profound message to give the reader, other than to point out that these are men who are doing their best to get the job done away from the limelight. Politicians and experts are always on TV debating Fukushima, but the workers have no voice. I hope to give them one through my manga.&quot; Tepco posts regular updates about progress in key areas of Fukushima Daiichi and invites groups of journalists to tour the facility several times a year, yet there is much about the work of the 3,000-plus men who work in shifts at the plant that remains hidden. &quot;The media have left a gap in people&apos;s understanding,&quot; said Tatsuta, who prefers not to reveal his face or his real name as he hasn&apos;t ruled out a return to the plant and wants to show solidarity with his &quot;anonymous&quot; workmates. &quot;We hear a lot about what the media are privy to \u2013 the water storage problem, the removal or fuel assemblies and the like \u2013 but what I hope to do is to tell people about things that the media never see.&quot; Drawing entirely from memory, Tatsuta takes the reader on a virtual tour of the areas where exhausted men eat and rest, the filling stations that service hundreds of trucks, buses and cars carrying workers and equipment, and the construction site for yet more tanks to relieve the buildup of contaminated water. He suggests that there is truth, though, in reports that many of the labourers are exploited. Tatsuta answered a job advertisement promising 20,000 yen (\u00a3117) a day, yet initially earned less than half that. And he shares concerns that as more skilled workers leave because they have reached their radiation exposure limit, finding enough replacements to push forward with decommissioning will become more difficult. Like the small number of contract workers who have spoken to the media about their experiences at Fukushima Daiichi, Tatsuta recalls his time there as a mixture of drudgery and camaraderie. &quot;The labourers at Fukushima get a bad press, which I think is unfair,&quot; he said. &quot;They&apos;re depicted as rough, but they are no different from the workers you would find on an ordinary building site in Tokyo.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["On Thursday afternoon, McCartney&apos;s spokesman Stuart Bell confirmed reports that the 71-year-old had been taken to a Tokyo hospital earlier this week."], "tags": ["Paul McCartney", "Music", "Pop and rock", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-23T07:51:20Z", "title": "Paul McCartney in hospital in Japan after contracting virus", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/23/paul-mccartney-hospital-asian-tour-virus", "article": "Paul McCartney has been treated in hospital after falling ill in Japan.

Knowing Asano had been provoked into attacking Kira, 47 of them plotted to avenge his death and restore their honour.

It&apos;s 1701 and they have firearms and mechanical clocks and printing presses and everything. &quot;A land shrouded in mystery. Forbidden to foreigners. A group of magical islands, home to witches and demons.&quot; Righto, so that&apos;s factual error; orientalism; more orientalism; heavy handed magical-realist orientalism. The voiceover perfectly sets the tone for the movie: a sludgy, pompous and witless mash-up of oriental fantasies with little care for the historical story. Our hero, or at least the closest we have to one, is Kai (Keanu Reeves), a fictional changeling who stumbles out of the demon forest and into the household of Lord Asano. Fauna A bunch of samurai are hunting a local computer-generated monster. It&apos;s a sort of big, angry marmoset with heaps of eyes and twigs for arms. Despite the film&apos;s often beautiful production design and a whopping great budget of $225m, the compositing looks shonky; the viewer can&apos;t help wondering if the easiest way to kill this thing might be control-alt-delete. But of course the only one who can stop it is Kai, even though the chief samurai Oishi Yoshio (Hiroyuki Sanada) sneers at him for being a &quot;half-breed&quot;. You may scorn the mudblood now, Draco Malfoy samurai, but everybody watching knows you&apos;re going to need Harry Potter Keanu to save your snobby ass later in the film. Sadly, this film is nowhere near as much fun as Harry Potter. The real story of the 47 ronin has spawned a whole genre of literature and art called chushingura, which is held very dear in the Japanese cultural canon. Wisely, Japanese viewers (indeed, most viewers) stayed away from this movie, making it one of the biggest flops of 2013. More fauna The film stumbles back towards the historical record when Asano organises a reception for the shogun, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi. In real life, the fifth Tokugawa shogun is remembered mainly for being an animal-rights fanatic, so obsessed with the welfare of dogs in particular that he made it illegal for people to harm them in any way \u2013 even if a dog attacked and a person was trying to fight it off. You just had to let it eat you if it wanted. He also banned the selling of live birds, shrimps and shellfish. He&apos;d have been absolutely furious about Kai killing that twig-armed marmoset thing, but the film can&apos;t be bothered to give him any elements of his real character, so he doesn&apos;t even notice. Magic     Photograph: Frank Connor/AP    Asano hopes to impress the shogun. Evil Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) has other ideas, put into his mostly empty head by a Lady Macbeth-style sorceress who the film rather unimaginatively calls Witch. She is played by Rinko Kikuchi, whose ultra-high-camp overacting produces the only genuinely enjoyable performance in this otherwise relentlessly dour movie. &quot;Rivers of blood and mountains of corpses will not stand in our way,&quot; she hisses to Kira, like a sexy Enoch Powell. Quite a niche market, sexy Enoch Powells. Romance Witch tricks Asano into attacking Kira. The shogun orders him to commit seppuku \u2013 ritual suicide \u2013 and makes his samurai ronin. The film drags itself exhaustingly through a series of story points straight out of a screenwriting primer \u2013 the ronin have to band together, get magic swords, face a couple of increasingly big challenges, blah blah \u2013 while the audience fight desperately to stay awake. There&apos;s a tedious subplot whereby Kira intends to marry Kai&apos;s fictional love interest, Asano&apos;s daughter and heir Mika (Ko Shibasaki). In real life, Asano had no children and adopted his brother as his heir. The film puts Mika in a white wedding dress with a veil. This was not even traditional in Europe until Queen Victoria wore one to marry Prince Albert, 139 years after the 47 ronin affair. In Edo Japan, a bride would have worn a brightly coloured uchikake kimono. Meanwhile, everybody&apos;s running around thwacking each other with swords and turning into dragons and whatnot. It&apos;s quite a feat to make this stuff boring, but somehow the film-makers have really pulled it off.

It is not related to UN sanctions.&quot; Tokyo has refused to contemplate normalising ties with North Korea until the abduction issue is resolved. KCNA, North Korea&apos;s official news agency, said any Japanese abductees found to be alive would be sent back to Japan. In return, Japan had &quot;reclarified its will to settle its inglorious past, solve the pending issues and normalise relations&quot;. It said North Korea had &quot;expressed the willingness to conduct a comprehensive and full-scale survey for the final settlement of all issues related to Japan&quot;. Japan insists that North Korea abducted 17 of its nationals, who reportedly taught the Japanese language to Pyongyang agents and coached them on how to pass as Japanese for future missions. North Korea said four alleged abductees had not entered the country and that a further eight had died of illnesses or in bizarre accidents. They include Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she was snatched in 1977 near her home on the Sea of Japan coast as she returned from school badminton practice. Yokota&apos;s parents and their supporters refuse to believe North Korean claims that she hanged herself in 1994 while being treated in hospital for depression. Yokota reportedly married a fellow abductee from South Korea, with whom she had a daughter. Her parents met their granddaughter for the first time, in Mongolia, in March this year. When North Korea sent Yokota&apos;s cremated remains to Japan for analysis in 2004, tests showed they contained someone else&apos;s DNA. Experts also found inconsistencies in her death certificate. The abductions are an emotionally charged issue in Japan. After Thursday&apos;s announcement \u2013 which came after three days of talks between North Korean and Japanese officials in Stockholm \u2013 TV networks broadcast reports on the missing abductees and the prospects for their return. Some campaigners believe North Korea abducted many more Japanese nationals who are not included on the official list of those missing."}, {"sentences": ["He was appointed secretary general of the third international conference on adult education in Tokyo in 1972, and worked especially on functional literacy and education for women."], "tags": ["Education", "Literacy", "Books", "Culture", "Higher education", "Canada", "Americas", "World news", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-29T16:17:03Z", "title": "John Cairns obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/may/29/john-cairns", "article": "My husband, John Cairns, who has died aged 92, was an author, a consultant on international development and a champion of women&apos;s education worldwide.

One night saw the opening of his new production of Miss Saigon that had already clocked up more than \u00a310m in advance-sales. The next day Mackintosh announced that he was buying two new London theatres \u2013 the Victoria Palace and the Ambassadors \u2013 to add to his existing seven-strong portfolio. When you consider that he has produced the three longest-running musicals of all time \u2013 Les Miserables, The Phantom of the Opera and Cats \u2013 and that he is worth an estimated $1.1bn (\u00a3658m), you might be forgiven for thinking of him as a mega-tycoon. Yet, talking to him this week in his Bloomsbury offices, I was struck by how he remains the same bubbly enthusiast I\u00a0have known on and off for 40 years. You go expecting to meet Citizen Kane: what you see is Peter Pan. Mackintosh, although now 67, has the unlined features and bright-eyed fervour of someone who has spent all his life doing precisely what he wants: putting on shows. He also brings to the acquisition of theatres the same enthusiasm, and microscopic attention to detail, he does to producing musicals. I&apos;ve never forgotten how, after he bought the Gielgud theatre in 2006, he insisted I inspect the radically transformed ladies&apos; loo: not a subject, I\u00a0confess, on which I had any expertise. Now he is excited by his purchase of the Victoria Palace and the Ambassadors (to be rechristened the Sondheim). &quot;I\u00a0love old buildings,&quot; he tells me, &quot;and, if I hadn&apos;t been a theatre producer, I&apos;d have been an interfering architect. The Victoria Palace is the best house designed\u00a0by the great Frank Matcham from the point of view of intimacy and sightlines, and will have an extra stage depth of\u00a020ft.&quot; Mackintosh is equally fired up by the new Sondheim and juggles a sheaf of architectural plans with\u00a0the enthusiasm of a madcap Christopher Wren. But what will the Sondheim be used for? &quot;I want it,&quot; says Mackintosh, &quot;to give a longer life to some of the best work from the subsidised houses in London and the regions. I&apos;ve talked to the two Nicks [Hytner and Starr from the National Theatre] and they say it would have been perfect for the transfer of the musical, London Road. A show like the Young Vic&apos;s The Scottsboro Boys would also have been ideal for this space. Or it could have taken National Theatre Scotland&apos;s Black Watch. The idea is to run each show for eight to 16 weeks but not to plan too far ahead so we can take in shows from, say, the Royal Court or the Menier or the Chichester Minerva that deserve wider\u00a0exposure.&quot; Mackintosh quickly scotches the idea\u00a0that the Sondheim will be used to try out new musicals. But, before we get on to the controversial subject of whether the musical is a declining form living off its golden past, I am intrigued to know how Mackintosh remains so sane and rooted in spite of his vast wealth. How can one not be intimidated by the knowledge one is a billionaire \u2013 especially when the information has been proclaimed on the Sunday Times super-rich list? &quot;For a start,&quot; he says, &quot;I&apos;m only worth\u00a0a billion if I want to sell my shows or theatres, which I don&apos;t propose to do. But I&apos;ve known sufficiently hard times not to be affected by wealth. I&apos;m a war baby, I was brought up with rationing and my parents always had to struggle. I remember when I was sent to boarding school \u2013 Prior Park College in Bath \u2013 my father was asked how he was going to pay the fees and he replied: &apos;In arrears.&apos; &quot;As a young producer, I also learned the hard way. One of my first shows, Anything Goes in 1969, lost \u00a340,000 in unsecured loans and another one, Home With the Dales, lost another \u00a310,000 because no one wanted to see it. And I&apos;ve never forgotten the dagger in my heart of a show called After Shave, which I hoped would be a female Beyond the Fringe, and which turned out a complete disaster.     Miss Saigon is one of Mackintosh's biggest successes. Photograph: Tristram Kenton    &quot;I survived because I never took on big responsibilities in my private life. In the early days I lived on two or three pounds a week and learned to cook \u2013 and I&apos;m a good cook \u2013 because I had to. Even when I went on holiday, I stayed in other people&apos;s houses. Now I can take friends on holiday and, if I wanted to, could afford a private jet. But, if I&apos;m taking a short flight to Scotland or the continent, I travel economy. I go on EasyJet all the time and I&apos;ve got my travel pass for the underground, which I use whenever I&apos;m dashing between different rehearsal rooms. Like Ed Miliband, I probably couldn&apos;t tell you my week&apos;s grocery bill but I use public transport for two reasons. It&apos;s often the most practical way to get around London and it&apos;s important for me to know what it means to someone to fork out \u00a350 or \u00a360 for one of my shows. I\u00a0realise that the people who&apos;ve made my fortune are people who have to budget carefully and who want value for\u00a0money.&quot; Mackintosh is, in no sense, a\u00a0tightwad. He has set up a foundation that supports numerous charities, individuals and theatrical projects including an annual Oxford professorship at St Catherine&apos;s College. He even, in 1998, gave a handsome donation to the Labour party. When I\u00a0ask if he is likely to repeat that, he offers an emphatic &quot;No&quot;, adding: &quot;I&apos;ll\u00a0never vote for them again because of their incompetence.&quot; But, Mackintosh remains a benign capitalist and one who\u00a0has never insulated himself from daily reality. &quot;I&apos;m privileged,&quot; he says, &quot;to have had some success but I&apos;ve never forgotten what it was like to queue for a half-crown gallery seat for Oliver! which is why I ensure that there\u00a0are \u00a320 day tickets for Miss Saigon and that the balconies in my theatres are \u00a0as comfortable as I can possibly make them.&quot; To use an old-fashioned term, Cameron Mackintosh is a good egg. He only bridles when I suggest that the musical, despite its economic buoyancy, is living off its back catalogue. For all the success of Les Mis, Phantom and Miss Saigon, new musicals, I suggest, are thin on the ground and recent much-touted entries such as Andrew Lloyd Webber&apos;s Stephen Ward and Tim Rice&apos;s From Here to Eternity have not survived long. There even seems little room for a modest show such as Betty Blue Eyes by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, which Mackintosh originally produced and which had only a brief West End run\u00a0in 2011. &quot;I disagree with you,&quot; he says. &quot;To take the specific case of Betty Blue Eyes, the only problem was one of timing. We were too close to the royal wedding and the economic crisis. But the show&apos;s just been wonderfully revived in Colchester, is going on a six-month tour and has been a great success in America. &quot;What you forget is that a lot of the shows we now regard as classics didn&apos;t make it the first time round. Cabaret had\u00a0only an eight-month run in London\u00a0in the late 1960s, even with Judi\u00a0Dench, and Sondheim&apos;s Sweeney Todd was not a big hit when it was first done at Drury Lane.&quot; But don&apos;t musicals now have to be epic and expensive in order to succeed? Is there still room for shows such as Trelawny or The Card, both of which Mackintosh himself produced in the early 1970s? &quot;Of course, there is,&quot; he says. &quot;Two of the biggest hits in London right now are Matilda and The Book of Mormon. Both are medium-sized musicals, both slightly oddball and both attracting huge audiences because of the quality of the writing and imaginative staging. There are also far more venues for new musicals than when I started out. Today you can take a project to the Menier or Southwark Playhouse in London or to Leicester, Leeds, Sheffield or Chichester. In the old days, it was shit-or-bust but today there are far more opportunities. No producer, however, can put together a hit musical if the material isn&apos;t there.&quot; Several times Mackintosh makes the point that producers can&apos;t instigate shows: they can only hope to find good material and make it better. But is it true that he interferes in every aspect of a\u00a0production? &quot;I suppose,&quot; he says, &quot;I&apos;m a bit of an &apos;eminence grisly&apos; but my sole aim is to get the show right. &quot;I&apos;m proud of the fact that I&apos;ve taken a lot of big directors, such as Trevor Nunn and Nick Hytner, who were musical virgins, and introduced them to the form. I also supervise every single word of the script and every note of the orchestration and I&apos;m at the knee of the lighting designer all the time. But, when the show&apos;s in rehearsal, I only pop in two or three times a week early on, then I let the director and choreographer get on with it. To be a good producer, you need to be able to distance yourself. If a director wants my approbation for everything they do, I know it&apos;s going to\u00a0be a disaster.&quot; What is fascinating about Mackintosh is that he&apos;s now in the third stage of a long career. First there was the perpetually hard-up young tyro who never really hit the jackpot until the revue Side by Side by Sondheim in 1976: a show he booked sight unseen since he missed a Sunday-night try-out in Wavendon by driving up the M4 instead of the M1. Then came the prolific middle period in the 1980s and 90s when shows such as Cats, Les Mis, Phantom and Miss Saigon helped transform the musical from a national product into an international franchise.     The cast of Les Miserables. Photograph: Michael Le Poer Trench    But he is equally excited by what he is doing now \u2013 in what he calls his &quot;daddy period&quot; \u2013 which is to offer new productions of old hits, or even the odd failure such as Moby Dick. &quot;I find it curious,&quot; he says, &quot;that no\u00a0one thinks twice about there being a dozen different Hamlets or King Lears but people seem sceptical about revived musicals. But I feel that, however brilliant the original production was, you can&apos;t expect a new audience to get the same frisson from it. That&apos;s why I&apos;m doing Miss Saigon with a new director, Laurence Connor, and a totally fresh design team. I&apos;ve also just opened a new version of Les Mis on Broadway. And I&apos;ve got Miss Saigon opening in Tokyo in eight weeks&apos; time, then it&apos;s off to Australia for Les Mis, then back here for the national tour of Brian Conley in Barnum and, next, Mary Poppins in\u00a0Vienna in October. &quot;I actually thought around the time of The Witches of Eastwick in 2000 that I&apos;d come to the natural end of my producing life. What I never foresaw was that the circle would complete itself and I&apos;d be doing new versions of the shows of 20 or 30 years ago.&quot; Like the rest of us, though on a bigger scale, Cameron Mackintosh is full of contradictions. He itemises his whirlwind activity over the next year with obvious relish. In the next breath he tells me that what he really wants is to be at home in the country: in his case the medieval Somerset priory he shares with his long-term partner, Michael Le Poer Trench, which they run as a thriving farm (&quot;We&apos;ve got two dairies and 600 or 700 cows&quot;). He is a producer with every fibre of his being \u2013 even at school he was nicknamed Darryl F Mackintosh in a nod to a legendary Hollywood mogul \u2013 and yet offers a modest definition of his role: &quot;My greatest talent,&quot; he says, &quot;is to be a chameleon and, providing someone has written something interesting, to be the catalyst to make it work.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 30 May to correct a ticket price"}, {"sentences": ["Finally, last September, the same day that Tokyo beat Madrid for the right to host of the 2020 Olympics, he hung a picture of him eating sushi in a Japanese restaurant."], "tags": ["Spain", "World Cup 2014", "World Cup 2014 Group B", "World Cup", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-31T13:00:00Z", "title": "World Cup 2014: Spain \u2013 the secrets behind the players", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/31/world-cup-2014-spain-secrets-players", "article": "This article is part of the Guardian&apos;s World Cup 2014 Experts&apos; Network, a co-operation between 32 of the best media organisations from the countries who have qualified for the finals in Brazil. theguardian.com is running previews from four countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 12 June.

The Barcelona midfielder wanted to end his international career after Euro 2012 but Vicente del Bosque convinced him to extend playing for another two years. The &apos;brain&apos; of Terrassa, 34, will play his last World Cup and, this time, after the tournament, will surely retire from the national team. Diego Costa Though it may sound incredible, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid signed him from Portguese side Braga seven years ago, when the striker had only played a couple of seasons in professional football. Costa, named Diego after Maradona, and whose father and brother are called by Jair after Jairzinho, was born in Brazil, came to Europe at a young age and signed his first contract at the age of 18. It is precisely this lack of experience in football training which has influenced his lack of discipline and combative and sometimes violent nature. Well aware of this are internationals like Sergio Ramos, Jordi Alba and Xabi Alonso, who have all had clashes with their new international team-mate at club level in recent years. &quot;I grew up thinking that to elbow another player was normal&quot;, he told the BBC, while playing on loan at Rayo Vallecano. In spite of his style of play, always on the edge, off the field he is a shy and very reserved. Sergio Busquets Sergio Busquets was born in Badia del Valles, one of the cities with the highest rate of unemployment in Spain. Fortunately for those who bear his name work has never been lacking. His father was a professional goalkeeper for Barcelona and his grandfather was also a keeper ... but for a school in the area. A public school like the one Busquets was educated in in Badia, even though his parents could have chosen a private one. After winning the World Cup in South Africa in Johannesburg, Busquets wore the scarf his first team, CD Badia, a gesture recognised with tears in his hometown. After that, the council decided that the local stadium where this humble club plays was to be named &apos;Sergio Busquets Burgos&apos;. Sergio Ramos Of all the Twitter accounts managed by Spanish internationals, Sergio Ramos&apos;s one shines with its own light. In its history there is a bit of everything, especially blunders. On an American tour, he dubbed the San Antonio Spurs with the name of San Francisco and posted a picture of Las Vegas when the message that accompanied it was &apos;What a spectacular city is New York&apos;. Also widely commented on was his congratulations to the women&apos;s water polo national team 24 days after their victory in the World Cup final held last summer in Barcelona. The reason for the delay in his message was that the game he watched was deferred, while he thought it was live. Finally, last September, the same day that Tokyo beat Madrid for the right to host of the 2020 Olympics, he hung a picture of him eating sushi in a Japanese restaurant. Fortunately, his distraction only affects his relationship only with social networking, because Ramos looks in good shape heading into the World Cup. Koke That Atl\u00e9tico&apos;s midfielder is a tireless player is evidenced by his stats: he is the Spanish players with the most appearances for his club during the last season \u2013 58 games between La Liga (36), Copa del Rey (9) and the Champions League (13). And there is more to come. It will be his third consecutive summer without taking a break. In 2012 he was part of the Spanish Olympic team; in 2013 he won the European Under-21 tournament in Israel and this summer he will make his debut in a World Cup. The one thing he may not be good at is celebrations. During the celebrations of Atl\u00e9tico winning the Europa League, in 2012, he made a bad choice wearing a scarf with a skull known as Totenkopf, symbol banned by Uefa for being associated with neo-Nazi movements. The player apologised and said he did not know the meaning of the skull. Last month, he did not appear at the beginning of the party when Atl\u00e9tico celebrated their La Liga victory. He said that he had felt &quot;unwell&quot; but a few people wondered whether his absence was due to having drunk too much alcohol.

Tim Cahill Australia&apos;s most famous football face in Brazil almost never played for the Socceroos. At the age of 14, he was picked for the Samoa national team with his brother, Chris. A family man, Cahill explained later that it was a good chance to get an all-expenses paid trip to visit his sick grandmother in Samoa. While Chris Cahill went on to captain Samoa, Tim took Fifa to court to play for Australia. He missed gaining experience in Australian youth teams, but when Fifa changed their eligibility rules in 2003, Tim was theoretically able to choose to represent five different national teams. Thankfully for Australia, he chose the country of his birth. Speaking of youth development, every one of Cahill&apos;s junior clubs now squabbles over his legacy. Sydney United, the Croatian backed club in Sydney&apos;s western suburbs, have Twitter battles with Sydney Olympic, a Greek-backed side from a little further south, while Belmore Hercules also chimes in from time to time. Millwall, Cahill&apos;s first club in England, must look at it all with bemusement. Bloody convicts. Speaking of convicts, the Cahill Expressway in Sydney, named after a former New South Wales Premier Joseph Cahill, was briefly renamed the Tim Cahill Expressway in June 2013. Jason Davidson The little-known Jason Davidson plays in the Netherlands for Heracles Almelo. His father Alan was also a Socceroo, part of several squads during the 1980s, and was named as part of the greatest ever Australian team in 2012. Not that he sat back and let his dad&apos;s reputation help him coast by. At the age of 14 he was sent to an elite Tokyo boarding school \u2013 his grandmother is Japanese \u2013 specialising in football. He was a minute late for his first training session and as punishment had his head shaved \u2013 along with all those of his team-mates. Davidson cried every day at the start of his time in Japan but said it helped him toughen up. &quot;It was hell,&quot; he later told the Melbourne Age. &quot;There were guys that got broken noses and all sorts of injuries by the coaches. In a way, I was lucky.&quot; Mile Jedinak Werrington Croatia&apos;s favourite son, Mile Jedinak is the only Australian who has started regularly for his club in the Premier League. As more young Australians move to Holland, Germany and various Asian leagues, Jedinak is holding it down for Aussies in England with Crystal Palace. It is an unlikely rise to fame. Overlooked initially by the new A-League clubs in 2005, Jedinak played for Sydney United in the NSW state leagues before earning a contract with Central Coast Mariners in 2006. Nicknamed &apos;Inspector Gadget Legs&apos; by his former coach at the Mariners, Lawrie McKinna, Jedinak led the Premier League table of tackles and interceptions last season. Mat Ryan Ryan won all there was to win with the Central Coast Mariners. In just three seasons at the club Ryan won two premierships, a grand final, the goalkeeper of the year award and the young footballer of the year gong twice in a row. With the retirement of Mark Schwarzer from international duty \u2013 Ryan had a poster of Schawarzer on his wall as a boy \u2013 and Ryan&apos;s recent good form at Club Brugge, it dovetails nicely for the young goalkeeper to start in Brazil. Rumour was he was being scouted by Real Madrid, although it appears his former coach, Graham Arnold, might have been getting a little carried away. Still, the former Anderlecht keeper Wim De Coninck commented that it is only a matter of time before Ryan leaves Brugge, and the World Cup might be a launching pad for a move to a bigger club. Tom Rogic The last time Australia were preparing for a World Cup, in 2010, Tom Rogic was playing in the AFC Futsal Tournament in Uzbekistan. He also had a mullet. How times change. Now Rogic is a bona fide star and has a more sensible short back and sides. He featured in Nike&apos;s kit launch and is hyped as &apos;the next big thing&apos; in Australian football, and yet Rogic is yet to play a full game for the Socceroos. Likely to be used sparingly by Ange Postecoglou \u2013 especially considering his relative lack of game time at Melbourne Victory \u2013 Rogic could be one of the surprise packages at the World Cup. Mark Milligan An almost certain starter in the centre of midfield in Brazil, Milligan is one of many Socceroos who ply their trade in the A-League. In 2006, &apos;Millsy&apos; - who had completed just one season for Sydney FC - was the shock selection in Guus Hiddink&apos;s squad for Germany. He didn&apos;t start any games, but featured in the Asian Cup a year later. The 20-year-old was then rumoured to sign for Manchester City, Porto, Arsenal and Werder Bremen. The move to Europe never materialised however, and Milligan instead went to Asia, playing at Shanghai Shenhua and JEF United Chiba. An earthquake drove him back to Melbourne Victory, where he is currently captain. He has been poised to move to Crystal Palace in England and Baniyas in the United Arab Emirates this season, but again nothing has eventuated. Still, with a coach who respects A-League talent, home has provided Milligan with a good platform to stake a case for Brazil. Ange Postecoglou All eyes are on Ange. The first Australian to coach the Socceroos to a World Cup since Rale Rasic in 1974, Postecoglou is a media darling in Australia. Seven years ago it was a vastly different story, after Postecoglou was sacked by the FFA for failing to qualify for the under-20s World Cup. An infamous interview with the prominent pundit, Craig Foster, didn&apos;t help his case, but made for great television. Postecoglou is no stranger to Brazil, however.

We were a couple \u00a0of hours from Tokyo on the Boso peninsula: the view from the train started with a succession of dull dormitory towns, but suddenly switched to green knobbly hills and flat rice fields. Yosuke&apos;s parents-in-law, US-born photojournalist Everett Kennedy Brown and his wife Deco Nakajima, a teacher of macrobiotic cooking, moved here 15 years ago, tired of living in Tokyo with their five children. They bought the two-acre farm and set about shaking off their urban selves, farming sustainably and organically, drawing on centuries of rural Japanese wisdom. This is a well-trodden path in Europe or America but, driving us in his biodiesel car from nearby Chojamachi station, Everett told me that here it&apos;s unusual. In Japan, few would choose simple and natural over modern and hi-tech, he said.      Their city friends still think they are mad, but several of them enjoyed coming to stay, and eventually the idea was born of opening a guesthouse. On a bright, breezy afternoon, a young family from Tokyo were playing ball in front of one of the two guest cottages in the field in front of the farmhouse. Visitors can also stay in one of four rough-and-ready but appealing treehouses connected by Ewok-style wooden walkways. We wandered with Yosuke and his baby daughter among bamboo groves, vegetable plots and rice paddies in which dozens of white ducks waddled contentedly. It&apos;s called aigamo nohou, duck-farming, Everett later told us. &quot;The ducks eat weeds (they can&apos;t reach the rice seedlings), their droppings act as fertiliser, and their paddling feet work it into the soil.&quot; Across the paddy, the ducks&apos; house looks like a New England clapboard church, a nod to Everett&apos;s US east coast upbringing. So far, so delightful. Then Yosuke showed us the toilets, which are of the composting variety. You wash your hands in harvested rainwater, using only in the biodegradable toiletries provided. Bedrooms are bare and functional, futons and duvets rolled in one corner. Chickens, dogs and interns (students and Wwoofing volunteers) were busy around the ramshackle-looking main farmhouse. Macrobiotic meals are eaten communally \u2013 family, staff, volunteers and guests elbow to elbow at a long table.     Tree house accommodation at Brown's Field. Photograph: Tony McNicol    But what about comfort? What if you prefer contemporary to basic? With such visitors in mind, Everett bought a big old house a short walk from Brown&apos;s Field, and opened it last year as a six-bedroom &quot;country inn&quot;. Its name, Jiji no Ie, means &quot;grandpa&apos;s house&quot;, though this would have been a very sophisticated grandfather. Five of the rooms are Japanese in style, with beautiful organic tatami on the floors, bright cushions at low tables, exquisite carving round the doors and futons hidden inside hand-painted cupboards. (A sixth room has a western bed, with billowing drapes.) There are sliding paper screens between the rooms and the corridor, a dining room with built-in woodburner, \u00a0normal flushing loos and a garden bathhouse. Everett, who has long silver hair, and a wise manner, told us how he sought out sustainable architects and designers to make the house from local timber, earth, bamboo and straw. (This baffled the local planning authorities, who \u2013 typically, said Everett \u2013 couldn&apos;t see why he eschewed factory-made materials.) In one corner of Jiji&apos;s garden is a suikinkitsu, or water harp, a feature dating from Japan&apos;s Edo era (1603-1867) \u2013 a large ceramic jar buried upside-down in the earth. Water overflowing from a stone basin trickles through the hole in its base and makes a surprising ringing sound \u2013 the unpredictability of the drops forming sweet natural music.     Rooms at Jiji no Ie    Inside, Deco, who is as tiny as her smile is huge, was preparing dinner. Meals at Jiji no Ie are mostly vegan, but with some local cheese and fish. After an aperitif of plum wine, we sat at a long, polished table made from a single length of tree trunk for an exquisite 10-course tasting menu that included homegrown red rice crisps with hummus; carrot tempura with leek flowers; a brown rice and walnut timbale with turmeric, tomato, seaweed and pumpkin seeds; and cabbage leaves stuffed with millet and cashew nuts. Macrobiotic isn&apos;t scary, said Deco, it&apos;s just a balanced diet of natural ingredients, eaten in season, with traditional fermented foods such as tofu with koji (which gives the curd a cheesy tastiness). Fermentation, she told us, produces probiotics that help us absorb more nutrients. We drank unfiltered sake made by a friend of theirs \u2013 chock-full of good yeasts and enzymes, they assured me. Can&apos;t go wrong then, I said, accepting a refill. \u00a0 We&apos;d been introduced to Everett by Bristol-based Inside Japan Tours, which now recommends Jiji&apos;s for a relaxing few days at the beginning or end of a trip (it&apos;s less than an hour from Narita airport).

Masahiko Inoha After making his J-League debut in 2006, Masahiko Inoha quickly became famous not so much for his footballing skills but for his obsession with ice cream. He proudly claimed he would eat three a day \u2013 &quot;two at the clubhouse, one after bath time&quot; \u2013 and was always on hand to offer critiques on all the latest frozen snacks to team-mates and club officials. His status as one of Alberto Zaccheroni&apos;s favourites melted somewhat after an ill-fated six months with Hajduk Split, but he denied accusations that rescinding his contract made him a flake after the Croatian side had failed to pay his wages. Toshihiro Aoyama From diligent defensive work to penetrative long passes, good looks to a unique sense of humour, surprise selection Toshihiro Aoyama has it all. His readiness to spend time joking with fans sparked a collection of anecdotes on Twitter, which he embraced by writing the associated hashtag across his bare chest and uploading a photo. Aoyama became a minor YouTube sensation in 2012 with an astonishing 69-yard strike. In celebration, he got his team-mates to line up like bowling pins at which he aimed not one, but two balls; converting a 7-10 split to complete the spare. Eiji Kawashima The positioning of foreign languages within Japanese compulsory education is similar to that in its fellow island nation, the United Kingdom, but Kawashima knew from a young age that if he was to be a star footballer, he would have to get learning. Plus, in his own words, he thought he would &quot;look cool to others if [he] could speak English fluently&quot;. Brief spells training with Parma and Udinese early in his career led him to study Italian, which he exhibited with remarkable fluency as a guest on the Sky Italia show Speciale Calciomercato in 2012. The Portuguese interpreter at Kawashima&apos;s old club, Kawasaki Frontale, claims he had no problems conversing with his Brazilian teammates, and after dabbling with Spanish and Dutch, four years playing in Belgium means he is now perfectly comfortable giving television interviews in French as well. Indeed, his equally fluent English is now laced with a soft but noticeable Francophone twang, which \u2013 you&apos;ve got to hand it to him \u2013 does make him look pretty cool. Yasuyuki Konno Usually deployed as a centre-back under Zaccheroni, Japan&apos;s versatile answer to John O&apos;Shea scored the decisive goal in a frantic five-way title race in 2005 when his equaliser for FC Tokyo demoted Cerezo Osaka from first to fifth in the final minute of the season and allowed their local rivals, Gamba Osaka, to steal glory instead. The following April, Konno became the only opposition player in memory to gain a rousing pre-match cheer from the champions&apos; notorious ultras. He later donned the blue and black shirt himself to help Gamba to the J2 championship in 2013, but only after they went from perennial trophy contenders to relegation following his arrival from Tokyo the previous year. Hiroshi Kiyotake Having made his international debut just three months earlier, Hiroshi Kiyotake enjoyed a glamorous 22nd birthday in November 2011, travelling from Tajikistan to North Korea as Japan sought to secure their way through the first stage of World Cup qualification. For those of us watching on television, the Samurai Blue&apos;s first visit to Pyongyang since 1989 was like a journey into history \u2013 only in high definition \u2013 filled with Cold War-style military uniforms, mass games propaganda, and plenty of (choreographed) anti-Japanese sentiment. For a young footballer who actually had to go there and be part of it, however, it was all a little daunting. Spooked by the dark corridors and silent, expressionless North Korean security guards monitoring each floor of their hotel, Kiyotake chose to abandon his own bed and share a single room with the goalkeeper Shusaku Nishikawa, three years his senior in the Oita Trinita youth setup where both began their careers.

The underlying theme for Alberto Zaccheroni during his four-year reign in charge of the Samurai Blue has been to prepare a side capable of embracing the global stage on their own terms. After the previous manager Takeshi Okada sealed qualification for the last World Cup in South Africa in June 2009, he discovered that opponents of a higher standard than those faced in the Asian preliminaries had little problem exploiting the vast space that opened up between Japan&apos;s creative midfield and their capable but slow centre-backs. Embarrassing capitulations in friendlies against Holland, Serbia, and South Korea prompted an emergency tactical reshuffle on the eve of the World Cup, with Yuki Abe brought in as an extra defensive midfielder and Keisuke Honda deployed as a false nine with no genuine forwards. The move was a great success as Japan reached the knockout stages on foreign soil for the first time, though the sense was that Paraguay were there for the taking in the last 16 if only Okada&apos;s men had approached the game more positively before going out on penalties. Installing an Italian as his successor, however, was not an indication that Japan were to persist with a conservative approach. Zaccheroni immediately dispensed with a number of the old guard, reinstated the 4-2-3-1 formation, and sought to mould an exciting new team around the younger attacking midfielders and full-backs beginning to make waves in European club football. Argentina were sensationally beaten in his debut match at the helm, while his first competitive action at the 2011 Asian Cup saw Japan steadily grow in prowess as the tournament progressed to seal outright victory. Encouragingly, from a long-term perspective, &apos;Zac Japan&apos; have always saved their most effective performances for higher-level opponents; even if they do sometimes struggle to break down weaker continental teams content to park the bus. The 24th man in 2010, Shinji Kagawa instantly became a key player for Zaccheroni as he did for J\u00fcrgen Klopp, but despite earning the No10 shirt for his national team, the Manchester United man is seldom deployed in the centre. The hub of the side, instead, is Honda, whose demanding attitude, composure, and consistency \u2013 at least in a Japan shirt \u2013 makes him the ideal orchestrator for their fast, fluid attacking play. Increasingly, over the past couple of years, Honda adopts a slightly withdrawn starting position to link more effectively with the two volante \u2013 Japanese imports its word for deep-lying or defensive midfielders from Brazil \u2013 while Kagawa and the third attacking midfielder move inside to offer short, triangular passes. This allows Yuto Nagatomo and Atsuto Uchida to bomb forward from full-back, with Honda then arriving late into the penalty area and providing a potent additional goal threat. Perhaps ironically, Japan&apos;s obvious weakness is now in defence, and particularly at centre-back. At last year&apos;s Confederations Cup, the Samurai Blue dominated Italy high up the pitch for 70 minutes but conceded four times in the other 20 to lose 4-3, while suffering miserable defeats to Brazil and Mexico in games where their attacking players failed to shine. This prompted rather haughty cries of naivete in the international press, but the fact is that Japan depend upon their high line; they function best both attackingly and defensively when the front players press high and the volante gain time on the ball around or beyond the halfway line. It is when they sit back, or allow themselves to be pushed back, that they start to crumble. Ideally, Maya Yoshida would have enjoyed more playing time at Southampton this season, and a young J-League centre-back would have broken through to take the place of the utility man Yasuyuki Konno \u2013 who doesn&apos;t even get picked in defence for a notoriously porous Gamba Osaka. But that hasn&apos;t happened, so Japan are better off going for it and playing to their strengths. The biggest criticism of Zaccheroni has been his reluctance to try new things \u2013 barring an ineffective experiment with his old 3-4-3 as a Plan B \u2013 or new personnel. However, the East Asian Cup in July 2013 required the former Milan and Juventus manager to select a squad of domestic-based players, which has seemed to refresh his thinking a little. No fewer than six of his list of 23 for Brazil made their international debuts in that tournament, including the 26-year-old FC Tokyo defender Masato Morishige, as well as the forwards Yoichiro Kakitani and Yuya Osako. Kakitani scored in Japan&apos;s 3-2 victory away to Belgium last November, but it was Osako, now of 1860 Munich, who really caught the eye with a goal and an assist for Honda during an impressive 2-2 draw away to the Netherlands four days earlier. That said, arguably the most significant new arrival is the midfield dynamo Hotaru Yamaguchi of Cerezo Osaka, a member of the Japan under-23 team that finished fourth at the London 2012 Olympics. During the senior side&apos;s autumn tour in Europe, his work-rate and ball-winning ability imparted greater cohesion and made life much easier for either his captain Makoto Hasebe or the 141-cap Yasuhito Endo alongside him. It may well be that Japan&apos;s two veteran volante are now playing for one spot next to Yamaguchi, who celebrated his World Cup call-up by abandoning his trademark peroxide coiffure and re-dying it black. Hiroshi Kiyotake of N\u00fcrnberg has often been favoured for the right-midfield position, but Shinji Okazaki has sparkled \u2013 albeit in a more advanced role \u2013 since joining Mainz at the beginning of this season and looks the favourite to start in Brazil. The Standard Li\u00e8ge goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima is prone to the odd moment of madness but will likely edge out Shusaku Nishikawa of Urawa Reds. Who is the player who is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup? Japan may still lack a top-class goalscorer, but they don&apos;t necessarily need one as long as the striker facilitates those just behind him. As he showed against Holland, Yuya Osako can be that man. The 23-year-old sometimes flattered to deceive during his first four years at Kashima Antlers and was dropped from the Japan squad for the London Olympics. But 19 J-League goals in 2013 earned him a chance at the East Asian Cup, before that excellent performance against Holland where he combined so well with Honda, Kagawa, and Okazaki. A January move to the Bundesliga second tier appeared risky six months ahead of the World Cup, but Osako has been a regular performer for mid-table 1860 Munich, top scoring with six goals in just 15 appearances. Who is the player who is going to disappoint the most? The clear issue is in defence, but since expectations there are so low as a result, it probably would not count as a disappointment if the back line imploded. As a colleague at JSports recently pointed out, Honda may be the absolute central player to whom injury would be most devastating, but because he is such a consistent performer, Japan&apos;s fortunes actually depend more on the form of Shinji Kagawa. It is vital for the side&apos;s attacking fluency that the former Borussia Dortmund star is confident and on his game. There is little point in Honda pulling all the strings in midfield if Kagawa is moping about his difficult season at Old Trafford and cannot exert similar levels of influence. What is the realistic aim for your team at the World Cup and why? To go one step better than South Africa 2010 and reach the quarter-finals. Under Zaccheroni, Japan no longer have to compromise their attacking capabilities as they did four years ago, and as they have shown over the past 12 months against Italy, Holland, and Belgium \u2013 as well as Argentina and France earlier in Zac&apos;s reign \u2013 on their day they are capable of troubling and beating the very best sides in international football. However, when forced backwards their defence can capitulate to almost any opponent, so it will be vital for Japan to seize their attacking rhythm early on in matches and remain on the front foot. There are by no means any guarantees of escaping a very challenging, evenly-matched group with Ivory Coast, Greece and Colombia, but doing so would give them plenty of confidence ahead of a potential clash with England or rematch against Italy in the last 16.

The Canadian singer&apos;s camp have known about the video, shot when he was younger, for some time and have tried to prevent its release, according to the newspaper. It is the latest and perhaps most damaging controversy to engulf the superstar beloved of teenage girls. He apologised in April after posting a photograph that showed him standing in front of the contentious Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo. China and South Korea regard Yasukuni, which honours leaders executed for war crimes among 2.5 million Japanese war dead, as a potent symbol of Japanese militarism. The singer removed the image but only after it had been tweeted to his 51.1 million followers and attracted 660,000 likes on Instagram. Bieber later said he had been unaware of the shrine&apos;s controversial role. In January, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, together with the singer Khalil, on suspicion of driving under the influence, driving with an expired licence and resisting arrest without violence. Police said that Bieber told authorities he had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana and taken prescription drugs. In the same month, Bieber surrendered to Toronto police, who charged him with assaulting a limousine driver in the city last December.

Manuel Neuer saves but cannot hold on. Henry squares the rebound across the goal. Aged 17 years, seven months and four days, and still studying for his school exams, Bojan Krkic taps home the winning goal in a Champions League quarter-final. Krkic had all the attributes we have come to expect from a La Masia graduate. He was skillful, he had wonderful balance, he was quick and he was a better dribbler than a baby with teething problems. He could score goals too. He joined the Catalan Club at the age of nine and within seven years he had over 850 to his name. Aged 15, he was joint top-scorer at the 2006 Under-17 European Championships. A year later and he scored the winning goal for Spain in the final of the same tournament. He beat Lionel Messi\u2019s record as the youngest player to score in La Liga for Bar\u00e7a by nearly eight-and-a-half months and soon after he became the first footballer born in the 1990s to play in the Champions League. The compliments came in the almost the same numbers as the youth-team goals. \u201cBojan is a treasure,\u201d purred the then Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard. \u201cThere are only a few players who have a magical touch,\u201d said Pep Guardiola, \u201cand Bojan is one of them.\u201d Some saw him as the new Messi. Others compared him to Ra\u00fal. Spain and Serbia \u2013 his father\u2019s homeland; his mother is Catalan \u2013 fought for him to represent them. They both believed they needed him. So too did Barcelona. The squad was overloaded with overloaded stars who had grown too comfortable and too complacent. There were whispers that injuries had been invented as excuses to leave out certain players and while Barcelona batted away rumours of Rijkaard\u2019s demise, it became clear that the Dutchman was not much longer for the club. In stark contrast to that mess, here was this young star, untainted and with a smile that lit up like Tokyo at night. As Sid Lowe pointed out, one Spanish (and non-Catalan) newspaper even pictured him in a cape with his underpants on the outside and a B on his chest. Here was Krkic swooping to the rescue. In 2007/08 he made 48 appearance, scored 12 goals and set up another six. For a teenager to record such numbers for such a big club on his first season in La Liga is nothing short of miraculous. But with great expectations comes great pressure and Krkic could not cope with it. He was called up to the Spain squad but he pulled out with a what was reported to be a panic attack. He was called up for Euro 2008 but once again he pulled out. He was, he said, \u201cphysically and emotionally shattered\u201d. \u201cPressure was being heaped on very young shoulders,\u201d wrote Lowe. \u201cHe\u2019d gone from a 16-year-old inhabiting one world to a 17-year-old living somewhere completely different.\u201d \u201cOvernight, I couldn\u2019t even walk down the street,\u201d Krkic said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go to a birthday party or to the cinema.\u201d By the start of the 2008/09 season, there was a new man in change. The loss of the Dutch manager was a big blow for Krkic. \u201cRijkaard had complete trust in me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has a great personality. I had a relationship with him that I haven\u2019t had with anyone else.\u201d Under Pep Guardiola, Krkic fell behind in the pecking order and started to get fewer and fewer appearances, making less and less of an impact when he did play. This soon led to a falling out between him and Guardiola and after two more sparse seasons, Krkic would leave the club in 2011 without saying goodbye to him. \u201cAs a fan,\u201d Krkic said, \u201cGuardiola is the best coach in the world, but personal things that have happened to me [that] were hurtful. He was not fair with me on several occasions, and this is one of the reasons that I decided to leave.\u201d Roma seemed like an obvious choice. The man who had replaced Guardiola as the manager of the Barcelona B team, Luis Enrique, was in charge and the club\u2019s owners were eager for the team to play in a way that Krkic was more than familiar with. \u201cLuis Enrique represents an idea of football that we would like to follow which imposes itself today through Spain and Barcelona,\u201d said Roma\u2019s sporting director Walter Sabatini. At Roma, he had plenty of playing time to impress \u2013 he made 33 appearances in his first season, more than any other player that season \u2013 and in patches he did, scoring seven goals in his first season. However, his form was inconsistent and he failed to impose himself on games. Easy chances were often spurned and he was quickly overshadowed by other players within the squad. His lack of strength \u2013 not so much an issue in Spain \u2013 held him back and the suspicions about his lack of mental toughness raised their heads once more. \u201cThere are a lot of strong personalities in Serie A and Bojan wasn\u2019t one of them,\u201d says Italian football correspondent Susy Campanale. \u201cHe was very quiet and seemingly lacking in confidence. He was also accustomed to a different tactical style and Spanish forwards have traditionally struggled in Italy. They are not accustomed to being marked so firmly and expect far more time and space on the ball than they\u2019re allowed in Serie A. Bojan expected more than most. He needed to barge his way into the game a bit more but wanted to always have the classy move without the hard work that goes with it.\u201d The end of his first season at Roma saw Luis Enrique leave the club and Krkic soon followed him. He decided to try his luck with a loan move to Milan. He started just nine games \u2013 he made a further 14 appearances from the bench \u2013 scored just three goals and made the sort of impact on the Rossoneri that a fly has landing on a brown bear. It was the same old problems but he was not helped by his contract situation. \u201cIt was reported,\u201d says Campanale, \u201cthat the clause in his contract meant Milan would have to buy him out permanently if he amassed a certain number of appearances, so towards the end of the season they simply stopped using him.\u201d For a player in desperate need of a club to inject some confidence in him, that must have been a cruel blow. From Milan, he continued his journey north, this time to Ajax. Like with his move to Roma, this seemed like the sensible option. Historically, Ajax play the sort of possession and passing game that would suit Krkic\u2019s style and the Eredivisie\u2019s reputation was not built on the motto that \u2018might is right\u2019. \u201cWhen Bojan was signed by Ajax, it was seen as quite a coup,\u201d says Michiel Jongsma from BeNeFoot. \u201cIn Eredivisie measures, it was as if a superstar had arrived because usually the type of player that joins the league is a either a promising talent or an unknown player. In Bojan, they had the combination of a name well known in Europe and still the promise of someone who could go on to become a very good player.\u201d His performance in a pre-season friendly against Werder Bremen must have had Ajax fans rubbing their hands with glee. Stationed wide on the right, Krkic was a constant menace against the decent German opposition. He worked hard, combined well with his new team-mates, produced flick after trick, made some intelligent runs, set up one goal and scored another. But it was not long however before that glee evaporated into thin air. According to OptaJohan, it took him 665 playing minutes to score his first goal for the club \u2013 he would only add three more to his season\u2019s tally \u2013 and although he had three assist in his first six league games, he would record no more for the season (by means of comparison, Christian Eriksen had five before he moved to Tottenham). \u201cI\u2019m delighted for Bojan because he just does everything right on the field,\u201d Rijkaard once said. \u201cEvery decision he takes is the right one.\u201d At Ajax last season, his decision-making stood out but for the wrong reasons. \u201cHe starts dribbles when a pass would be more appropriate,\u201d says Jongsma. \u201cHe has also found himself in decent positions to shoot but he waits for someone he could pass to.\u201d All signs pointed to the return of those problems. Krkic\u2019s dip in form has seen the fans turn on him too. From the player they expected major things from, he has become a player who is seen as a major impasse in the progression of youth team players. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed this season,\u201d said Krkic, \u201cand I have to evaluate the pros and cons.\u201d So too will Ajax, or any club or manager who thinks they can revive the flagging fortunes of a player who was once had the world at his feet."}, {"sentences": ["The KGB even sent two agents to my office in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Art and design", "Culture", "Tetris", "Games", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-02T16:58:37Z", "title": "Tetris: how we made the addictive computer game", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jun/02/how-we-made-tetris", "article": "Alexey Pajitnov, programmer  In the early 80s, I worked at the computing lab for the Academy of Science of the USSR, researching artificial intelligence. It was one of the very few Soviet institutes able to communicate with the rest of the world, so people occasionally sent us new hardware. We&apos;d assess how powerful it was by writing a simple program for it, which became my excuse for making games. I&apos;ve loved puzzles ever since I was a child, especially pentominoes. You could get three of these geometric games for a rouble in Moscow toyshops. In June 1984, it occurred to me that they might be a good basis for a computer game. But having the 12 pentomino pieces rotating in real time seemed too complicated, so I scaled it down to tetrominoes, of which there are seven. Also, the Electronika 60, the Russian computer I originally wrote Tetris for, didn&apos;t have proper graphics, just a monitor that could display text, so I used letters to form the playing pieces. Next I put together the procedures for manipulating the pieces: pick a tile, flip it, rotate it. But the playfield filled up in 20 seconds flat. Also, once you&apos;d filled a line, it was kind of dead, so why keep it on the screen? So I made each full line disappear, which was key. I was a pretty good programmer and it took me about three weeks to get something controllable on screen. I pretended I was debugging my program, but in truth I just couldn&apos;t stop playing it. When other people tried it, they couldn&apos;t, either. It was so abstract \u2013 that was its great quality. It appealed to everybody. I had no idea how to publish it. I suspected that trying to would get me into trouble, but the PC version had been smuggled to Hungary and western companies started producing unauthorised versions. Perestroika had started, so I granted my rights to the government for 10 years. It was among the first pieces of software exported by the Soviet Union. Spectrum HoloByte, the US company who produced one of the earlier versions, had a big influence on how it was marketed. I found all those matryoshka dolls and churches a bit tacky, but they helped sales. They chose Korobeiniki, a 19th-century Russian folk song, for the music; and Nintendo later included Tchaikovsky&apos;s Nutcracker theme. It was very embarrassing for me: when kids of the world hear these pieces of music, they start screaming: &quot;Tetris! Tetris!&quot; That&apos;s not very good for Russian culture. I didn&apos;t make much money at first, but I was happy, because my main priority was to see people enjoying my game. Tetris came along early and had a very important role in breaking down ordinary people&apos;s inhibitions in front of computers, which were scary objects to non-professionals used to pen and paper. But the fact that something so simple and beautiful could appear on screen destroyed that barrier.     Impossible to stop playing... Tetris.    Henk Rogers, videogame licenser  My job in the 80s was acquiring games for the Japanese market. When I first came across Tetris in January 1988, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, I was hooked instantly, which was unusual. I licensed every version on every system I could through Spectrum HoloByte. But it turned out their parent company, Mirrorsoft [owned by Robert Maxwell], had already given some of the Japanese rights I thought I owned to Atari. It was a total mess, so when it came to securing the Game Boy rights, I went straight to Moscow to speak to Elorg, the bureau handling the export of software. I didn&apos;t know anyone in the capital, or where the ministry was. The Muscovites were completely unfriendly: nobody spoke English, and they weren&apos;t allowed to talk to me anyway. I&apos;d planned to get a fur coat when I arrived, but I found it impossible to buy anything, so I was freezing my ass off. I play the board game Go, so I tried to find a local Go association, thinking I could make a friend. I ended up playing the third strongest player in the Soviet Union \u2013 and I beat him. But he spoke no English. Finally, I hired an interpreter from a booth in the lobby of my hotel. They were all KGB, but she was beautiful and very perky, when everybody else was doom and gloom. She took me to Elorg, but she wouldn&apos;t take me in because I hadn&apos;t been officially invited. I was breaking a cardinal rule \u2013 trying to do business on a tourist visa \u2013 but I told her I hadn&apos;t come all this way for nothing. It was like standing on a rock 50ft above water. You just have to\u00a0jump and trust it&apos;s not going to be as bad as you think. The director of Elorg, a Mr Belikov, told me they had never given rights to anybody. I was in deep kimchi, because I had 200,000 game cartridges at $10 apiece being manufactured in Japan, and I&apos;d put up all of my in-laws&apos; property up as collateral. We reconvened the following day and they had a lineup of 10 people \u2013 KGB, business guys, lawyers, Alexey \u2013 who grilled me for two hours. I didn&apos;t realise at first, but they were negotiating simultaneously with Kevin Maxwell. The KGB even sent two agents to my office in Tokyo. Because I&apos;d had no contact with my staff, they thought: &quot;Oh my God, what&apos;s happened to Henk?&quot; But I was very open with the Russians and they decided to give me console rights. I gave them the best contract I&apos;ve ever seen in the industry \u2013 clear, concise, no bullshit \u2013 partly because there wasn&apos;t time for any renegotiations. Elorg used it as the template for all their other deals. The Maxwells were furious, and tried to lobby Gorbachev, whose autobiography they&apos;d published. Tetris made Game Boy and Game Boy made Tetris. It was the perfect platform for the game, since you could carry it around. That&apos;s how it caught on. And it&apos;s even bigger on mobiles. \u2022 World Tetris Day is on 6 June, the game&apos;s 30th anniversary."}, {"sentences": ["A Japanese newspaper reported: &quot;On quite a few occasions, officials from the Chinese embassy in Tokyo have told our editors that they were not pleased with some reports by our reporters in China.", "The Tokyo headquarters of other Japanese media have received similar visits.&quot; A European newspaper journalist said: &quot;Diplomats contacted my editor several times."], "tags": ["Media", "Press freedom", "Tiananmen Square protests 1989", "Censorship", "China", "Journalist safety", "Sky News", "USA Today"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-03T07:46:07Z", "title": "Foreign journalists in China harassed over Tiananmen Square anniversary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jun/03/press-freedom-tiananmen-square-protests-1989", "article": "International journalists working in China have been facing increasing harassment and intimidation by the authorities in the run-up to the 25th anniversary of the suppression of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square. According to the Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club of China (FCCC), it would appear that the communist party is determined to deter reporting on the massacre of demonstrators that occurred on 4-5 June 1989.  Foreign journalists and their local staffs have been summoned by public security officers to their offices to be given video-taped lectures dissuading them from reporting on the anniversary. Some reporters were warned of serious consequences should they disobey the authorities. The FCCC, in calling for a halt to interference, argues that the authorities are violating Chinese government rules governing foreign correspondents that permit them to interview anybody who consents to be interviewed.  The Beijing-based organisation, which represents 122 news organisations from 29 countries, has catalogued several examples of harassment. The tank man pictures: too &apos;sensitive&apos; to report A French broadcaster told of showing people on a Beijing street the iconic photo of the student who stood in front of a tank during the military crackdown on 5 June 1989 and attempting to interview them. Within 10 minutes police showed up and ordered the French team into a police car and took them to police station. After an hour, public security officers arrived and interrogated them.  She said: &quot;They separated us and questioned us for hours... The officer said, &apos;You were speaking about a sensitive topic. You know that the topic is sensitive and the government don&apos;t want people to speak about it.&apos;  &quot;I asked which Chinese law I broke. He answered, &apos;It&apos;s not a matter of law. It&apos;s a matter of culture. The culture is above the law.&apos;&quot;  The team were released after six hours of interrogation. The next day they were questioned again and then had to appear before a video camera and admit they had done something &quot;very sensitive&quot; which could cause &quot;disturbance&quot;. A reporter working for a north American media outlet was called to the (police) entry and exit bureau and told that security would be especially strict during the &quot;sensitive period&quot; in &quot;sensitive areas&quot;. All interviews related to the 4 June anniversary would be regarded as &quot;sensitive.&quot; A foreign TV correspondent said he found it &quot;very difficult to interview people... Several well-known intellectuals, including people who are not considered dissidents, refused to be interviewed. &quot;They expressed concern for their own freedom or fear they would not be allowed to travel or to continue their work.&quot; Reporting conditions worsen over the course of 2014 The FCCC&apos;s annual reporting conditions survey*, conducted last month, found that 99% of respondents thought reporting conditions in China do not meet international standards, with 80% feeling that conditions have worsened or stayed the same in the past year \u2013 up 10 percentage points from the May 2013 survey. Not one member said conditions had improved. One out of four respondents said the Chinese authorities had put pressure on editors at headquarters in their home country over news coverage. A Sky News journalist told the researchers:   &quot;Not just in Beijing, but also at locations across China, the authorities used plainclothes individuals to block access, intimidate interviewees and physically assault us as we attempted to report.  On one occasion, a busload of such thugs arrived, escorted by police cars. The police cars then drove away and the plainclothes thugs attacked the human rights lawyers we were with. Our equipment was damaged and we had to barricade ourselves in the local government prosecutor&apos;s office and wait four hours to be rescued.&quot;  Several TV journalists said they were subject to physical force. Attempts to cover the trial of New Citizens Movement leader Xu Zhiyong in Beijing in early 2014 resulted in reports of physical violence. And Calum MacLeod of USA Today told how he and other journalists were &quot;manhandled away from the Malaysian embassy in Beijing by plainclothes and uniformed police when reporting on the MH370 relatives&apos; protest in April 2014.&quot; Before reporters even arrive on a scene, authorities are attempting to preempt coverage and discourage outlets from covering certain &quot;sensitive&quot; events such as the Xu Zhiyong trial or the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square military crackdown.  News assistants and sources are harassed and intimidated Many survey respondents said their assistants had been harassed or intimidated at least once; up from 35% in 2013 survey. In total, the FCCC received reports on a total of at least 79 such cases. A US journalist said: &quot;One research assistant was detained overnight and an intern was pressured to spy on us, and then forced to quit the internship when he refused to cooperate with the public security bureau.&quot; A European broadcaster told of her colleagues being visited &quot;very late at night in a hotel by the local propaganda office, and advised not to continue along a particular storyline. This happened on at least two stories, in different provinces.&quot; Sources have suffered too. Chinese citizens who talk to reporters, thereby exercising the free speech rights granted in China&apos;s constitution, have faced official hostility. Some 66 incidents were reported by 39 members compared to 23 cases the previous year. Christine Adelhardt, of the German TV company ARD, said: &quot;As we were filming at a monastery where nuns take care of unwanted kids, officials from the local government called the nun and later showed up while we were filming, telling the nun that if she talked to us, they would take away the kids.&quot; And another European TV reporter said: &quot;After visiting a village for a story on family planning, all of our sources were afterwards contacted by police and state security and issued stern warnings. One source was told, &apos;you know you can lose your life by talking to foreign journalists.&apos;&quot; Chinese authorities apply pressure outside China A quarter of respondents said there was pressure applied to editors in headquarters about their coverage. A Japanese newspaper reported: &quot;On quite a few occasions, officials from the Chinese embassy in Tokyo have told our editors that they were not pleased with some reports by our reporters in China.  &quot;Their complaints cover a wide variety of topics, from domestic incidents such as suicide attacks in Xinjiang to international affairs including China&apos;s recent confrontations in the South China Sea with Vietnam and the Philippines.  &quot;They think our reporters express too much sympathy for terrorists or Vietnam and the Philippines. The Tokyo headquarters of other Japanese media have received similar visits.&quot; A European newspaper journalist said: &quot;Diplomats contacted my editor several times. They also had a meeting where the Chinese embassy sent three people including a lawyer.&quot; In a separate FCCC survey about visa issues, released in March 2014, it was found that Chinese authorities routinely abuse the press card and visa renewal process by treating journalistic accreditation as a privilege rather than a professional right. *The FCCC reporting conditions survey was sent to 236 FCCC members in May 2014, of whom 123 replied.

They bought it! We pulled the wool over their eyes \u2013 it seems to have been accepted as a good thing. Foolishly, this has given me the illusion that I might be able to do another opera. I think about Berlioz again. I like him because he&apos;s crazy, flawed, exciting and he breaks rules. John Berry [ENO artistic director] mentions Benvenuto Cellini, an opera by Berlioz that has never been staged at ENO and rarely anywhere else. I prefer to do operas that haven&apos;t been done because you can&apos;t be judged against the great versions. You are page one. Plus, no one succeeds with a Berlioz opera\u00a0\u2013 you might fuck it up, but so does everybody else. John also mentions that an ENO patron has offered \u00a3150,000 towards a production of Cellini. SeptemberCellini is someone I&apos;ve dreamed of making a film about. He was an extraordinary man: the only Renaissance character to have written an autobiography, a brilliant goldsmith and sculptor, one of the greatest of his age \u2013 and also a scoundrel and a liar. Casting his sculpture of Perseus, now in Florence, is the high point of his autobiography and of Berlioz&apos;s opera. Both are about the creative process, about madness, about hubris, about how you fuck yourself up. Berlioz, Cellini, me \u2013 it&apos;s like a magnet. May 2012The trick is trying to work out how you make this thing bearable to a 21st-century audience. There&apos;s wonderful story-telling music but, dramatically, you struggle to know why you should care. It&apos;s a clunky and clanky little story. I&apos;m eating breakfast on a plane to Los Angeles and obsessing about the overture. It lasts 10 minutes: too long for the audience to sit through waiting for the show to begin. Co-director Leah Hausman and I decide to give it a huge back story \u2013 make it an opera in itself, with sheep, hillsides, shepherds, Cellini travelling to Rome, meeting other sculptors, falling in love with Teresa ... July\u2026 scrap the overture idea.\u00a0We got tired and figured everyone will be exhausted by the time we start. And then there&apos;s still a three-hour opera to go. NovemberI put the music on my computer and start cutting. It&apos;s way too long! Berlioz was in his early 20s when he wrote this and he just threw everything in there, including the kitchen sink. So I get brutal. ENO&apos;s music director and conductor Ed Gardner and I meet. I tell him I want to cut, so it can make dramatic sense. He says: &quot;You can&apos;t: it won&apos;t make musical sense.&quot; We make some compromises, but there are some points where he won&apos;t budge. I haven&apos;t given up. April 2013Katrina Lindsay is designing the costumes. We start out thinking of Max Ernst, then move away from that, but stay in the 19th century. The costumes become Victoriana: an oppressive, class-bound society in black and white. Teresa is a rich girl in a cage: when she finally gets out, the world turns upside-down and all this sex that&apos;s been suppressed rears its ugly \u2013 or beautiful \u2013 head (depending on your point of view). The carnival that ends the first act shakes everything up. It will be full of colour, freedom and chaos. SummerI need a translator. I set potential candidates a test. Translate Honneur aux ma\u00eetres ciseleurs, a phrase that occurs throughout the opera. Literally, it means: &quot;Honour to the master goldsmiths.&quot; Whoever translates this best gets the job. Charles Hart, who wrote the book for The Phantom of the Opera (but I don&apos;t hold that against him) comes up with: &quot;Laud and applaud the arts and artisans.&quot; It&apos;s perfect and it sounds beautiful: arts and artisans is very much what this is about. Finn Ross, who worked on Faust, is doing video projections. We&apos;re going to have the whole of Cellini&apos;s foundry projected \u2013 and in the first scene, when Cellini makes his way across Rome, the world moves. I&apos;ve spent the last two months working on this with Finn when I should have been doing something else that I can&apos;t tell you about because then it won&apos;t happen. I&apos;ve also been making a film, The Zero Theorem. Not sure how I&apos;m finding time for this all. OctoberDisaster! Our wonderful designer Rae Smith has had to leave midway through the whole process. I take over. We&apos;d already decided on Piranesi as an inspiration, but the set \u2013 based on his prison drawings \u2013 had become too physical and therefore too expensive. I simplify things, make the sets more graphic, more two-dimensional, and decide to use more projection. NovemberI&apos;m supposed to be promoting The Zero Theorem. Then the Pythons and I decide to do a reunion. A week later, we&apos;re at a press conference announcing it all. I&apos;ll think about the details later. I&apos;ve postponed another film project, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, until next year. It&apos;s all got too much. Co-director Leah Hausman and I are doing a lot of thinking, listening and planning. The thing with Cellini is that the music is so bombastic. We&apos;re trying to take away the bombast and find another way of doing it. In our version, Cellini is a serial seducer and an alcoholic; the sculpture is almost secondary. Michael Spyres, who I&apos;ve worked with before on Faust, has agreed to take on the lead role. &quot;I&apos;ve sung over 50 opera roles,&quot; he says, &quot;and this is technically the most difficult. Ever.&quot; He understands madness. That&apos;s why we want him. 14 April 2014Rehearsals begin. We&apos;ve got actors only for the first week, so we can work on the carnival scene which is 30 minutes of non-stop action. Leah got the team together and is in charge. There&apos;s 100 people on stage - stilt walkers, tumblers, jugglers, magic tricks.  5 MayWe have a big head problem. This is a perfect metaphor. Much of the visual stuff I&apos;d planned isn&apos;t working \u2013 because there&apos;s a big head in the way. The head is bigger than it should be, just like Berlioz&apos;s, Cellini&apos;s and mine. This head belongs to the final Perseus statue and was designed to be in proportion, but it&apos;s ended up 30% bigger. So when it&apos;s supposed to be carried around in packing cases, it doesn&apos;t fit. Everything is wrong! Months ago, we started working with one particular sculptor, but it was clear it wasn&apos;t right. I kept screaming: &quot;This isn&apos;t going to work; this is the wrong person.&quot; And I kept being told: &quot;Oh, just come down and talk.&quot; And I&apos;d say: &quot;No, wrong person. You can either do it or you can&apos;t.&quot; Eventually, a different sculptor started over and it was much better. But we ended up with a head that was 30% too big, and now it&apos;s too late to start again.     'He understands madness.' Michael Spyres as Benvenuto Cellini with Corinne Winters as Teresa. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    12 MayEd Gardner&apos;s been in and out of rehearsals. We&apos;re still fighting about cuts. It depends who wears down who first. We only got 43 seconds out of Faust \u2013 we&apos;re doing a little better here. &quot;I&apos;m tired of arguing about this!&quot; Ed says. I think we&apos;ve worn him down. There are three versions of this opera and we&apos;re working from all three, although ours doesn&apos;t have any spoken dialogue, which was how Berlioz originally wrote it. It&apos;s hard enough making singing voices carry in the Coliseum, let alone speech, and mic-ing is horrible. But this does make it longer when we&apos;re trying desperately to keep it tight and have just the one interval. If this were theatre, there are several cuts you&apos;d make. At one point, we find out Cellini&apos;s going to die if he doesn&apos;t get the sculpture done. They sing: &quot;Hung by the neck until dead/&apos;til dead/&apos;til dead.&quot; Boom. Then black. And CUT. Or at least, that&apos;s what you want, dramatically. But no. Berlioz then has the music go, &quot;Dum, te-te dum, da da da-da-da da-da-da DAAAA-dum&quot; for several more minutes. He just goes on and on \u2013 he loves his playouts. There&apos;s no way of maintaining tension; it just dribbles away. So we decide to have some fun and at least get a laugh at the end of a supposedly dark moment. But I&apos;m not going to ruin the surprise by telling you how. 16 MayWhen I&apos;m making films, I&apos;m always right in people&apos;s faces, directing them up close. On this, and in Faust, it&apos;s Leah who does all that while I sit back and think: &quot;This is the way real film directors work.&quot; Leah is so much better at it than me, so much more articulate. She&apos;s got more energy, she&apos;s young, and \u2013 for the time being \u2013 healthy(ish). I don&apos;t know how people do this on their own. How do they keep their eye on everything? We have three assistants and they&apos;re always busy. We could kind of do with an extra one in fact. 19 May&gt;We move from the rehearsal room to the Coliseum stage. Killer moment. We did a great run-through (well, hobble-through) in the rehearsal room last week and everything felt exciting and buoyant. But in the theatre today, it&apos;s a total train crash. Scene changes don&apos;t work, neither do the costume changes, and there&apos;s chaos with the chorus, who are moving like blancmange. Leah and I want to book plane tickets out of here. 20 MayLeah&apos;s been screaming for at least a year that we need more rehearsal time. The opera has a huge chorus and they&apos;re in a lot of scenes. Working with a chorus takes a long time. It doesn&apos;t move quickly: you&apos;ve got a lot of bodies, a lot of minds, a lot of different things going on, and they&apos;re torn in a lot of different directions. Maybe it would be better if they all just stood at the back and sang, but it&apos;s not what&apos;s required by the music, which is telling you something&apos;s happening, there&apos;s some story going on. There are so many dramatic scenes that have to be kept alive by our singers at every single moment. But we keep having to compromise on how much we can do, due to lack of time. It&apos;s frustrating. You know how good it can be, but we have to keep trimming. Luckily, the thing is still big enough: it&apos;s still going to end up having two legs and a few other bits. 22 MayHazel, who&apos;s doing the costumes for the Python reunion, comes to go through things between rehearsals. She&apos;s having a problem because none of us are together at the same time. Until we are, everything has to be planned in advance, and decisions are being made that may not satisfactory when the group finally get together. But I&apos;m not really thinking about all that at the moment, not until we open. 23 MayThis is ruining everything else in my life. There&apos;s no escape. Today, I&apos;ve been working for the first time with lighting designer Paule Constable, so I haven&apos;t really been focusing on the big picture. Every once in a while, I look up and say: &quot;Oh fuck, what are they doing? That&apos;s horrible! Why are you doing that?&quot; It&apos;s like a 10-ring circus. At this stage in the process, the singers retreat back into a style they feel comfortable with, which is known as park and bark. All the work we&apos;ve been doing to make this feel like a real piece of drama slips away.            Reading on mobile? Terry Gilliam talks about the production on video 26 MayApparently, this is going to be one of the most expensive things ENO&apos;s ever done. I keep saying to John: &quot;What about this patron? Where&apos;s that money?&quot; An interviewer asks me how this is impacting on all my other projects. Like an impacted tooth, I tell her. If only I could just pull it out, it would be so much better. We&apos;re struggling with the second act. Much of the story-telling falls apart here and the music itself is very distorted in places. So we&apos;ve reimagined it and made the entire sequence Cellini&apos;s nightmare, with him dreaming about all of the things that can get in the way of the one thing he&apos;s got to do: cast Perseus, make that statue. I keep thinking of a Goya etching I&apos;ve always liked: The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. In a sense, this is what we&apos;re doing. I am having trouble sleeping as I dream of real events, real people and what&apos;s coming the next day, while I struggle to get the one thing I&apos;ve got to get done, done.     The carnival scene - 30 minutes of non-stop action. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    27 MayScrap the dream sequence. We were calling it the what-the-fuck-is-going-on sequence. Nobody followed it, even as a dream sequence. The second half is weird enough as it is. We&apos;ve gone back to some of Berlioz&apos;s stage directions. We&apos;ll stick with Cellini going mad, just like us. 1 JuneWe&apos;re in on a Sunday trying to make the overture work. We&apos;ve had a really good idea for how to animate some of it, to give people a little leg-up into the story. Meanwhile, the dress rehearsal is tomorrow and we still haven&apos;t done a complete run-through. There&apos;s a fire effect we want to put in. Producer Terri-Jane Griffin was trying it out yesterday in her back garden. We&apos;re hoping to get Westminster council to come in today and give us the OK to use it. Ed looks as green in the face as we did a month ago when contemplating all we had to do in the rehearsal room. It&apos;s such a huge piece and he has to pull together the orchestra, chorus and principal singers. We&apos;re all shitting ourselves. 2 JuneThe dress rehearsal and our first full run-through. The next will be opening night this Thursday. Good God! Ed took off like the clappers and the first act went like a bullet train to Tokyo. The chorus said they&apos;d never sung anything as fast in their lives. The overture went well, but then the deputy stage manager turned over two\u00a0pages instead of one. Cues were lost. For the first two minutes, nothing happened at all. Things went on like that for some time \u2013 we watched from between our fingers \u2013 then it did sort of come together. But God, it was rough. We&apos;re thinking about making an announcement before opening night: &quot;Things may not go smoothly. We may need to stop at some points.&quot; Still, there was an amazing energy. It&apos;s going to be really good by the third performance! One final thing: Cellini the movie is no longer on my wish list. I&apos;ve got it out of my system. * Benvenuto Cellini is at the Coliseum, London from 5 June to 27 June. The 17 June performance will be broadcast live to cinemas around the UK and internationally.

It will also allow Japanese police to more effectively co-operate with their counterparts in the international community.&quot;Japan is one of the world&apos;s biggest markets for indecent images of children, along with the US and Russia. Police said the number of reported victims of child pornography in Japan stood at 646 in 2013, although the real number was thought to be much higher. That marks a dramatic increase from the 304 children under 18 who were identified as victims in 2007 and is by far the highest total since police began collecting data in 1999.The new law&apos;s limited reach is unlikely to change social attitudes towards the depiction of child sexual exploitation in manga and anime. Sexual imagery involving children is not difficult to find in Tokyo, where men can occasionally be seen on trains flicking through manga showing, for example, scantily clad schoolgirls.Tokyo authorities in May said they would ban sales to children of manga depicting incestuous relationships, a popular subgenre of Japanese pornography. In addition convenience stores in the capital were told to make displays of pornographic manga less conspicuous in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics.Manga artists and publishers have long resisted prohibitions on their material, describing it as an attack on freedom of expression. &quot;We welcome that manga and anime will not be targeted for the possession of child pornography,&quot; Hideki Takanuma of the Japan Magazine Publishers Association told the Asahi Shimbun.&quot;But banning the possession while the definition of child pornography is still ambiguous is highly dangerous.In an attempt to safeguard artistic freedoms, the bill states that &quot;attention should be paid in applying the law in a manner not to infringe upon the rights of the people without due cause in relation to academic studies, cultural and artistic activities and reports&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["While there, the 20-year-old posed for photographs at Tokyo&apos;s Yasukuni war shrine - one of the most controversial sites in all of Asia."], "tags": ["Justin Bieber", "Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock", "Race issues"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-05T07:13:44Z", "title": "Justin Bieber: 'I need to step up and own what I did'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/05/justin-bieber-apology-racist-video", "article": "Justin Bieber has issued yet another apology after a second video emerged reportedly showing the singer using the N-word and making racist jokes. &quot;I need to step up and own what I did,&quot; Bieber said. &quot;I am sorry for all those I have let down and offended.&quot; Unlike Bieber&apos;s previous apology, which he posted to his Twitter account, this one was apparently issued exclusively to the Sun. &quot;Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I&apos;ve ever dealt with,&quot; he said, expressing hope that &quot;the next 14-year-old kid who doesn&apos;t understand the power of these words ... not make the same mistakes I made&quot;.

She had been trying to write for a while, and one 20-minute train journey with James Joyce changed everything. &quot;I started reading the book, got off at Liverpool Street, and just thought: that&apos;s it. Everything I have written before is rubbish, and today is the beginning of something else.&quot; Not long afterwards, aged 27, she wrote her novel, A Girl Is a Half-formed Thing, in six feverish months. This week, 10 years later and after a stack of rejections, it won the Baileys Women&apos;s Prize for Fiction (formerly the Orange prize), beating big, brilliant novels by established literary stars Donna Tartt, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Jhumpa Lahiri. We meet a few hours after McBride, 37, has taken to the stage, eyes shining with tears. She is being interviewed in a large side room at the Royal Festival Hall, people buzzing around, trying to keep their voices down. There is the furtive pop of a champagne cork, friends and prize judges whispering urgently, passionately, about the book; when McBride comes to the end of a short radio interview, someone&apos;s tentative whoop turns into a collective roar of approval. The book has been described as difficult, because of its language; devoid of commas, a fractured, poetic, pre-conscious voice, pregnant with full stops and half rhymes, which McBride knew she had captured when she wrote the first lines: &quot;For you. You&apos;ll soon. You&apos;ll give her name. In the stitches of her skin she&apos;ll wear your say.&quot; But it actually feels like language anyone could read and understand. Its subject matter is the real difficulty, the story of a young girl, struggling to deal with her older brother&apos;s illness \u2013 a brain tumour \u2013 and the abuse she experiences. As she wrote, says McBride, disturbing themes bubbled up, unforeseen. &quot;There&apos;s a moment where the girl is in the kitchen with her uncle, and he&apos;s about to do what he does, and she says, &apos;he didn&apos;t get me&apos;, or a line like that. And then the next line is, &apos;Oh, but he did&apos;. And that very distinctly was me trying not to let that happen in the story, and then realising that it would \u2026 I thought, &apos;Oh god, don&apos;t be the Irish writer who is writing about child abuse.&apos; I really didn&apos;t want to. But it seems I had to.&quot; McBride had been given the gift of six months to write the book \u2013 her husband, William Galinsky, had directed a production of The Winter&apos;s Tale in Tokyo, and gave her a portion of the fee. She committed to 1,000 words a day, and &quot;it felt like I was in this kind of death match. It involved pulling it out, pushing it out. It was not something that flowed.&quot; Once finished, the book could not find a home. She sent it to agents and publishers, and while many were positive \u2013 no one suggested she wasn&apos;t a writer \u2013 they felt it was too much of a risk, too difficult to sell. &quot;I knew it wasn&apos;t easy to be published,&quot; she says, &quot;but I certainly never expected it to be this hard. I didn&apos;t feel the book was without precedent in all of literature \u2013 I had no idea it was going to be treated as a crazy book, written by a madwoman, you know?&quot; She turned down the idea of publishing it as a memoir \u2013 since it wasn&apos;t one \u2013 and after about five years, &quot;I put it in a drawer and started work on my second book. I had to go through the process of accepting that I might be a failed, unpublishable writer, and would I continue if that was the case? And the answer was yes, I would, because that&apos;s who I am. But it certainly takes a toll on you, personally, to be a failure for all of your adult life.&quot; The novel was finally published in 2013, nine years after it was first written, by Galley Beggar Press, a small, independent publisher in Norwich, where McBride, Galinsky and their two-year-old daughter now live. It was hailed with long, glowing reviews in the Times Literary Supplement, and the London Review of Books; in the Guardian, Anne Enright described McBride as a &quot;genius&quot;. It has since been published by Faber &amp; Faber, and has also won the Goldsmiths Prize. Her experience suggests publishers have been underestimating readers, says McBride. &quot;I think the publishing industry is perpetuating this myth that readers like a very passive experience, that all they want is a beach novel. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s true, and I think this book doing as well as it has is absolute proof of that. There are serious readers who want to be challenged, who want to be offered something else, who don&apos;t mind being asked to work a little bit to get there.&quot; She hopes her success might lead to the publication of other seriously ambitious novels. &quot;There is a readership there, they deserve to be catered to, and literature needs new blood pumped through it all the time, or it becomes stale and purposeless. It&apos;s not a museum piece. It needs to be pushed forward.&quot;     McBride receives the Baileys women's prize for fiction. Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters    Born in Liverpool, the third of four siblings \u2013 the rest of them brothers \u2013 the family moved to Ireland when McBride was two. Her parents were both nurses, practising Catholics, who had spent time working with the criminally insane; her father continued working in Ireland, in a home for the mentally disabled, while her mother looked after the children. McBride was taught to read, aged three, by her father. &quot;We grew up in a house with very little money, but I never asked for books that I didn&apos;t get. That was paramount.&quot; Her parents&apos; work made her aware from an early age, she says, &quot;that a lot of people lived with difficult things \u2026 and that was not something that should be hidden away, or ignored.&quot; This understanding deepened when her father died of cancer when she was eight. Her mother sent her to drama classes, as an outlet for her feelings, and she developed an ambition to act. At 17 she moved to London for a three-year course at the Drama Centre \u2013 sometimes wryly known as the Trauma Centre. &quot;I was very interested in The Method,&quot; she says, &quot;and it&apos;s a method school, Stanislavsky training, and that&apos;s what I really wanted to pursue. It was very, very intense, 11 hours a day, and there were all these crazy exercises to try and break yourself down, to dig into the darkness within, and I loved it, of course.&quot; They read from the ancient Greeks through to Tennessee Williams, and the sum of that training is in the voice of her novel. &quot;A lot of the book is like a description of what is going on in a method actor&apos;s head on stage. It&apos;s about trying to draw in all these disparate experiences: so what is being said, and also how a person is reacting and feeling, what they&apos;re feeling about the feeling, what they&apos;re thinking. What other thoughts are going through their heads, and their gut reactions, and physical sensations. You know, if you&apos;re itchy or need the loo when you&apos;re saying something, that also affects how it&apos;s said, and received.&quot; Acting had seemed like a protection, a place where she could express and explore difficult emotions, but when her brother Donagh died of a brain tumour in his late 20s, not long after she finished her training, McBride realised there was no protection. &quot;I stopped wanting to be an actress,&quot; she says. &quot;I had felt as though the bad thing that would happen in my life, had happened, and when my brother died I realised that anything can happen at any time, and there was nothing you could do about it.&quot; A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing is dedicated to Donagh, and features obvious echoes of his illness, but she says she gets quite upset, &quot;when people say, &apos;this is like your brother&apos;. I think, well, this is really not about my brother, this is not his life, and I am not that girl.&quot; McBride&apos;s second novel is almost finished, and she says she tries to be fearless in her writing, to move beyond her natural boundaries. &quot;I certainly try to go in with as little self-censorship as possible. I try to write from a part of myself that is not concerned with how it will be received, what people think about what I should be writing, and that&apos;s very important. It can be disturbing, because it&apos;s something that&apos;s then outside of your control, and you end up writing things you don&apos;t want to write, and discussing things you don&apos;t want to discuss, that personally you don&apos;t feel comfortable examining. &quot;But if you are not uncomfortable as a writer, then you are not doing your job. Your job is not to feel great about everything. Your job is to look at what is difficult and to try and understand it in some small way.&quot; With A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing, McBride has done that. I suspect in years to come \u2013 maybe even a century from now \u2013 an aspiring writer will read it on their way to a drudging, unhappy job, and feel that everything about their world has changed."}, {"sentences": ["The bad boy  Jason Davidson&apos;s spot of teenage rebellion backfired while playing Tokyo youth football (his grandmother is Japanese)."], "tags": ["Australia", "World Cup 2014 Group B", "World Cup 2014", "World Cup", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-07T12:00:06Z", "title": "Australia: World Cup 2014 team guide", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/07/australia-world-cup-2014-team-guide", "article": "The players Star man  Time travellers from 1893 will be pleased with the continuity in the Socceroos squad, because Tim Cahill is still the main man.

Wave-shaped benches with central armrests made from slippery or buttock-numbing materials such as stainless steel are designed to prevent the homeless from kipping in public. Sloping seats at bus stops barely provide a perch, let alone a place to actually sit.  London is not alone in its embrace of hostile seating design. Eager to prevent loitering, the authorities at Yantai Park in Shandong, China introduced a pay-per-minute system for the use of its benches: overstay your welcome and you\u2019ll be treated to a series of studs that emerge suddenly and uncomfortably from the seat. In Tokyo\u2019s Ueno park, sloped benches prevents sitters from leaning back; Japan is also fond of tubular benches that are either too hot in summer or too cold in winter, and an array of sculptures (cute penguins, for example) that double as comfort-destroyers. New York\u2019s spiky anti-sit devices, found on air-conditioning units, fire hydrants and standpipes, are notably unsparing in the brutality of their design.     A man tries to take a nap at a bench in Tokyo, which has been designed to discourage sleeping. Photograph: Yuya Shino/Reuters    It&apos;s not just the homeless who are targeted. \u201cThose impacted are usually homeless people, teenagers, the poor, those who are marginalised or don\u2019t have good social representation, or who aren\u2019t organised as an interest group,\u201d says Selena Savic, one of the editors of the book Unpleasant Design. The most egregious anti-teenage-loitering device is the Mosquito Alarm, which emits an unpleasant sound that many older people can&apos;t hear. Aldi are one supermarket company that uses such devices. An Aldi spokesperson said: \u201cThese alarms are in place to prevent antisocial behaviour taking place near the store, prevent damage to the building and promote a safe shopping and working environment for customers and staff.\u201d An equally artful weapon is the use of \u201cuncool\u201d classical music and opera, piped into public spaces such as train stations and outside of branches of McDonald\u2019s to ensure teenagers don\u2019t linger. And rather adding insult to injury, Mansfield in Nottingham installed neon pink lights at two underpasses, not just for their calming effect but also because they highlight spotty skin.  Blue lighting has similarly been used for its soothing properties in dozens of Tokyo railway stations to curb the high rate of suicide. Such lights in bathrooms have been arguably less successful at preventing drug injection. Not only can users mark their veins beforehand, but the blue lights can provide mood lighting for sexual activity (a strict no-no); in 2004, Rugby council declared its blue-light toilet experiment a disaster, as people were using UV markers to draw graffiti that, under the light, looked &quot;spectacular&quot;, as one councillor put it.

Raised metal lumps known as \u201cpig ears\u201d are bolted on to an array of surfaces in cities. Ocean Howell, a former skateboarder and assistant professor of architectural history at the University of Oregon, who studies such anti-skating design, says it reveals wider processes of power. \u201cArchitectural deterrents to skateboarding and sleeping are interesting because \u2013 when noticed \u2013 they draw attention to the way that managers of spaces are always designing for specific subjects of the population, consciously or otherwise,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we talk about the \u2018public\u2019, we\u2019re never actually talking about \u2018everyone\u2019.\u201d  Anti-skate architecture, he adds, is often skateable anyway, and only serves to breed resentment. \u201cWhen you\u2019re designed against, you know it,\u201d he says. \u201cOther people might not see it but you will. The message is clear: you are not a member of the public, at least not of the public that is welcome here.\u201d One of the problems with architectures of control is that they don\u2019t discriminate. An uncomfortable bench is as uncomfortable for a homeless person as it is for a tired passerby or for someone looking for a place to read. Moreover, says Dan Lockton of the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, defensive architecture doesn&apos;t address the underlying problem of homelessness. They simply shift it from one area to another, or worst still, reduce its visibility.  Many of these tactics have their origins in a more positive movement to design against crime, which aims to make public spaces feel safer. \u201cThe original goal was a lot more pro-public,\u201d says Lockton. \u201cBut these new features are part of a range of strategies that perceive the public as a threat and treat everyone as a criminal.\u201d \u2022 Read more: Welcome to China&apos;s city of clones"}, {"sentences": ["The mutual accountability framework agreed two years ago in Tokyo between the Afghans and western donors can be the cornerstone of a broader partnership."], "tags": ["Afghanistan", "World news", "US foreign policy", "Al-Qaida", "Taliban"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-13T13:29:53Z", "title": "Afghanistan's presidential election may just change the country's fate | Michael Keating", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/13/afghanistan-presidential-election", "article": "The fury generated by the handover of Sergeant Bergdahl and the release of five Taliban prisoners from Guant\u00e1namo Bay is distracting attention from a rare political opportunity. This Saturday, the decisive round of voting takes place to elect the next president of Afghanistan. If the winner is viewed by Afghans to have been legitimately elected, and if the runner-up concedes, an opportunity of enormous significance will have been created. Things may go badly wrong, as last week&apos;s assassination attempt on one of the two leading candidates, Dr Abdullah Abdullah, underscored. There will be electoral irregularities, fraud, and violence, but the first-round vote went much better than expected, in terms of turnout, electoral organisation, security and acceptance by the candidates of the results. A second round of voting that delivers a decisive result, combined with widely shared interests in Afghanistan, could provide a basis for that rare thing: concerted international action for peace and stability. Unlike Syria, Iraq or Ukraine, Afghanistan has neighbours who share strong common interests in its future. These include the elimination of its role as a safe haven for al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, and reducing the flow of refugees, drugs and arms. Moreover, Afghanistan has vast mineral and natural resources, and could link populous south Asia with resource-rich central Asia. Stability in Afghanistan is sought not only by the US and its allies but also by China, Russia, the Gulf and central Asian states, India and Iran. Pakistan may be on board, too, though after years of offering sanctuary and support to the Afghan Taliban, scepticism about a strategic shift in Pakistan&apos;s attitude is understandable. But with its own virulent Taliban insurgency, and deep economic and social problems, Pakistanis increasingly recognise that they will benefit from Afghan stability. If Afghanistan&apos;s presidential election goes well, three steps will boost confidence: 1) The new president must address Afghans&apos; most pressing needs: security, justice, jobs and basic services. Actions will speak louder than words. The appointment of competent officials and action on corruption \u2013 an arrest or two \u2013 would be a great start. Both candidates say they will quickly sign the bilateral security agreement with the US. That is essential. But security, particularly for women and girls, is not just about a strong army. It is about having someone to turn to, without having to pay a bribe, if your land or property is stolen, if you are abused or if you need a school certificate. 2) Donor countries need to reaffirm predictable levels of financial support for the next five years. Nato&apos;s Cardiff summit in September and the London ministerial conference on Afghanistan in November are good moments. The first will focus on support for Afghan security forces, and the second the basis upon which civilian aid will continue. Maintaining political support in western capitals will be far from easy. The hubbub in Washington around the release of Taliban prisoners and bitter attacks on US foreign policy, including from former insiders, whether over Syria or the broader Middle East, do not help. But in Afghanistan, the case for bipartisan support is strong. Relatively modest financial assistance will help ensure that the enormous human and financial investment in Afghanistan is not wasted, gains on the ground are secured, and the world is safer. 3) A stronger partnership is needed between the new government and both western and regional states, including China and Russia. Their influence is central to regional stability, as is the Americans&apos;. The current president, Hamid Karzai, has deeply alienated the US but his successor can press the reset button. The mutual accountability framework agreed two years ago in Tokyo between the Afghans and western donors can be the cornerstone of a broader partnership. The objective must be to help the Afghans achieve a more accountable, sustainable and secure state. It needs to include support for an intra-Afghan reconciliation process. In 2013, an average of 400 soldiers and 250 civilians were killed each month, and the figures for 2014 will be higher than any year since 2001. The human toll and violence must come down. The tight schedule set for US military drawdown by President Obama means there is no time to lose. The coming weeks will be decisive. Cautious optimism about the elections may be dashed. Of course, the new president may fail to seize the moment. But it would be a terrible irony if the Afghans, so tired of 35 years of conflict, do create a political opportunity to turn things round, and the rest of the world is too distracted to notice."}, {"sentences": ["I can&apos;t say I shall watch every single last match between Tokyo or Costa Rica but I shall certainly stay up to watch all of England&apos;s matches, yes."], "tags": ["World Cup 2014", "Ronnie Wood", "Simon Armitage", "David Starkey", "World Cup"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-13T20:11:00Z", "title": "World Cup armchair pundits: 'It feels calmer now we have no chance'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/13/world-cup-armchair-spectators", "article": "Chris Packham I am a massive World Cup fan. There hasn&apos;t been a World Cup where I haven&apos;t watched every game. I&apos;ve often been working when the games have been on so I record them all and then watch them at double or triple speed, first to make sure that I can get through them all but also because it makes them even more exciting to watch. I remember in 1990 when it was the Ireland game I was sitting in the back of a taxi in London and I had a portable TV with me so I didn&apos;t miss it. When it went to penalties the taxi driver pulled over and we sat on the pavement and watched the game on this little TV. This year I&apos;ll be recording during some of it but thankfully the games are on late, and we wrap up filming for Springwatch on Friday so there&apos;ll be no badgers during the World Cup. I have to have a wall planner where I write down all the scores. Unfortunately I am in a caravan in the middle of the wild at the moment but as soon as I get back I am rushing out to buy one. We are always unrealistically optimistic about the UK&apos;s chances. It&apos;s the blight of England fans. The worst nights of my life were in 1990 and 1996 \u2013 it makes me depressed even thinking about it. It&apos;s all agony, agony, agony, isn&apos;t it? I think this year they&apos;ve got to get the young players on the field, chuck them out there and see if they catch fire. I don&apos;t want to see any of these old codgers again \u2013 Rooney, drop him, he&apos;s never performed at this level. I think we&apos;ll get to the quarter-finals but I think that will mean we face Brazil. The thing is, it&apos;s so unpredictable and that&apos;s what makes it&apos;s so exciting. I have a replica World Cup that is currently sitting in my utility room but over the next few weeks it will be out on top of my television. It will be me and two poodles cavorting round my living room clutching the World Cup every time England score. Philip Pullman  I shall watch England&apos;s matches and of course I will be supporting England. I can&apos;t say I shall watch every single last match between Tokyo or Costa Rica but I shall certainly stay up to watch all of England&apos;s matches, yes. I am a football fan to some extent. I follow the fortunes of my favourite club, which is Norwich City, who I have been following since the early 50s when I was a very small boy. I will be watching the games at home as I&apos;m fairly relaxed about the whole thing. I&apos;d like to think England&apos;s chances are a bit higher than people say but you have to be realistic. We&apos;d be lucky to make the quarter-finals, I guess, but World Cups do have a habit of throwing up good games. I remember very vividly the best football match I ever watched in my life, which was the 1970 semi-final between Germany and Italy in Mexico. Fantastic match, superb match, but I can&apos;t remember who won. It doesn&apos;t matter who won, it&apos;s the quality of the match that is enthralling. Ronnie Wood I&apos;m good! We&apos;re in Paris and getting ready for the World Cup kick-off along with our on-tour backgammon tournament. We will be watching the World Cup en masse. Every four years I come out of hiding and hibernation and go nuts on football. I&apos;ll be watching all the games I can and Mick is trying to time it so we have days off when England are playing and as near as dammit we are. We are very much looking forward to it. We love the spirit of the competition. Of course I&apos;ll be supporting England but I can&apos;t wait to watch Italy and Holland \u2013 oh, and Spain, because I have a place in Barcelona. I don&apos;t mind, I just love good football. We are having a party tonight at Mick&apos;s and it&apos;s a kick-off in a double sense, it&apos;s a kick-off of the tournament and a kick-off of our tour. We&apos;re going to be in Paris for the first game but from then on we are carrying on across Europe, so we&apos;ll watch wherever we may be. We have a big entourage with us but we&apos;ll try and get out into the cities we&apos;re in to watch the games. I think it&apos;s a young team and I like the manager and I like the atmosphere between the boys and I think if we are going to stand a chance, this is the year. Good luck to them. There&apos;s not going to be any easy games so I think they should just take it one step at a time \u2013 a bit like my sobriety. I remember we played a gig in Italy when they won in 1998 and we had some of their players up on stage for the encore the night that they won and that was a fabulous night. It&apos;s not an impossibility and I think the odds are more in our favour than not, we are right up there with the big contenders. And of course we have a big backgammon tournament that my wife Sally has organised. We have 32 contenders and we&apos;ve timed every match of the backgammon to take place at the same time as one of the games. So fingers crossed, off we go. Simon Armitage I will be watching the World Cup but it rather annoyingly clashes with a play I&apos;ve got on at the Globe. My dream would be just lounging at home with a can of beer and a big bowl of popcorn in front of a flat screen. If I can persuade the Globe, once the show&apos;s finished on Saturday night, to turn the hallowed boards of Shakespeare into a giant screen then I&apos;d be very happy, but what I suspect is that I&apos;ll set off somewhere into the depths of east London to find a pub to watch the game. I am a big football fan. My team? Well, that&apos;s a complicated question that I keep the answer to myself. This year we&apos;ve ended up in that bizarre situation where everyone is saying we are being more realistic this time, but in a strange way that realism has turned into a weird kind of optimism and because everyone&apos;s got low expectations that&apos;s being reinterpreted as us having a chance. I certainly don&apos;t feel tense about it as I&apos;ve done in previous years when we&apos;ve had a really good team and it seems there&apos;s an awful lot to lose but I feel incredibly relaxed about this year. I remember that game against Argentina when Beckham scored that penalty and not being able to stay in the same room to watch the end of the match just in case they&apos;d get an equaliser. Every four years you can plot a trail of disappointment and I don&apos;t think it will be any different this year. Every single game will be a difficult game, every single one. You look at the world ranking and see that England are number 10 and you think: how can that be? I can think of at least 40 countries that we would struggle to beat. It feels calmer this time. You don&apos;t even see people driving around with flags on their cars. Hannah Reid (lead singer of London Grammar) I love the excitement around the World Cup, and it&apos;s the only time football makes sense to me because it&apos;s basically the football Olympics. I feel like I can join in. But I will never understand the offside rule. I&apos;m not the best at keeping up while watching. Gilles Peterson, Radio 6 DJ Of course I will be watching, I&apos;ve cleared my diary as best as I could to make room as much as I can to watch the games. I am a big football fan, I&apos;ve been an arsenal season ticket holder for 25 years, so yeah, I love it. I put out a track earlier this year that I recorded in Rio called Brazil Bam Bam Bam, so I&apos;ve got that Brazilian feeling, but then I&apos;m also half french and half swiss, I live in England and my wife&apos;s Japanese so there&apos;s at least five teams for me to support. But I&apos;m completely 100 per cent supporting England all the way, even though I don&apos;t have any Englishness in me, so I&apos;m very excited for that. This is like Christmas but better, I love it&apos;s so amazing. Forget the football, I get pleasure out of watching the crowds and feeling that atmosphere. Where better to watch the World Cup in London, at home and see the country become more and more seduced by it. I&apos;m one of those people who can&apos;t watch games in pubs, I have to watch it at home with just a small group. I can&apos;t have anyone getting in the way. I&apos;m a realist so I can cope with the pressure and cope with defeat. When it comes to the World Cup, I love the spectacle more than the actual winning. I think England might well get to the Quarter finals actually and then anything&apos;s possible. I&apos;d say that we will get through the group, and we&apos;ve got quite an easy second round- it could be England, Japan which will be funny in my house, and then we&apos;ll probably get knocked out by Spain or Brazil in the quarter finals. I think the team&apos;s decent but we&apos;ve got a big problem at right back, I think Glen Johnson is a definite weakness. David Starkey The World Cup? I have no views at all.

For years it made Shredded Wheat on an industrial scale and it wafted across town. It was nice \u2013 like a warm, cooking, comforty thingy. At home the smell I remember is tripe, which Mum would boil up for our dog. It\u00a0was absolutely disgusting. But there was this huge deep middle drawer in the kitchen, once the extension was done, which mum completely stocked with multi-packs of crisps, Maltesers, mini-Mars Bars and Milky Ways each week. I&apos;m the oldest of three girls. Dad was outvoted, hence his need for control at table. I&apos;ve noticed this in friends who are dads \u2013 the desire to do dinner properly. Dad hated it if my sisters and I sniggered at table, but being told not to made us more uncontrollable. Sometimes, we&apos;d only have to catch each other&apos;s eyes and it would trigger hysterics. Between 14 and 16, I ate a jacket potato with beans and grated cheese on top every\u00a0day for two years in the canteen at the Italia Conti school. I was very much a creature of habit then. The most exotic meal I&apos;d make then was grilled spag cheese. That&apos;s spaghetti with grated cheese on top. When I was 17, Dad used to say: &quot;I&apos;d much prefer you come home in the evening than be out with a Bargain Bucket.&quot; But I loved meeting up with friends on the wall outside KFC. It was our little place and it felt cool, glamorous and independent, sitting there sharing chicken and chips and a bottle of Blue Nun. At 19, I was in Tokyo on a three-month modelling agency contract, living on my own. Big Macs featured heavily. Not only was the agency above a McDonald&apos;s but they&apos;d give me a little map showing western food landmarks and instructions to &quot;turn right at McDonald&apos;s&quot;. I was also eating cornflakes most nights. It was like comfort food, but bloody expensive \u2013 I&apos;d buy three oranges, milk and some Kellogg&apos;s and it was somehow 20 or 30 quid. Getting up at 4am to do Capital Breakfast on radio I make a smoothie, adding bee pollen and royal jelly. I don&apos;t take my own car, because I&apos;d end up screaming at how slowly the garage door opens. I&apos;ll drink a litre of water throughout a show, but in the first hour of the show I&apos;ll sip through a big coffee, or Coca-Cola if I&apos;ve got a hangover. Around 7am, I start on papaya, bananas, mango, fruit with almonds. By 8am I almost feel like a kebab and a beer, but I&apos;ll have salmon and avocado, chopped up with quinoa, tomatoes, asparagus and cucumbers. Of course I don&apos;t share: I&apos;m a little piggy. I get to work with Michelin-starred chefs on Channel 4&apos;s Weekend Kitchen. Angela Hartnett&apos;s roast chicken was completely salivating. Unfortunately Jean-Christophe Novelli had a little bowl of very hot garlic that dropped, bounced\u00a0on the studio floor and flew up in his eye.

Today, a dress made of geometric panels in off-white with an exaggerated puffed sleeve. Later, when we venture out, she pops on a\u00a0long, padded coat covered in metallic swirls \u2013 how Barbour might have interpreted Joseph&apos;s dream coat. Then there&apos;s that unmistakable speaking voice, a clash of trilled Icelandic &quot;rrrs&quot; and a cockney chirrup acquired when the &quot;drrrrrumer&quot; of the band she was in got them gigs in the UK and they stayed in squats. &quot;English for me is still like an arm&apos;s length removed,&quot; she says. &quot;You are always a\u00a0bit different in the mother tongue. That&apos;s why it&apos;s maybe easier for me in English to be an extrovert. In Icelandic I&apos;m more private.&quot; A woman in a long, felt tunic, no feet visible, wearing dark glasses and a straw hat glides into the room. &quot;Oh,&quot; says Bj\u00f6rk, &quot;this is my mum.&quot; Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s mum, Hildur R\u00fana Hauksd\u00f3ttir, is excellent company. While her global-superstar daughter valiantly attempts to rustle up lunch (as she&apos;s only on a flying visit home, Bj\u00f6rk hasn&apos;t been to the shops so is low on all provisions \u2013 not just milk), Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s mum smokes outside and tells me conspiratorially that a distant ancestor was an Irish girl enslaved by Vikings. She is worried about the tourist influx to Iceland, especially the enormous cruise ships and what their impact might be on the natural world. Later, I read that she went on hunger strike in 2002 to protest against the building of a power plant in the Icelandic wilderness. Her daughter appears with a salad, some wooden plates, one of which has warped in the dishwasher, and some rice crackers. We eat lunch in the front garden. It&apos;s all pleasingly bohemian \u2013 a bit how I\u00a0imagine the hippy commune Bj\u00f6rk famously grew up in might have been (although she says this has been overcooked: &quot;It was a group of kind people with long hair, who lived together and listened to Jimi Hendrix, but they did have &apos;normal&apos; jobs.&quot;) But given her international stardom, I had expected more retinue, fanfare, housekeepers and less eating in full view of the passing public. &quot;Oh, we&apos;re not really like that in Iceland,&quot; Bj\u00f6rk explains. &quot;It&apos;s a place where if you go to the geothermal baths the prime minister is naked in the shower. There is no hierarchy. In every family there will be one poet and one bricklayer, and there will be, you know, a\u00a0sculptor and it all merges into one thing.&quot; The same egalitarian principles cover Icelandic life as a whole, according to Bj\u00f6rk. &quot;There are no wars between the genres and wars between the classes and there are no wars between people and the arts.&quot; At this time of year, January to June, Bj\u00f6rk is usually to be found at her other home in New York&apos;s Brooklyn Heights, where her daughter, Isadora (with artist Matthew Barney), attends the liberal arts school, Saint Ann&apos;s. It seems a\u00a0very different life from this one here in Iceland, where she&apos;s clearly invigorated by the natural environment. But she talks enthusiastically about Brooklyn Bridge Park. &quot;When it&apos;s ready it&apos;ll be almost as long as Central Park,&quot; she tells me. &quot;Plus, it&apos;s got the East River on the side, so you get the wind from the Atlantic Ocean.&quot; To miss the wind seems very Icelandic.     Bj\u00f6rk on tour with her Biophilia album and project. Photograph: PR    Bj\u00f6rk is back in her homeland working on her Biophilia project, which is billed as &quot;a\u00a0multimedia exploration of the universe&quot;. First released as the 2010 album of the same name, it is a giant collaboration between app developers, scientists, instrument makers and a 24-women Icelandic choir who toured with Bj\u00f6rk for more than three years in a stage show. Later this year, a film of the live show will be released, narrated by David Attenborough, who is a huge fan of the project. The great biologist Edward O Wilson coined the term &quot;biophilia&quot; in his 1984 book of the same name, hypothesising that we are hard-wired to associate with other forms of life. You can interpret it, too, as an impulse towards environmentalism and conservation: we need nature and therefore we need to protect it. Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s interpretation is more playful. What began as simply an artistic concept \u2013 &quot;You know, just picking 10 songs with 10 emotions and 10 connections to the natural world&quot; \u2013 became a pioneering &quot;app album&quot;, whose iPad form gave each track an app of its own, incorporating interactives and even games with the music. Now it has evolved into a\u00a0way of teaching music and science using patterns from nature. Bj\u00f6rk is fresh from three days of meetings with Scandinavian educationalists because in several countries, including Iceland, the Biophilia Educational Program is soon to be on the curriculum (or &quot;corricoooloom&quot; as she pronounces it) funded by the Nordic Council. It is hard to imagine Michael Gove signing UK schools up any time soon, but, as Bj\u00f6rk puts it: &quot;Education is one thing we&apos;re good at.&quot; She says she herself studied musicology and classical notation, but the system never encouraged her to actually form her own songs. &quot;Basically music schools are just like conveyor belts for violinists and cellists for symphony orchestras,&quot; says Bj\u00f6rk. &quot;There is not usually any space for students to have a voice. The average person on the street is made to feel they can&apos;t join.&quot; Biophilia&apos;s programme, designed to be hands-on and non-academic, has been &quot;really popular with kids who have ADD or dyslexia&quot;. She sighs. &quot;Unfortunately it means we have to sit down and write a\u00a0curriculum and that&apos;s a contradiction.&quot; Her native Iceland is a\u00a0biophiliac&apos;s paradise. Not 30 minutes from Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s house you can watch the tectonic plates shift (well, sort of\u2026 they move an inch a year) at Thingvellir \u2013 track nine on Biophilia, &quot;Mutual Core&quot;, deals with plate tectonics. Pretty much anywhere in the country you can watch waterfalls plunging into the ground or trek across lava fields. The Icelandic historian Gu\u00f0mundur H\u00e1lfdanarson has suggested that the natural world is so inextricably entwined with his countrymen&apos;s psyche that &quot;nature is close to replacing language as a symbol of Icelandicness&quot;. Late in the game, the rest of the world has caught on and Iceland has bounced back from its cataclysmic banking collapse of 2008 partly thanks to tourism. Last year there were 825,000 visitors to Iceland \u2013 that&apos;s 2.5 visitors per resident. Tourism now exceeds fishing as Iceland&apos;s dominant industry. Bj\u00f6rk has helped put this country on the map, but so too did the unpronouncable volcano  Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull: bookings surged after the ash cloud spread south. The news coverage seems to have served as a tourist information video as we collectively swooned over Iceland&apos;s theatrical natural world. Game of Thrones may have helped, too. So it is a tragic irony that as Iceland grasps how to exploit its volcanic tundras for the biophiliac in all of us, it faces its greatest environmental threat. Activists accuse the government of industrialising this great pristine wilderness, particularly the highlands, through back-door deals with foreign aluminium giants involving tax incentives and undeclared sweeteners. Iceland&apos;s geothermal energy is a\u00a0cheap way to refine bauxite mined in Australia and the US into aluminium, and without using fossil fuels. But don&apos;t be fooled that this is a green, impact-free way of doing industry. Geothermal requires the diversion of major glacial lakes through massive damming projects that will change Iceland for ever, while the effects and exploitation of geothermal fields has been shown to cause irreversible habitat damage through pollution and emissions. In May last year, the global aluminium trade got a boost: the left-leaning government was ousted by a centre-right coalition apparently hell-bent on opening up the highlands to industry in the name of economic development. It took the new government precisely one day to begin pushing ahead with a stalled new aluminium smelter in Helguv\u00edk. Bj\u00f6rk has entered the battle. &quot;I want the campaign to get foreign interest,&quot; she says, carefully. &quot;It can&apos;t only matter to us \u2013 it needs to matter to everybody to get it stopped.&quot; She wants everyone to ask themselves the question: do you want to open up aluminium production for a handful of corporations or to preserve one of Europe&apos;s last remaining pristine wildernesses? &quot;Otherwise the rednecks [as she habitually refers to the pro-aluminium lobby] could build 17 dams and then it&apos;s all over, even though the majority of people here don&apos;t agree with them.&quot; A homegrown environmental movement is relatively new for Iceland. Previous campaigns tend to have been carried out by the big international NGOs, such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, on fishing and whaling, where Iceland has often been cast as the bad guy. The cultural touchstone for this nascent Reykjavik-based movement is Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason&apos;s 2006 book (and later documentary), Dreamland: a Self-help Manual for a Frightened Nation, which explores the damage of foreign ownership and predicts the privatisation and industrialisation of the wilderness. Inevitably, the &quot;rednecks&quot; paint the opposition as a metropolitan elite who don&apos;t have to concern themselves with the economic realities of the deprivation in the highlands of Iceland, where the fishing industry has collapsed. Doesn&apos;t she get flak for being a part timer, spending half the year away? &quot;I do sometimes have to answer those questions, yes,&quot; she says. &quot;But even venture capitalists here now understand that our future needs to be in nature, not destroying it. There are bankers who now have companies taking boat trips across the fjords. That&apos;s what&apos;s turning people around. &quot;I&apos;m not saying we go back to the past and live in a cave, but to have a smooth route into the 21st century it makes sense to embrace technology and give ourselves options, not have a dirty industrial revolution. We need to take a short cut to the green shit!&quot; How far would she go to protect the wilderness? It&apos;s not hard to imagine the fierce, charismatic Bj\u00f6rk we see on stage staring down the police to block a dam project. &quot;I don&apos;t want to judge direct action,&quot; she says quietly, &quot;but it&apos;s a\u00a0bit masochistic, right? What would chaining myself to a\u00a0bulldozer achieve?&quot; She has a\u00a0far more pragmatic approach. &quot;I remember going as a 16-year-old to England and everyone was vegetarian because of their principles and we just didn&apos;t get that here,&quot; she explains &quot;We can&apos;t grow vegetables so well, so it&apos;s a different context, you know? We&apos;re functional about things.&quot; Instead of manning the barricades, Bj\u00f6rk turned to the context she knows best and held a concert. With various luminaries on the bill, including Patti Smith and Of Monsters and Men, Bj\u00f6rk raised 35m kr\u00f3na (\u00a33m) for the campaign. &quot;That&apos;s a lot of money in Iceland,&quot; she adds. &quot;Money talks, bullshit walks.&quot; And what will they do with the money? &quot;We decided we&apos;re going to start a national park in the centre of the island. Instead of fighting with the rednecks, we&apos;ll just get on and do it.&quot; That&apos;s the thing about Bj\u00f6rk, she&apos;s incredibly driven \u2013 much more than the dreamy, raised-in-a-commune hippy mythology would have you believe. Without this inner steel, it&apos;s hard to imagine how she would have become the cultural force she is. In the 90s she was as big as either Gallagher brother, pushing the boundaries of electronica and house music when previously in dance music women were mainly used to supply anonymous (and often trite) vocals over the beats. She also navigated fame with a baby \u2013 at 20 she gave birth to her son, Sindri (now 27). &quot;On my first tour with the Sugarcubes with him I was like, &apos;OK, this kid is really going to love being on the road or hate it. If he hates it I&apos;m going to have to go back and work in a fish factory.&apos;&quot; History records that the fish factory wasn&apos;t necessary, but it must have been tough. &quot;I guess I was lucky. In Iceland everybody at that time had kids young. You know, we win all those surveys that we are the best place for women. So I didn&apos;t have to worry about a lot of stuff that was probably more complicated for women in England.&quot; Although she made her choices very young, she made pretty good ones, often by instinct. Despite offers from Warner, Sony and other music industry giants who came to Iceland to try to sign the Sugarcubes, it wasn&apos;t Bj\u00f6rk and her friends&apos; philosophy to sign big. Instead, her friend Derek Birkett, a bass player in punk band Flux of Pink Indians, started the record company One Little Indian around them at the indie record shop where they all worked shifts.. &quot;These were not the type of people who say: &apos;Leave your kids at home when you tour,&apos;&quot; Bj\u00f6rk says. Nearly 30 years on, Birkett is still her manager and One Little Indian her label. They still own a record shop, Bad Taste, in downtown Reykjav\u00edk, and she says they&apos;ve never had a\u00a0formal meeting. &quot;We just sort of go for a walk and talk about our kids and then he goes: &apos;Do you wanna play Tokyo next year?&apos; and then we go from there.&quot; Their enduring relationship is one of the keys to Planet Bj\u00f6rk. &quot;The pressure only comes from people who want you to repeat yourself and we have shaken off those people,&quot; she says. &quot;The only ones left are the ones who understand I\u00a0have to do things how I do things.&quot; Birkett is the sole publisher of all her work, from the tiny, idiosyncratic books to the massive, swirling projects like Biophilia. This is critical to her because it allows her to create more. &quot;More people get burned out by not putting out enough,&quot; she says. &quot;Once you&apos;ve done something you need to get it out there otherwise you&apos;re all stifled.&quot; After lunch, Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s mum drives us to the local cinema to watch a screening of Biophilia Live. The film has been remastered and Bj\u00f6rk wants to check the sound and see what some of her friends think. Her form appears on screen in a huge ginger wig, a blue chinstrap extravagantly painted on her face and a dress like some intergalactic mollusc. In her seat she listens intently. There are not many artists who can combine the lifecycle of a jellyfish with a breakbeat and make it work. But this is an extraordinary piece, perhaps more an opera, where Bj\u00f6rk and drummer Manu Delago are at their virtuosic best. It&apos;s utterly bonkers yet moving \u2013 especially a strange love song set to a\u00a0mutating virus. It should be mandatory viewing for anyone about to dam a glacial river to facilitate aluminium smelting. Afterwards, Bj\u00f6rk seems happy. Her extended clan of family and friends stands outside chatting, enjoying the Reykjav\u00edk wind. &quot;That man is Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s father,&quot; Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s mum nods towards a neat man in a sports jacket. These days he looks neither like a commune dweller nor even a Hendrix fan. Before we part, I ask Bj\u00f6rk if she could ever see herself committing in a more permanent way to the environment, perhaps in a\u00a0political sense. She tells me a cautionary tale. Her comedian friend, J\u00f3n Gnarr, who began a\u00a0political party for a joke, got elected and now, as the Mayor of Reykjav\u00edk, has 14 hours of meetings a day. &quot;At the moment I get to write songs as much as I want,&quot; she says. &quot;Sometimes I go to meetings and that&apos;s important, but they do drive me kind of nuts. I would not want to increase the meetings or decrease the music making, you know what I mean?&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["This may simply be because it is difficult to find a buyer for Thursday\u2019s Japan versus Greece Group C game at the Est\u00e1dio das Dunas in Natal, but the report notes admiringly that the sellers from Tokyo are \u201cnot trying to profit\u201d."], "tags": ["World Cup 2014", "World Cup", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-18T23:19:59Z", "title": "World Cup diary: Boy \u2018staged land rights protest before opening game\u2019", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/19/world-cup-diary-boy-land-rights-protest", "article": "The opening ceremony was almost a week ago but it continues to throw up controversy.

The pianist and composer Horace Silver, who has died aged 85, took the genre in the latter direction, and pioneered &quot;hard bop&quot; in the 1950s and 60s. A supreme craftsman, Silver was a member of the Jazz Messengers and formed a succession of quintets whose music appealed to audiences beyond jazz. Tunes entitled Opus de Funk, Doodlin&apos;, The Preacher, Home Cookin&apos; and Soulville reflected this new departure, though his mercurial approach transcended any rigid stylistic limits. He was born in Norwalk, Connecticut. His father, John Tavares Silva, came from the Cape Verde Islands but anglicised his name to Silver after arriving in the US, where he worked in a rubber factory. His mother, Gertrude, was a maid. Mostly self-taught, Horace doubled as a saxophonist as a teenager before concentrating on the piano and emulating the bebop great Bud Powell&apos;s intricate right-hand phrases and blunt, propulsive touch. Realising that Powell&apos;s virtuoso technique was out of reach for him, Silver modified the style through chords, crafty use of space and oddball quotes from other melodies. Underpinned by pounding left-hand figures, these imparted a special kind of bonhomie, while the lack of bombast made Silver exceptionally convincing as a blues pianist. For many years, he played with his right wrist arched high over the keys, useless for fast fingering but effective for making each note ring out. Whereas frontline soloists expected pianists to feed them appropriate chords, Silver laid down more intrusive patterns, closer to riffs from a swing band. At Club Sundown in Hartford, Connecticut, where Silver&apos;s trio often backed visiting artists, the saxophonist Stan Getz was so impressed that in 1950 he hired all three unknowns as his touring rhythm section. With his silky skills presented in relatively restrained settings, Getz had personified cool jazz but he now seemed to relish Silver&apos;s insistent accompaniment. At their first recording session, Getz loosened up, chucked quotes around and matched Silver for uninhibited swing: no other contemporary pianist could have got that from him. Silver performed a similar service for Miles Davis, appearing on many classic tracks in 1954, taking a splendid blues solo on Weirdo and offering the trumpeter fresh rhythmic impetus. The avant-garde pianist Cecil Taylor has since acknowledged Silver&apos;s gutsy attack as a vital influence. Having moved to New York, Silver was in demand for live gigs and records. On sessions under his name for Blue Note in 1952-53, he led trios including the label&apos;s favourite drummer, Art Blakey. In another portent of the future, nine of the 14 pieces were Silver&apos;s own. They soon recorded again under Silver&apos;s leadership, with the trumpeter Kenny Dorham and the tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley. The tracks were later combined on the album Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers (1955); by then, this outfit was a cooperative quintet, and hard bop had been born. Vinyl albums running 15 minutes per side encouraged groups to develop extended solos. On the live version of Soft Winds, the tension escalates behind Mobley; Blakey and Silver switch off when the trumpet takes over, then build inexorably until the performance reaches its emotional peak. Some of the Messengers were heroin users, and the difficulties this caused led Silver to break out and launch what became the most tightly organised of the hard bop quintets. He composed virtually all the material and won over the crowds through his affable personality and all-action approach. He crouched over the piano as the sweat poured out, with his forelock brushing the keys and his feet pounding. A former teenage admirer of the highly drilled Jimmie Lunceford orchestra of the 1930s, he knew the easy-sounding bits were the hardest to write and he devised methods, some almost subliminal, to give the round of solos an overall cohesiveness. The quintet lineup that lasted longest included the trumpeter Blue Mitchell and the saxophonist Junior Cook, a no-nonsense pairing that inspired some of Silver&apos;s happiest pieces, Blowin&apos; the Blues Away, Juicy Lucy, Sister Sadie and Filthy McNasty among them. Also from that period, the uncharacteristic slow ballad Peace has regularly attracted younger musicians and has been recorded by Norah Jones. The tenor saxophone star Joe Henderson joined in time for the bossa nova classic Song for My Father, part of a million-selling album of the same name. A tour of Japan inspired the album The Tokyo Blues (1962), gong sounds and all. Silver gradually calmed down \u2013 he had a history of back trouble and in the late 1960s suffered what could have been a repetitive-strain arm injury. A short-term switch to electric piano and a series of recordings with larger groups coincided with a far bigger change. He had occasionally put words to melodies (Se\u00f1or Blues, Peace, Psychedelic Sally), but during the 1970s his espousal of &quot;self-help holistic metaphysics&quot; inspired such titles as Moving Forward With Confidence, My Soul Is My Computer and Old Mother Nature Calls, with lyrics sometimes reminiscent of William McGonagall. The music itself barely altered but this didacticism contributed to him starting his own label, Silveto, after more than 20 years at Blue Note; some of his subsequent albums featured the brilliant saxophonist Eddie Harris and one had Bill Cosby as narrator. A believer in spiritualism, Silver organised prayer groups and claimed that Louis Armstrong had transmitted a tune to him over the ether, while a dream led to Rockin&apos; With Rachmaninoff (recorded in 1991 and finally released in 2003), a kind of musical about Duke Ellington, introducing the Russian composer to jazz. His quintet was still in demand for gigs and Silver frequently hired musicians years before critics raved about them \u2013 Tom Harrell, Dave Douglas, Vincent Herring and Bob Berg coming after Woody Shaw, Bennie Maupin and the brothers Randy and Michael Brecker. In the 1990s, he recorded for major labels and, now over his didactic tendencies, sounded as joyously creative as ever, cramming a wealth of detail into seemingly guileless routines and banging away behind solos. The results confirmed his place among the inimitable one-offs. The pianist Ran Blake and the singer Dee Dee Bridgewater both devoted albums to his work. Based in California since the 1970s, Silver was granted various honours by the US state and, in 2005, received a President&apos;s Merit award at the Grammy Salute to Jazz ceremony. He also set up the Horace Silver Foundation to give scholarships to aspiring jazz musicians. His autobiography, Let&apos;s Get to the Nitty Gritty, was published in 2005. He had a son, Gregory \u2013 now a rap musician under the name of G Wise \u2013 from his marriage to Barbara, which ended in divorce.   \u2022 Horace Ward Martin Tavares Silver, pianist and composer, born 2 September 1928; died 18 June 2014"}, {"sentences": ["They both loved Japan and married there at the Meiji shrine in Shibuya, Tokyo, in 1986."], "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Recycling", "Waste", "Ethical and green living", "Environment", "UK news", "London"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-19T15:04:58Z", "title": "Roger Ackling obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/19/roger-ackling", "article": "Recycling material and harnessing the power of the sun, the artist Roger Ackling, who has died aged 66 from motor neurone disease, used natural resources to make work that was exhibited all over the world. He would focus the sun&apos;s rays with a magnifying glass to burn grids of precise black lines into the surface of long-lost or discarded fragments of wooden artefacts found on beaches and in other marginal places. He used no expensive materials and, travelling light, could work anywhere in the world. It was important to him that he did not touch the object with an instrument, but used instead an energy source 93m miles away. Detritus was thus transformed into work of great power and beauty, with qualities akin to prehistoric art, which we find beautiful and compelling without knowing its meaning or purpose. For the last 40 years he worked outside and alone, the wood in his lap, the lens in his right hand, the sun over his right shoulder. In the 1970s he could work like this for only about an hour, but with practice this became seven hours of joyful, obsessional concentration. Colleagues at Chelsea School of Art, London, where he taught from the early 80s until 2012, knew he had been working the day before if his right ear was bright red when he came into college. He was an inspirational teacher for individual students, giving their work close attention and them great encouragement. He would make suggestions: &quot;Make something for your pocket. Make something to go in a drawer.&quot; They responded to a mischievous wit and irreverent attitude that were nevertheless accompanied by a deep seriousness about the value of making art. He was very supportive of students, often buying their work if he had any money. His dealer, David Juda, always remembered that Roger had bought a work from Juda&apos;s wife, Yuko Shiraishi, when she was a foundation-year student at Chelsea. Roger&apos;s own work is held in collections including that of the Arts Council of Great Britain, the British Museum, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Tate and the Victoria and Albert Museum.     Roger Ackling transformed detritus into work of great power and beauty    He was born in Isleworth, west London, but grew up on the Isle of Wight, where his parents, Walter and Jean, went to run a hotel. In the mid-60s, he went to Saint Martin&apos;s School of Art, London, where, in 1968, he met Richard Long, the land artist, who became a great friend. They cycled through France on a tandem in 1976, making individual bodies of work from the journey. In 2006, they collaborated on shared artworks, Long in Somerset and Ackling in Norfolk, each making his mark on a work and sending it to the other. He also met Hamish Fulton at St Martin&apos;s, and the three of them made a glorious triumvirate of artist friends with interests in common. In 1979, Roger and Hamish undertook a walk beginning and ending in H\u00f3lmavik on the north coast of Iceland, Hamish recording his walk in photographs and Roger working on the driftwood on the beach. In 1996, they walked along the Kii Peninsula in Japan and held a joint exhibition of the resulting work at the Museum of Modern Art, Wakayama. Roger met his future wife, Sylvia Crowther, at the wedding of the artists Trevor Sutton and Carol Robertson in 1985. They both loved Japan and married there at the Meiji shrine in Shibuya, Tokyo, in 1986. Roger and Trevor had taught together at Wimbledon School of Art in the 70s, and after Trevor moved to Chelsea School of Art he invited Roger to join him there in the painting school at the beginning of the 80s. Roger remained at Chelsea until he retired in 2012, insisting that he put up a final show in the Chelsea Space gallery at the same time as his graduating students, &quot;so they could be judged together&quot;. The Acklings lived for many years in north Norfolk, in a coastguard&apos;s cottage hanging over the sea, until forced to move by erosion. Many of Roger&apos;s pieces were made with wood found on the beach below the cottage. During his final illness, he had a great outpouring of work. This had a new lightness and humour and he put it together as grand installations in numerous exhibitions in countries including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the US. He always valued lightness and was a good footballer and a demon table-tennis player. He is survived by Sylvia, Jean, and his sister, Jane. \u2022 Walter Roger Ackling, artist, born 11 August 1947; died 5 June 2014"}, {"sentences": ["Throughout his career, he guest-conducted top orchestras, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra of Tokyo, but he was not rewarded with the top posts a conductor of his calibre might have deserved."], "tags": ["Classical music", "The Philharmonia Orchestra", "Culture", "Music", "UK news", "Spain", "Europe", "World news", "Conducting"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-19T17:46:13Z", "title": "Rafael Fr\u00fchbeck de Burgos obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/19/rafael-frubeck-de-burgos", "article": "The Spanish conductor Rafael Fr\u00fchbeck de Burgos, who has died aged 80, was held in affection and respect by audiences and musicians alike. In Britain he was particularly identified with the New Philharmonia Orchestra (later the Philharmonia Orchestra) and its chorus in the late 1960s and early 70s. With it, he made some of his finest recordings: Orff&apos;s Carmina Burana, Mendelssohn&apos;s Elijah, Haydn&apos;s Creation and Mozart&apos;s Requiem. His recording of Carmen was one of the first to restore the original spoken dialogue, though delivered by actors, and he was credited with conducting the first performance in Spain of Bach&apos;s St Matthew Passion. He also recorded the complete orchestral and stage works of Manuel de Falla and many zarzuelas. Other associations included those with the Philadelphia Orchestra, with which he made many guest appearances over four decades, the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington (1980-90), the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, where he was music director (1992-97), and the Italian RAI National Symphony Orchestra (principal conductor, 2001-07). Throughout his career, he guest-conducted top orchestras, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra of Tokyo, but he was not rewarded with the top posts a conductor of his calibre might have deserved. Born Rafael Fr\u00fchbeck, of German-Spanish parentage, he took the additional name of his birthplace, Burgos, to identify himself as Spanish when conducting abroad. After training at the Bilbao and Madrid conservatories, he entered military service as an army director of music (1953-56). He then studied conducting in Munich, returning to Spain as conductor of the Bilbao Symphony Orchestra (1958-62), following which he was appointed music director of the Spanish National Orchestra (1962-78). He was a keen proselytiser for Spanish music, including contemporary repertoire. He became musical director of the D\u00fcsseldorf Symphony Orchestra (1966-71), where he focused on symphonic rather than operatic music, before moving on to the Montreal Symphony Orchestra in 1974. His tenure there was short-lived: he was forced to step down after making disparaging off-the-record comments about the orchestra&apos;s brass section, which appeared in a local newspaper. After leaving Canada, he enjoyed his greatest successes in Europe, the US, Israel and Japan. His appointment as chief conductor and artistic director of the Dresden Philharmonic (2004-11) was one of several in which he achieved high standards with orchestras that were not in the very highest league. He also held a post with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. His last appointment was as chief conductor of the Danish National Orchestra (2012). His conducting was often described by musicians as &quot;old school&quot;, but in the most complimentary way. His Brahms and Bruckner with the Dresden Philharmonic, for example, and his Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Eighth with the Swedish Radio Orchestra had a sense of space and rhetoric that were never allowed to weigh the music down. The lyrical warmth he brought to his classic Carmina Burana recording, combined with an obvious affection for the work, set it apart from more prosaically high-octane performances. His conducting of De Falla and Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo not surprisingly sounded idiomatic \u2013 Rimsky-Korsakov&apos;s Scheherazade was also particularly convincing \u2013 but he was successful, too, in Ottorino Respighi&apos;s tone poems. The Carmen recording benefited not only from an empathy for local colour but also from a top-level cast, including Grace Bumbry and Jon Vickers. The decision to return to the work&apos;s op\u00e9ra comique origins, while welcome, was vitiated by the placing of a largely separate cast of actors in a different spatial ambience. Fr\u00fchbeck, as he was familiarly known, was a man of great charm and elegance. Both choral and orchestral musicians relished the way he invited them to make music with him, often extending his hand, with a smile, at their entry. In March of this year he collapsed on the podium while conducting in Washington. He recovered and continued to the end of the concert, but earlier this month announced that he was retiring forthwith from the concert platform, having been diagnosed with cancer. His wife, Mar\u00eda Carmen Mart\u00ednez, whom he married in 1959, survives him, as do a son and a daughter. \u2022 Rafael Fr\u00fchbeck de Burgos, conductor, born 15 September 1933; died 11 June 2014"}, {"sentences": ["), as well as a Liszt recital recorded in Tokyo in 1972, with selections from the Transcendental Studies and the Ann\u00e9es de P\u00e8lerinage."], "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-19T21:00:00Z", "title": "John Ogdon: The RCA Recordings review - a vivid reminder of a virtuoso", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/19/john-ogdon-rca-recordings-review", "article": "John Ogdon died 25 years ago, at the age of 52, and the anniversary has already been commemorated this year with a biography and a TV documentary. But this collection of his recordings for RCA is the best possible memorial, a vivid reminder of what a fine pianist Ogdon was, particularly in the high-romantic and 20th-century repertoires closest to his heart. There are discs of Rachmaninov (the two monumental piano sonatas), Beethoven&apos;s Hammerklavier Sonata and the piano music of Carl Nielsen (who else championed that?), as well as a Liszt recital recorded in Tokyo in 1972, with selections from the Transcendental Studies and the Ann\u00e9es de P\u00e8lerinage. The virtuoso command in all the performances is extraordinary, though that is sometimes achieved at the expense of subtlety and colour; Ogdon is perhaps heard at his very best in Alkan&apos;s Concerto for Solo Piano, a record he made at a time (1969) when the composer&apos;s music was only just beginning to be explored seriously.

The incident drew criticism from across the political spectrum after unidentified male assembly members, all thought to belong to the conservative Liberal Democratic party (LDP), shouted abuse at Ayaka Shiomura as she questioned the city administration&apos;s commitment to helping pregnant women and young mothers, as Japan attempts to tackle its low birthrate. One shouted: &quot;You&apos;re the one who should get married as soon as possible.&quot; Another asked if she was able to have children, prompting laughter among other male councillors. Colleagues of Shiomura, a 35-year-old member of the centre-right Your party, demanded that the hecklers be identified and punished. The LDP&apos;s Tokyo chapter did not deny the remarks were made but said there was insufficient evidence to punish individual councillors. The outbursts are an embarrassment to the prime minister and leader of the LDP, Shinzo Abe, who is pushing to increase the number of women in senior positions in business and improve Japan&apos;s poor standing in global gender equality rankings. The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said the behaviour of LDP representatives in the Tokyo assembly was not a reflection of the party&apos;s national policies. He added: &quot;If there were comments of a sexist nature, I would like the assembly to clean up its act.&quot; The health minister, Norihisa Tamura, whose portfolio includes promoting women in the workplace, said the abuse was &quot;deeply disrespectful to women&quot;. Masako Mori, the minister responsible for tackling the low birthrate, described the comments as &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;. Shiomura and her party colleagues were unable to identify the hecklers, but said the comments had originated in a section of the assembly chamber occupied by members of the LDP. Eyewitnesses said Shiomura had been reduced to tears by the intervention, but continued with her remarks. &quot;The male members&apos; offensive remarks indicate they think women who aren&apos;t married, or can&apos;t bear a child, aren&apos;t worth listening to,&quot; Shiomura told the Wall Street Journal. &quot;For such male members, understanding and making policies for women who want to but can&apos;t marry or have children would be difficult.&quot; The incident unleashed an outpouring of indignation on social media and a flurry of angry phone calls to the Tokyo metropolitan government. As of noon on Friday, 35,000 people had signed an online petition calling on the LDP&apos;s Tokyo chapter to name the culprits and administer a &quot;severe punishment&quot;. Shiomura&apos;s post describing her ordeal had been retweeted more than 20,000 times by Thursday evening. One woman urged her to establish the identity of the hecklers &quot;so I can make sure I never vote for them again&quot;. The composition of the Tokyo assembly reflects the under-representation of women in positions of influence in Japan. Just 27 of the chamber&apos;s 127 representatives are female.

Then I spot a strange scene that assures me I haven&apos;t taken a wrong turn. Through a townhouse&apos;s wide glass doors, I spy six expectant-looking people sitting around a long table, while a man at the back is carefully arranging a row of plates on a\u00a0makeshift bar. &quot;Is\u00a0this EatWith?&quot; I ask tentatively, but I already know the answer. Dining in unusual places with people that you&apos;ve never met is what Eatwith.com was invented for. The website is an online directory of supper\u00a0clubs: anyone can apply to be a\u00a0host, in\u00a0their home or a venue of their \u00a0choice, and anyone who pays a small fee can attend. Founded in Tel Aviv, the site has had an incredible first year, expanding to feature 20 countries, including the US, Japan, Brazil and Italy. But it&apos;s in Barcelona, the official launch city, that it is the most active, with an astonishing 200\u00a0hosts. And so this is where I come to give it a\u00a0trial run. Earlier, after logging in and browsing the options on the website, I&apos;d found myself drawn to\u00a0the idea of a chocolate-themed night. Although most events take place in people&apos;s dining rooms, this one proves slightly different. The ground floor of the house has been transformed into an events space by Miquel, a\u00a0thirtysomething, self-taught artisan chocolatier. Whitewashed walls cocoon an interior that&apos;s almost empty, bar a few well-sourced pieces of vintage furniture \u2013 an old fridge here, a hefty chest of drawers there. The online description was a little vague (&quot;It&apos;s just creativity and madness!&quot;), so I&apos;m not sure what to expect. What I get is a remarkably imaginative, multi-course tasting menu. First: a smooth chocolate fondant, covered in a lightly whipped carrot mousse. Next: tender ravioli, filled with lentils and chocolate, in a miso broth. It&apos;s weird but it works. Both dishes are perfectly executed, attractively presented and surprisingly moreish. And the meal costs me just \u00a313 \u2013 about the same as a tour of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.     Miquel hosting an EatWith evening.     Miquel says EatWith \u2013 which takes 15% of what each guest pays \u2013 is serving him well as he tries to build up his business of making and, he hopes, exporting chocolates. &quot;People ask why I don&apos;t just get customers off the streets,&quot; he says, &quot;but I like the flexibility. I like the characteristics of the people it brings. This is not a shop. I am not looking to compete with normal chocolatiers.&quot; Although EatWith originally set out to target tourists, the biggest uptake in locations all over the world has come from locals. My fellow diners all live in Barcelona, despite originating from places as far-flung as Mexico, Sweden, Canada, France and Italy. Two of them are EatWith hosts themselves: outgoing Andrea, the Italian, hosts pizza parties in his back garden, and Monica, a firecracker from Mexico City, holds Mexican/Syrian food nights, to reflect her own mixed heritage. Underpinning the site is an idea that\u00a0everyone should have some sort of\u00a0USP \u2013 be that the cuisine, the theme\u00a0or the setting. To keep standards up, EatWith approves all its hosts, and those wanting to gain an additional &quot;verified&quot; badge can also be\u00a0visited by an inspector, who will check their menu, venue and interpersonal skills. Some would say supper clubs should be more of an underground network, operating without a middleman but at\u00a0least this site is taking responsibility, and offering its hosts support and, in some places, informal training.     Xabi preparing food for his dinner party    Over the course of my weekend, I\u00a0try two other EatWith dinners to get an idea of the variety on offer. One night I find myself in a fully open-plan apartment belonging to Xabi, a professional chef who has worked in Michelin-starred restaurants. He was running supper clubs and cookery classes before EatWith but the site has given him a\u00a0wider reach. He serves a six-course menu (\u00a343pp including wine), ably assisted by a grandmotherly type called \u00c0ngels, who squeezes my arm as she sets down every dish: potato ravioli with truffle mayonnaise and rusi\u00f1ol (a local mushroom), and suquet (Catalan fish stew) with fennel confit. My final meal is with a young couple, Vanessa and Renato, who offer a night of traditional Catalan food in their one-bedroom apartment in the city centre. Here, we dig into delicious esqueixada de bacall\u00e0 (salt cod with tomatoes, onions, olives and vinegar) and fideu\u00e0, a Catalonian paella made with noodles. Before all this we try drinking wine out of a porr\u00f3 \u2013 those traditional glass carafes with a spout you hold above your mouth, moving your arm further and further away as your pour. It&apos;s an ice-breaker with a difference and I last about three seconds before dribbling down my front. Vanessa and Renato&apos;s dinner is also unlike the others because they join us to eat, rather than just serving the food. We sit surrounded by their books and travel photos and, as there are just two other guests (both Barcelona residents), it feels like I&apos;ve popped round to a friend&apos;s house for dinner. I&apos;m not sure how the evenings pan out in other countries but here the sobremesa (after-dinner conversation) at each event lasts for hours, and I\u00a0wonder if I have just lucked out with\u00a0particularly fine company. However, the early days of a peer-to-peer site are often the glory days, so if\u00a0you&apos;re considering it, now&apos;s the time to try EatWith. It&apos;s no more of a gamble than any restaurant \u2013 and could be far more entertaining.\u2022 More details from EatWith.com.

The walls of Hobart&apos;s Prince of Wales Battery, made of big slabs of sandstone, are covered in dust and cobwebs. And Manning\u2019s piece, Sad Majick, is like a little spider of light in the centre of one of the spaces. Attached to an oscillating fan, an LED light spins nervously, unleashing shards of coloured light from two glass prisms.  Showing his work outside the &quot;white cube&quot; of a gallery is an uncommon but rewarding experience for the artist. &quot;The contrast is really nice with the cave-like underground, that\u2019s cold and dark, and then having these little stations of energy, movement and intensity,\u201d says Manning over the phone.         Sad Majick, recorded here at Sydney's Museum of Contemporary Art.    It is not the only installation Manning has at the Dark Mofo festival. At the Town Hall Underground are three additional works: Dichroic Filter Piece, Double Refraction and Small Spiral. Each displays a love of gadgetry and a sculptural harmony of form, colour and movement, that typifies much of the 36-year-old artist&apos;s work. The works seem to unlock a hidden beauty from ordinary objects. Take Double Refraction, that uses an LCD screen and layers of plastic to alter dimensions of light and expose an optical phenomenon that is normally trapped in the material. The work has a colour and sheen found in a butterfly\u2019s wing, and is an enimagtic portrait of a piece of technology omnipresent in modern life, but that few of its users know much about.  Manning\u2019s former life as a repairman for data projectors, a job he took in part thanks to his love for technology, has clearly fed into his new life as an artist. He has a surgeon-like passion for the inner workings of machinery. &quot;When you show a video through a data projector you have predeterminants that technology will produce your artwork out of. I like to start with the technology, start with the machine, and then try and get it to do the things I want it to do.&quot; And yet more proof that life experience is essential to making good art, Manning also highlights the years he spent in Japan, working as an English teacher, as a period of great influence on his art practice. It is not hard to draw a line between his art and a city like Tokyo, where there&apos;s &quot;lots of sound, and everything is flashing&quot; and his work.  &quot;Japan is where I first started mucking around with electronics. I would go into Akihabara and all the electronics stalls. It was a music focus because I built my own instruments and electronics for audio. In Japan is where I saw all this amazing music and art and also got the chance to start building and experimenting with my own stuff.&quot; Despite his love of technology, there is also a sense that through his work he is searching for a Platonic ideal. &quot;I like to keep it stripped down, cut out as much noise as possible. I\u2019m really interested in movement and light and sound. Those three things seem to effect you on a primal, instinctual level. For a viewer it activates more senses than just looking and thinking, there\u2019s movement and light and people become aware of spatial changes and shadow.&quot; But Manning argues that for authenticity&apos;s sake, he has also preserved nature\u2019s \u201cmessiness\u201d. He mentions Small Spiral, a kinetic hanging mobile with a double helix shape and reminiscent of scientific dioramas. Manning has kept the chords and power boards of the work exposed, an element many others artists may choose to hide.  &quot;I get a little suspicious with things that are too neat, tidy and clean. Because life isn\u2019t tidy and clean and everyone is completely flawed. I like to expose all the workings of things.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["US security analysts say the expected moves to large-scale investments in military drones are a natural phenomenon given the geopolitical and economic rivalries in Asia, which are expected to only intensify as Beijing and Tokyo aggressively pursue their interests in the South China Sea."], "tags": ["Technology sector", "Drones (military)", "Business", "US news", "World news", "Technology", "China", "Japan", "Russia", "Weapons technology"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-22T15:45:08Z", "title": "Drone markets open in Russia, China and rogue states as America's wars wane", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/22/drones-market-us-military-china-russia-rogue-state", "article": "Last October, in a private ceremony held at a stately mansion on the campus of the California Institute of Technology, the Aerospace Historical Society awarded the reclusive, 78-year-old CEO of General Atomics, Neal Blue, with the prestigious Von Karman Wings Award, a sort of Nobel Prize in the field, for \u201cpioneering novel applications&quot; of military drones.  For Blue, whose life reads like a thriller of private jets, oil profits and secret sorties to the Nicaraguan jungle, and whose company makes military drones with names like Predator and Reaper, the award capped the dominance of profits from drone manufacturing for his company and for the US drone industry at large.  That boomtime of drones \u2013 a decade-long celebration of war technology \u2013 was all largely fueled by the US military\u2019s appetite for stealth and surveillance. Now the US military is backing off, and the drone industry is starting to look elsewhere to profits \u2013 even to some of the United States&apos; deep-pocketed, warmongering adversaries.  For drone manufacturers, it doesn&apos;t seem to matter where the profits come from, as long as they keep rolling in. Dominated by four major US companies \u2013 Northrop Grumman, Boeing, General Atomics and Lockheed Martin \u2013 the global drone-making sector is expected to reach a market value of $82bn by 2022, according to internal PowerPoint slides provided to the Guardian by a senior analyst at the leading defense and security agency IHS Jane\u2019s. The thorny thing is: those billions of dollars in profits are likely to be coming from some unsavory quarters. The US market for drones is shrinking because the biggest buyer \u2013 the US government \u2013 is dropping its purchases because of budget pressures and the end of large-scale wars in Afghanistan.  To respond to market pressures, the largest four private US drone manufacturers are now actively courting foreign buyers for business, said the analyst, who requested anonymity for this article in order to speak candidly on issues related to agency clients.     A US military predator drone. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features    \u201cThe United States has been using drones as a weapon of warfare for a decade and it was only a matter of time before other nation-states were going to do the same,\u201d says University of Utah law professor Amos Guiora, an international law expert on drone warfare. \u201cRight now, there is no policy anywhere in the world to stop drones from getting into the hands of anyone who wants them, so the possibilities for profits are endless,\u201d Guiora says. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially become a sort of wild west.\u2019\u201d  The majority of the growth in drone buyers will come from the Asia-Pacific Region, according to IHS Jane&apos;s. China, India and Japan lead the pack, with Japan expected to expand its now virtually non-existent military drone program by roughly 600% in the coming decade. US security analysts say the expected moves to large-scale investments in military drones are a natural phenomenon given the geopolitical and economic rivalries in Asia, which are expected to only intensify as Beijing and Tokyo aggressively pursue their interests in the South China Sea.  The capitalist center of gravity is shifting on drones. The huge profits companies can make in the coming decade in the production and sale of drones are all coming from abroad. Any regulations put into place here in the United States or at the international level will be fighting the tide of profits.  \u201cThe market dictates where you sell. It\u2019s clearly not containable,\u201d said Trevor Timm, co-founder and executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation who has written extensively on drones. \u201cYou can look at who wants them and who has them. And as the country that has the most, who are we to change the rules of the game?\u201d Not that the international community is likely to act. There is no established international convention at the United Nations to regulate armed predator drones \u2013 just one reason that critics say there is a high probability that drones will end up in the hands of rogue states and problematic actors.      Drones may enter the contest between Japan and China over the disputed Senkaku islands in the East China Sea.  Photograph: Japan Pool/AFP/Getty Images    This is what happens when your biggest market shrinks, and with it, your profits. \u201cThe growing competition that these suppliers have is the issue, the world market is evolving and the US is under pressure. It\u2019s got a reducing home market that will reach a low point in 2016 and in order to maintain the supply base, they [suppliers] need to look outward,\u201d said the analyst at IHS Jane\u2019s. \u201cRussia and China are projected to invest significant amounts in research and development, which will account for large parts of those sales.\u201d The International Institute for Strategic Studies identifies only 11 countries \u2013 the US, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, the UK, Russia, China, India, Iran and Israel \u2013 who currently possess armed military drones. The United States operates the most sophisticated predator drone fleet in the world, but the huge market advantage that American-made predator drones have enjoyed for over a decade will be significantly reduced in the coming years, according to the IHS Jane\u2019s analyst. \u201cRussia and China\u2019s capabilities are quickly developing. By the end of the decade, if certainly not before, we have intel that shows they\u2019ll have the potential to develop the capability to produce a predator drone on par with American standards,\u201d said the analyst.     A pilot's heads up display from the view of a camera on an MQ-9 Reaper during a training mission. Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty Images    Despite the cutbacks on orders for drone production, there is still considerable money to be made for America\u2019s top defense contractors. One such lucrative military drone program is the MQ-9 Reaper system, made by General Atomics.  The MQ-9 Reaper is an armed, multi-mission, remotely piloted aircraft that has completed missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Because of its capabilities to reach over 300 mph and its pinpoint accuracy, it is known within Washington as the crown jewel of the government\u2019s drone fleet. The US air force currently owns 104 of these aircraft, which has cost US taxpayers nearly $6bn since production began in October 2007, according to public records. The program is slated to end in 2018. After several attempts to reach General Atomics, company representatives refused to comment for this article. One way General Atomics and its competitors could substantially increase these billion-dollar profits in the coming years is if the US State Department relaxes its current restrictions on arms exports, said the analyst. Under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, operated by the State Department\u2019s Directorate of Trade Controls, armed military drones are not approved for exports. \u201cThe pace and development of the market is going to have to be absolutely tied to these ITAR rules and regulations,\u201d said the analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s not absolutely clear how these regulations will evolve.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 22 June, 2014 to say the global drone-making sector is expected to reach a market value of $82bn by 2022."}, {"sentences": ["Now it looks like the trading of shares, which has drifted away from the main exchanges in London, New York and Tokyo into dark pools,may need to be forced back onto the main exchanges."], "tags": ["Banking", "Business", "Barclays", "US economy", "Economics", "Financial sector"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-26T18:37:53Z", "title": "Barclays allegations and inside the murky world of dark pools", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/26/barclays-allegations-dark-pool-trading-system-private", "article": "What is a dark pool? Banks in the US and Europe created these pseudo exchanges to carry out transactions on behalf of big clients who wanted to conduct huge buy or sell deals without the price moving as the deal was done. The term &quot;dark pool&quot; was coined to sum up the opaque nature of these privately run platforms, which have become one of the main devices banks use to match buyers and sellers away from the main exchanges. They are computer-driven, and cheaper than sending buy and sell orders through the US&apos;s 13 public exchanges. Around 45 dark pools are in operation. The biggest are understood to be run by JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. Who benefits? There are several selling points. The trades tend to be large slugs of shares that would attract the attention of other large shareholders, either spooking them into selling their shares of encouraging them to buy more. Dark pools only report data after a trade has occurred. At\u00a0that stage, information about the trade has little influence on the price. In the past investors who wanted to process a big trade would break it up into a number of smaller transactions \u2013 but algorithmic traders used computers to spot these trading patterns and prices were effected as they moved in to buy and sell at the same time. There was also a promise that high frequency traders \u2013 dubbed the great white sharks of the investment business in Michael Lewis&apos;s new book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt \u2013 and algorithmic traders would also be prevented from participating and incorporating dark pool trading in their computer-driven dealings. Lastly, there was the price tag. Banks promised to process trades at cheaper, bulk rates compared with rival big exchanges. This price promise has now attracted many smaller investors in search of a cheap transaction. Why are they a problem? Critics say dark pools are parasitic, largely unregulated and open to abuse. Parasitic because they price trades using\u00a0data off the main exchanges. Unregulated because while banks must submit detailed accounts to regulators about their reserves and liabilities, dealing in client funds has been, to a great extent, a private affair \u2013 at least until there are complaints (see Barclays). They are open to abuse when the balance of information is uneven between the client and the matchmaker. The dark pool operator is in possession of very big, market-moving information on\u00a0trades which they, or their staff, might front-run (ie deal in advance with\u00a0inside knowledge). Are they a threat to existing exchanges? According to Reuters, dark pools now account for up to 40% of shares traded in the US, up from around 16% six years ago. Are regulators doing anything about it? John Ramsay, a former head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission&apos;s (SEC) trading and markets division, told reporters in February that dark pools were &quot;a real concern&quot;. Without saying when regulators should intervene, he said: &quot;We have academic data now that suggests that, yes, in fact there is a point beyond which the level of dark trading for particular securities can really erode market\u00a0quality.&quot; Since then, and with added pressure of Lewis&apos;s book \u2013 in which he says the markets are effectively rigged in favour of banks and high frequency traders \u2013 it appears the SEC has been digging around to see what goes on. Why are Barclays in the firing line? The UK bank is accused of ushering in the high-frequency traders to its secretive LX Liquidity Cross alternative trading system and letting them run riot. Or more precisely, let them bid on trades with clients without their knowledge. The New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said Barclays told customers who chose to trade in its dark pool that they would be protected from these &quot;predatory traders&quot;, which use their speed advantage \u2013 processing trades through superfast fibre-optic cables \u2013 to deprive other investors of small profits on every trade. The bank courted high-frequency traders in part by charging them virtually nothing, Schneiderman claimed. What happens next? In the months after the financial crash, regulators have worked to put exotic derivatives trading behind the sub-prime mortgage crash through open exchanges, where it can be monitored. Now it looks like the trading of shares, which has drifted away from the main exchanges in London, New York and Tokyo into dark pools,may need to be forced back onto the main exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq exchange have allowed brokerages to place dark pool-style orders on their platforms, with the trade hidden until after it is executed. This practice could be tackled by regulators."}, {"sentences": ["Photograph: Everett Collection Historical/Alamy    Tokyo&apos;s postwar reconstruction and expansion took a different route altogether.", "Instead of large-scale developments built on a rigid grid system, Tokyo&apos;s boom was powered by small-time building contractors and private individuals building single family homes, informal settlements which were gradually incorporated into the city as a whole.", "The Shibuya crossing in Tokyo."], "tags": ["London", "Cities", "UK news", "New York", "World news", "Population", "Planning policy", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-27T15:15:00Z", "title": "London's population is booming, so what's the solution? | Feargus O'Sullivan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/27/london-population-booming-new-york-tokyo", "article": "Last year, the entire population of Carlisle moved to London.

Between 2001 and 2011 average London household sizes grew for the first time in a century, and with new home construction lagging behind population growth, that shows no sign of abating. So where next for London? Looking back at other cities that have experienced population spikes in the past could provide some lessons. When New York&apos;s population more than tripled between 1850 and 1900, the city responded by building dense and (by the period&apos;s standards) high, constructing cheap tenements within the city&apos;s heart. Given housebuilders&apos; prioritising of the bottom line over healthy living conditions, it&apos;s no great surprise that they tended to be cramped, dingy and verminous. When greater affluence thinned these buildings&apos; populations out a bit, however, these New York tenements eventually turned out be potentially good places to live. Still, even today you can&apos;t poke your head out into an old New York building&apos;s rear light well without smelling the greed that forced so many to live in ill-ventilated murk.

Photograph: Everett Collection Historical/Alamy    Tokyo&apos;s postwar reconstruction and expansion took a different route altogether. Instead of large-scale developments built on a rigid grid system, Tokyo&apos;s boom was powered by small-time building contractors and private individuals building single family homes, informal settlements which were gradually incorporated into the city as a whole. The results may have looked scrappy and provisional but, coupled with initially affordable land prices, this laissez-faire planning strategy seems to have worked, even if much land has since been redeveloped. There are, of course, less rapacious or haphazard models out there. Many European cities \u2013 London included \u2013 have tried a more systematic, socially responsible approach to population growth and overcrowding by building new towns on their peripheries, whether garden cities such as Letchworth and Basildon or dense high-rise districts like Paris&apos;s Sarcelles or Bratislava&apos;s Petr\u017ealka. These have been a mixed blessing. Some of them proved so popular that their housing became too expensive to house the working-class populations they were intended for, ultimately shunting housing problems elsewhere. Denser, more urban developments may have boosted housing quality, meanwhile, but they tended to export inner city poverty problems to the periphery where they were more likely to be ignored.     The Shibuya crossing in Tokyo. Photograph: Patrick Batchelder/Alamy    So which model should contemporary London be following to meet the needs of its growing population? Should it be building cheap, high-density housing in the city core? Or planned new towns on the city edge? Or should it be relaxing planning laws and providing incentives to help people build what they need without hindrance? Perhaps the greatest problem London currently faces is that it is adopting no solution with much gusto. All these former models have their problems, but at least they actually show cities taking meaningful action and building housing for people on low incomes. Newcomers to London, by contrast, are arriving in a city that has sidelined ordinary people&apos;s housing needs because it has grown giddy with the potential profits to be made by building for the rentier rich. Certainly, London may be building upwards like Hong Kong did. It&apos;s not building social housing, however, but steel and glass eyries designed mainly (to paraphrase Mike Leigh) to give absentee landlords a nice, clear view of the class struggle down below. The city is actually moving backwards, bulldozing desperately needed social housing such as Elephant &amp; Castle&apos;s Heygate Estate to replace it with private flats and a feather-light dusting of (almost meaninglessly designated) affordable homes. Granted, there are cosy little plans like the proposed garden suburb at Ebbsfleet, but these fail by such a margin to match the city&apos;s real needs, they&apos;re a bit like dabbing TCP on a shark bite. London isn&apos;t learning from history at all. Its developers are just fiddling while the city&apos;s affordable housing stock burns."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I set a target at the Tokyo Game Show for 5m units.", "He talks about going to dinner with Platinum Games during last year&apos;s Tokyo Game Show to secure the studio&apos;s first Xbox exclusive, Scalebound (&quot;it turns out that our team working with them on the game is just around the corner from me - they get tired of me turning up&quot;)."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "E3 2014", "Sony", "Microsoft", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-27T15:48:20Z", "title": "PlayStation and Xbox bosses discuss the future: 'We made the right call'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/27/playstation-xbox-sony-andrew-house-phil-spencer", "article": "In a small room on the upper floor of the Galen Center, Phil Spencer is waiting for the press. Two hours ago, this vast arena saw Microsoft&apos;s pre-E3 press conference, a 90-minute event in which Spencer, now head of Xbox, laid out the future of the company&apos;s console business. It was something of a success, a barrage of game demos from big-hitters to indie newcomers.  Getting to see Spencer requires a walk into the bowels of the building accompanied by PR staff, then a service elevator up to the second floor, another long corridor, and finally a room filled with more PR people. As ever he smiles a big charming smile while the Microsoft staff tap away on laptops, not looking up; they will have briefed him carefully on who I am and what media outlet I write for. There is no natural light in here. &quot;The second year for any console is an important year,&quot; says Spencer as we chat about the conference. &quot;The first E3 is always challenging because the developers are working on early dev kits for a console that hasn&apos;t launched yet. Just thinking about last year in terms of what we showed \u2026&quot; he pauses and changes direction. &quot;This year we brought a great line up. We wanted to show Xbox One owners, and potential owners, what games they&apos;re going to get to play in 2014 and beyond. There was a lot of game content - I don&apos;t need to see more of me talking on stage.&quot; Inside Sony&apos;s E3 headquarters Two days later, I&apos;m over at Sony&apos;s traditional E3 enclave, the JW Marriott hotel, right next to the convention centre. Andrew House, the head of Sony Computer Entertainment, is holed up in a suite on the third floor, a much brighter room, looking out over the eight-lane flyover that snakes out toward South LA. Assured and understated, he is much more of a businessman than Spencer. When he talks he glances at a page full of handwritten notes.  I ask if there&apos;s a sense of self-congratulation at Sony. PlayStation 4 has come into E3 with 7m units sold and a clear lead over Xbox One. &quot;Seriously, we&apos;ve been absolutely delighted with the success,&quot; he says. &quot;I set a target at the Tokyo Game Show for 5m units. There was considerable skepticism about the role of consoles, given the massively changed device landscape that consumers have. It was important that we were able to exceed those fairly aggressive goals. &quot;But also, we were able to exceed the launch period of PlayStation 2, which is really significant. People maybe underestimated the fact that, although PS4 is primarily a game device, it did arrive fully baked as a multifunctional entertainment machine, which is kind of what PS3 migrated into over time. I think there&apos;s a primary user motivated by great games, but I think there&apos;s a secondary user who also wants a great Netflix device, or a great video streaming device, or a great catch-up TV device.&quot;  The return of multimedia  While Microsoft completely sidestepped the whole multimedia angle in its presentation, Sony spent time discussing tertiary features like the streaming games service PlayStation Now, the mini secondary console PlayStation TV, and the exclusive Marvel TV series, Powers. This is the sort of demographic-widening stuff that Microsoft relied on for its original Xbox One unveiling event last year \u2013 the event that gamers hated.  House shrugs away concerns. &quot;You have to continue to innovate at the system level, at the multifunctional element, to reach other audiences,&quot; he says. &quot;I announced at CES that our intention this year is to deliver a cloud TV service in the US. This is almost the final piece of the puzzle. You&apos;ve got music, you&apos;ve got streaming video, you&apos;ve got games, now you can have a service that elegantly combines live TV and video-on-demand with a really slick user interface that is, with all due respect, far ahead of the television manufacturers because of the native processing power of PS4.&quot;       So where does television and video-on-demand sit in the Xbox plans at the moment? &quot;We&apos;ve got to win with the core gamer first, that is the most important customer for a games console,&quot; says Spencer. &quot;I wanted to make sure that we weren&apos;t only putting an E3 show together, because E3 will come and go, but that we&apos;re building a program that supports that customer.  &quot;However, Xbox Live is important, not only for games but also for the way all entertainment is consumed; we pulled the entertainment apps out from Gold membership because I wanted everyone to be able to use them. And the focus we have on television, on the HDMI In functionality, this is a long term focus. But it&apos;s about sequencing \u2013 making sure we win with gamers every single year and that the other functionality supports that, it doesn&apos;t drown it.&quot; The allure of indie The two executives are aligned in their apparent keenness to broaden the range of games available on current platforms. For Sony, that has always meant embracing indie development, something it has done since releasing the Net Yaroze hobbyist dev kit back in 1997.  &quot;It came very organically and from the ground up,&quot; says House. &quot;There were individuals in both the Europe and US offices who were passionate gamers and really interested in the indie scene, and fortunately they were well placed to engineer that outreach.  &quot;For me, I was starting to get worried that the industry was trending towards a concentration around fewer and fewer major franchises; you&apos;ve got to worry about the long-term health of the business if there isn&apos;t new talent, new creativity and new IP coming in. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love the big blockbusters, but it&apos;s great for the health of the business to have the quirky, the new, the different, and to have experimentation in narrative and technical design. Our goal as a platform holder is to be in the business of A&amp;R, of talent development and nurturing. We have to bring these guys in and say we can connect you with an audience. No Man&apos;s Sky is a great testament to that. Seeing the feedback it is garnering, it&apos;s been universally positive. That team is six people.&quot;       Phil Spencer has clearly been using his own tastes and contacts to broaden the Xbox One output. He talks about going to dinner with Platinum Games during last year&apos;s Tokyo Game Show to secure the studio&apos;s first Xbox exclusive, Scalebound (&quot;it turns out that our team working with them on the game is just around the corner from me - they get tired of me turning up&quot;). He also mentions indie titles like Ori and the Blind Forest as a priority in his plans.  &quot;Brothers was my game of the year last year - the ending was so emotional,&quot; he says. &quot;Those are the kinds of thoughts we need to embed in terms of how we&apos;re building for this platform. I want to have a great line-up, I want to make the tools that allow developers to build on Xbox, to enable the breadth of content.&quot;        During the Xbox press event, Microsoft shows a trailer of Inside, the latest game from Playdead, the team behind cult monochrome platformer, Limbo. &quot;That is one of my favourite games of all time,&quot; says Spencer, who wore a T-shirt bearing its name on stage. &quot;Last time I was at Playdead I got to play Inside and talked to the guys about it. I thought, I really want this on Xbox One. It&apos;s so interesting.&quot; Social engineering As for the future, both men agree that the social element will play a major role, with games evolving away from transient anonymous online matches. &quot;Multiplayer co-op feels like it&apos;s going to be important,&quot; says Spencer. &quot;Sunset Overdrive, Assassin&apos;s Creed Unity, Fable Legends - these are games that friends will play together. And Dave Jones is talking about what he wants to do with Crackdown, bringing people together via co-op but using the compute CPU capability in Xbox Live to make it a different kind of experience. The physics and destruction calculations around buildings and other objects will happen in the cloud, freeing up the local capabilities to do something that looks better.  &quot;Our investment in Live and in servers will continue. You&apos;ll see more teams making use of that cloud capability to handle AI and dedicated servers for matchmaking. And multiple years later, when those games sunset, and gamers move on, we&apos;re handling the whole backend for those developers. If you&apos;re a small studio and you don&apos;t know how many servers you&apos;ll need or how long you&apos;ll need them, our service gives them the capability to build a server-based game without having to invest in all the infrastucture.&quot;       House talks about how, during the development of the PlayStation hardware, there was a moment where he had to decide whether or not to hardwire in the console&apos;s sharing capabilities; ensuring that the machine automatically records footage, adding the &apos;share&apos; button on the controller which uploads highlights to the web. It was a risk. &quot;I said to the engineers, &apos;I only have one question for you guys, there&apos;s a lot around the community, what if we throw the party and no one shows up?&apos;  &quot;But we made the right call, tapping into this idea that gaming could become more social, that people would want to share their experience. I don&apos;t think we envisaged that Playroom would be used by people to broadcast themselves from their living rooms, but if that&apos;s what people want to do fine, so be it \u2013 we jumped on it. So there are now visual tools to help you do that. There&apos;s a sense of a vibrant community around the games and that&apos;s helped PS4 enormously.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m particularly intrigued by what will happen with the games share functionality [of PlayStation Now]: for the first time ever you can be playing a game and lend it to someone else effectively, have them play with you - that creates this whole new social dynamic.&quot; After 10 minutes with House, a PR rep sitting at the far end of the suite&apos;s vast conference table tells me I have one more question. I&apos;ll be shot by my readers if I don&apos;t ask this, I say \u2013 but what is happening with Last Guardian? The long-awaited and much-delayed title from Team Ico, the studio behind classics Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, has become something of a metaphor for the unfulfilled and unfulfillable promises bandied around at this event. The news site IGN has just posted a rumour that the game has been quietly cancelled.  &quot;It is not cancelled,&quot; says House, slowly and deliberately. So what&apos;s happening with it? There is a long pause. I sense that the PR manager at the end of the table has momentarily stopped tapping at his keyboard. These interviews are carefully stage-managed and controlled \u2013 sometimes you get more from them if you are belligerent and insistent, but that&apos;s rarely the case. Sometimes you have to play the game. Spencer and House are both good players; you get what they want and no more. But then, they too are under the control of a business which insists on the micro-management of information. Games are multimillion dollar bets these days, and no one wants to show their cards.  &quot;I&apos;ll just say \u2026 active work is ongoing,&quot; House says at last. &quot;I&apos;ll get shot by my studios if I say any more.&quot; \u2022 E3 2014: Sony hits with Uncharted 4, GTA 5 and Grim Fandango \u2022 Microsoft at E3 2014: from Halo 5 to the return of Crackdown - the key points"}, {"sentences": ["If the journeys home from Rio to Tokyo, Tehran, Seoul and Sydney take a long time, then the next four years are going to feel like an eternity as only then will Asian football get a chance to restore its standing before the world.", "Most Asian teams arrive in Tokyo happy to defend.", "The Tokyo model of development is spreading around a continent slowly realising that hiring expensive foreign coaches means little if nothing is spent on youth development."], "tags": ["World Cup 2014", "Japan", "Iran", "South Korea", "Australia", "World Cup", "Sport", "Football"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-28T11:01:18Z", "title": "Japan and South Korea head list of Asian World Cup failures", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/28/japan-south-korea-australia-iran-world-cup-failures", "article": "If the journeys home from Rio to Tokyo, Tehran, Seoul and Sydney take a long time, then the next four years are going to feel like an eternity as only then will Asian football get a chance to restore its standing before the world. The reputation of the football scene in the Asian Football Federation, never high, has taken a Brazilian battering. Spare a thought for the organisers of the 2015 Asian Cup, who have to sell the January tournament to an already sceptical Australian public. All four representatives finished bottom of their groups with a combined tally of just three points. It is not like there are teams sitting at home that could be confident of doing a better job. This quartet is the best that the region has to offer. Australia and Iran will not be too downcast. The Socceroos are in transition and acquitted themselves fairly well in the toughest of groups. There were no expectations. Iran too, were satisfied with the draw against Nigeria, proud and crushed after pushing Argentina all the way and happy just to be still in the running before the final game against Bosnia-Hercegovina. If there is a regret, it is that Team Melli could have done more against the Balkan side, but overall, it was a step up from 2006. Japan and South Korea were major disappointments, especially the former. No qualifier had such preparation. Four years ago, Alberto Zaccheroni took over a young team that almost reached the last eight in South Africa. Months later they won the Asian Cup and the Italian was able to spend the next three years fine-tuning, travelling the world playing high-profile friendlies, the Confederation Cup, the East Asian Cup and encouraging his players to move to Europe. His shade of Samurai Blue became easier on the eye and the slick passing game won admirers all over the world. It was rarely seen in Brazil. Passive against Ivory Coast, predictable and slow against Greece and wasteful against Colombia \u2013 the pass-and-move groove honed over the past years was jettisoned. A lack of flexibility was a feature of both Korean and Japanese campaigns. Both teams struggled to adapt when things were not going their way. Japan win when they play well but struggle to dig in and play smart when they do not, lacking the confidence to impose their style. Hiring an expensive and experienced Italian coach did not seem to make much difference. Neither Zaccheroni nor his Korean counterpart Hong Myung-bo could do much about the absence of an international-class No9. They have lacked a genuine goalscorer for some time \u2013 though Korea\u2019s struggles when looking for top-class goalkeepers, full-backs and holding midfielders are more recent. Coaches in Japan talk of youngsters wanting to become creative midfielders and in Korea, it is speedy wingers. In the absence of striking role models, it is easy to see why. Korea\u2019s preparations did not match Japan\u2019s for smoothness. The Group H opener with Russia was Hong\u2019s first ever senior competitive game as a coach. That he was unable to solve longstanding defensive problems and a lack of cutting edge was perhaps not a surprise. That a quick Korean team often looked anything but, was. This was a young side, against Belgium the oldest player on the pitch was 27, and there was a clear lack of experience and leadership. No wonder that, in March, Hong tried to persuade Park Ji-sung to come out of international retirement. There were also big-name players who failed to perform. Japan\u2019s Keisuke Honda peaked after 16 minutes of the opening game and it was downhill after that. Shinji Kagawa was worse and his talk of losing the mental battle after the Ivory Coast defeat was revealing and worrying. South Korea\u2019s main striker Park Chu-young was as anonymous for country as he has been for Arsenal. All three had issues with club form heading into the tournament but others did not. Shinji Okazaki arrived in Brazil red-hot after 15 goals in the Bundesliga but did little while Lee Chung-yong, Korea\u2019s best player for the past two years or so, struggled as did Koo Ja-cheol, captain and star of the 2012 Olympic campaign. The defeats to African teams did the most damage, making it too easy for some to resurrect the old physical argument. In truth, many Asian league games are no place for the faint-hearted, the Korean squad was supposedly the fifth tallest in the tournament and both have plenty of players with experience of Europe. Still, both Japan and South Korea struggled to deal with powerful players with aggressive and attacking intent. With cracks in a brittle Japanese defence already showing in the second half against Ivory Coast, the east Asians seemed to fall apart mentally just at the sight of Didier Drogba preparing to come on. Algeria simply swept Korea aside in the first half. These are the long-term lessons. For the best in Asia to improve, the rest of Asia must do the same. Most Asian teams arrive in Tokyo happy to defend. Looking elsewhere for games is a natural response and Zaccheroni was rightly proud that he sought out friendlies against football\u2019s leading nations \u2013 beating France and Belgium away and Argentina at home. Turns out though, that real games are different. Already Japan have realised the value of greater competition and you can\u2019t throw a durian in South-east Asia without hitting Japanese coaches spreading their know-how, Japanese teams looking for players and partnerships or Japanese administrators running local federations. The Tokyo model of development is spreading around a continent slowly realising that hiring expensive foreign coaches means little if nothing is spent on youth development. It will take time and won\u2019t be easy. Asia is so big and diverse that standards vary to a huge degree. Interference of politics is a familiar story all over the continent. Indonesia is a perfect example, A country of 250 million, where the size of potential is matched by the passion for the game, has major problems stemming directly from how the game is run. Fifa allowing the federation chief to continue his job from inside a prison cell was not the organisation\u2019s finest hour."}, {"sentences": ["Until its scheduled release last month, Warner Brothers was uncertain whether censors at China&apos;s state administration of press, publication, radio, film and television would permit the release of Godzilla, given its heavy association with Japan and the tension between Beijing and Tokyo over maritime territories."], "tags": ["Film industry", "Film", "World news", "Godzilla", "Angelina Jolie", "Brad Pitt", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Censorship", "Tom Cruise", "Nicole Kidman", "Grace of Monaco", "Maleficent", "X-Men: Days of Future Past", "Transformers: Age of Extinction"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-28T14:58:03Z", "title": "Hollywood tears through China's cinemas, stirring censorship fears", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/28/hollywood-china-box-office-godzilla", "article": "Hollywood enjoyed a decisive victory in its campaign to conquer China last week when US-made films \u2013 Godzilla, Angelina Jolie&apos;s Maleficent, Tom Cruise&apos;s Edge of Tomorrow, X-Men: Days of Future Past and Grace of Monaco \u2013 took the five top box-office slots in the country. The movie business is treating the clean sweep as a sign that its strategy for balancing the entertainment requirements of the world&apos;s two largest markets is paying off. Hollywood is devoting resources and star power to breaking open the tightly controlled region. Earlier this month, Jolie, Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Mark Wahlberg and Johnny Depp all went to China to support releases that could add up to a quarter of takings. Seducing the Chinese market can be as simple as adding Chinese locations, such as in the recent James Bond film Skyfall. In X-Men: Days of Future Past, half an hour of action takes place in Hong Kong, with Chinese star Li Bingbing and a Chinese boyband added to the superhero mix. With relations between Washington and Beijing tense, Hollywood&apos;s wooing of China can be similarly fraught. Two years ago, Quentin Tarantino&apos;s Django Unchained was yanked from cinemas after censors claimed it showed scenes too violent for Chinese audiences. Until its scheduled release last month, Warner Brothers was uncertain whether censors at China&apos;s state administration of press, publication, radio, film and television would permit the release of Godzilla, given its heavy association with Japan and the tension between Beijing and Tokyo over maritime territories. Disney was concerned that Jolie&apos;s recent comments on the political sovereignty of &quot;self-ruled Taiwan&quot; might keep mainland Chinese viewers away. But Maleficent still took a respectable $22m at the Chinese box office after Jolie, husband Brad Pitt and several of their children shared a birthday cake with a crowd in Shanghai and took lessons in making dim sum. Hollywood&apos;s current success will partially settle fears that it was losing ground to domestic Chinese releases. US film studios are counting on increased foreign sales to offset a decline in American cinema visits and the virtual collapse of the DVD market. The Chinese market was worth $3.6bn in ticket sales last year \u2013 more than enough to warrant substantial plot changes to appeal to Chinese filmgoers. US film executives are urgently looking to make deals in China. Last week Jeff Robinov, a former Warner Bros president known for approving the Matrix series, The Lego Movie and Gravity, signed a $1bn deal with Chinese investment giant Fosun to make films in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Some executives say the deal could help film-makers get around Chinese rules that limit the number of foreign-made releases in the country to 34 a year. But with Chinese films&apos; box-office share down 12% in the past year to 40%, there may be renewed efforts to counter the US invasion. Critics warn that Hollywood&apos;s closer ties with Beijing could mean that film-makers are less willing to touch on sensitive topics such as the Dalai Lama, the Falun Gong sect, and the Chinese market for rhinoceros horn, ivory and other items from critically endangered species. How much western culture Chinese audiences are willing to consume \u2013 and how much censors allow \u2013 is open to question. Disney recently announced an $800m deal with a Chinese consortium of state-owned companies to boost investment in Shanghai Disneyland, increasing the number of rides when it opens next year. The resort, one of the largest ever foreign investments in China, includes a 225-acre Magic Kingdom-style park with a castle surrounded by themed areas, with guests entering through a lush 11-acre garden. But Chinese entrepreneurs are preparing to gamble on the Chinese ultimately choosing homegrown fare. China&apos;s wealthiest man, Wang Jianlin, owner of the AMC cinema chain in the US and Imax theatres in China, is reportedly planning theme parks across China celebrating its history and mythology. &quot;Wang wants to save China from American cultural invasion and Disney,&quot; said one executive familiar with the plan. &quot;So he&apos;s going to make it better than Disney, with Chinese dragons, Shaolin warrior monks, the lot.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["FailCon, a conference about \u201cembracing failure\u201d, launched in San Francisco in 2009 and is now an annual event, with technology hubs in Barcelona, Tokyo, Porto Alegre and elsewhere hosting their own versions."], "tags": ["Silicon Valley", "Technology startups", "Technology", "Internet", "US economy", "Business", "US news", "World news", "Entrepreneurs", "Technology sector"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-28T17:00:00Z", "title": "Silicon Valley's culture of failure \u2026 and 'the walking dead' it leaves behind", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/28/silicon-valley-startup-failure-culture-success-myth", "article": "It is probably Silicon Valley&apos;s most striking mantra: \u201cFail fast, fail often.\u201d It is recited at technology conferences, pinned to company walls, bandied in conversation. Failure is not only invoked but celebrated. Entrepreneurs give speeches detailing their misfires. Academics laud the virtue of making mistakes. FailCon, a conference about \u201cembracing failure\u201d, launched in San Francisco in 2009 and is now an annual event, with technology hubs in Barcelona, Tokyo, Porto Alegre and elsewhere hosting their own versions. While the rest of the world recoils at failure, in other words, technology&apos;s dynamic innovators enshrine it as a rite of passage en route to success. But what about those tech entrepreneurs who lose \u2013 and keep on losing? What about those who start one company after another, refine pitches, tweak products, pivot strategies, reinvent themselves \u2026 and never succeed? What about the angst masked behind upbeat facades? Silicon Valley is increasingly asking such questions, even as the tech boom rewards some startups with billion-dollar valuations, sprinkling stardust on founders who talk of changing the world. \u201cIt&apos;s frustrating if you&apos;re trying and trying and all you read about is how much money Airbnb and Uber are making,\u201d said Johnny Chin, 28, who endured three startup flops but is hopeful for his fourth attempt. \u201cThe way startups are portrayed, everything seems an overnight success, but that&apos;s a disconnect from reality. There can be a psychic toll.\u201d It has never been easier or cheaper to launch a company in the hothouse of ambition, money and software that stretches from San Francisco to Cupertino, Mountain View, Menlo Park and San Jose. In 2012 the number of seed investment deals in US tech reportedly more than tripled, to 1,700, from three years earlier. Investment bankers are quitting Wall Street for Silicon Valley, lured by hopes of a cooler and more creative way to get rich. Most startups fail. However many entrepreneurs still overestimate the chances of success \u2013 and the cost of failure. Some estimates put the failure rate at 90% \u2013 on a par with small businesses in other sectors. A similar proportion of alumni from Y Combinator, a legendary incubator which mentors bright prospects, are said to also struggle.     Airbnb 'started as two guys with an air-bed' and is now a global rival to hotel chains valued at $10bn. Photograph: Ole Spata/Corbis    Companies typically die around 20 months after their last financing round and after having raised $1.3m, according to a study by the analytics firms CB Insights titled The RIP Report \u2013 startup death trends. Failure is difficult to quantify because it does not necessarily mean liquidation. Many startups limp on for years, ignored by the market but sustained by founders&apos; savings or investors. \u201cWe call them the walking dead,\u201d said one manager at a tech behemoth, who requested anonymity. \u201cThey don&apos;t necessarily die. They putter along.\u201d Software engineers employed by such zombies face a choice. Stay in hope the company will take off, turning stock options into gold. Or quit and take one of the plentiful jobs at other startups or giants like Apple and Google. Founders face a more agonising dilemma. Continue working 100-hour weeks and telling employees and investors their dream is alive, that the metrics are improving, and hope it&apos;s true, or pull the plug. The loss aversion principle \u2013 the human tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains \u2013 tilts many towards the former, said Bruno Bowden, a former engineering manager at Google who is now a venture investor and entrepreneur. &quot;People will do a lot of irrational things to avoid losing even if it&apos;s to their detriment. You push and push and exhaust yourself.&quot; Silicon Valley wannabes tell origin fables of startup founders who maxed out credit cards before dazzling Wall Street, the same way Hollywood&apos;s struggling actors find solace in the fact Brad Pitt dressed as a chicken for El Pollo Loco before his breakthrough. \u201cIt&apos;s painful to be one of the walking dead. You lie to yourself and mask what&apos;s not working. You amplify little wins,\u201d said Chin, who eventually abandoned startups which offered micro, specialised versions of Amazon and Yelp.

But then they go home and don&apos;t use your product.\u201d Chin is bullish about his new company, Bannerman, an Uber-type service for event security and bodyguards, and has no regrets about rolling the tech dice. \u201cI love what I do. I couldn&apos;t do anything else.\u201d     The comedy Silicon Valley lampoons the culture of tech entrepreneurs and also highlights their attendant failures. Photograph: HBO    Venture capitalists and angel investors tolerate failure only up to a point, said Bowden. &quot;You won&apos;t get funding unless you&apos;re credible. One previous failure can be OK but multiple failures will make it impossible to get funding.&quot; Shikhar Ghosh, a lecturer at Harvard who has studied startup mortality, noted that \u201cVCs bury their dead very quietly.\u201d Many founders are confessing anxiety in public for the first time via anonymous gossip sites like Secret and startupsanonymous.com. \u201cMy biggest mistake was trying to be an entrepreneur when I should have continued on with my current job,\u201d confided one. \u201cI\u2019ve got this month to pull something off, otherwise I\u2019m screwed and looking for a job. I\u2019m scared as hell that I can\u2019t do it,\u201d wrote another. Common threads are fear of failure and the stress of pretending everything is going well. \u201cThe time you send your monthly investor update and spend an hour trying to come up with positive shit to say,\u201d wrote another. Failure post-mortems by founders and investors \u2013 the tone ranging from philosophical to despairing \u2013 have proved a hit on the CB Insights blog. A Wired cover story about one startup&apos;s travails, titled No Exit, also set tongues wagging. Tragedy struck last year when Jody Sherman, a 47-year-old serial entrepreneur, shot himself. A tattoo on his wrist said \u201cI am awesome\u201d but it emerged he had agonised over raising fresh funding for a startup, Ecomom, which he knew was floundering.  Some startups raise the white flag under cover of \u201caqui-hire\u201d in which they are bought by established firms, allowing founders a graceful exit, but often it is a fig leaf to poach staff, especially programmers and designers. Even if startups survive the stress can drain you, Justin Yoshimura, 24, a high-school dropout who founded three companies, most recently 500friends, an online retail loyalty platform, told the General Assembly, a business and technology speaker series.  \u201cI&apos;m not burned out but I don&apos;t want to be a founder or CEO anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt&apos;s like running marathons back to back.\u201d Such cautionary tales, and fears of a bubble, are not denting exuberance. Silicon Valley remains in thrall to the success stories, none more so than Airbnb, which started as two guys with an air-bed and is now a global rival to hotel chains valued at $10bn. \u201cYou need stars that inspire massive numbers of people to pursue their dreams,\u201d said co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk, 30, seated on a sofa in the company&apos;s gleaming new headquarters. Failure really does pave the way to success, he said. \u201cI started coding when I was 12. A lot of things I did didn&apos;t pay off but it all went into my toolbelt. It takes a massive number of attempts to be successful.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Christian Dimmer, an assistant professor in the urban studies department at Tokyo University, shares Abe&apos;s concerns, but believes many residents were left with little choice when offered premium rates for their land by the government."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Tsunamis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Japan disaster", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-29T17:21:39Z", "title": "Tsunami-proof 'Great Wall of Japan' divides villagers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/29/tsunami-wall-japan-divides-villagers", "article": "When Masahito Abe looks out at the sea that killed 40 of his neighbours just over three years ago, he is certain of one thing: at some point, perhaps long after he is gone, the ocean will again unleash a terrifying wave on his village. Like dozens of other communities along the north-east coast of Japan struck by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, Koizumi is now a wasteland. Grass and weeds grow where homes once stood. On the beach, a man digs for shellfish near the remains of a solitary gutted building. No one will return to live in the low-lying neighbourhood of Koizumi in Miyagi prefecture, home to 60% of the 19,000 people who died in the disaster. But if the government gets its way, this abandoned strip of land will be made tsunami-proof as part of a \u00a35bn plan to defend 230 miles of coastline with hundreds of towering concrete walls. The scale of the project, referred to by detractors as the Great Wall of Japan, is staggering even by the standards of a country where much of the coastline is already protected against storms and erosion by concrete walls. Under government plans, hatched months after the disaster, 440 walls are to be built in the worst-hit prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate. But while Japan&apos;s construction industry relishes the prospect of a huge payday courtesy of its allies in the governing Liberal Democratic party, opposition among residents is gathering momentum. &quot;We want the government to change the shape of the coast, and redesign it so a tsunami would have minimal impact, not just build a lot of walls,&quot; said Abe, a primary school teacher in Koizumi who moved his family to a hilltop 20 years ago in anticipation of a deadly tsunami.     Masahito Abe points to the proposed site of a sea wall in the tsunami-hit village of Koizumi, north-east Japan. Photograph: Justin McCurry for the Guardian    Debate over the sea wall has proved so divisive among the village&apos;s 1,800 residents \u2013 now spread out among eight temporary housing complexes \u2013 that some fear it will derail attempts to revive the village three years after the disaster wiped it from the map. &quot;I don&apos;t want the sea wall issue to divide people here,&quot; said Yoshitaka Oikawa, a local assembly member. &quot;I can see the debate is already weakening their determination to rebuild their village together.&quot; By the end of the year, Koizumi&apos;s displaced will have moved into homes being built in an area carved into a mountaintop two miles from the coast. The 14.7-metre (48ft) wall below will do little more than protect rice paddies, at a cost of $230m. &quot;It&apos;s madness,&quot; said Abe, who wants the area to be an eco park. Yet many of his former neighbours appear content to leave tsunami defences in the hands of the authorities. &quot;The attitude seems to be that if the walls have already been planned and budgeted for, why interfere?&quot; Abe said. Christian Dimmer, an assistant professor in the urban studies department at Tokyo University, shares Abe&apos;s concerns, but believes many residents were left with little choice when offered premium rates for their land by the government. &quot;In Koizumi there are people who are happy to sell their land for seawall construction,&quot; he said. &quot;[They thought] they couldn&apos;t do anything else with their land and needed the money to rebuild their lives elsewhere.&quot; Those campaigning against the wall have few allies. Yoshihiro Murai, the governor of Miyagi, is in favour, while the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, told a recent residents&apos; forum that walls offered the best protection against a tsunami. His wife, Akie, has cautiously allied herself with the sceptics, warning of the damage so much concrete could do to ecosystems and tourism. The 3,000 people of Fudai village owe their lives to a 15-metre wall that was dismissed as a waste of money when it was built, at the then mayor&apos;s insistence, in the 1980s. But it was the exception. Most sea walls provided inadequate protection against the March 2011 tsunami. In Kamaishi, the waves simply smashed through the city&apos;s sea wall, then the largest in the world. Concrete barriers offered little or no resistance, and may even have caused deaths among people lulled into thinking they were safe. &quot;Sea walls have the potential to save lives wherever they are built, provided the tsunami does not exceed the simulated height and runup pressures,&quot; said Dimmer. &quot;The problem is that you can&apos;t predict how high the next tsunami will be, so sea walls can never give you 100% security. There will always be a risk, no matter how high you build them.&quot; Campaigners estimate that it will take Japan&apos;s taxpayers a quarter of a century to pay the bill for sea wall construction, which could eventually cover 9,000 miles of the country&apos;s coastline. But the debate is about more than cost. Until each locality decides whether to proceed with the plan, no construction can begin on sites considered vulnerable to tsunamis. &quot;I don&apos;t want the rest of the world to think of Japan as a concrete fortress,&quot; said Abe. &quot;The tsunami was a force of nature, so I can forgive it for the destruction and misery it caused. But for humans to ruin their own environment \u2026 I can never forgive that.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The results were released a day after a man set himself alight in central Tokyo, apparently in protest at the policy."], "tags": ["Japan", "Shinzo Abe", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-30T07:26:03Z", "title": "Japan PM to overturn pacifist defence policy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/30/japan-pm-overturn-pacifist-defence-policy-shinzo-abe", "article": "Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is to defy public opinion and announce a dramatic shift in the country&apos;s defence policy that would make it easier for its troops to fight in overseas conflicts. Abe&apos;s cabinet is expected to adopt a resolution on Tuesday that would end Japan&apos;s long-standing ban on exercising collective self-defence, or coming to the aid of an ally under attack even if Japan itself is not threatened. Japan&apos;s postwar constitution prohibits the use of force to settle international disputes \u2013 a restriction Abe and his supporters say inhibits the country&apos;s ability to protect itself and its allies, despite growing fears over North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme and China&apos;s aggressive territorial claims in the region. Abe&apos;s decision to introduce legislation that would reinterpret the pacifist clause in the constitution, which has prevented Japanese forces from fighting overseas since the end of the second world war, came after opinion polls indicated he would struggle to win enough support in parliament and among voters for outright constitutional reform. The change to be approved on Tuesday would require a simple majority in both houses; his ruling Liberal Democratic party [LDP] has a comfortable majority in the lower house and controls the upper house with the support of a junior coalition partner. Changing the wording of the constitution, however, would require a two-thirds majority in both houses and a simple majority in a nationwide referendum. In a poll published on Monday the Nikkei business newspaper found that 50% of voters were against overturning the ban on collective self-defence, while 34% supported the change. The results were released a day after a man set himself alight in central Tokyo, apparently in protest at the policy. The unidentified man, who remains in a serious condition in hospital, had criticised Abe&apos;s proposals before attempting to kill himself in front of horrified onlookers. The governing LDP has reportedly secured the support of its junior coalition partner, New Komeito, whose traditionally pacifist leanings had initially made a deal look impossible. Buddhist-backed New Komeito appears to have shifted its stance amid warnings from Abe that resistance could jeopardise the coalition. Critics have accused the government of abusing its parliamentary majority to railroad a reinterpretation of the constitution through parliament after Abe abandoned the far more difficult, and time-consuming, option of outright constitutional revision. &quot;To develop legislation aimed at protecting the lives of citizens will lead to an increase in Japan&apos;s deterrent capabilities and reduce the possibility of being dragged into a war,&quot; Abe said last week. &quot;It is necessary to appropriately interpret the constitution. A decision on a constitutional revision should be made as the public debate deepens. I hope to see a national debate on the matter.&quot; Supporters of the current constitution plan to demonstrate outside Abe&apos;s official residence on Monday evening. The left-of-centre Asahi Shimbun accused Abe of abandoning Japan&apos;s postwar pacifism after minimal public debate. &quot;This policy initiative, if it is pushed through, will leave the pacifist principles of the constitution totally eviscerated and the nation&apos;s public opinion bitterly divided,&quot; the paper said. &quot;It will also leave the Japanese voting public even more distrustful of politicians.&quot; Any measure that loosens the legal shackles on Japan&apos;s well-equipped self-defence forces is certain to anger China, with which Japan is embroiled in a dispute over the sovereignty of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea. The US, however, has been putting pressure on Japan to play a more active role in their bilateral security arrangements, while the Philippines, which is involved in its own territorial dispute with Beijing, has also voiced support for the move. Reinterpreting the war-renouncing article 9 of the constitution will give Japan&apos;s military significantly more leeway in coming to the aid of an ally \u2013 most likely the US \u2013 that has come under attack, even if the conflict is far from Japan&apos;s shores. The change will also relax restrictions on Japan&apos;s participation in UN peacekeeping operations, currently restricted to non-combat roles, and in so-called &quot;grey zone&quot; conflicts that have not developed into full-scale war, according to a draft of the proposal released to the media last week. Government officials denied the policy change would give future leaders carte blanche to send Japan&apos;s military into reckless overseas wars. Japan would exercise the right to collective self-defence only when &quot;clear dangers&quot; exist to the lives of people in countries &quot;with close ties&quot; to Japan, according to the most recent publicly available draft. Military intervention should be &quot;limited to the minimum amount necessary&quot;, it added. The draft goes on to say that Japan will &quot;ensure that its history as a pacifist state will continue&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["It is, however, very good: an RPG based in modern-day Tokyo, with impressive graphics and lots to explore."], "tags": ["Android", "Apps", "Smartphones", "Tablet computers", "Mobile phones", "Games", "Technology", "Media", "The Walking Dead", "Google", "Software", "Yahoo", "Monty Python", "Kim Kardashian West"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-30T14:36:35Z", "title": "20 best Android apps and games this week", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/30/best-android-apps-games-slides-walking-dead", "article": "It&apos;s time for our weekly roundup of the best new Android apps and games to have emerged on the Google Play store.

Browse previous Best Android Apps roundups on The Guardian. And if you&apos;re looking for iOS apps, browse the archives of Best iPhone and iPad apps roundups instead. APPS Google Slides (Free)Unveiled at Google&apos;s I/O developer conference last week, Slides is the official app for Google&apos;s PowerPoint-esque presentations software. You can create and edit presentations, working across the app and website, as well as accessing PowerPoint files and inviting colleagues to collaborate on individual presentations. Osper (Free)Osper is an interesting idea making its debut in the UK: a &quot;money management system&quot; for young people \u2013 i.e. under-18s. It&apos;s essentially a prepay debit card, funded by parents, with the app used by both children and parents to keep tabs on balances and transactions. Although a fair few teenagers may balk at the idea of their parents seeing an itemisation of their spending... Udacity - Learn Programming (Free)Udacity is one of the online learning startups getting a lot of buzz in the US and elsewhere, with this its first Android app. The focus is on learning programming skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and other languages, with a host of classes to then push on: from applied cryptography through to robotics AI. Yahoo Aviate Launcher (Free)Available in beta for a while, Aviate is now out and proud in the Google Play store, as the latest &quot;launcher&quot; app trying to smarten up Android users&apos; homescreens. The twist here is that it claims to &quot;adapt&quot; to your daily behaviour, trying to show you the most relevant apps to your time and activity for faster access. The proof will come a few months down the line when it&apos;s adapted to you well (or not) but early adopters seem impressed. Cardboard (Free)By far the quirkiest thing announced at Google I/O, this app goes with a make-your-own cardboard pair of virtual reality Goggles, into which you slot your Android device. If you&apos;ve got or made a pair, this app offers some demos of how Google services can work with them, from YouTube to Google Earth. Nudge (Free)Nudge is the latest health-tracking app, although in this case, it aggregates data from others \u2013 from Fitbit gadgets to the Moves and RunKeeper apps. Its aim: to give you an overall &quot;health score&quot; while comparing your quantified self to friends. Well, friends who are also on Nudge, anyway. Panic Button (Free)Hopefully, most people reading this article won&apos;t ever find themselves in a position dangerous enough to require this app. It&apos;s from Amnesty International, mainly for its activists as well as journalists around the world who might suddenly be in danger and need to let friends or colleagues know. The app sends location updates to the user&apos;s chosen contacts, hiding itself as best as possible so an attacker can&apos;t disable it. AlertsPro (\u00a31.43 + IAP)More alerts, but these are of the meteorological kind. This app aims to keep you posted on severe weather coming your way, from blizzards to monster thunderstorms. The app promises up to 48 hours advance notice, with a simple system of colour-grading to indicate severity. SpeakingPhoto (Free)SpeakingPhoto does what it says on the tin: you take a photo, then record a voice note to go with it, and then share to various social networks with up to eight pics and notes at a time. There&apos;s also a global gallery so you can see what other people have been spotting and sharing. YouTube Creator Studio (Free)Finally, another app with a very specific audience: people who run channels on YouTube. It&apos;s a simple, useful app for keeping an eye on your stats, answering comments from viewers, and managing other aspects of your channel. An essential tool for YouTubers.     The Walking Dead: Season Two for Android.    GAMES The Walking Dead: Season Two (Free + IAP)I can&apos;t speak highly enough of Telltale Games&apos; work with The Walking Dead on mobile: it&apos;s made gripping, atmospheric classics. This is the second &quot;season&quot; \u2013 it uses TV lingo \u2013 of the zombie games, with one episode available for free, another two available as in-app purchases, and two more coming later in the year. A rare zombie game where character and plot development are as important as gory action. Wartune: Hall of Heroes (Free + IAP)I was once given a demo of Wartune at a press event held by publisher Kabam, by someone who&apos;d unlocked pretty much everything in this massively-multiplayer game that blends battles with city-building. It looked mind-bogglingly baffling, but playing from the start opens up its features at a manageable pace. It&apos;s still hardcore, but looks worth the investment in time (and, yes, in in-app purchases should you so desire). Eliss Infinity (\u00a31.76)Eliss is brilliant: a puzzle game that&apos;s perfect for modern multi-touch devices, as you fuse and split planets to match them. Eliss Infinity is its first appearance on Android, complete with a new &quot;endless&quot; mode, a revamped version of the iOS-only original, and more polish. An excellent introduction to one of the best mobile time-killers. Spy vs Spy (\u00a31.99 + IAP)As someone who wasted countless hours on the Commodore 64 version of Spy vs Spy back in the 1980s, I&apos;m quite excited about its revival for modern smartphones and tablets. If you&apos;re new to it, the game focuses on a trap-laden battle between two enemy spies, sneaking around embassies trying to off one another. In-app purchases may raise an eyebrow, but the core game remains great fun. Kim Kardashian: Hollywood (Free + IAP)Once upon a time, Paris Hilton had her own mobile game: she even turned up to the E3 games industry show to promote it (while, er, forgetting its name). Several years later, Kim Kardashian is getting in on the act, with a fashion-themed freemium game that gets you wandering around LA trying to become a celebrity \u2013 occasionally running into Kim herself. Actually pretty fun, regardless of whether you&apos;re a fan or not. Wave Wave (\u00a31.09)There&apos;s a demand out there for viciously-difficult &quot;twitch&quot; arcade games \u2013 Super Hexagon being one of the prime examples. Wave Wave fits into this trend, and doesn&apos;t suffer in the comparison with Super Hexagon. It sees you guiding a line through a frequently-rotating maze by tap-holding on the screen: Tron meets Flappy Bird, but not for the faint of heart. Monsters Ate My Birthday Cake (\u00a31.76)This game&apos;s by Cartoon Network: the latest in a burst of mobile gaming from the TV channel. It&apos;s a puzzle game populated by colourful monsters, each with their own special powers to help you navigate through levels \u2013 pushing lots of blocks as you go. It&apos;s very addictive. The Rhythm of Fighters (\u00a30.69 + IAP)Here&apos;s a genre to conjure with: &quot;Fighting x Music&quot;. This game comes from SNK Playmore, working in elements of its famed beat &apos;em up series The King of Fighters, with rhythm-based musical gameplay as you tap in time to tunes to make your character fight. The World Ends With You (\u00a312.99)Yep, \u00a312.99. Publisher Square Enix isn&apos;t one to undervalue its classic games on mobile devices, so roleplaying game The World Ends With You \u2013 originally released for Nintendo&apos;s SD in 2007-8 \u2013 isn&apos;t cheap. It is, however, very good: an RPG based in modern-day Tokyo, with impressive graphics and lots to explore. The Ministry of Silly Walks (\u00a30.99)And now for something completely diff... Well, you see where I&apos;m heading. This is the first official Monty Python game for Android: an endless runner where the running is silly walking based on one of the comedy troupe&apos;s most famous sketches. John Cleese provides voice acting, while the rag-doll physics are good for a few laughs. Those are our picks, but what have you been enjoying on Android this week?

As Cat People vacated shops, another Melbourne publisher was putting the finishing touches to Four&amp;Sons, also a new and stylish, independent magazine \u2014 but dedicated to dogs. You\u2019re entitled to an eye roll. Maybe you&apos;re thinking: dogs wearing flat caps, cats wearing cardigans, dogs listening to the National, cats knitting decorative replica cats out of organic kale. Adorably stupid kittens in strategic Buzzfeed lists: \u201cLook at me yawn, then burn fat with this one weird trick.\u201d But Cat People\u2019s Gavin Green didn\u2019t want anything like that. \u201cIt was a big point right from the start not to do cats in an internet way, because that\u2019s been done. We faced a bit of backlash from people who assumed that\u2019s what it was, but the magazine is just as much about cats as it as about humans. It\u2019s using cats to explore the lives and artistic practices of different people,\u201d says Green. Green, a photographer, along with the magazine&apos;s co-creator Jessica Lowe, who is an art director by trade, had thought about a collaboration for some time. \u201cIt was always going to be visually led. We were influenced by a lot of Japanese art books. They have this way of combining niche editorial with high production. The idea was to make something that an international audience can relate to.\u201d The result is a handsome publication set in rich tones on thick, unfinished paper, with insets on different stocks tailored to individual artists. The Tokyo photographic pioneer Takashi Homma sits alongside the Melbourne collage artist Lucy James. Articles with cat people are presented in English and Japanese, with shoots and interviews arranged during incidental trips to Perth, Tokyo, Milan and London.             Our meeting is my first sighting of a copy. Despite being stocked in 15 countries, the first issue had a print run of only a thousand and sold in quick time. Rather than meme recognition, you can put that down to high-end specs and the work of its creators, who travelled to Tokyo\u2019s Art Book Fair to pitch in person to Japanese stockists. As momentum built, their work gained favourable press from influential admirers.  \u201cIt\u2019s surprising,\u201d says Green modestly, \u201cbut at the same time it\u2019s irrelevant. We wanted to make something that we were proud of. Any commercial or critical success is wonderful, but it\u2019s just gravy.\u201d There are international flavours to both of Melbourne\u2019s newest animal mag offerings. Marta Roca\u2019s Four&amp;Sons, an offshoot of a website founded in 2011, is likewise outward-looking, with the Barcelona-born editor coordinating an internationalist contributor list. It, too, puts a premium on presentation and strength of image, with photo essays of unexpected depth: Nicolas Wilmouth mimicking 17th-century Flemish portrait technique, Mark Ruwedel\u2019s abandoned doghouses in the desert and the humour and personality of Sophie Gamand\u2019s mid-bath series. Interspersed are interviews with dog owners and writing from the likes of Dave Eggers.  Again, at the core of the publication are stories and cultural expression based around dogs rather than a cute fest. \u201cI was sucked in by the bond between humans and dogs, how it inspires people to create and how it breaks down barriers,\u201d says Roca. \u201cIt is a fun subject but we\u2019ve been careful not to fall into doggy cliches.\u201d  Both magazines are built on enthusiasm. Roca, a typographical designer, founded Four Publishing to compensate for scarce editorial opportunities. She says the magazine \u201chas become a bit of an obsession. It\u2019s a total labour of love. There is no external backing except for three advertisers on the printed mag.\u201d      Hellen Van Meene's dog delights in Four&amp;Sons. Photograph: Four&amp;Sons    For Green, Cat People \u201cis definitely a personal sort of project. There was no pressure there for it to be viable commercially. Just schlocking a whole lot of advertising in so we can buy a car or something doesn\u2019t interest us.\u201d Despite the expense and hassle of distribution, both believe the printed page is essential to show off their artists. \u201cOur content is really visual, almost tactile,\u201d says Roca.  Green sees it as a principle of modern publishing: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do something in print it has to be justified. I find myself buying fewer print novels now, but there\u2019s no good way to read an art book on a Kindle. Illustration and photography don\u2019t reproduce as well, and the colour varies on each device. So it\u2019s about control as well: a printed photograph stays exactly as you intended.\u201d  The reader response so far has made that print adventure possible. Cat People will double its run for a second edition in coming months, while Four&amp;Sons is aiming to publish twice a year alongside events and exhibitions. Each will provide more opportunities for photographers, artists and writers to find an audience.  Reassuringly, while an animal of choice may prove a useful hook, it doesn\u2019t need to be the kind that catches click-throughs or crochets gingham blankets.

When the full horror of Japanese atrocities became apparent in the aftermath of its surrender, Ishida devoted himself to defending the pacifist constitution, imposed by victorious US occupation authorities. Now, the former imperial army officer is consumed with fear that young Japanese will again be sent to fight overseas, following the most dramatic shift in the country&apos;s defence policy for almost 70 years. On Tuesday, the conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and his cabinet agreed to lift the longstanding ban on Japan&apos;s troops engaging in combat overseas, a move Ishida believes could once again drag his county into a reckless war. &quot;What Abe is doing is destroying the principles of our pacifist constitution,&quot; Ishida, a professor emeritus at Tokyo University, told the Guardian. &quot;Not killing anyone abroad is, in a sense, a precious part of our heritage. Why should we have to throw it away on the orders of one man rather than through the will of the people?&quot; Ishida, 91, believes Japan&apos;s US-authored constitution is at the heart of its postwar peace. &quot;I came to realise that I had been indoctrinated to become a militaristic youth,&quot; he said. &quot;As someone who felt for a while that he had lost his identity, the peace constitution was a great encouragement.&quot; That tradition of pacifism is in danger of being abandoned as Abe moves to reinterpret the constitution and lift the self-imposed ban on collective defence, or coming to the aid of an ally under attack. Japan will not attempt to revise its constitution outright \u2013 an option Abe apparently abandoned after accepting he would not win the necessary majorities in parliament and in a nationwide referendum \u2013 but will reinterpret the &quot;pacifist&quot; article 9, which prohibits the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. The change, which is expected to be approved by parliament \u2013 where Abe&apos;s Liberal Democratic party and its junior coalition partner hold majorities \u2013 would allow Japan to exercise collective self-defence for the first time since the end of the second world war. In practical terms, armed troops could take part in UN peacekeeping operations or be dispatched to &quot;grey zone&quot; emergencies that have not developed into full-blown conflict. Most troubling of all, say critics, the military could come to the aid of an ally, leaving open the possibility that Japan could be dragged into war at Washington&apos;s behest. Abe has made building a better-equipped, more robust military a cornerstone of his second term as prime minister. As a prominent figure among conservative politicians who want to change the country&apos;s view of its wartime record, he says the current constitution compromises Japan&apos;s ability to defend itself and its allies amid Chinese military aggression and North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. In a televised address on Tuesday, Abe said Japan would remain a pacifist state and denied that the new policy would mean sending troops into combat zones. Instead, he said it would offer better protection to the Japanese people. The country&apos;s navy, for example, would be able to help protect US warships that were fighting to defend Japan, he said. &quot;This is for the happiness of the Japanese people,&quot; Abe said. &quot;Japan&apos;s status as a peaceful country will not change.&quot; According to a cabinet document on the change, Japan would only take action if &quot;a country&apos;s existence is threatened, and there are clear dangers that the people&apos;s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness would be overturned&quot; by an armed attack on Japan or on &quot;countries with close ties&quot;. But neighbouring countries that were victims of Japanese militarism in the first half of the 20th century have warned Tokyo against abandoning its pacifist principles. &quot;Beijing opposes Japan&apos;s act of hyping the China threat,&quot; Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters in Beijing. &quot;It&apos;s only natural for us to wonder if Japan is going to leave the path of peaceful development that it has long been pursuing.&quot; In Seoul, the foreign ministry spokesman Noh Kwang-il said: &quot;Our position is that the discussions should be held on the basis of the pacifist constitution, dispelling concerns among neighbouring countries stemming from history, and into a direction of contributing to peace and stability in the region.&quot; Abe&apos;s push to remove constitutional restraints on the military has also attracted opposition in Japan. An estimated 10,000 people demonstrated outside his official residence on Monday evening, and similar protests were held on Tuesday. &quot;The current constitution is the result of the sacrifice of more than three million\u00a0Japanese and more than 20 million Asian victims of war,&quot; said Yoshihiko Murata, a 74-year-old protester. &quot;We should value it more.&quot; Several recent opinion polls show most voters oppose the lifting of the ban on collective self-defence. Supporters of the change said Japan is simply adopting the same defence policy as other liberal democracies at a time of increasing uncertainty in the Asia-Pacific. &quot;What we are trying to do now is to play a more proactive role in cooperating with regional countries in setting up a framework to protect the peace and stability of the region,&quot; Takeshi Iwaya, who heads the LDP&apos;s security research commission, told AP. Ishida said the effective removal of the last significant constraint on Japan&apos;s military had come at a dangerous time for the region, citing Abe&apos;s visit to Yasukuni shrine as part of an attempt to foment tension with China and South Korea. Japan&apos;s rightward shift under Abe, including the recent passage of a state secrets law, has rekindled uncomfortable memories for a man drafted to fight in a war he now believes was tragically misguided. &quot;The state secrets law immediately reminded me of the peace preservation law in 1928, which made it much easier to arrest people and suppress information,&quot; Ishida said. &quot;Now we have this new interpretation of article 9 of the constitution that would allow Japanese forces to fight overseas. I am worried that history is repeating itself.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Emin&apos;s bed was first shown in Tokyo, where the Japanese customs attempted to destroy it as it arrived in the country, and then in New York."], "tags": ["Tracey Emin", "Art and design", "Art", "Culture", "UK news", "Charles Saatchi"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-01T21:43:41Z", "title": "Tracey Emin's Bed is sold at auction for over \u00a32.5m", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jul/01/tracey-emin-my-bed-sale-auction", "article": "Tracey Emin&apos;s installation, My Bed, which documents the artist&apos;s traumatic relationship breakdown, sold for \u00a32.54m at Christie&apos;s auction on Tuesday. One of Britain&apos;s most famous and polarising pieces of modern art, My Bed was made in Emin&apos;s Waterloo council flat in 1998. Referred to by the artist as an unconventional and uncompromising self-portrait though objects, it features the artist&apos;s own bed covered in stained sheets, discarded condoms, blood-stained underwear and empty bottles of alcohol. The Turner-nominated artwork was first purchased by Charles Saatchi in 2000 for just \u00a3150,000. On the market for the first time, My Bed was put up for sale as part of Christie&apos;s Post-War and Contemporary Art sale, which also included works by Francis Bacon, Peter Doig, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock. Hundreds crammed into the Christie&apos;s auction house in St James&apos;s in central London, including Emin herself, to watch and take part in the historic sale, with the auction house estimating her work would sell for up to \u00a31.2m. Overseen by auctioneer Jussi Pylkk\u00e4nen, the sale opened at \u00a3650,000 and, as the bids came in thick and fast, the tension in the auction room was palpable until Emin&apos;s seminal artwork eventually went for over double the estimate at \u00a32.54m to Jay Jopling, the art dealer and founder of the White Cube gallery. As the winning bid was announced, Emin smiled and applauded. Jopling is a leading figure in the art world and made his name in the 1990s as the main dealer of those in the Young British Artist (YBA) movement such as Damien Hirst, Jake and Dinos Chapman and Emin herself. In 2012 he opened his newest venture in S\u00e3o Paolo with a solo exhibition by Emin. Before the auction, Emin said the selling of the piece felt like &quot;the end of an era. Saatchi&apos;s had this 90s thing in his house like a time capsule. Now it&apos;s historical.&quot; The artist said her hope was that the piece would be bought by a benefactor who would donate it to a museum and keep it on public display. It is unclear what Jopling will do with the artwork. Emin&apos;s bed was first shown in Tokyo, where the Japanese customs attempted to destroy it as it arrived in the country, and then in New York. After being nominated for the 1999 Turner prize, and causing a subsequent media frenzy, it caused visitor numbers to Tate Britain to hit a record high and was the piece that put Emin at the heart of the YBAs. Describing her original inspiration for the work, Emin said: &quot;Well I spent four days in bed. And I was feeling at a very low ebb. And, for two of those four days I was asleep and I didn&apos;t wake up. &quot;It was about the breakup of a relationship with someone I was really in love with. And it was also about my own sort of desperation; it was very romantic in lots of ways. It was almost like a 19th-century bohemian, &apos;have you ever half-lived?&apos;. &quot;It&apos;s very romantic, what I was feeling was the saddest kind of romanticism that anybody could ever imagine. I could have written a broken-hearted love story at the same time, and I did, with the bed.&quot; It was the work, she added, that had changed her life: &quot;I think about the bed almost every day when I make my own bed. I&apos;ll always be grateful for the bed. And if I could show the bed in my next show and my next show and my next show, I would. Because I think the bed will forever stand up to time.&quot; Emin&apos;s bed is one of 50 modern artworks and installations being sold by Saatchi this year, as part of a major clearout of his collection. In 2010, Saatchi offered 200 works from his collection, including My Bed, to the nation free of charge if his Chelsea gallery could be given museum status, but the offer was declined. Proceeds from the sale will go to support the Saatchi Gallery&apos;s policy of free entry to exhibitions and free education programme for school. Thanks to the Artists Resale Right, which enables artists and their beneficiaries to a royalty from the commercial resale of an original work of art, Emin will also make a small amount from the sale \u2013 around \u00a310,000 \u2013 which is the maximum an artist can receive under the legislation. Other works up for sale at the auction included Roy Lichtenstein&apos;s 1971 painting Mirror #8, which went for \u00a31.7m, Andy Warhol&apos;s Self Portrait (fright wig) which sold for \u00a35.6m and Francis Bacon&apos;s 1967 Study for Head of Lucian Freud, from the Roald Dahl estate, which began bidding at \u00a35m and eventually went for \u00a310.2m."}, {"sentences": ["Connecting flight cancelled on the runway, so I missed the international departure from Frankfurt to Tokyo."], "tags": ["Travel", "Heathrow", "UK news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-02T15:11:23Z", "title": "Ten airport horror stories that will make you never want to fly again", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jul/02/ten-airport-horror-stories-never-want-to-fly-again", "article": "After thousands of passengers were left without their baggage due to a conveyor belt glitch at Heathrow airport this week, we asked you to share some of your airport horror stories.

We had traveled by bus from Chefchauen, a well known cannabis producing region, to the capital, Rabat, and it had been a rather long uncomfortable journey. It was made a lot worse by the fact that for the last couple of days i had had a rather &quot;loose&quot; stomach.  We got to the airport with about forty minuted until our flight took off, so we rushed through check in, changed what little money we had left, pushed to the front of the passport queue and then tried to get through security. At that point, we were rather flushed from all the rushing, and I, more than I previously thought was possible, needed the toilet.  Inevitably, the guy in security pulled us to one side to take a closer look at our bags. And after emptying everything decided he should get another security guard to take a further look. I then made the mistake of telling him that I very much would like to go to the toilet while we waited because i had quite a bad stomach. He asked if i had taken any thing to which i replied, i have -- some Imodium -- but it hadn't helped. He then asked if i needed to have a doctor to check out my stomach, I said that i was OK, I just really needed to toilet. I then realised that we had very different understandings of what was wrong. Telling me that he knew that I came to the airport from Chefchauen - he must have checked my exit visa or guessed - he suggested that my bad stomach might be something to do with all the drugs I had taken or was smuggling in my stomach. I was looked nervous he told me. I tried to explain that I needed the loo. At that point, out came two armed police officers with sniffer dogs, and we were dragged to the corner of security and we waited, confident if a little nervous, for them to check out our bags.  I then got taken to an interview room, where a police officer poked at my stomach while quizzing me about my drug consumption habits. I told him that &quot;of course there is cannabis in Chefcauen&quot; -- you get offered it all the time -- but &quot;of course i didn't take any.&quot; He then said, after a little conferring, that I I would have to wait while they found a doctor to &quot;examine me.&quot; I tried to explain, once more, that this was a big misunderstanding and I just needed to go to the toilet but the more I remonstrated the more it seemed inevitable that i would end up with a latex gloved hand exploring my most intimate parts.  We waited, my girlfriend in tears; the police now were giggling and taking what seemed to be a remarkable amount of joy from our misery. Eventually somebody arrived to examine me: the original security officers. I asked about their medical credentials but i was told i didn't have a choice. Round the corner I went with him. We stopped outside a disabled toilet and he pointed to the door. Finally! I thought. And then it became obvious that the disabled toilets were in fact the examining room and he was coming in with me. He then told me that he was going to check if i was lying or not and told me that if i needed to go i should go now in a rather threatening tone, although he might have just been pissed off that he had drawn the short-straw of watching me defecate.  I was just about to ask if he could leave me alone while i went, but i no longer cared. Down came my trousers, and while I enjoyed an explosive, thundering poo, my bottom turning temporarily into an aerosol of faeces, i looked up at him and with a smug smile that said &quot;well i did tell you.&quot; After a minute or so, he left me to it. And by the time i returned my girlfriend was packing our bags once more, still a little shaken and uncertain as to where they had taken me.  The plane ended up being delayed, so we even got our flight. But it's taught me a lot. There are always bastard cops where ever you are; learning your rights is up there with remembering your passport; and make sure you carry money in case you need to bribe somebody in a disabled toilet in an airport in order to get home.

Going through the security scanner I was called back by one of the police security hovering around at the end who handed me a pair of magnifying glasses that were sitting at the end of the conveyor belt where I'd just picked my handbag up. I said thank you and wandered off with my family and a friend to the cafe. About 15 minutes later my brother said &quot;I think those three annoyed looking policemen are pointing at you&quot;!  It seems I'd mistakenly taken the glasses that belonged to someone else by mistake (I did honestly have a pair with me, I thought they'd fallen out my bag) and he was standing there with the policemen who came over to our table and started pointing and gesticulating at me and the glasses. I don't speak Spanish, neither did anyone else with me, the whole cafe was silent and staring at us but fortunately, the chap whose glasses I'd accidentally taken was German and did speak Spanish, he also spoke excellent English. He was very nice and accepted my massively red-faced apology that I truly had taken them by accident and left with the three policemen who glared at me as they departed. A rather uncomfortable experience at the time, not sure it warranted three police officers, but we laugh about it now..........!         Passport control at Amsterdam airport.

The next day we noticed that my friend's connecting flight in London to Newcastle was wrong - they had booked her connection a YEAR after she landed at LHR.  The LAN office in Cusco was closed for Easter, so we tried to alter the ticket online (it was a BA, One World alliance ticket) but no joy. Unfazed we flew from Cusco to Lima to catch our flight to the UK thinking we could sort this out with LAN at Lima. Hahahahaa... Three hours - and one shift change - later, we were still arguing with LAN about the error. They were adamant they would not change it, despite seeing that the original connection was the same day and that their colleague had made the mistake!  Frustrated at the complete ineptitude of LAN, and with a very angry, shouty best mate losing her rag ('I HATE THIS COUNTRY') I decided to do what all good PAs do: sort it out. I hopped online and booked my friend a BMi flight to Newcastle, I then called British Airways. It was not cheap, however, I got a very nice lady in the UK who took note of my issue, that we had spent more money on a flight, and that we were displeased. Ah, Britain.  It took 4 months of letters to get the flight connection refunded and an apology from LAN, however.....she got home!!

He never turned up - his connecting plane from Heathrow was diverted to Porto when one of the other passengers had a cardiac arrest. He eventually met us at the hotel but had no luggage, which had been lost in transit at Heathrow. He waited the requisite 3 days without luggage before hitting the fashion shops to buy underwear etc. His plight gave us much amusement. On the way back the friend was travelling to Hong Kong as he'd been moved to that office. We waited for the EasyJet flight back to Basel as he boarded his HK flight in business class. Constant delayed messages alerted to us an issue with our flight and when we eventually took our seats we were 5 hours late. Basel won't allow landings after midnight. Easyjet decided to send us to Lyon instead (which the tannoy insisted &quot;is near Basel&quot; - it isn't). We got shunted on to a rickety bus at 2 a.m. and trundled to Basel, arriving exhausted at 07:50 a.m. (10 minutes before the deadline at which EasyJet would have owed us compensation). At this point I received a text from the friend who had headed off to Hong Kong. He had landed on time and had been seated next to Alice Cooper, a fascinating companion who was happy (over a large quantity of Jack Daniels &amp; coke) to share stories of classic albums and touring shenanigans.

It was a brief stopover of two or three hours, which I should have spent in the heat and grime of what the airport staff referred to, with a straight face, as the transit lounge.  Within a few minutes of arriving in said lounge, a man came up to me, flashed his police ID, and demanded to see my passport and ticket. After inspecting them, he put them in his pocket, and told me to follow him.  We went downstairs, out through customs and immigration without pausing, and into the airport police station. I was taken into an interrogation room, where we were joined by two of my new friend's colleagues.  They kindly offered to assist me, for a small fee, in boarding my flight, an offer I politely declined on the grounds my ticket was in order. They then offered, in exchange for a similar consideration, to ensure that my checked baggage was loaded onto the plane, and again I thanked them very much, but said I was sure everything would be fine. At one point, I said I had little cash, but they told me they accepted travellers cheques. This dance went on for hours, with all of us pretending the officers weren't demanding bribes to let me go, and my stubbornly refusing to take advantage of their offers of assistance. Eventually, my plane landed, and they gave up.  I found myself at the bottom of the 747's steps, arguing with cabin crew, who, understandably, weren't keen to let me board without a passport or ticket. Eventually, a police officer shambled across the tarmac and returned my documents. It was only when I settled into my seat that I realised what a fool I'd been. What felt at the time like a game -- which I'd won! -- could have caused me real problems. For the sake of \u00a320 (though that really was a lot to me back then), I'd risked missing my plane, and possibly spending time in a Zairian jail. How long would it have taken the British consul to discover I was missing -- and then find me? What might have happened to me in my cell during that time?  But I was young, naive and it was my first time out of Europe. Thank God the on-board booze in cattle class was free back then. Otherwise, I'd have blown \u00a320 on getting drunk.

She was in her 70s, couldn't speak a word of English, spoke Mandarin with a strong accent and was illiterate. So we booked her into a direct flight and my parents and I (I was 7 then) waited dutifully at Heathrow for her to arrive.  Except her flight didn't arrive. At first it was labelled 'delayed'. This continued for hours. Then it just disappeared from the boards. My parents, with their broken English, were panicked. We slept on the floor in Heathrow airport that night as they struggled to locate the plane. The first of many nights I have since spent in airports and definitely the most scary.  Around 36 hours later we found out the plane had been held up somewhere and we, as Chinese people did in those days, sought the help of the Chinese Embassy. The Embassy actually provided us with accommodation for 2 further nights until my grandma arrived at Heathrow, 3 days late, but happy, healthy and completely unruffled and unconcerned.  She said she'd had a nice time with some ladies from another province in China who'd looked after her and we had nothing to worry about. She wasn't sure what had happened but they'd landed somewhere and she'd been given a place to stay and good food. She's even made good enough friends to give a few of the ladies our address, which my mum had written down for her. A few months later, we received a letter from one of these ladies with a photo of my grandma standing in front of St Basil's Cathedral in Moscow.  My grandma passed away in 2009. This is the main picture of her my parents still display on their mantelpiece.

Try being in a wheelchair. I have a story for every time I have flown with my power wheelchair, from the very helpful checkin lady in Vegas demanding that I try and walk (really? I'd never thought of that? Let me give it a go just for you), to the Paratransit bus that had a lift that failed with me inside the bus, as we're parked outside the airport and the departure time getting ever closer. However, there is one that will remain with us for all time. Flying from Vancouver Airport to Orlando for a massive family holiday. We are on the plane and the cabin crew ask my husband if he can step off the plane to talk to the ground staff. Nothing new here, we've been asked before to show them how to make sure the battery is off. My husband is gone for a little longer than I would have thought...and the cabin crew come back and ask for our address in Florida. Hmmmm. Not normal. My ashen faced husband gets back on the plane to tell me that they have dropped my $25k custom built power wheelchair from 20ft onto concrete and it is destroyed. And we're on our way to our holiday... To cut a very long story short, the holiday was painful - you can't just rent a replacement chair - so I mean literally painful with the chair that I had. It took 5 months before everything was finished. It was the airline's responsibility, but not their fault - Vancouver ground crew put it in a freight elevator without putting brakes on and leaving the back door of the elevator open. 350lb of chair flying through the air...could have killed someone. The airline, WestJet, were wonderful and did everything they could and I ended up with a lifelong friend from their mobility specialist in customer service. And they replaced the chair, without us ever having a crossed word anywhere in the proceedings. Has it put me off flying? Nah, flying again this year with WestJet. My mobility specialist friend already has the flights marked on her calendar...I've said I expect the chair to be wrapped in industrial strength bubble wrap! Your baggage is late?

Midwinter    01 July 2014 1:58pm   This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate So this would have been around 1990. It was Christmas Eve and I'd gone to Washington Dulles Airport to pick up my wife, who was flying in from LA (where she worked at the time). I don't know if you remember that winter, but it was a cold one, and the airport was virtually snowbound. Delays were expected. To amuse myself, I had a couple of drinks at the airport bar. While I was there I spotted what I thought was a dodgy looking character. Intrigued, I followed him into the baggage claim hall, where I was appalled to see that the man was both carrying a gun, and seemed to interfering with some baggage due to be loaded up onto one of the plans. I was armed myself, and -- as is common in these situations -- a shootout ensured, in which I killed one of the men. On reporting to airport security, I was appalled to discover that the man (whose ID I took) was a mercenary, supposedly killed in action a few years back. As you can imagine, I was even more suspicious than ever. Well, my suspicions were proved correct. Not long after that, a terrorist cell seized control of air traffic control and threatened to crash planes into the ground unless the dictator of their South American homeland -- then in jail in the US on drug charges -- was released from custody. To their credit, airport security called in SWAT to try and take the terrorists out, but it was a disaster. The SWAT team were massacred, and the terrorists went ahead and crashed a plane into the runway. There was over 200 people on board! Really, it was a bit of a downer. Anyway, realising my wife was in danger and that the authorities weren't going to solve the situation, I took matters into my own hands. To cut a long story short, I found the terrorists, killed them all and blew up their plane. Then I ran out onto the runway in the snow, and hailed down the remaining planes, saving thousands. The irony is that just the previous year I'd had to deal with a similar terrorist threat at my wife's workplace in LA. I mean, honestly, how can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?      There are plenty more we could have picked, so head over to this thread for more.

After all, it can mean fresher and healthier foods, stronger local economies, direct contact with food producers and in some cases \u2014 but not always \u2014 lower carbon emissions.  But most of us have only a few options for participating in the local food movement: visiting the farmers market or signing up for a community supported agriculture (CSA) subscription. As the movement continues to grow and evolve, however, social entrepreneurs are experimenting with novel ways to make local agriculture an integral part of urban life. Here are 10 of the most intriguing projects currently underway: GrowUp Box, London, UK     In a 20-foot shipping container, GrowUp Box farms tilapia in tanks and uses the waste to fertilize greens, which are cultivated in vertical columns. Photograph: GrowUp Box    Kate Hofman and Tom Webster are giving new meaning to the phrase &quot;box lunch&quot; with their reinvented shipping container, the GrowUp Box. Inside the 20-foot container, tilapia are farmed in tanks specially designed to ensure the fish enough room to grow, while on top, greens are cultivated in vertical columns. The water from the tilapia tanks circulates through the columns, where the fish waste provides nourishment to about 400 plants. The fish and greens are sold to area restaurants. The project&apos;s parent company, GrowUp Urban Farms, consults with people looking to build their own boxes and is set to start building the first commercial-scale aquaponics farm in London soon, Hofman said. Beacon Food Forest, Seattle, Washington, US     This Seattle project, called the Beacon Food Forest, is turning public land into an edible forest where residents can forage for fruits, pumpkins and nuts. Photograph: Beacon Food Forest    Opening to the public this spring, the Beacon Food Forest in Seattle is turning a piece of public land into an edible forest garden. Residents will be welcome to forage in the forest, a 7-acre plot \u2014 adjacent to a city park \u2014 featuring fruit and nut trees, a pumpkin patch and dozens of berry bushes. The goal is to mimic a natural ecosystem, creating a space that requires less maintenance and offers higher yields, co-founder Glenn Herlihy says.

The foods grown in the office are prepared and served in the company cafeteria.    Farmery, North Carolina and TBA, US     The Farmery, slated to open this fall in an as-yet-undisclosed location, will be an 8,000-square-foot market that will grow its own mushrooms, greens and fruits. Photograph: Amy Edwards/Farmery    Benjamin Greene, founder of the Farmery, plans to make the journey from farm to store more efficient by eliminating it almost entirely.  The Farmery will be an 8,000-square-foot market with food shopping on the lower level and mushrooms, greens and fruits growing on the upper level. Whatever is not grown on site will be sourced locally.  A smaller, Kickstarter-funded prototype \u2014 what Greene calls &quot;a souped-up produce stand&quot; \u2014 is currently in operation in Durham, North Carolina, and the first full-scale store is coming this fall, Greene says. The location, however, is being kept under wraps for now. Sky Greens, Lim Chu Kang area, Singapore     Sky Greens grows lettuce, spinach and a variety of Asian greens on a tall, narrow A-frame structure that slowly rotates the plants to make sure they get enough sunlight. Photograph: Sky Greens    Singapore, one of the most densely populated nations in the world, has little room available for farming. So inventor and entrepreneur Jack Ng created the Sky Greens system to grow more food in less space. Think of it as a plant skyscraper. The equipment (see photo above) holds up to 32 trays of greens \u2014 including lettuce, spinach and a variety of Asian greens \u2014 on a tall, narrow A-frame structure. The plants slowly rotate, as if on a Ferris wheel, so each tray gets sufficient exposure to sunlight. Sky Greens, which launched commercial operations in October 2012, harvests and delivers vegetables to Singaporean markets every day. Brooklyn Grange, Brooklyn, New York, US The Brooklyn Grange comprises two and a half acres of growing space high atop a pair of office buildings. &quot;We&apos;re looking at ways to increase food production without increasing agricultural footprint,&quot; spokeswoman Anastasia Plakias says.  The operation grows more than 50,000lbs of food each year, which it sells through farmers markets, CSA subscriptions and wholesale accounts. In addition to boosting New York City&apos;s local food supply, the farm also absorbs more than 1m gallons of stormwater every year, reducing the load the city&apos;s systems must manage.  Deu Horta Na Telha, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil     Deu Horta Na Telha turns large waterproof roof tiles upside down, filling them with soil to turn roofs, balconies and other paved areas into miniature farms. Photograph: Deu Horta Na Telha    After 30 years of building urban gardens in S\u00e3o Paulo, agricultural technician Marcos Victorino started running out of cultivable land.  As part of his research work at local college Faculdade Cantareira, he designed a way to turn roofs, balconies and paved areas across the city into miniature farms. Victorino turns large roof tiles upside down, creating a long, V-shaped trough that can be filled with soil.  These tile beds are elevated, making them easily accessible to children and the handicapped. Because the tiles are watertight, they hold in moisture, allowing growers to make the most of an increasingly limited water supply.  Prinzessinnengarten, Berlin, Germany     In the shadow of the former Berlin wall, a wide range of vegetables grows in repurposed Tetra Paks, rice sacks and plastic crates. Photograph: Prinzessinnengarten    The Prinzessinnengarten is an urban farm nestled in the shadow of the former Berlin Wall, between unused subway stops, graffiti-ed concrete walls and aging apartment blocks. Inside vine-covered fences grows a wide range of vegetables, all planted in easy-to-move containers \u2014 recycled Tetra Paks, rice sacks, and plastic crates \u2014 that allow the entire operation to be moved if needed. Visitors can pick vegetables, learn about seed harvesting and vegetable pickling, or visit the caf\u00e9 to enjoy snacks made from the garden&apos;s produce.  Urban Organics, St. Paul, Minnesota, US     In a former commercial brewery, Urban Organics uses aquaponics - a system in which fish waste fertilizes plants - to supply salad greens and fish to area grocery stores and restaurants. Photograph: /Urban Organics    Located in a building formerly occupied by a commercial brewery, Urban Organics is an aquaponics operation that provides salad greens and fish to grocery stores and restaurants using just 2% of the water of conventional agriculture. Founder Fred Haberman, CEO of Minneapolis marketing agency Haberman, hopes the for-profit farm will prove the commercial viability of aquaponics and help spur economic development in the area. &quot;If we can do that, I believe you\u2019ll see more of these types of facilities popping up,&quot; he said. Lufa Farms, Montreal, Canada     Lufa Farms has two sprawling rooftop greenhouses that produce greens, herbs, peppers and eggplants, which it delivers to approximately 4,000 customers each week. Photograph: Lufa Farms    The goal of Lufa Farms in Montreal is to create a &quot;local food engine&quot;, says the company&apos;s greenhouse director Lauren Rathmell.  At the heart of the operation are two sprawling rooftop greenhouses \u2014 currently totaling 1.75 acres \u2014 that produce a range of vegetables: greens and herbs, peppers and eggplants. The produce is packaged with locally sourced goods like handmade pastas, fresh bread and dark baking chocolate, and delivered to approximately 4,000 customers each week. And the business isn&apos;t stopping there: It has two more greenhouses in the works.

This is a remarkable development when one considers the close ideological and historic ties between China and North Korea, but it would be premature to assume that Beijing has abandoned Pyongyang for Seoul. China under Mao Zedong saved Kim Jong-un\u2019s grandfather from certain defeat at the hands of UN forces led by General MacArthur during the 1950-1953 Korean War (still known in China as the \u201cWar to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea\u201d) by preventing the advance of allied forces to the China-North Korean border at the Yalu River and fighting to a stalemate. Although North Korea saw China\u2019s normalisation of relations with South Korea in 1992 as a betrayal, and Sino-South Korean trade is now almost 40 times larger than its trade with North Korea, China has not allowed its 1961 security commitment to North Korea to lapse. Neither has Beijing withdrawn its extensive economic assistance or political support for North Korea. Even in the aftermath of North Korea\u2019s 2010 shelling of South Korean islands, Beijing protected North Korea from international condemnation of those actions at the United Nations. No doubt, Xi\u2019s Seoul visit is a powerful expression of his displeasure with North Korea\u2019s direction under Kim Jong-un, but despite Beijing\u2019s symbolic chastening of Pyongyang and stories that China has cut its export of oil to North Korea, China still places maintenance of North Korea\u2019s stability as a top priority. South Korean efforts to gain China\u2019s understanding for a South Korean-led reunification of the Korean peninsula and Park\u2019s desire to warm up relations with Beijing may be understandable, but China may not be swayed by Seoul\u2019s logic on Korean reunification as long as South Korea\u2019s alliance with the United States remains central to South Korea.  China may not be swayed by Seoul\u2019s logic on Korean reunification as long as South Korea\u2019s alliance with the United States remains central to South Korea  China wants a reunified Korea to be friendly to Beijing, has explicitly stated its distrust of US alliances and its view that the US-Korea alliance would have no utility in the absence of a North Korean threat, and probably believes that its growing economic importance to South Korea will eventually provide it with the leverage necessary to marginalise the US security role on the peninsula.     Chinese President Xi Jinping greets South Korean children during a welcoming ceremony held at the presidential Blue House on 3 July, 2014 in Seoul. Photograph: Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images    At present, Chinese and South Korean political and strategic differences on these issues impose real limits on the improvement of political relations between China and South Korea, despite a bilateral trade relationship of over $220 billion in 2013 and notwithstanding the current honeymoon in Sino-ROK relations under Xi and Park. Beijing probably believes that time and the forces of economic interdependence are on its side. The more difficult near-term questions for Xi may come after Seoul, when he may return to the more difficult task of determining how to more effectively deal with Pyongyang. Scott Snyder is senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Follow him on Twitter @snydersas Adam Cathcart: Xi Jinping\u2019s diplomatic goals in the South Korean capital do not perturb the North Korean regime in the least For all the international frisson which is being generated around Xi Jinping\u2019s preference for travelling to Seoul over Pyongyang, there is one large demographic that seems unlikely to know or care anything about it: the North Korean people. For the 23 million people trapped within the otherworldly bubble of DPRK state media, the current news cycle is far more fixated on the revolutionary repertoire of an obscure Russian wind band than the itinerary of China\u2019s head of state. To the extent that they might be discussed at all outside of North Korean elite circles, Xi Jinping\u2019s diplomatic goals in the South Korean capital do not perturb the North Korean regime in the least. Nevertheless, ire must be displayed for the proper audiences. And, since well over 80% of its non-peninsular trade is with China, the North Korean state has to resort to indirect insults. One article referred to withstanding the \u201cpressure of the great power chauvinists.\u201d Another article in the Party newspaper called Park Geun-hye\u2019s goal of denuclearisation (a goal very much shared by Xi Jinping) a \u201cdog\u2019s dream.\u201d Meanwhile, Kim Jong-un demonstrates an almost Rabelasian appetite for, and delight in, watching missile launches. China has seen far worse, however, and the Chinese Communist Party continues to build up its northeastern frontier with the Korean peninsula. The Party Secretary for Jilin province was recently on the Sino-North Korean border, talking in Xi-inflected language about &quot;accelerating the interconnection of Northeast Asian transportation routes\u201d via new high-speed trains, and making the borderlands safe and prosperous.     This undated picture released from North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on 30 June, 2014 shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (R) observing a tactical rocket launch by the Korean People's Army Strategic Force at an undisclosed place in North Korea. Photograph: KNS/AFP/Getty Images    Trade with North Korea continues, even as reports emerge of problems with oil exports, deadly accidents and a total cessation of construction on two islands leased to China. Perfectly-timed defector narratives recently asserted that a letter to Chinese leaders helped to seal the death sentence for Kim Jong-un\u2019s very uncle this past December. The People\u2019s Republic of China has had diplomatic relations with Seoul since 1992, but its business ties to South Korea date back another decade. And South Korean business leaders are meeting with Xi in force on 4 July, investing heavily in Northeast China and gambling on the long-term prospect of gaining access to the minerals and manpower north of the 38th parallel.  China&apos;s greatest leverage with Pyongyang is geographical, and Chinese dynasties have made a pattern of allying with southern Korean kingdoms to extinguish disrespectful foes in the north. As Xi Jinping cosies up to South Korean capitalists and dreams his canine dream of a nuclear-free peninsula, the North Korean leadership might keep that in mind. Adam Cathcart is a lecturer in Chinese History at University of Leeds, and Editor-in-Chief of SinoNK.com. Follow him on Twitter @adamcathcart Ralph Cossa: While China will send signals of its annoyance, it will not pull the plug and take Pyongyang off of life support I think the fact that Chinese President Xi Jinping has decided to go to Seoul prior to visiting Pyongyang, and instead of having Kim Jong-un visit Beijing, reflects both growing frustration on the part of the Chinese leadership with North Korea\u2019s young General, as well as a growing level of distrust toward the North Korean regime. I\u2019m told by Chinese security specialists that Pyongyang has been pushing hard for a Kim visit to China and that Beijing has been reluctant since it fears that a Kim Jong-un visit to Beijing might be followed shortly after his return home by another North Korean nuclear test, thus implying (falsely) that Beijing had given Kim a green light. The same logic would apply regarding a Xi visit to Pyongyang. This highlights the growing mistrust between the two nations, especially following Jang Song-thaek\u2019s execution. Clearly both President Xi and South Korean President Park Guen-hye see the visit as a way to pressure Pyongyang to be more forthcoming and to act more responsibly. It also has the added \u201cbenefit\u201d (from a PRC and ROK perspective; certainly not from a US perspective) of contrasting the increasingly close ties between Beijing in Seoul with the continued frosty relations both currently have with Tokyo.   The visit also contrasts the increasingly close ties between Beijing and Seoul, with the frosty relations both currently have with Tokyo  While Xi and Park may hope their second summit (the first was held last year) will have a sobering effect on Kim Jong-un, it is more likely to have the opposite effect. The North seems to still believe, based on logic that is clear only to those residing in Pyongyang, that China needs the North more than it needs China, and that while China will send signals of its annoyance from time to time, at the end of the day it will not pull the plug and take Pyongyang off of life support; any pain Pyongyang may experience will be temporary.     Chinese President Xi Jinping, his wife Peng Liyuan and South Korean President Park Geun-Hye walk towards a guard of honour during a welcoming ceremony held at the presidential Blue House on 3 July, 2014 in Seoul. Photograph: Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images    As a result, the North is more likely to take steps that appear to up the ante since history has told them that the more confrontational Pyongyang appears, the more likely Beijing (and Washington and Seoul) will be to eventually reward them not for good behaviour but merely for the absence of bad behaviour. Pyongyang also appears to be attempting some sort of crude quid pro quo by all of a sudden cooperating with Tokyo on the abductees issue, even though this is likely to once again provide disappointing to Japan.

And so it was the sheer variety of the compositions nominated this week that made this final choice so difficult. How to include everything that deserves to be celebrated here? Well for a start, there has to be soul music. Sweet Soul Music in fact. Co-written by Otis Redding, Arthur Conley\u2019s 1967 single opens with a fanfare and proceeds to celebrate songs by the Miracles, James Brown, Sam and Dave, Wilson Picket and Otis too. Wynton Marsalis performs a wordless version of the old Black spiritual Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child. The words if we could hear them speak of pain and despair. A child separated from his/her parents. In this rendition the trumpet carries the melody and conveys the emotions so effectively we need to hear nothing more. By way of contrast, Irish folk/punk musicians The Pogues take a melody heard at a Spanish fairground and use the brass section to recreate the feeling of Fiesta. Drunkenness, debauchery and mayhem. Back in more sober company, the Baroque Brass of London play the canzona from Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary. Written by Purcell in the 17th century it has lost none of its power to move the listener. Back on your feet again. We are in need of some ska. A music originated in Jamaica, reinterpreted in 1970s Britain by the Two Tone bands and now given a different slant by Japanese combo The Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra. Bold, brassy and big in Japan their Pride of Lions captures the spirit of The Specials and Madness at another time and in another place. Then there is folk. English folk music and brass bands. A marriage made in heaven. At the 2012 Folk Awards The Unthanks performed the song King of Rome, which tells the story of Charles Hudson, who had dreams of flying like the pigeons he loved. His bird was the only one which returned from Rome to his native Derby in a record-breaking 1913 race. \u201cCome on down your majesty, I knew you\u2019d make it back to me\u201d. The Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band provide the perfect accompaniment.  A more modern take on the brass band concept comes from Chicago eight-piece the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble with War. Funky and eclectic music from the sons of jazz trumpeter Phil Cohran. What can be said about The Beatles\u2019 Penny Lane that hasn\u2019t already been said? Let\u2019s just say that it\u2019s a classic and that David Mason\u2019s piccolo trumpet solo lifts it to higher ground. Speaking of classics, The Skatalites\u2019 Guns of Navarone was one of the original ska anthems. Timeless dance music with horns honking just like they should. Indie Tex Mex band Calexico were completely new to me. I gather that their music has been described as \u201cdesert noir\u201d. This live performance of their song Inspiracion is a delight.

Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he had decided to revoke the measures after concluding that North Korean authorities were serious about establishing the whereabouts of the missing Japanese, even though North Korea claimed more than a decade ago that they had either died or had never been taken to the country. &quot;We have determined that an unprecedented framework has been established, where an organisation that can make decisions at a national level ... will be at the forefront of the investigations,&quot; Abe said. &quot;But this is just a start. We are determined to do everything we can to achieve the complete resolution of this issue.\u201d Abe has made determining the abductees\u2019 fates a priority of his North Korea policy, even if it meant a departure from the tough line adopted by the UN over the regime\u2019s missile and nuclear weapons programmes. Japanese officials stressed that Tokyo remained committed to UN sanctions, and that this week\u2019s rapprochement was connected solely to the abductions. Following the agreement between officials from both countries in Beijing, North Korean state media said negotiators had explained the composition and logistics of a committee of investigators. &quot;Both sides agreed to take necessary measures in the days ahead, while getting in touch with each other through a diplomatic channel,&quot; the state news agency KCNA quoted its negotiators as saying. Other countries in the region welcomed the agreement, but warned that multilateral sanctions would remain in place until progress was made in curbing North Korea&apos;s quest to develop a nuclear deterrent. Noh Kwang-il, a South Korean foreign ministry spokesman, said negotiations between Tokyo and Pyongyang should proceed \u201cin a transparent manner, and that all the relevant measures by Japan should be taken in a way that does not undermine the co-ordination among [South Korea] the US and Japan on North Korea&apos;s nuclear and missile issues\u201d. China, whose leader, Xi Jinping, is visiting South Korea in an apparent snub to the North \u2013 with which it has traditionally had closer ties \u2013 said it hoped the breakthrough would be \u201cconducive to regional peace and stability\u201d. Xi and his South Korean counterpart, Park Geun-hye, issued a joint communiqu\u00e9 reaffirming their opposition to a nuclear-armed North Korea. The US state department said it \u201cunderstood\u201d Japan\u2019s desire to resolve the abduction issue.  &quot;We closely co-ordinate with our allies and partners, including Japan, to counter the threat to global security posed by [North Korea\u2019s] nuclear and ballistic missile programs,&quot; state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. &quot;At the same time, we empathise with the families of the abductees and understand Japan&apos;s efforts to resolve this humanitarian issue.&quot; Japan\u2019s government is seeking information about at least 12 people who it says were snatched and forcibly taken to North Korea during the cold war to teach Japanese language and customs to communist agents. In 2002, the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, secured the release of five other abductees, who were later joined by their families, after a summit in Pyongyang with his counterpart Kim Jong-il. Japan has refused to believe North Korean claims that eight of the remaining abductees had died, often in mysterious accidents, and four more had never entered the country. On Thursday, Japanese media reported that North Korea had handed over the names of 10 Japanese thought to be living there, including some believed to be on Tokyo\u2019s abductee list. While Japanese officials played down the economic significance of lifting sanctions, the move will make it easier to transfer money to North Korea, as well as boosting people-to-people contacts with the easing of travel restrictions and the resumption of port calls by North Korean ships for \u201chumanitarian\u201d purposes. Relatives of the abductees said they hoped North Korea would conduct the investigation in good faith, having reneged on a similar promise in 2008. &quot;Unlike then, the coming investigation may produce something,&quot; said Shigeru Yokota, whose daughter, Megumi, was 13 when she abducted on her way home from school near the Japan Sea coast in 1977."}, {"sentences": ["He was considered a leading candidate to break the four-minute mile, and a favourite for the 1940 Tokyo Olympics, which were cancelled when the second world war broke out."], "tags": ["Sport and leisure", "Film", "Biopics", "Culture", "World news", "Second world war", "Unbroken", "Books", "US news", "Biography", "History", "Angelina Jolie", "Sport", "Athletics"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-04T18:36:06Z", "title": "Louis Zamperini obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/04/louis-zamperini", "article": "A star runner, war hero, and survivor of 47 days at sea in a rubber raft and two years of torture in Japanese prison camps, Louis Zamperini, who has died aged 97, experienced the sort of life that was the stuff of Hollywood movies. And 71 years after he was declared killed in action in the Pacific, four years after Laura Hillenbrand&apos;s biography of him became a bestseller, Hollywood got the message. Angelina Jolie&apos;s film Unbroken, with Jack O&apos;Connell playing Zamperini and a screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen, will be released in December. Zamperini was born in Olean, New York, to Italian immigrants who moved to Torrance, California, when he was three. He still had not learned English, and was bullied. His father, a labourer, taught him boxing, and Zamperini so enjoyed defeating his bullies that he became a young terror, in and out of trouble. Not until his older brother Pete talked him into joining the track team at Torrance high school were his energies directed into more constructive channels. In 1934 at the Los Angeles Coliseum, Zamperini ran mile in 4min 21.2 sec, setting a national high school record that stood for 20 years. He won a scholarship to the University of Southern California (USC), and in 1936 moved up to 5,000m for the US Olympic trials, finishing in a dead heat with the world record holder Don Lash. In Berlin, where his room-mate Jesse Owens was the biggest hero of the games, he finished 8th in the Olympic final, but he stunned the crowd with a 56-second final lap.     Left to right: Don Lash, Louis Zamperini and Thomas Deckard, who represented the US in the 1936 Olympic 5,000m, Photograph: AP    Afterwards, standing with a group of runners in front of Adolf Hitler, but unable to take a photo, he handed his camera to a thin man standing nearby, and Joseph Goebbels snapped a shot for him. Hitler then shook his hand, saying &quot;You&apos;re the boy with the fast finish.&quot; Once the dignitaries were gone, Zamperini sparked a small incident when he shinned up a flagpole to take away the Fuhrer&apos;s personal standard. At USC his finishing kick saw him called &quot;The Torrance Tornado&quot;, and in 1938 his 4min 8.3sec mile set a US college record that lasted 15 years. He was considered a leading candidate to break the four-minute mile, and a favourite for the 1940 Tokyo Olympics, which were cancelled when the second world war broke out.     Louis Zamperini, right, with his friend Fred Garrett, after returning to the US in 1945. Photograph: PCS/AP    Zamperini enlisted in the army in September 1941, and after the US entered the war the following December flew B-24s from the island of Funafuti. In May 1943, his crew was assigned to search for a lost bomber, and given a spare plane thought to be mechanically jinxed. When its engine exploded, they crashed into the ocean; eight of the 11-man crew died. Zamperini and two others survived in a life raft. They lived on rainwater, albatross and the occasional fish, and were beset by storms, sharks and strafing from passing Japanese planes. After 47 days, two of the three, Zamperini and co-pilot Russell Phillips reached the Marshall Islands and were captured. Zamperini weighed 75lbs. As he recalled: &quot;I thought to myself, six weeks ago I was a world-class athlete. And then, for the first time in my life, I was scared.&quot; In his first prison camp, Zamperini&apos;s renown earned him the enmity of the notorious Japanese army sergeant Mutsuhiro Watanabe, known to prisoners as The Bird. He was tortured repeatedly. &quot;I could take the beatings and physical punishment,&quot; he later said. &quot;But it was the attempt to destroy your dignity, to make you a nonentity, that was the hardest thing to bear.&quot; Zamperini had been reported missing in action, and in June 1943 his parents received the telegram from the president declaring him killed. But later Zamperini was transferred away from Watanabe, to help make a radio broadcast home. When he refused to make a second, condemning the US, he was transferred to another camp where Watanabe was now commandant. After the war ended, Watanabe was listed 23rd among the top 40 war criminals sought by the Americans, but escaped and went into hiding. Zamperini returned to Los Angeles and married Cynthia Applewhite in 1946. However, he suffered from what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder, and began drinking heavily. In 1949, Cynthia took him to a rally staged by the evangelist Billy Graham, and then to a second, where Louis was overcome and born-again as a Christian. He became an inspirational speaker and youth worker, while working in commercial real estate, and in 1950 accompanied missionaries to Japan, where he contacted those who had tortured him and greeted them with forgiveness. He stayed active physically, saying &quot;the war took 10 years off my life. I decided to get the 10 years back.&quot; In 1984 he carried an Olympic torch into the same Coliseum where he had set records as a youth, and for the 1998 winter Games in Nagano he again joined the torch relay, carrying the Olympic flame past one of the prison camps where he had been tortured. By then, Watanabe had resurfaced as a successful businessman, and Zamperini wrote him a letter of forgiveness, offering to meet. Watanabe refused, but gave an interview to the American TV show 60 Minutes, saying he had treated Zamperini only as &quot;an enemy of Japan&quot;. Zamperini published two memoirs, different books with the same title, Devil at My Heels. The first, in 1956, written with Helen Itris, was optioned by Universal as a vehicle for Tony Curtis, but he went on to make Spartacus instead. The second, done with David Rensin, appeared in 2003. But it was not until Hillenbrand, who had previously written Seabiscuit, the story of the great racehorse, published Unbroken, that Zamperini&apos;s story gained traction. When Jolie was drawn to the story, she discovered that he lived just down the street from her. Torrance&apos;s airport and high school stadium are both named after Zamperini, as is the plaza outside the stadium at USC. When asked to describe his own indomitable spirit, he said &quot;the only way I can put it that makes sense is that every athlete wants to win.&quot; Cynthia died in 2001, and he is survived by a daughter, Cynthia, and a son, Luke. \u2022 Louis Silvie Zamperini, athlete and soldier, born 26 January 1917; died 2 July 2014"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;If you go to Tokyo, one of the busiest cities in the world, you don&apos;t see the type of behaviour you consistently see in London."], "tags": ["Cycling", "Life and style", "Cycle hire schemes", "Transport", "London", "Road safety", "World news", "Road transport", "UK news", "Cycling", "Sport", "Sir Chris Hoy"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-05T07:00:00Z", "title": "What's the worst thing about cycling? Other cyclists", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/05/worst-thing-about-cycling-other-cyclists", "article": "After 12 years riding a bike in London, I\u00a0recently came to a\u00a0shocking conclusion: what scares me the most as a cyclist is not the cars, not the lorries and not even the taxi passengers who unexpectedly wrench their door open in front of you \u2013 but other cyclists. From busy roads to quiet estate pathways, canal towpaths to back streets, they move with astonishingly little regard for anyone else, leaving old and young, pedestrians and fellow two-wheelers spinning in their self-righteous wake. They buy a bike and they buy a\u00a0bell, and they make me despair because everywhere they go they set the cause of cycling back. If you consider yourself a cyclist and are about to head below the line or send a letter to the editor with a rage you haven&apos;t felt since the last pedestrian typing on an iPhone stepped right out in front of you without looking \u2013 hold off a moment. This isn&apos;t an attack on cyclists or cycling. Far from it. This is an attack on a kind of new boy racer who is giving cyclists a bad name. Cycling is \u2013 rightly \u2013 booming: bike shops are the new coffee shops, springing up in huge numbers on every high street; in London the Barclays bikes\u00a0have been taken up with enthusiasm; and the Tour de France, starting this weekend, will undoubtedly enthuse even more people to get on two wheels when it passes through Yorkshire. This is great ... but with all this comes increased congestion, and too many cyclists \u2013 who see this overcrowding as an affront to their freedom \u2013 react with a self-righteous fury and a &quot;screw you&quot; attitude. You might correctly point out that cyclists are too often the victims of the road and that motor vehicles are still the\u00a0main danger to life and limb for cyclists and pedestrians alike. According to CTC, the national cycling charity, in 2012, 98% of serious or fatal pedestrian injuries in urban areas were due to collisions with motor vehicles. And between 2008 and 2012, nine pedestrians were killed by cycles, while 1,361 were killed by cars. But none of this excuses the breathtakingly bad behaviour of a significant minority of cyclists. No less\u00a0an authority than Chris Hoy remarked on this in an interview for the Telegraph, saying that nothing winds him up more than bad manners on a bike. &quot;When I&apos;m out on a bike and I see someone doing something stupid I will absolutely have a word with them at the next set of lights,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;There was a guy who was riding like an idiot, jumping lights, cutting up the pavement, and I just said: &apos;You&apos;re not helping matters here. If you want respect, you have to earn it.&apos;&quot;     Chris Hoy \u2026 'When I\u2019m out on a bike and I see \u00adsomeone doing something stupid I will absolutely have a word with them at the next set of lights.' Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA    If you travel in a city during rush hour, the chances are you will have seen someone on a bicycle pull a stunt that, had it been perpetrated by a car driver, would have seen them dragged from the wheel and strung from the nearest lamp-post. And you will have seen it\u00a0time and time again. This is why they are a danger both to the cause of cycling and to\u00a0cyclists themselves. While none of us is perfect, these people slip into a realm where the rules of the road are irrelevant, and common decency goes out the window. They are the ones who are increasingly cutting us all up (pedestrian, car or cyclist), pushing us\u00a0aside or screaming at us because we&apos;ve slowed down to allow a child or\u00a0older person live. In fact, I&apos;d say car drivers in general deserve more credit than they get from the cycling fraternity, because I don&apos;t recall ever seeing a car driver spot a space on a fully loaded zebra crossing that&apos;s a couple of centimetres wider than his car, put his head down, cross to the wrong side of the road, and bolt through at full\u00a0speed. Nor do you see many cars flash on to a footpath behind a tight knot of pedestrians and proceed to ring their bell furiously until everyone jumps out of their way. And I probably don&apos;t even need to start talking about red lights, do I? But the physical hazards posed by the new boy racers are not the real danger to\u00a0cyclists \u2013 it&apos;s the damage to the cycling brand they constitute that&apos;s truly problematic. To the harassed pedestrian for whom\u00a0he tinged bell has become a\u00a0tense precursor to either an earful of\u00a0abuse or near-death experience, the moron has become the norm. The\u00a0new\u00a0boy racers represent all cyclists. And that&apos;s why they are really\u00a0dangerous, because cycling needs to progress and be embraced,\u00a0but the more badly behaved and unaccountable\u00a0cyclists are perceived to be, the greater the likelihood that we&apos;ll be forced into restrictive and bureaucratic measures that set the whole cause\u00a0back. Compulsory insurance is one of those cure-alls for accountability that gets regularly trotted out, which is fine in principle, but although the person who just killed your dog might be able to offer compensation, you&apos;d still have to catch\u00a0them first. Registration is another oft-proposed solution to the problem. Japan is the only country that\u00a0requires all bikes to be registered. Switzerland and others phased it out because of the cost and the bureaucracy. Now, the UK loves a bit of red tape, but registering every single bike? I don&apos;t think so. And apart from that, the freedom of cycling is a big draw to many of us. Take that away and it becomes another bureaucratically laden drag. So nothing would hold the cause of cycling back more than registration. Interestingly, while we&apos;re on the subject of Japan, it has a large cycling population and many cycling laws \u2013 all of which are completely ignored. Cyclists regularly ride on paths and, indeed, police will even direct them on to walkways if they see them on roads. And yet cyclists, drivers and pedestrians get along fine. How does it work? In a\u00a0word, politeness \u2013 one of those Japanese concepts with no direct translation into\u00a0English. The unfortunate truth, as CTC points out, is that congestion is only going to get worse and that we all \u2013 drivers and cyclists \u2013 have to meet in the middle and\u00a0be considerate. &quot;If you go to Tokyo, one of the busiest cities in the world, you don&apos;t see the type of behaviour you consistently see in London. Everyone understands that the city is hugely busy and that they have to behave accordingly. We would like to see cycle awareness training as\u00a0part of the driving test because everyone needs to understand the other point of view,&quot; says CTC spokesperson Jacqui Shannon.     More popular than ever \u2026 the commuter bike hire scheme in London has been taken up enthusiastically. Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA    The organisation would also like to\u00a0see Bikeability \u2013 a 21st-century version\u00a0of\u00a0the cycling proficiency test \u2013 as part of\u00a0the school curriculum. That would help with the next generation, but it&apos;s the current crop of speeding rudeboys high on a cocktail of fury and\u00a0selfishness who are the problem, and they are unlikely to think they need\u00a0any training. But enough of regulation and training, what about the laws of the highway? To me, as a cyclist, I see a car coming and I am 99% confident that it will behave in a predictable manner, because drivers are trained to stick to the rules. Surely riders could do the same? Unfortunately though, when I\u00a0see\u00a0another rider, I have no idea if they are going to slow down, speed up, stop, run over a pedestrian and say it was my fault or do a wheelie down the wrong side of the road. Last year, the Metropolitan police launched Operation Safeway in response\u00a0to the deaths of six cyclists who were killed on the roads in London between 5 and 18 November. Officers manned major junctions and trouble spots and handed out a total of 13,818 fines \u2013 with 4,085 going to cyclists. Of\u00a0course, a driver can do far more damage\u00a0in a car \u2013 or worse, a lorry \u2013 than\u00a0any cyclist, but that&apos;s still a lot of\u00a0cyclists jumping red lights and whizzing down footpaths. Besides, the process of holding drivers to account is\u00a0easy because you have a means of identifying\u00a0the miscreant and catching up with them at a later date. However, an officer witnessing a dangerous cyclist can do little more than shake his fist in\u00a0their direction. I wouldn&apos;t call myself a cyclist with a\u00a0capital c, but I know many of them, and they&apos;re a sensitive bunch. So I&apos;m writing this anonymously because I&apos;ve\u00a0had enough of being intimidated on the roads as it is. Maybe it&apos;s time for me\u00a0to put the bike away and start walking instead. But don&apos;t let me stop you. If you&apos;re caught up in the cycling boom and are tempted to join in the revolution, go ahead.

In Abbott, Abe has found a kindred spirit and a source of friendship that is palpably absent from his testy relationships with the leaders of China and South Korea. Abe may be one of Japan\u2019s most peripatetic prime ministers since the war, but his unapologetic brand of nationalism has taken Tokyo\u2019s ties with Beijing and Seoul to their lowest point in decades. At the same time, Abe\u2019s mission to create a more robust military has been welcomed by Australia and other countries in the region who share his concerns about China\u2019s swift, and opaque, military build-up. This will be his second meeting with Abbott in a matter of months, yet bilateral summits with his Chinese and South Korean counterparts remain elusive more than 18 months into his prime ministership. Tokyo\u2019s longstanding dispute with Beijing over ownership of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands shows no signs of easing. Only this weekend, Chinese patrol vessels were spotted entering waters near the Japanese-owned islands, located amid potentially huge oil and gas deposits. Relations with South Korea have taken a similarly parlous turn, after Abe questioned the validity of an official apology for Japan\u2019s use of thousands of mainly Korean sex slaves before and during the second world war. At home, praise for the early success of Abenomics \u2013 his three-pronged prescription for two decades of stagnation \u2013 has been overshadowed by public opposition to his post-Fukushima plans to restart nuclear reactors and, in the past week, his controversial decision to lift a 70-year-old ban on Japanese troops fighting alongside allies in overseas wars. But while China and South Korea issued predictable words of condemnation, Australia was among the most vociferous in its support for his defence policy shift. The Japan-Australia relationship has transformed in the seven decades since the end of the second world war. China may be Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner, but few can remember a time when Tokyo and Canberra\u2019s economic and diplomatic interests converged so seamlessly.     Abe and Abbott at the Asean summit in Brunei in October. Photograph: Karlis Salna/AAP    Aside from signing a Free Trade Agreement finalised during Abbott\u2019s visit to Japan in April, the leaders are expected to conclude a defence technology pact that could lead to a key Japanese role in the construction of a fleet of Australian submarines. The defence agreement \u2013 Japan\u2019s first with a country in the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 says much about Abe\u2019s priorities since he became prime minister for a second time in December 2012. He is the most visible of a group of conservative politicians determined to move Japan away from what they regard as a \u201cmasochistic\u201d postwar settlement, under which it depended on the US for its security and observed the spirit, if not the letter, of its postwar commitment to pacifism as it set about building a well-equipped, but strictly defence-oriented, military. Born in 1954 into an affluent family in Nagato, south-western Japan, Abe grew up as Japan made the transformation from defeated outcast into economic powerhouse. He watched as Japan replaced wartime austerity with a dramatic rise in living standards and the militarism of the 1930s with a constitutional commitment never to \u201cuse force as a means of settling international disputes\u201d. In lifting the postwar bans on arms exports \u2013 without which defence equipment deals with Australia would have been impossible \u2013 and on collective self-defence, Abe believes he is simply adding Japan to the club of \u201cnormal\u201d democratic states, able to defend its interests at home and abroad, with force if necessary. Having cited China\u2019s aggressive challenges to the territorial status quo in the East and South China seas, and North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, as the chief threats to stability in the region, Abe and Abbott will find little to disagree on this week. Not even Tokyo\u2019s threat to redesign and resume its whaling program in response to Australia\u2019s recent legal challenge in the Hague is expected to sour the mood. The political synergy and friendship between the leaders will be most evident on Tuesday, when Abe becomes the first Japanese prime minister to address the Australian parliament, where he is expected to explain to the world his historic shift on collective self-defence. In one sense the expected conclusion of a free-trade deal with Australia \u2013 Japan\u2019s second-biggest trading partner \u2013 represents unfinished family business for Abe. His maternal grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was Japan\u2019s prime minister when he signed a commercial pact with his Australian counterpart Robert Menzies in 1957. Kishi, an early critic of his country\u2019s US-authored constitution who was arrested, but never charged, for alleged war crimes, remains Abe\u2019s biggest political influence, more so than his own father, Shintaro Abe, who served as foreign minister in the early 1980s. As he prepares to celebrate the transformation in bilateral ties since the Menzies-Kishi summit, Abe may be tempted to draw parallels with his own political rehabilitation. After becoming Japan\u2019s youngest postwar prime minister in 2006, he limped from office after a year blighted by a stomach condition he now manages with new drugs, a string of ministerial gaffes and a disastrous showing in upper house elections. In the past 18 months, he has presided over improvements in Japan\u2019s export-led economy, prioritised a stronger role for women in the job market and steered an unpopular tax rise through parliament amid less public opposition than many had predicted. He has even reached out to North Korea in the hope of resolving the cold war abductions of at least a dozen Japanese nationals \u2013 a hugely emotive issue in Japan. On the other hand, Abe has said little to suggest he is willing to temper his hawkish views on defence or reconsider his revisionist views of Japan\u2019s wartime conduct in an attempt to drag relations with China and South Korea out of the deep-freeze.

Rebuild by Design&apos;s winners of its competition for flood resilience in the wake of Hurricane Sandy included a flood barrier wrapped around lower Manhattan, called the &quot;Big U&quot;, and a living breakwater. Last week, the scientist who had predicted the devastating impact of an event like Sandy on New York wrote in Next City that, although innovative designs like these would have a positive short-term effect, the city may have to radically change its infrastructure if it wants to truly sustain its future.  What Klaus Jacob suggests is eyebrow-raising: he believes New York needs to be &quot;submersible&quot;, and to raise connections between buildings into a network of &quot;high-lines&quot;. &quot;By 2100,&quot; Jacob writes, &quot;we need to have transformed many city streets into Venice-like canals so that businesses can continue to flourish; that goods, services, people and waste can get in and out unhindered using watertight subways, and where needed, barges, ferries and water taxis.&quot; Car-acas Caracas needs to stop driving. Architect Tere Garcia, writing in This Big City, says the crowded, congested and polluted city is in need of an effective and cheap public transport system, to make trips easier, healthier and more convivial. Although the Venezuelan city is introducing new public rail infrastructure in the form of the Cabletren Bolivariano, this is not yet affordable or extensive enough to start changing the transportation habits of its citizens, Garcia argues. &quot;Although Venezuelan institutions have made a huge effort to implement new ways of transportation and mobilization, the city still needs to raise awareness of the importance of public transport and promote other alternatives.&quot;  In a country that has some of the world&apos;s cheapest petrol, Garcia believes promotoing cycling \u2013 though expanded cycling education, initiatives and activity programmes \u2013 is one short-term solution to reducing the 1 million cars that rumble through Caracas each day. Disaster planning in Tokyo By contrast to Caracas, Tokyo is a city that has largely kicked the driving habit. Instead, most citizens rely on their urban rail network, the most extensive in the world. But what if all those trains suddenly just stopped? In a city with a significant earthquake risk, this is a grim but vital question: almost 4 million people would find themseves stranded.  Tokyo has introduced a law, the Metropolitan Tokyo Ordinance on Measures for Stranded Persons, that contains measures for stockpiling food and resources across the city and creating emergency support stations. The aim is to stop people having to walk home in a post-disaster landscape \u2013 though in times of crisis one imagines it would be difficult to change the natural homing instinct. The lost city Kowloon Walled City was an overcrowded settlement fraught with contention, its disputed governance and ambiguous legal status leading to problems of crime and a reputation as a haven of vice. In 1987, the Hong Kong government decided to demolish the labyrinthine city, which eventually took place in 1993 after lengthy evictions. In this remarkable Wall Street Journal interactive, we are invited into the world of the Walled City to meet the locals, explore the streets, discover its history and watch the myths it has created unfold. From sick cities to slick cities In their new Slicker City section, which explores urban challenges and innovative solutions, Fast Co Design report back on the American Institute of Architects convention, where design professor Thomas Fisher insisted that &quot;we have designed cities to make people ill&quot;. Quoting the statistic that cars are the biggest killer of people under 34, Fisher argues that every time we design a building which can only be reached by car, we are endangering lives. Future urbanism, he says, should fuse health with architecture and design, so we can create cities that are less car-dependent and consequently healthier.

Andrew Carr, research fellow in strategic &amp; defence studies at the Australian National University, and Harry White, strategic analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, offer two perspectives on the strategic implications of our new &quot;special relationship&quot; \u2013 and the consequences for any future conflict with China.  Andrew Carr: because the US &apos;pivot&apos; to Asia never arrived, inter-regional relationships are a positive step     'Australia and Japan can't explicitly say that deterring China is their purpose.' Photograph: AAP    For the last 20 years the US has talked about building better links between its allies, such as Japan and Australia. Today&apos;s speech to the Australian parliament by Shinzo Abe is a big step towards that goal, but credit lies not with Washington&apos;s silver tongue, but fear of China&apos;s iron fist. With Abe&apos;s speech, Australia and Japan have moved a long way towards creating a de facto alliance. Japan is pledging to sell advanced defence technology to Australia \u2014 ideally as the engine for our future submarines \u2014 while opening up its carefully guarded markets. In return, Australia is offering something that can&apos;t be said publicly: Australian support for Japan&apos;s regional power struggle with Beijing. While China builds its economy and military strength at home, Japan under Abe has gone abroad, to seek regional partnerships and pledges of support. This move would have been unthinkable a decade or more ago, given lingering fears that Japan had not sufficiently renounced its second world war imperialism. Yet at the recent Shangri-La dialogue and Asia-Pacific roundtable, held across Southeast Asia, Japanese leaders were welcomed with open arms. It&apos;s not that Asia has entirely forgiven Japan \u2014 especially with revisionist leaders like Abe at the helm. Rather it is China&apos;s aggressiveness over the last few years, combined with the failure of the Obama administration to implement the &quot;pivot&quot;, which has caused a search for new partners and new ways of seeking security.  While Obama used his own speech to the Australian parliament in 2011 to declare America was &quot;all in&quot; when it came to the Asia-Pacific, the reality has been anything but. Obama&apos;s team have been unable to put this claim in practice, while allowing themselves to be distracted by the crises of the day; from the Ukraine and Iraq to the West Bank. With the US president not even bothering to mention the pivot in recent major foreign policy speeches, it is no wonder US allies and partners in Asia are seeking their own bonds of protection. Of course, Australia and Japan can&apos;t explicitly say that deterring China is their purpose, hence today&apos;s focus on issues like trade and cooperation on natural disasters. Abbott is particularly reticent to admit this purpose, because he knows there is no guarantee the Australian public will support it. Despite five years of much more confrontational behaviour by China in the South and East China Seas, a recent Lowy Institute poll showed that Australians don&apos;t see China and Japan in vastly different lights. There is no clear evidence Australians would happily sacrifice not only their lucrative trade with China, but also some of their sons and daughters, to protect Japanese claims to oil and gas reserves in the East China Sea. Hopefully such a conflict will never happen. Given the US&apos;s pivot has failed to deter China, it is for the good of the Asia Pacific that new inter-regional approaches like this are sought. Today&apos;s cooperation between Australia and Japan is just one of a web of agreements and handshakes occurring across Asia. China won&apos;t like it, but isn&apos;t likely to retaliate in the short term. After-all, why cripple their own preparations, built on Australian steel and iron ore? To the casual observer little has changed. The US is still a vital partner in Asia, and China is still an economic opportunity far more than a military threat. But just in case either of those situations changes we&apos;re likely to see more days of regional web building as we did today. Let&apos;s just hope the people of Australia and the wider Asia Pacific are watching closely and know what they&apos;re being signed up for. Harry White: Australian support for Japan makes it harder for Washington to say no to conflict with China     'From Canberra, any increased risk at all of war with China seems like too high a price to pay.' Photograph: AAP    Shinzo Abe heralded the beginning of a new &quot;special relationship&quot; between Japan and Australia in his address to parliament. Now, our partnership is about security as well as economics. Despite not mentioning China, that\u2019s what the security part of this partnership is about \u2013 for Japan at least. That means more risk than benefit for Australia. Things look bleak from Tokyo because of the risks posed by China\u2019s rise, which is why Abe\u2019s government is reinventing Japan\u2019s approach to defence and security. Beijing is growing stronger, and more aggressively pursuing her territorial claims, including a dispute with Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Chinese relationships with Japan and America are becoming more deeply adversarial.  It\u2019s against that backdrop that Japan wants Australia as a security partner. Our economic relationship with Japan has been tremendously important to Australia, and we see the world in the same terms. But partnerships between countries are driven by the pursuit of their interests, not only their values \u2013 otherwise we\u2019d be as close with Denmark as we are with America.  Australia and Japan both want a peaceful and secure Asia that looks like the one we\u2019ve enjoyed for the last several decades. The risk we seek to insure against is the disruption of that order caused by China\u2019s growing power. The new &quot;special relationship&quot; will be good for Australia where it lessens the risks of conflict with Beijing, and will be bad where it increases the chances of us being involved in a war we may have otherwise avoided. Can our security partnership mitigate these risks? Despite talk of international law and norms, it\u2019s hard to see how a security partnership makes us more or less law-abiding. The next idea is that we could deter potential Chinese aggression by lending extra military weight. But it\u2019s fanciful to think that the token forces we could send would have any deterrent effect on a country that has the combined might of America and Japan spooked.  What makes the partnership appealing for Japan is the prospect that in a conflict, Australian support or involvement alongside Japan would make it harder for Washington to say no. It would be harder to abandon two allies than one, and the more robust America\u2019s commitment, the more likely Beijing is to be deterred.  Maybe that\u2019s right, although it seems optimistic to think that America would be prepared to abandon Japan, and so its whole position in Asia, but Australia\u2019s involvement would tip the scales. Set against whatever benefit a security partnership confers on the prospects for peace in Asia, are the increased risks that Australia would find itself in a war with Japan against China. Helping Japan in the event that it found itself in a conflict is the heart of any meaningful security agreement after all. That\u2019s a serious prospect \u2013 otherwise Japan wouldn\u2019t need new security partners.  From Canberra, any increased risk at all of war with China seems like too high a price to pay for a marginal benefit in deterring Beijing. Of course Australia is at no direct risk compared to Japan, so Tokyo takes on no liability in exchange for its marginal benefit. We can hardly blame them for asking, let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t come to rue saying yes."}, {"sentences": ["New York / Tokyo, 25 June 2014: Panasonic Corporation, one of the world&apos;s largest electronics manufacturers, joined the Business Call to Action (BCtA) today with a commitment to improve the quality of life for the people in Africa and Asia by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing greater access to energy."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2014-07-08T12:02:50Z", "title": "Lighting rural communities in Africa and Asia", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/solar-lanterns-rural-communities-reduce-greenhouse-emissions", "article": "New York / Tokyo, 25 June 2014: Panasonic Corporation, one of the world&apos;s largest electronics manufacturers, joined the Business Call to Action (BCtA) today with a commitment to improve the quality of life for the people in Africa and Asia by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing greater access to energy. The company plans to provide one\u00a0million solar lanterns as a clean and safe light source for people living in regions without electricity by the end of 2018 fiscal year. Utilising its expertise in energy solutions, Panasonic has developed a new high-quality and affordable solar lantern with a 3.5-watt solar panel, which provides light for as long as 90\u00a0hours. The Panasonic lantern can also charge cell phones by using a USB port. Launched in Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand in early 2014, these lanterns will soon be available in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Kenya and Malaysia. Panasonic&apos;s commitment to the BCtA is focused on providing low-income communities with greater access to affordable light, which is especially critical at night. Solar light is a valuable tool that allows children to study after dark; its USB cell phone charger also allows people to benefit from a range of mobile services and generate income by charging other people&apos;s phones. By replacing kerosene lamps with its solar lanterns, Panasonic is helping to reduce low-income households&apos; spending on kerosene, which can cost up to $100 per year. The solar lanterns will also contribute to eliminating pulmonary sickness caused by kerosene lamps. For low-income people living in remote areas with no retail stores, Panasonic is establishing its own solar lantern distribution networks in collaboration with local community groups. According to Sahba Sobhani, Acting Programme Manager of BCtA, &quot;Panasonic&apos;s commitment to the BCtA will go a long way to reaching communities in need of solar energy. Especially encouraging is the enhanced access that power can provide in supporting a range of livelihood activities. We are pleased to welcome them to the Business Call to Action.&quot; Replacing kerosene lamps with one\u00a0million Panasonic solar lanterns is estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 30,000 tons between 2014 and 2018. The sale of these one million solar lanterns will bring Panasonic $50 million in revenues. And by introducing its solar lantern as the first Panasonic product to low-income communities, the company plans to enter into emerging markets in Africa and Asia, strengthening product development to improve the lives of people in these regions. &quot;By providing our advanced technologies and products, we believe Panasonic can contribute to the fight against global warming and poverty eradication. Panasonic is greatly honoured to be a member of the BCtA, and we look forward to collaborating with its members and partners,&quot; stated Takashi Toyama, managing director of Panasonic.

TV images showed deserted streets strewn with fallen trees on the main Okinawan island as residents heeded warnings to stay away from the coast and low-lying areas being battered by gusts of up to 155mph (250km/h) , storm surges and waves of up to 14 metres (46ft) high. Hundreds of flights were cancelled and the US military, which has a strong presence on the main island, called off all outdoor exercises. As of early afternoon local time there were reports of a handful of minor injuries, most of them to people who had not stayed inside. Further north, a man was reported missing after being swept overboard from his fishing boat. &quot;When the wind is at its strongest, it&apos;s impossible to stand. You have to hold on to something,&quot; Kei Shima, an Okinawa resident in her 30s, told Reuters. &quot;The lights are fading in and out, like the house is haunted. The rain is getting stronger and falling sideways.&quot; Officials had said that Neoguri could be one of the most powerful storms to hit Japan for decades, although it has since been downgraded from its original super-typhoon status. &quot;There is a risk of unprecedentedly strong winds and torrential rains. Please refrain from non-essential outdoor activities,&quot; said Satoshi Ebihara, of the meteorological agency. The storm is moving slowly and weakening in intensity, but experts warned that its reduced speed could increase the potential for major damage to homes and infrastructure. The worst of the typhoon was not expected to reach the more populated parts of the Okinawa island chain until Tuesday evening, before moving north to Kyushu by Thursday and the main Japanese island of Honshu by the end of the week. Although the typhoon is forecast to lose more of its power as it travels over land, it could create potentially dangerous landslides and flooding. Several typhoons a year strike Japan, but they usually develop later in the summer or in early autumn. The threat of flooding is particularly acute at this time of year, just as Japan emerges from its annual rainy season. In Tokyo, Keiji Furuya, the state minister in charge of disaster management, pleaded with residents to exercise the &quot;utmost caution&quot;. The government is keen to avoid a repeat of the loss of life last October, when a powerful typhoon slammed into Izu Oshima island, killing 35 people. Then, local authorities were criticised for being too slow to take precautions. There are no nuclear power plants on Okinawa, but Kyushu, which is expected to experience violent winds and torrential rain on Thursday, is home to two atomic facilities. There is another on nearby Shikoku island. Nuclear plant operators say they have well-rehearsed measures in place all year round, while the typhoon is expected to have largely blown itself out by the time it reaches the north-east of Japan, where the Fukushima Daiichi plant is located. All of the country&apos;s nuclear reactors remain closed as a result of the triple meltdown in Fukushima just over three years ago. Kadena air base, one of the biggest US military installations in the region, was on its highest level of storm alert, while the Brazilian firm Petrobas said it had suspended operations at its oil refinery in Okinawa. Japan&apos;s meteorological agency said Neoguri would maintain its strength as it moved north, and was expected to brush Tokyo on Friday. &quot;But it will be weaker by then, so that Tokyo can mainly expect a lot of rain, and maybe some gusts of wind,&quot; an agency official said.\u00a0"}, {"sentences": ["Inspired by Hiroshige&apos;s print series The 53 Stations of the Tokaido, which is based upon a journey the artist took in 1832 from Edo (now Tokyo) to Kyoto, Tokaido Road has a text by Nancy Gaffield, based upon her own collection of poems."], "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Musicals", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-08T16:32:38Z", "title": "Tokaido Road review \u2013 everything is distanced, nothing engages", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/08/tokaido-road-review-nicola-lefanu-premiere", "article": "With a baritone protagonist who speaks more than he sings and an actor who mimes more than she speaks, Tokaido Road, Nicola LeFanu&apos;s new stage work, is much closer to music theatre than to opera. Inspired by Hiroshige&apos;s print series The 53 Stations of the Tokaido, which is based upon a journey the artist took in 1832 from Edo (now Tokyo) to Kyoto, Tokaido Road has a text by Nancy Gaffield, based upon her own collection of poems. Tokaido Road was conceived expressly for Okeanos, an ensemble that combines western and Japanese instruments, and the hour-long result does sometimes feel more like an awkward hybrid, contrived for such a lineup, than a piece that has evolved inevitably from the dramatic potential of its source. The central character is Hiroshige himself, both in old age as narrator, remembering his epic journey 25 years earlier, and as the young man Hiro living the experiences of that trip; the two are represented by both the baritone (Jeremy Huw Williams) and the actor/mime (Tomoko Kamura). A soprano (Rafaela Papadakis) and a mezzo (Caryl Hughes) are the women that Hiro encounters en route, Kikuyo and Mariko. But none of them holds the attention. Everything is distanced, nothing engages, and even Kikuyo&apos;s suicide hardly impacts at all. Lefanu&apos;s score is functional and economical, with the Japanese instruments colouring the sound-world quite discreetly, the koto adding brittleness and the sho piquant clusters to the harmony; the word setting is mostly declamatory. The staging, directed by Caroline Clegg and designed by Kimie Nakano, uses video projections of Hiroshige&apos;s prints extensively, though the stylised movements of the singers and the more fluid antics of the mime seem to belong in different worlds. Altogether, there&apos;s the sense that Tokaido Road doesn&apos;t get where it wants to be, musically or dramatically. \u2022 Repeated at Lake District Summer festival (01539 742621) on 6 August.

But innovative brands are reimagining the physical store, turning to magazines and museums for inspiration and creating spaces where the virtual and physical worlds collide. A new wave of thinking about bricks-and-mortar retail has given rise to a surge in brands experimenting with concept stores. Apple and Burberry have been leading the pack when it comes to creating experience-focused retail for many years. But a wider range of brands is starting to experiment with concepts, and no longer just luxury ones. General Electric, for example, is currently working with New York concept store Story as part of an exercise to promote one of its products. Story is built on the concept of treating retail as media, curating its merchandise every month, like a magazine would with content, and getting a brand to sponsor it. This month&apos;s theme is &quot;cool&quot; and the products on sale in the store \u2013 clothes, jewellery and gadgets \u2013 reflect that. GE, which has partnered with invention platform Quirky for the curation, does not take a revenue share from product sales, but is using the store as a platform to promote a smartphone-controlled air conditioning unit. &quot;A product tells a much bigger story than just a transaction and in Story every item has a long-tail narrative attached to it. That is really what we want to do. Not to enhance every transaction and sell more, but to tell the story behind our work through product, commerce and experience,&quot; explains Sam Olstein, global director of innovation at GE. Nestl\u00e9, on the other hand, aims to combine branding with direct-to-customer sales through its KitKat concept store in Japan. The Chocolatory, located in a Tokyo shopping mall, sells exclusive and unique products, such as Sublime Bitter and Special Sakura Green Tea. Stewart Dryburgh, Nestl\u00e9&apos;s global marketing head for KitKat , explains that creating unique products taps into the Japanese custom of buying thoughtful gifts for people, helping KitKat build an emotional connection with the consumer and reinforcing positive sentiment around the brand. The store has attracted a lot of social media attention and requests for versions in other markets. &quot;We did not open the store on a whim, but it is still quite early in evolution and we are doing a lot of testing and learning to understand how best we leverage it in other markets,&quot; says Dryburgh. While e-commerce is rapidly growing, particularly on mobile \u2013 eMarketer forecasts worldwide business-to-consumer e-commerce sales will increase by 20.1% this year to reach $1.5tn \u2013 not all commerce will shift online. The clicks-versus-bricks debate is wearing thin as more retailers embrace an omni-channel retail. And with eBay and Amazon having both experimented with physical retail concepts, and Google also reportedly planning a museum-style concept store in New York, even the most successful digital brands recognise the importance of physical retail. People still love to shop as a social occasion, family day out or even holiday, but there is a crucial distinction between the act of shopping and where a purchase is made, says David Womack, executive creative director at R/GA. &quot;Retail serves a number of complex functions beyond moving merchandise. The retail experience is an incredible part of the consideration process, it is just where they do transactions that will shift,&quot; he says. A concept store that leverages technology effectively can close the loop between digital and physical, overcoming the problem of attributing online marketing to offline sales. &quot;As we are able to have single view of the customer from digital to retail, this will change the nature of the [physical] retail experience. Stores will become more like galleries,&quot; Womack adds. Tesco has been exploring omni-channel retail to power a new kind of shopping experience. In South Korea, Tesco created a touchscreen storefront in a subway, enabling commuters to buy groceries while waiting for their train. &quot;Our focus is on helping our customers shop whenever, however and wherever they chose to,&quot; says Paul Wilkinson, head of technology research at Tesco Labs. &quot;The proliferation of channels, devices and services means that people can shop in a huge variety of ways and they expect a seamlessly connected experience. We are building our business around that,&quot; he says. One of the key challenges retailers face with concept stores is ensuring they add value. They are a big investment and if the technology falters, or the space has no buzz, it could create negative brand perception. Logistics will also prove to be another battlefield. With delivery times speeding up \u2013 Amazon potentially will deploy delivery drones \u2013 bricks-and-mortar retailers will no longer be able to depend on instant gratification to give them the edge over their online competitors. For Rachel Shechtman, founder of Story, the future of retail lies in experience, community, differentiation and mass customisation. &quot;We are barely scratching the surface, and while bricks-and-mortar is often referred to as dying, I think it will only give way to a new frontier with endless and untapped potential, light years beyond looking at sales per square foot,&quot; she says.

With gusts of up to 110mph (180km/h) the typhoon was expected to be one of the worst storms of the year, the national weather agency said.        Several typhoons a year strike Japan, but they usually develop later in the summer or in early autumn.        The typhoon forced half a million people to seek shelter in Okinawa on Tuesday.        Residents were warned to stay away from the coast and low-lying areas, which experienced storm surges and waves up to 14 metres (46ft) high.       Okinawa was left with difficult driving conditions after the storm passed.       And one Instagram user managed to capture the moment his bus flooded.        The storm is moving slowly and weakening in intensity, but experts warned that its reduced speed could increase the potential for major damage to homes and infrastructure.        The threat of flooding is particularly acute at this time of year, as Japan emerges from its annual rainy season.       It could also create potentially dangerous landslides.       In the Okinawan capital of Naha on Tuesday traffic lights went out, trees were split, signboards flew about and a restaurant was destroyed.        Schools were closed, air and sea traffic ground to a halt and nearly 70,000 Okinawan households had no power.       Kyushu, the southern main island next to the biggest island of Honshu where major cities including Tokyo and Osaka are located, experienced heavy rain and strong winds.       Japan&apos;s meteorological agency said Neoguri would maintain its strength as it moved north, and was expected to brush Tokyo on Friday.

Q&A", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/09/typhoon-neoguri-japan", "article": "What does the name Neoguri mean? It means raccoon cat. The name was submitted by the Republic of Korea (South Korea) to the World Meteorological Organization, which oversees the list of storm names in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific. Where has Neoguri hit? Typhoon Neoguri has already hit outlying southern islands of Japan. It passed through the southern Okinawa Island Chains on Tuesday, with sustained wind speeds of 108 miles per hour (175 km/h) and gusts of up to 154 mph, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. How destructive is the storm? Most buildings in Japan are designed to withstand typhoons. Even so, in Okinawa, Neoguri has already claimed two lives. A further 25 have been reported injured, with over 500,000 forced to seek shelter. Around 70,000 homes have been left without power, according to the news agency AFP. Buildings and trees have been brought down, with air and sea traffic brought to a standstill. More destruction is set to follow as the storm bears down on mainland Japan. The country&apos;s weather agency has warned that as much as 300 millimetres (12 inches) of rain will have fallen on Kyushu in just 24 hours by noon on Thursday. What is a typhoon? A typhoon is a type of large tropical storm or cyclone that has a circular or spiral system of violent winds, typically hundreds of kilometres across. The winds spiral around a region of low atmospheric pressure known as the &quot;eye&quot;. What&apos;s the difference between a typhoon, cyclone and hurricane? Both typhoons and hurricanes are powerful tropical cyclones, - storms with very high sustained wind speeds. The only difference between them is their location: typhoons are formed in the western Pacific Ocean, while hurricanes form in the Atlantic or eastern Pacific Ocean. Is Neoguri a typhoon or a super-typhoon? This depends on the wind speed of the storm. A typhoon is any cyclone with a sustained wind speed greater than 74 km/h. Lower wind speeds are classed as topical storms. The Japan Meteorological Agency unofficially divides typhoons into the following categories: \u2022 A typhoon has wind speeds of 119 km/h to 156 km/h \u2022 A strong typhoon has wind speeds of 157 km/h to 193 km/h \u2022 A violent typhoon has wind speeds of 194 km/h to 239 km/h \u2022 A super typhoon has wind speeds greater than 240 km/h How powerful is it? Initially classed as a super-typhoon, Neoguri has been downgraded to a strong typhoon. As such it can devastate any region it hits directly or indirectly, flattening buildings and forming high waves off coastlines. Where will it hit next? Typhoon Neoguri is moving towards mainland Japan. The combination of high pressure to the northeast and a trough of low pressure to the northwest will steer Neoguri in a curve that will take it over or near much of Japan. As Neoguri passes over colder water south of the mainland, the storm will weaken, but will still impact the southern island of Kyushu with gusts of up to 110 mph (180 km/h), the national weather agency said. Nagasaki may also be severely hit, after which Neoguri should retain minimal typhoon strength (winds of 74 mph) into central Japan and is expected to reach the Tokyo area by Friday. How long is it to going to last? It&apos;s very difficult to predict when the storm will dissipate. There are a great many factors that will contribute to its longevity and strength, such as surface sea temperature and when it hits land. Most likely, it will be much weakened by the time it has passed over Japan and turn into a large tropical storm. Are typhoons common in the region and will there be more? Yes and yes. Last year there were 30 typhoons in the western Pacific Ocean region. Neoguri is only the ninth this year, making it probable that there will be many more to come in the next few months. Typically about seven or eight pass over Okinawa Prefecture each year, and about three hit the Japanese main islands. Most typhoons dissipate over the Pacific Ocean, causing little disruption. How big is Neoguri compared to others? Japan is no stranger to typhoons, but Neoguri is proving to be a stronger storm than it has experienced in recent years. The Japanese weather agency said Neoguri could be one of the strongest to approach Japan in decades, and issued its highest warnings for violent winds, high waves and heavy rain. However, the wind speeds are not as severe as those experienced by the US under Hurricane Katrina, which hit land with wind speeds of 200 km/h. Could climate change have played a role in its formation? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN body that recently reviewed scientific evidence on the impacts of climate change, concluded: &quot;Tropical cyclone frequency is likely to decrease or remain unchanged over the 21st century, while intensity (ie maximum wind speed and rainfall rates) is likely to increase.&quot; However, the IPCC said it was harder to make region-specific projections. Extreme cyclones in Asia since 1970 have claimed more than half a million lives.

I contributed yesterday's piece on Helsinki's plan to rethink public transit, and I too am looking forward to digging in to this knot of issues.             Guardian contributor     adamgreenfield    11 July 2014 12:09pm  I should say a bit about who I am so folks have some context. Broadly speaking I come from a technological perspective \u2014 my first book, &quot;Everyware,&quot; was on the colonization of everyday life by information processing, and I've continued to write about these issues in &quot;Urban Computing and its Discontents&quot; and &quot;Against the smart city.&quot; But I've also worked in the sector, as among other things Nokia's head of design direction for service and user-interface design, and I like to think my skepticism regarding technological solutionism is intimately informed by this experience. In general, I strongly believe in pedestrianizing cities wherever possible, but I'm not an absolutist on the question \u2014 and despite my skepticism, I think networked information technologies will have a significant role to play in developing new, cleaner, safer and more *urban* forms of urban mobility.             Guardian contributor     DavidSimGehl    11 July 2014 12:05pm  Hello my name is David Sim.I am Creative Director at Gehl Architects, based in Copenhagen. I suppose I was asked to participate because Gehl Architects focus on the pedestrian experience \u2013 which has been \u2013 and still is \u2013 often forgotten in the planning process.  I think the question posed by our friends at the Guardian is of course a bit of a provocation \u2013 I mean car-free is a bit extreme. But if the question helps us talk about this \u2026 let\u2019s get going!             Guardian contributor     DavidSimGehl    11 July 2014 12:08pm  Saying that I don't own a car. I grew up driving everywhere and where the car was the epicentre of family life but moving to Scandinavia has changed that. It's not about not having a car - though that does save me a huge amount of money which I can spend on other stuff.It's about having great alternatives.It's about having walkable and bike-able streets and an integrated transportation system.             Guardian contributor     PaulWatters    11 July 2014 12:07pm  Hi Paul from the AA here. We don't think cars should be banned form cities - but perhaps they can become redundant in cities as seems to be happening organically.      LEDLAMP comments:  Anyone who has walked along the Marylebone road would agree that as long as motor vehicles are powered by the internal combustion engine we cannot improve the quality of life in big cities like London. They are noisy and dangerous to other street users. They produce soot particulates, noxious gases and greenhouse gases. I often go to London but eschew the tube and motorised traffic. Instead, I mostly walk with the aid of a small London A-Z, taking all the side roads and walking through parks. Walking is quick and easy and amazingly interesting, discovering out of the way restaurants and pubs and quietly observing the architecture. Away from the main roads the air is much fresher and it is quiet. Yet there is still so much going on. Think of the walk along the South Bank. The other day, I was in Carleton House Terrace at the Royal Society. I left and walked down the Mall, across Trafalgar Square which is a beautiful spot but thoroughly ruined by the traffic. It is somewhat improved by the pedestrianised section in front of the National Gallery, however, thanks to Ken Livingstone. I walked on up the Strand and left into the Aldwych, Kingsway, Southampton Row and right into Guildford Street past Great Ormond Street Hospital. There you find yourself in quiet Corams Field and Brunswick Square Gardens. When you finally emerge on the Euston Road, opposite St Pancras, you realise just how unpleasant cars and lorries have made our lives. I believe London and all big cities can never be great places to live, work or play until we replace this outdated mode of transport. We now have plenty of alternatives such as electric vehicles but, best of all, I love the experience of walking in the city and only then, as Will Self often remarks, can you properly experience it. As Lewis Mumford once said, \u2018Restore human legs as a means of travel. Pedestrians rely on food for fuel and need no special parking facilities.\u2019          Guardian contributor     patricialondon    11 July 2014 12:00pm  Sounds great. I ran the organisation that initiated what became 'Legible London' - the blue 'wayfinding' signs and finger posts. Our vision was to 'give people the confidence to get lost safe in the knowledge you can be found again'. At the time London had no consistent mapping or signs so visitors and (some) Londoners stuck to the main streets - which are not so great because of the car dominance. In fact, it was also a safety issue as some places were so overcrowded pick pockets had a field day.             Guardian contributor     adamgreenfield    11 July 2014 12:05pm  I tend to agree fairly strongly, but would add that as far as I'm concerned, the problem isn't even simply the internal combustion engine. You could replace every vehicle on the road with a clean, near-silent electric equivalent and many of the issues presented by the car would still remain. For example, the appalling rate of injuries and fatalities every society in the world is apparently content to absorb as the cost of automotive freedom; for example, the ways in which (as you've pointed out) high-speed vehicular traffic makes public space inimical to the pedestrian; for example, the degree to which traveling by car deprives the rider of the sense of the city. These are all design issues, design challenges, and I believe that they can and must be addressed in the development of new modes of personal transportation. The car, particularly the privately-owned car, strikes me as simply a hundred-year plateau in the evolution of human mobility.      Chris Michael asks:  Hi David, to build on your idea of the car as epicentre of family life \u2013 isn&apos;t ferrying the kids around on public transit impractical? I don&apos;t know many families who don&apos;t eventually cave and buy a gas-guzzler. Walkable and bikable doesn&apos;t work if you&apos;ve got three kids under 5. What&apos;s the solution?          Guardian contributor     DavidSimGehl    11 July 2014 12:18pm  OK family life - a good point.Many families here, do thrive without a car. The combination of cargo-style bikes, pram and family friendly public transport and generous family-orientated ticketing can help. A recent study here showed that children who cycle or walk to school perform better academically than those driven. The active children arrive at school alert while the driven children are passive.                 MariaAM    11 July 2014 12:26pm  We've struggled with the decision to keep our car. We don't really need it most days (cycle/walk/bus to work and nursery with our son). When we do need a car for longer journeys, the issue is a safe car seat. We currently use a rear-facing seat (good to 4 years old) that can't be easily lugged around, which makes using a car share difficult (our nearest one is several blocks away), and we refuse to compromise our child's safety by using a forward facing rental car seat of unknown history and use. The problem would only be worse if we had more than one child.      We ask:  We had two pieces this week from Zoe Williams and Ken Livingstone following the news that London&apos;s Oxford Street is the most polluted place on earth. The diesel engines of buses have been blamed - so are banning cars not the answer? Should we strive instead for electric vehicles?          Guardian contributor     adamgreenfield    11 July 2014 12:15pm  As I've mentioned above, I tend to think that the problems with cars extend beyond the internal combustion engine. We can start with the thought that replacing every such engine with a clean, quiet electric drivetrain would simply displace the pollution elsewhere, until and unless all power is generated via nonpolluting, renewable means...                 Rochdalelass    11 July 2014 12:23pm  Yes, definitely. Not everyone is young and or fit enough to walk distances especially pushing their way through crowds.It's always those who are who thinks that everyone should run, cycle or use public transport. Better to go to the real problem and sort that out, pollution caused by the combustible engine. We need to move on to a new technology.                 hooopla    11 July 2014 12:32pm  Pollution isn't the only problem from traffic. Cars have come to dominate our environments: It is hard to find anywhere away from background traffic noise. Streets are fenced off to stop pedestrians encroaching on car space. Parked cars litter empty space. And yes, there is pollution. Town centres are dying because local councils want so much income from parking fees that shoppers stay away.  Most people don't have a car. That's a fact. A sizeable minority of people don't have access to use someone else's car. We need to recognise that this problem is caused by a minority, not &quot;everyone&quot; We need to find transport solutions so inviting, enjoyable, affordable and well-planned that people will not choose to use cars. The best way to do that will vary, but I suspect that mostly it is a matter of reclaiming public transport from the elderly, the smelly and the poor, making it the most attractive option for those who can choose. But getting the pricing right will help. Where I live there is no bus to the nearest town. The bus fare to the next nearest town is \u00a32 each way. It costs me just 40p in fuel to go in my car instead. Where is the sense in that?                 Captainstegs    11 July 2014 12:52pm  Switching to a new technology, e.g. replacing combustion engines with electric motors, won't resolve the congestion though and the elderly and infirm who can't afford motor vehicles will still need to push their way through crowds.By banning most motor vehicles from some/all city roads the space can be opened up to widen pavements, better for mobility scooters and to ease the crowds, and segregated cycle lanes can be installed, safer for cyclists of all ages and abilities. Meanwhile those with disability badges could still be allowed access for their vehicles. Access no longer choked up by all the other millions of vehicles swarming in and out of the cities. A city that restricts motor vehicles would be easier to navigate by people of all ages and abilities.      debs515 asks:  I love the idea of &apos;making the car redundant&apos;- but the reality is is that lots of us need some form of powered transport - becuase of heavy bags, kids, health/disability issues etc. I wish people who make these lovely statements would consider those of us for whom walking/cycling is actually pretty difficult.          Guardian contributor     adamgreenfield    11 July 2014 12:25pm  I wouldn't assume that they haven't! : . ) I myself have terrible knees \u2014 walking too far, as much as I love it, is acutely painful for me, and sometime I have trouble even stepping down from a curb (or kerb, I guess). So while of course I can't speak for anyone else, I can tell you that anything I design fully accounts for the needs of people with limited mobility. I believe the city is for everyone.             Guardian contributor     patricialondon    11 July 2014 12:32pm  re cars becoming redundant; we currently need vehicles to make our economy work. It is possible to manage demand and encourage change, such as The Crown Estate's consolidated freight system in Regent Street, designed to reduce the number of delivery vehicles.  Personally, I describe myself as a cycling, walking, taxi taking, bus hopping, tube regular, train using, car driver. The beauty of most big cities is about the level of choice. I have changed my habits so dramatically over the past decade, but it is very convenient (and time efficient) to aggregate my shopping, dry cleaning, garden centre trips in one swoop and in a car. So systems that make the choice easy will win out.  Living as I do in central London, it has been fascinating to watch the switch, in part hastened by congestion charging. My bus journey is often shared with a window cleaner on his way with bucket, etc, as well as a plasterer and a possie of parents taking kids to school. TfL has now got to manage that complexity of use, however. which is another story!      thorndoc comments:  I really do not understand why people drive in city centres. I live in London and I can see nothing but relentless misery for motorists. Yet the huge cost of motoring and snail&apos;s pace speed they get around at still doesn&apos;t seem to put people off. I think the only thing that will make people review their method of travel in city centres is some sort of extra charge or tax. The only thing people seem to respond to is a shock in the wallet!          Guardian contributor     PaulWatters    11 July 2014 12:33pm  The London charge has done nothing for congestion as when you look at traffic in the centre it is everything but the private car there (almost). Also the revenue raised has been helpful but who's to know an equivalent sum was not then sliced from the GLA grant to TFL.              Guardian staff     Chrismichael    11 July 2014 12:45pm    The London charge has done nothing for congestion   But surely what the congestion charge HAS done has allowed much more room for buses, taxis and other shared vehicles, thus allowing far more people to use the city centre?      Mikeyc74 says:  I live in Bath. Its a pretty compact city surrounded by seven hills. However much of the city centre is full of cars - whether moving or parked. It was a city planned for an age before cars and cars have almost totally taken the city over. It would be great to get some of the cars out of the city, perhaps have more one way streets and look at other ways of getting people into the city and out again. One of my friends has suggested the use of cable cars (a la Rio style) which could work nicely with the topography of the place. There is a danger of congestion permanently having a negative impact on a city which is very much on the human scale and should be for people to wander and enjoy the green spaces, independent shops and wonderful architecture. The local authority is trying to people first but always comes up against so much resistence and has to do stuff by stealth. How do we get the balance right so that we avoid a scenario where people play second fiddle to traffic?          Guardian contributor     patricialondon    11 July 2014 12:39pm  Bath is interesting as they are really trying with several good initiatives. But it is in Bath where a friend pointed out that her mobility impaired father can't easily visit the new pedestrian shopping area, since the drop off point is so far away from the main shops he has expended his energy before he gets to them.  So yet again, it comes back to balance. For me, this is a stark reminder about empathetic planning in cities - it's easy to herald the cycling car free city, but we have different needs at different stages of our lives.                 Mikeyc74    11 July 2014 1:07pm  Exactly. We need to cater for all users so that you have access for all. There is a need for a big vision that helps the people of the city move around easily and effectively without too much of a detrimental impact on the quality of life in the city.      shelltune suggests:  Build huge park and ride car parks outside the city centre with regular buses (or better yet monorails, segregated from the remaining main traffic flow) into the centre, and you have a deal              Jazzactivist    11 July 2014 12:26pm  But what about the people who live in the areas where you want to build park and ride facilities? Most people choose to live outside cities and large towns because it is less congested and built on! Building big park and ride facilities here would just shift the pollution, noise and congestion onto those people.                 somewhatsceptical    11 July 2014 12:33pm  Oxford is a great example of a city that seems to have done huge amounts along those lines... and, as reported above, is often terribly gridlocked.      Chris Michael asks:  Just on a slightly different note, what about the cultural value of a car? As a rite of passage, as a beautiful aesthetic object, as the centrepiece of community (as with Harley-Davidson riders)? Do we want to kill the love of cars?          Guardian contributor     PaulWatters    11 July 2014 12:30pm  Agree we should not loose our love of cars but perhaps this is getting harder in cities where they cannot be fully enjoyed or used to potential.Finding a place to keep one and keep it safe is difficult.             Guardian contributor     adamgreenfield    11 July 2014 12:31pm  So, nobody loves cars more than I \u2014 nobody. The sensuality of an E-type, the elegance of a Citroen DS, the raw power of a GTO or a '69 Charger: these are all powerful emotional touchstones for me. But I no longer believe that my *desire* for these things can be reconciled with my other prerogatives. And I mean that personally, before we even start talking about collective or social impacts. *I* don't want to bear the burden, the expense or hassle of ownership, and licensure, and regulation, and insurance, and parking (ad infinitum). Other options are just pragmatically better and more satisfying, on every axis. And you know what? It turns out that I *love* getting around on the bus. London's bus service is fantastic! I only very rarely find myself more than 100m from a bus stop, the buses come with pleasing regularity, and it's fantastic to watch the city go by from the upper deck. As someone who's lived and gotten around in New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Seoul, Tokyo and Helsinki, I've gotta tell you, this is a great accomplishment. Despite all my deep love for the car, it just can't hold a candle to the freedom and other benefits I enjoy as a rider and satisfied TfL customer.                 Jazzactivist    11 July 2014 12:34pm  It's not just the aesthetics of a car, but it is also culturally important in that it provides a private space that is like an extension of your home. Inside a car you can have familiar things around you, listen to music or the radio or books without having to wear earpieces, or can just enjoy the silence etc. For many people, being stuck alone in a car in traffic is the only time they get some (enforced) peaceful personal time! A car is like a protective bubble, whereas sharing the space on public transport with lots of other people you don't know isn't.             Guardian contributor     adamgreenfield    11 July 2014 12:48pm  Consider, though, that we increasingly live in such &quot;epistemic bubbles,&quot; where nothing challenges us in our complacency, where we're surrounded only and ever by things we're already comfortable with. I happen to believe \u2014 and I understand that not everyone will share this viewpoint\u00a0\u2014 that this isn't what cities are for. Within reason, I think we ought to be exposed to things which are not quite as we would have them. It's the only way we ever learn to negotiate the use of shared spaces with people who are different from us, and I think it makes us better citizens, better neighbors, better human beings. If you'll forgive me, though, a &quot;private space that is like an extension of your home...[where] you can have familiar things around you&quot; just doesn't do that for us, and I do believe it's undermining our collective ability to live with one another in public.      ajchm comments:  Until public transport is cheap, frequent, reliable and goes where you want to go it is pointless even debating the future of the car in this way. I need to get a present today, I could take the bus for \u00a34.50 return or I can drive and pay \u00a31.40 to park for an hour, \u00a32.50 for two hours - no contest really. Then there&apos;s the fact the buses stop at 10.30pm, don&apos;t start til 9.30 on sundays and are only every half an hour day / hour in eves and weekends. Now the kids are off the economics of driving are even more stacked in the car&apos;s favour as unlike in London, it \u00a32 each way for a child over 5 and under 16, adults fare after that. Oh and the car doesn&apos;t mean taking two buses and travel 10 miles to get to the shopping centre 4 miles away!              thorndoc    11 July 2014 12:34pm  You have forgotten the cost of fuel, car depreciation, vehicle excise duty, insurance, MOT, wear and tear, repairs and servicing into the calculation of your cost of a car journey. To make real comparisons the total cost of running a car needs to be taken into account.Not to mention the cost of the stress of sitting in traffic jams on your health!      Here are some more of your comments that added to the debate:             FrancesZaida    11 July 2014 12:37pm  I don't know about getting rid of cars altogether, but I think that shared space can work really well. I'm in Kyoto and (certainly off the main roads) cars, people on scooters, pedestrians, and cyclists all share the same space. It seems to work well - cars don't go fast and parents can carry their children around on their bikes. Using multiple forms of transportation on the same road just doesn't seem to be a problem.                 Michael Chilcott    11 July 2014 12:36pm  It's very easy to sit and say 'ban cars', and it's a view that I have some sympathy with. I live in Oxford UK and it's often snarled up with traffic.  However, so often the people who say 'ban cars' are talking from the privileged position of being able-bodied, in good health and so on. A move to ban cars in city centres would have to take into account those who don't have the luxury of full health and mobility. We need to be careful about talk that excludes the disabled, for whom a car ban would be a nightmare even in a city as small as Oxford.                 Themardler    11 July 2014 12:32pm  Well I only know a few cities intimately and they are small cities.And I rarely drive in them. And if I lived and worked in one of them day to day life without a car would be easy- until I wanted to go somewhere just a few hundred yards off the bus routes ( yes I can cycle but not all olds and people with kids can) or visit places outside of the city. Similarly it would be a real pain if I could not drive from my home to visit friends who live in the city-finding somewhere to park on the edge of a city on a bus route when buses are running-not easy. Car less cities sound a fine idea for the young or childless whose lives are completely within a city.Not so great to deprive city dwellers of the right to own a car and use it to get out of the city nor for their visitors. Unless every major route has 24 hour car hire establishments I can't see how city dwellers could be expected to do it.                 Arlene Decker    11 July 2014 1:03pm  Electric car sharing schemes like the Blue-car scheme in Paris, which is going to be rolled out in London soon, I think is a great idea to help reduce emissions and encourage people to think about cars differently. My other thoughts on making London more pedestrian friendly and car free is this: Ban private vehicles from the centre, maybe up to zone 2/3 (maybe more). Salary the taxi drivers and drop taxi fares so they are affordable to more people for necessary journeys . Service vehicles could be allowed in to the no car zone providing they pay for a permit which allows them to enter. All the while improving the public transport system to be more complete with better east/west links (particularly in south London!). It would be a big change but would still allow for the iconic black cab to have a place in public London life. Futhermore I would add that if London is serious about being car free, it is going to have to drop the prices of travelling on public transport.                 FLeghorn    11 July 2014 12:50pm  I live in Bristol, have run a company here for 30 years, brought up 3 kids and have never bothered to learn to drive. I cycle, walk and taxi - (buses are too badly run in Bristol to bother with! )Most people still react with a degree of disbelief that you can live happily in a (hilly) city without a car, and I stress that its not a statement, more the fact that cars mean nothing to me and frankly at 53 I can't be bothered to start learning now!Of our staff of approx 40, about 60% cycle or walk to work - thats something I'm happy about.I'm happy to support a gentle and pragmatic reduction of car access in our cities, but it has to be linked with acceptable, visible alternatives - what I can't support is political point scoring, ego and posturing (and boy, do we have that in Bristol) too many schemes are half baked and not linked to city wide regeneration, isolated cycleworks create a false sense of security and we really need to move away from the 'paint on the road' mentality and implement physical segregated infrastructure.                 BigBear2    11 July 2014 12:51pm  I'm all in favour of getting cars out if cities and it works in places like Norwich which has one of the largest pedestrianised areas in the UK, and they started earlier. It is possible for a family with children to manage without a car, my daughter her husband and two children live there and do very well without one. I would like to move further into Manchester and rely on its excellent public transport. What we have to do is reduce the ownership of cars as well as restricting where they can go. Most cars stand idle most of the time. Car clubs work very well and should be encouraged everywhere. Or, cars available to rent more casually like bikes. The presence of heavy traffic in cities makes them unpleasant for everyone, including the drivers. The nature of London's road system makes this worse as you are forced to walk by traffic so much.                 Pfutsch    11 July 2014 12:46pm  Allowing things to take their course is not a viable strategy: As we have seen in London, Beijing, Mexico City or Rome, a city can be choking on fumes and gridlocked, but people will still sit in their cars rather than take a bus or a train. Considering the almost universal concern about passive smoking, I can't understand how car pollution is deemed acceptable given that it affects children, old people and non-drivers indiscriminately. Let's take a bold step: ban all private cars in towns except those powered 100% by electricity!      And some final thoughts:         Guardian contributor     patricialondon    11 July 2014 1:07pm  We have to plan our cities very carefully to get balance and go back regularly to ensure what we created still works.             Guardian contributor     PaulWatters    11 July 2014 12:54pm  It is clear from the debate that there are mixed views perhaps because we are in fact all road users and use a multitude of modes if we can - choosing the best to suit our needs at the time. We need to make this choice easier and more seamless.             Guardian contributor     PaulWatters    11 July 2014 1:04pm  I don't think we need to ban cars from cities as they are already being replaced by other transport choices. Cars must continue to be 'allowed' for those who need the mobility or through choice. As we've heard its no fun owning a car in a city - there is a price!

Africa and Asia &quot;will face numerous challenges in meeting the needs of their growing urban populations, including for housing, infrastructure, transportation, energy and employment, as well as for basic services such as education and healthcare&quot;, it adds. Future development targets should focus on creating inclusive cities with adequate infrastructure and services for all residents, said John Wilmoth, director of the UN&apos;s population division. &quot;Managing urban areas has become one of the most important development challenges of the 21st century,&quot; he said. &quot;Our success or failure in building sustainable cities will be a major factor in the success of the post-2015 UN development agenda.&quot; The report says rapid urbanisation will bring opportunities for governments to improve access to important services. &quot;Providing public transportation, as well as housing, electricity, water and sanitation for a densely settled population is typically cheaper and less environmentally damaging than providing a similar level of services to a predominantly rural household,&quot; it says.      Africa is projected to experience a 16% rise in its urban population by 2050 \u2013 making it the most rapidly urbanising region on the planet \u2013 as the number of people living in its cities soars to 56%. The report predicts there will be more than 40 megacities worldwide by 2050,each with a population of at least 10 million.

The UN projects that rural populations will increase in only a third of countries between 2014 and 2050, as states with large rural communities will take longer to urbanise. &quot;In general, the pace of urbanisation tends to slow down as a population becomes more urbanised,&quot; the report says. The UN cautions that sustainable urbanisation requires cities to generate better income and employment opportunities, and &quot;expand the necessary infrastructure for water and sanitation, energy, transportation, information and communications; ensure equal access to services; reduce the number of people living in slums; and preserve the natural assets within the city and surrounding areas&quot;. Urbanisation has historically taken place in wealthy countries, but such expansion is now happening most rapidly in upper-middle-income countries, where gross national income per capita is between $1,046 and $4,125.

He won a gold medal at an international sporting event. \u201cNigeria Creates World Sensation,\u201d ran the headline in the West African Pilot after Ifeajuna\u2019s record-breaking victory in the high jump at the 1954 Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver. He was the pride not just of Nigeria but of a whole continent. An editorial asked: \u201cWho among our people did not weep for sheer joy when Nigeria came uppermost, beating all whites and blacks together?\u201d In the words of a former schoolmate, Ifeajuna had leaped \u201cto the very pinnacle of Nigerian sporting achievement\u201d. His nine track and field team-mates won another six silver and bronze medals, prompting a special correspondent to write \u201cRejoice with me, oh ye sports lovers of Nigeria, for the remarkable achievements of our boys\u201d. Ifeajuna, feted wherever he went, would soon see his picture on the front of school exercise books. He was a great national hero who would remain Nigeria\u2019s only gold medallist, in Commonwealth or Olympic sport, until 1966. The next time Ifeajuna appeared before a crowd of thousands he was bare-chested and tied to a stake, facing execution before a seething mob. He had co-led a military coup in January 1966 in which, according to an official but disputed police report, he shot and killed Nigeria\u2019s first prime minister. The coup failed but Ifeajuna escaped to safety in Ghana, dressed as a woman and was driven to freedom by a famous poet. Twenty months later, he was back, fighting for the persecuted Igbo people of eastern Nigeria in a brutal civil war that broke out as a consequence of the coup. Ifeajuna and three fellow officers were accused by their own leader, General Emeka Ojukwu, of plotting against him and the breakaway Republic of Biafra. They denied charges of treason: they were trying to save lives and their country, they said, by negotiating an early ceasefire with the federal government and reuniting Nigeria. They failed, they died and, in the next two and a half years, so did more than a million Igbos. The day of the execution was 25 September, 1967, and the time 1.30pm. There was a very short gap between trial and execution, not least because federal troops were closing in on Enugu, the Biafran capital, giving rise to fears that the \u201cguilty four\u201d might be rescued. As the execution approached, the four men \u2013 Ifeajuna, Victor Banjo, Phillip Alale and Sam Agbam \u2013 were tied to stakes. Ifeajuna, with his head on his chest as though he was already dead, kept mumbling that his death would not stop what he had feared most, that federal troops would enter Enugu, and the only way to stop this was for those about to kill him to ask for a ceasefire. A body of soldiers drew up with their automatic rifles at the ready. On the order of their officer, they levelled their guns at the bared chests of the four men. As a hysterical mass behind the firing squad shouted: \u201cShoot them! Shoot them!\u201d a grim-looking officer gave the command: \u201cFire!\u201d The deafening volley was followed by lolling heads. Ifeajuna slumped. Nigeria\u2019s great sporting hero died a villain\u2019s death. But he had been right. By 4pm two and a half hours after the executions, the gunners of the federal troops had started to hit their targets in Enugu with great accuracy. The Biafrans began to flee and the city fell a few days later. Of all the many hundreds of gold medallists at the Empire and Commonwealth Games since 1930 none left such a mark on history, led such a remarkable life or suffered such a shocking death as Ifeajuna. His co-plotter in the 1966 coup, Chukwuma Nzeogwu, was buried with full military honours and had a statue erected in his memory in his home town. But for Ifeajuna, the hateful verdict of that seething mob carried weight down the years. His name was reviled, his sporting glory all but written out of Nigeria\u2019s history. His name is absent from the website of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria, appearing neither in the history of the Federation nor in any other section. There is no easy road to redemption for the gold medallist who inadvertently started a war and was shot for trying to stop it. Nigeria\u2019s first foray into overseas sport was in 1948, when they sent athletes to London to compete in the Amateur Athletic Association Championships, and to watch the Olympic Games before a planned first entry in the next Olympiad. In 1950 there was cause to celebrate when the high jumper, Josiah Majekodunmi, won a silver medal at the Auckland Commonwealth Games. He also fared best of Nigeria\u2019s Olympic pathfinders, the nine-man team who competed at Helsinki in 1952. Majekodunmi was ninth, with two of his team-mates also in the top 20. Nigerians clearly excelled at the high jump. With three men having competed in that 1952 Olympic final, the Nigeria selectors had plenty of names to consider for the Commonwealth Games high jump in Vancouver two years later. Ifeajuna, aged 20, was not a contender until he surprised everybody at the national championships in late April, less than two months before the team were due to depart. His jump of 6ft 5.5in, the best of the season, took him straight in alongside Nafiu Osagie, one of the 1952 Olympians, and he was selected. The high jump was on day one of competition in Vancouver and Ifeajuna wore only one shoe, on his left foot. One correspondent wrote: \u201cThe Nigerian made his cat-like approach from the left-hand side. In his take-off stride his leading leg was flexed to an angle quite beyond anything ever seen but he retrieved position with a fantastic spring and soared upwards as if plucked by some external agency.\u201d Ifeajuna brushed the bar at 6ft 7in but it stayed on; he then cleared 6ft 8in to set a Games and British Empire record, and to become the first man ever to jump 13.5in more than his own height. This first gold for black Africa was a world-class performance. His 6ft 8in \u2013 just over 2.03m \u2013 would have been good enough for a silver medal at the Helsinki Olympics two years earlier. The team arrived back home on 8 September. That afternoon they were driven on an open-backed lorry through the streets of Lagos, with the police band on board, to a civic reception at the racecourse. The flags and bunting were out in abundance, as were the crowds in the middle and, for those who could afford tickets, the grandstand. There was a celebration dance at 9pm. Ifeajuna told reporters he had been so tired, having spent nearly four hours in competition, that: \u201cAt the time I attempted the record jump I did not think I had enough strength to achieve the success which was mine. I was very happy when I went over the bar on my second attempt.\u201d After a couple of weeks at home Ifeajuna was off to university on the other side of the country at Ibadan. His sporting career was already over, apart from rare appearances in inter-varsity matches. He met his future wife, Rose, in 1955. They married in 1959 and had two sons. After graduating in zoology he taught for a while before joining the army in 1960 and was trained in England, at Aldershot. Ifeajuna had first shown an interest in the military in 1956 when, during a summer holiday in Abeokuta, he had visited the local barracks with a friend who later became one of the most important figures in the Commonwealth. Chief Emeka Anyaoku joined the Commonwealth Secretariat in 1966, the year of Ifeajuna\u2019s coup attempt. While his good friend escaped, returned, fought in the war and died in front of the firing squad, Anyaoku moved to London, where he rose to the highest office in the Commonwealth, secretary-general, in 1990. For four years at university he lived in a room next door to Ifeajuna, who became a close friend. Why did the record-breaking champion stop competing? \u201cFrom October, 1954, when he enrolled at Ibadan, he never trained,\u201d said Anyaoku, nearly 60 years later. \u201cHe never had a coach \u2013 only his games master at grammar school \u2013 and there were no facilities at the university. He simply stopped. He seemed content with celebrating his gold medal. I don\u2019t think the Olympics ever tempted him. I used to tease him that he was the most natural hero in sport. He did no special training. He was so gifted, he just did it all himself. Jumping barefoot, or with one shoe, was not unusual where we came from.\u201d Another hugely influential voice from Nigerian history pointed out that Ifeajuna, in his days as a student, had \u201ca fairly good record of rebellion\u201d. Olusegun Obasanjo served as head of a military regime and as an elected president. He recalled Ifeajuna\u2019s role in a protest that led to the closure of his grammar school in Onitsha for a term in 1951, when he was 16. Three years after winning gold, while at university, Ifeajuna made a rousing speech before leading several hundred students in protest against poor food and conditions. The former president also held a manuscript written by Ifeajuna in the aftermath of the coup but never published. It stated: \u201cIt was unity we wanted, not rebellion. We had watched our leaders rape our country. The country was so diseased that bold reforms were badly needed to settle social, moral, economic and political questions. We fully realised that to be caught planning, let alone acting, on our lines, was high treason. And the penalty for high treason is death.\u201d In 1964 the Lagos boxer Omo Oloja won a light-middleweight bronze in Tokyo, thereby becoming Nigeria\u2019s first Olympic medallist. It was a rare moment of celebration in a grim year that featured a general strike and a rigged election. Another election the following year was, said the BBC and Reuters correspondent Frederick Forsyth, seriously rigged \u2013 \u201celectoral officers disappeared, ballot papers vanished from police custody, candidates were detained, polling agents were murdered\u201d. Two opposing sides both claimed victory, leading to a complete breakdown of law and order. \u201cRioting, murder, looting, arson and mayhem were rife,\u201d said Forsyth. The prime minister, Tafawa Balewa, refused to declare a state of emergency. There was corruption in the army, too, with favouritism for northern recruits. A group of officers began to talk about a coup after they were told by their brigadier that they would be required to pledge allegiance to the prime minister, from the north, rather than the country\u2019s first president, an Igbo. Ifeajuna\u2019s group feared a jihad against the mainly Christian south, led by the north\u2019s Muslim figurehead, the Sardauna of Sokoto. The coup, codenamed Leopard, was planned in secret meetings. Major Ifeajuna led a small group in Lagos, whose main targets were the prime minister, the army\u2019s commander-in-chief, and a brigadier, who was Ifeajuna\u2019s first victim. According to the official police report, part of which has never been made public, Ifeajuna and a few of his men broke into the prime minister\u2019s home, kicked down his bedroom door and led out Balewa in his white robe. They allowed him to say his prayers and drove him away in Ifeajuna\u2019s car. On the road to Abeokuta they stopped, Ifeajuna ordered the prime minister out of the car, shot him, and left his body in the bush. Others say the Prime Minister was not shot, nor was the intention ever to kill him: Balewa died of an asthma attack or a heart attack brought on by fear. There has never been conclusive evidence either way. Ifeajuna drove on to Enugu, where it became apparent that the coup had failed, mainly because one of the key officers in Ifeajuna\u2019s Lagos operation had \u201cturned traitor\u201d and had failed to arrive as planned with armoured cars. Major-General Ironsi, the main military target, was still at large and he soon took control of the military government. Ifeajuna was now a wanted man. He hid in a chemist\u2019s shop, disguised himself as a woman, and was driven over the border by his friend Christopher Okigbo, a poet of great renown. Then he travelled on to Ghana, where he was welcomed. Ifeajuna eventually agreed to return to Lagos, where he was held pending trial. Ojukwu, by now a senior officer, ensured his safety by having him transferred, in April, to a jail in the east. Igbos who lived in the north of the country were attacked. In weeks of violent bloodshed tens of thousands died. As the death toll increased, the outcome was civil war. In May, 1967, Ojukwu, military governor of the south-east of Nigeria, declared that the region had now become the Republic of Biafra. By the time the fighting ended in early 1970, the number of deaths would be in the millions. Arguably, if either of Ifeajuna\u2019s plots had been a success, those lives would not have been lost. The verdicts on his role in Nigerian history are many and varied: his detractors have held sway. Chief among them was Bernard Odogwu, Biafra\u2019s head of intelligence, who branded Ifeajuna a traitor and blamed him for \u201cfailure and atrocities\u201d in the 1966 coup. Adewale Ademoyega, one of the 1966 plotters, held a different view of Ifeajuna. \u201cHe was a rather complicated character ... intensely political and revolutionary ... very influential among those close to him ... generous and willing to sacrifice anything for the revolution.\u201d The last time Anyaoku saw Ifeajuna was in 1963, in Lagos, before Anyaoku\u2019s departure for a diplomatic role in New York. He later moved to London and was there in 1967. \u201cI was devastated when I heard the news of the execution,\u201d he said. As for Ifeajuna being all but written out of Nigeria\u2019s sporting history, he noted that: \u201cThe history of the civil war still evokes a two-sided argument. He is a hero to many people, though they would more readily talk about his gold medal than his involvement in the war. There are people who think he was unjustifiably executed and others who believe the opposite.\u201d One commentator suggested recently that the new national stadium in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, should be named after Ifeajuna. It will surely never happen. Brian Oliver is a former sports editor of the Observer.

If all goes to plan, by next March Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s four damaged reactors will be surrounded by an underground frozen wall that will be a barrier between highly toxic water used to cool melted fuel inside reactor basements and clean groundwater flowing in from surrounding hills. Up to 400 tonnes of groundwater that flows into the basements each day must be pumped out, stored and treated \u2013 and on-site storage is edging closer to capacity. Decommissioning the plant will be impossible until its operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] addresses the water crisis. Last month workers from Tepco and the construction firm Kajima Corp began inserting 1,550 pipes 33 metres vertically into the ground to form a rectangular cordon around the reactors. Coolant set at -30C will be fed into the pipes, eventually freezing the surrounding earth to create an impermeable barrier. &quot;We started work a month ago and have installed more than 100 pipes, so it is all going according to plan to meet our deadline,&quot; Tadafumi Asamura, a Kajima manager who is supervising the ice wall construction, said as workers braved rain, humidity and radiation to bore holes in the ground outside reactor No 4, scene of one of three hydrogen explosions at the plant in the early days of the crisis. But sealing off the four reactors \u2013 three of which melted down in the March 2011 disaster \u2013 is costly and not without risks. The 32bn-yen (\u00a3185m) wall will be built with technology that has never been used on such a large scale. &quot;I&apos;m not convinced the freeze wall is the best option,&quot; Dale Klein, former head of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and a senior adviser to Tepco, recently told Kyodo News. &quot;What I&apos;m concerned about is unintended consequences. Where does that water go and what are the consequences of that? I think they need more testing and more analysis.&quot; The 1,500-metre wall will stay in use until 2020, using enough electricity every year to power 13,000 households, according to officials. Over the next eight months, 360 workers from Tepco and Kajima will work in rotating shifts of up to four hours a day, with each shift beginning in the early evening to combat heat exhaustion. Each worker is wrapped in hazardous materials suits and full-face masks, along with tungsten-lined rubber torso bibs for added protection against radiation. Tepco&apos;s record of mishaps in the three years since Fukushima Daiichi suffered a triple meltdown suggests the wall project will not be trouble free. The firm has had problems freezing irradiated water \u2013 using the same method being used to build the underground wall \u2013 that has accumulated in underground trenches, raising concerns that the ice technology is flawed. &quot;There have been challenges over the past three years, but major improvements too,&quot; Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s manager, Akira Ono, told the Guardian and other visiting journalists this week. &quot;We know it&apos;s not 100% yet and we&apos;re working to make it better. What is important is that we recognise the problems and take action to solve them.&quot; Ono said Tepco had safely removed 1,200 of the 1,500 nuclear fuel assemblies that were being stored in a pool in reactor No 4 when the tsunami smashed into the plant, knocking out back-up power supplies and sending three of its reactors into meltdown. The rest would be removed, on schedule, by the end of the year, he added. But attempts to address the build-up of contaminated water in reactor basements suffered a serious setback last year when storage tanks sprung leaks. The plant&apos;s water-treatment facility, which can remove all radioactive nuclides except tritium, has been suspended several times owing to malfunctions. All three lines of the system are running again, but only on a trial basis, according to Tepco spokesman Yuichi Nagano. &quot;We hope to have treated all the contaminated water stored on site by next March,&quot; he said. Ono said the wall would work in tandem with a recently completed bypass that reroutes clean groundwater directly into the Pacific, and underground wells. Last month, Japan&apos;s nuclear regulators voiced concern at the failure to freeze the water in the trenches. Ono conceded attempts had been unsuccessful, but said it did not mean the ice-wall technology was faulty. &quot;The water inside the trenches isn&apos;t freezing properly because it is circulating inside at higher speeds [than the groundwater],&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m confident we&apos;ll be able to freeze the trench water by next March.&quot; As it enters a critical phase of the Fukushima Daiichi clean-up, Tepco is contending with low morale among employees, about 3,000 of whom have quit or taken early retirement since the March 2011 disaster. Many have turned their back on nuclear power to take better-paid, less stressful jobs in other parts of the energy industry. Ono recognised the difficulties facing workers, but dismissed suggestions that there would not be enough people to decommission the plant. &quot;In a sense decommissioning a nuclear power plant is a backward-looking operation, but we face so many unprecedented challenges that I think of it as forward-looking,&quot; he said, citing the deployment of newly designed robots to locate and remove melted nuclear fuel. &quot;That&apos;s the kind of thing that motivates our engineers to keep going.&quot; He insisted that the 6,000 men from Tepco and its huge network of contractors and subcontractors now working at Fukushima Daiichi would see the world&apos;s most complex nuclear cleanup through to the end. &quot;Obviously, it&apos;s difficult to say for sure how many years it&apos;s going to take \u2026 at the moment we&apos;re talking about 30 or 40 years,&quot; he said. &quot;But I know that our employees have a strong sense of mission \u2013 the Tepco spirit, if you like \u2013 that is being passed down from one generation of workers to the next.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Thirty years ago you\u2019d have found it Tokyo, but the prolonged economic malaise that beset Japan after the postwar boom that made its capital such a thrilling vision has turned the country inward."], "tags": ["Cities", "Urbanisation", "Seoul holidays", "South Korea", "Asia Pacific", "South Korea holidays", "Asia"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-14T09:10:10Z", "title": "An urbanist\u2019s tour of South Korea: a glimpse into the future of world cities", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jul/14/an-urbanists-tour-of-south-korea-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-world-cities", "article": "Since at least the 1970s, we\u2019ve turned to East Asia for a look at the urban future. Thirty years ago you\u2019d have found it Tokyo, but the prolonged economic malaise that beset Japan after the postwar boom that made its capital such a thrilling vision has turned the country inward. Many westerners now seem convinced that the future \u2013 urban, rural, or otherwise \u2013 looks, speaks, and (given all that industrialisation) smells Chinese. Yet China\u2019s vast size, still-authoritarian government and enormous ballast of poor people make it, to my mind, an unlikely contender. No, to experience first-hand what lies in store for world cities, you\u2019ll want to book a flight to South Korea. First and foremost, I mean Seoul. One can hardly overstate this nation\u2019s capital-centricity, which makes England look like it just happens to have a big city called London. Americans must imagine a metropolitan area that somehow combines New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC, swallowing up a handful of other respectably large towns in the process. Ollagada, the Korean-language verb for making a trip to Seoul for a day or a lifetime, translates as \u201cgoing up\u201d; naeryeogada, the one for returning to your hometown, translates to \u201cgoing down\u201d. A young South Korean looking to make something of himself has, in recent history, faced two options: go over to America, if possible, or go up to Seoul. The capital\u2019s role as absolute centre of gravity hasn\u2019t necessarily benefited the country as a whole, but what a metropolis has resulted. Even the most wayworn city traveller will feel exhilarated, as I did, upon first stepping into Seoul\u2019s subway network, still growing yet already the most extensive in the world. It especially excels in its integration with the city itself \u2013 you can obtain pretty much everything you need in life not just without ever leaving the subway, but without ever leaving certain stations. In my past month based in Seoul, these and other amenities \u2013 the well-maintained restrooms in those stations; the Wi-Fi-equipped coffee shops where none need worry about the safety of their laptop; the other 24-hour businesses of every imaginable kind \u2013 have at times made me believe that South Korea has attained a new high watermark of urban civilisation.      Seoul\u2019s seemingly unquenchable thirst for the new coexists with a difficult history. Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images    Admittedly, I may be a little biased. First enthused by a burst of creativity in Korean cinema (notably the urban-dwelling comedies of director Hong Sangsoo, often called South Korea\u2019s Woody Allen), I\u2019ve spent years studying Korean language and culture, most recently from my home in Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown, a neighbourhood Korean friends describe as looking and feeling like a little piece of the Seoul of long ago. And despite the best efforts of forward-thinking officials, even the real Seoul hasn\u2019t extinguished its developing-world past. As I sit at the window in a vegan cafe in the international neighborhood of Itaewon, a middle-aged lady passes with a complete Korean meal (including the requisite myriad side dishes) balanced expertly on her head. As I cycle along the Han River, the old-timer ahead of me \u2013 fully suited up in lycra riding gear \u2013 suddenly pulls over to gather roadside greens. I drink a first-rate cappuccino in a traditional hanok house (all wooden beams and curvy roof), the recent reevaluation of which has got some Seoulites working to spare them demolition \u2013 or better yet, in their thinking, to demolish and rebuild them in more technologically advanced ways. These contrasts, for me, provide the distinctively satisfying texture of South Korean urban life. Even Seoul\u2019s seemingly unquenchable thirst for the new coexists with a difficult history that at once feels immediately present and impossibly distant. The country \u2013 and doubly so its distilled form, Seoul \u2013 has come an unfathomably long way in a matter of decades. You see it not just in its architecture, infrastructure and connection to the wider world, but in its people: I\u2019ve met worldly, stylish Koreans who have clear childhood memories of begging American GIs for chocolate.  I can draw few connections with other cities built in the 20th century, which as a rule have turned out less well-connected and use space far less efficiently. Apart from a selection of historical tourist attractions, Seoul really did go up in the past 60 years, its country having had to build up more or less all of its wealth, infrastructure and population after the Korean War, which destroyed or depleted all three.                     Seoul  lacks a coastline, but the Han River is well over half-a-mile wide as it runs through the city. Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images    Most of that startling progress came in the 30 years between the mid-1960s and the Asian Financial Crisis of the mid-90s, an impossibly short timeframe by the standards of western development. Friends who were here more than 20 years ago remember walking the streets of Seoul at all hours, seeing and hearing nothing but construction.  South Korea is one of the few developed-world cultures which regards change as, for the most part, unequivocally good. This makes Seoul that rarest of places, a world-class city not hobbled by an instinct for the preservation of its own perceived heyday. Of cities trying to freeze themselves in amber, obvious examples abound in Europe, and even the once recklessly-inspiring America has followed suit: whenever I go to San Francisco, I am saddened by its willingness to squander its future for the sake of a handful of Victorian houses.  The neophiliac Seoul suffers no such qualms. My daily walks along its high streets take me past countless construction sites, many of them as busy in the middle of the night as in the middle of the day. Small- or large-scale, public or private, most of these sites surround themselves with barriers emblazoned with the same words: anjeon cheil (safety first). This imperative has taken on the grimmest kind of irony in the wake of April\u2019s sinking of the MV Sewol.   That disaster, which claimed 293 lives (many of them high school students from Ansan, just south of Seoul) with another 11 still missing, plunged the Koreans I know at home and abroad into a period of reflection and regret. Even as they ask how such a thing could have happened, they uniformly describe it as the inevitable consequence of the same forces \u2013 the unceasing drive to push ahead, the tendency to cut corners, the disregard for the law \u2013 that brought South Korea up from nothing in the first place.      A series of negligence-related tragedies has left many Koreans questioning the pace of change. Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images    The Sewol was not an isolated incident but the latest \u2013 and not the deadliest \u2013 in a long series of negligence-related tragedies. Some 502 people died when Seoul\u2019s Sampoong Department Store suddenly collapsed in 1995, taking with it, in the words of Korean-American writer Krys Lee, \u201cgenerations of families\u201d. The list goes on: preventable Korean Air crashes, the Seongsu Bridge\u2019s collapse over Seoul\u2019s Han River, subway fires, auditorium cave-ins, and every other contributor to this country of 50 million\u2019s astonishing 31,000 accidental deaths per year. Koreans must surely wonder if they\u2019ve built a truly developed country or a dysfunctional sham, with Seoul a blindingly illuminated, distraction-filled Potemkin village.  And yet, Seoul stokes my urbanist passions like nowhere else. It has faced down challenges that many longer-established cities of the west have yet to deal with, or in some cases even acknowledge: accommodating an explosion in urban population; designing for density without relying on an existing, pre-car built environment; and retaining without fetishising elements of its past.  And then there\u2019s the \u2018candle-burnt-at-both-ends\u2019 Seoul lifestyle \u2013 at once workaholic and hedonistic, drifting and familial. By assuming the role of \u2018gonzo urbanist\u2019, immersing myself in the triumphs, mis-steps and sometimes downright bizarre experiments that characterise this country\u2019s urban future, I can figure out just what it offers me that better-known, longer-established centres of world commerce and culture don\u2019t.  Throughout this week, you can live that experience here with me at Guardian Cities. So as they say here, gapshida \u2013 let\u2019s go. Seoul by (big) numbers  1. In excess of 25.6 million people \u2013 that\u2019s more than half of Korea\u2019s population \u2013 live in the Seoul metropolitan area. And that population is 99% Korean: fewer than 300,000 foreigners live in Seoul, making it one of the most ethnically homogenous world capitals.  2. Seoul has built the most extensive subway system in the world. The world\u2019s \u201clongest multi-operator metro system by route length\u201d boasts 19 lines, 617 stations, and a daily ridership of nearly 10 million.  3. It also has taxis that go 90 miles an hour. Known as chongal taekshi, or \u2018bullet taxis\u2019, these cabs specialise in high-speed, late-night freeway rides to outlying suburbs.  4. The city offers the fastest internet connections in the world. Last year, web-surfing Seoulites did so at an average speed of 13.3 megabytes per second, compared to the American average of 8.7 megabytes per second. This year, South Korea is also rolling out a 5G mobile internet service, capable of an astonishing one gigabyte per second.   5. Seoul has more Starbucks locations than any other city in the world: 284 and counting, compared to New York City\u2019s 277.  6. It also boasts 38 colleges and universities and countless other institutions of higher education \u2013 which won\u2019t surprise you if you know anything of Korea\u2019s national obsession with grades, exams and degrees. You can get to the top three universities in the entire country on Seoul\u2019s circular subway line alone. \u2022 Gangnam, shanty-style: Seoul\u2019s Guryong Village slum \u2013 in pictures"}, {"sentences": ["He states on his personal website that after working as a copyboy for the New York Daily News, he graduated from Columbia University\u2019s journalism school, which awarded him a fellowship to go to Tokyo, where he worked as a correspondent for UPI."], "tags": ["US press and publishing", "US news", "Media", "US politics", "Books"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-14T15:56:49Z", "title": "Edward Klein: the difference between the truth and a lie", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/14/edward-klein-blood-feud-difference-between-truth-and-lie", "article": "The opening scene in Blood Feud, the new book by Ed Klein about the Clintons and the Obamas, is a classic of the 77-year-old author\u2019s scurrilous brand of political non-fiction. On a sunny afternoon in May last year, we are told, Hillary Clinton gathered six girlfriends from Wellesley&apos;s class of 1969 for a boozy lunch at Le Jardin du Roi, a bistro near her home in Chappaqua, New York. Recently liberated from the State Department, Clinton is said to have let loose on her erstwhile boss, accusing President Obama of having \u201cno hand on the fucking tiller\u201d. Klein discloses breathlessly that \u201cthe wines had been carefully chosen by Roi, the owner of the restaurant,\u201d and that \u201cRoi waited on Hillary personally and prepared a special vegan dish for her after the former first lady told him that she was trying to lose weight.\u201d There is, however, a problem with this centrepiece of Blood Feud\u2019s prologue. Le Jardin du Roi was not named after the backyard of a man called Roi. It means \u201cThe Garden of the King\u201d, or \u201cThe King\u2019s Garden\u201d in French. \u201cIt\u2019s just the name of the restaurant,\u201d a puzzled staff member told the Guardian when reached by telephone. The name of the man who owns the restaurant is Joe. This is not the first glaring factual error to have made its way into Klein\u2019s reporting. It is not even the first time a mistake has been made in the very first anecdote of one of his books. Such clangers, along with excruciating claims about his subjects&apos; personal lives, have contributed to the establishment of a diverse anti-Klein caucus, ranging from Media Matters on the left to the conservative columnists John Podhoretz and Peggy Noonan.  People close to Clinton in the past week directly alleged that Klein had made up parts of the book. Theirs were only the heftiest blows in a fresh barrage of criticism delivered even as Blood Feud rose to the top of New York Times bestseller list, selling more than 20,100 copies in a week to oust Clinton\u2019s own memoir Hard Choices, which sold about 16,600, from the No1 slot.  Even Rush Limbaugh, the king of conservative talk radio, told his listeners last week that the purported dialogue in some of Klein\u2019s florid set pieces \u2013 \u201cYou can\u2019t trust the motherfucker,\u201d Clinton is supposed to have said of Obama over her next glass of wine \u2013 does not ring true. \u201cSome of the quotes strike me as odd,\u201d said Limbaugh. \u201cIn the sense that I don\u2019t know people who speak this way.\u201d  Publishing industry sources contacted by the Guardian were privately withering about the veracity of Klein\u2019s reporting, while declining to allow their names to be associated with such allegations in public. Former colleagues wonder aloud how this one-time editor of the New York Times Magazine, senior Newsweek editor and staff writer for Vanity Fair came to join what might be termed the Fox News Industrial Complex. Yet as Blood Feud scales the same chart-topping heights of The Amateur \u2013 his scathing 2012 take on Obama\u2019s presidency, which sold more than 230,000 copies \u2013 Klein appears to be laughing off his critics all the way to the bank.  \u201cAttacking the messenger to hide the truth is the first page of the Clinton playbook,\u201d Klein told the Guardian in a statement. \u201cEven in a city completely devoid of accountability, it never ceases to amaze that a Clinton operative could call anyone a \u2018liar\u2019. For starters, ask the families of the victims of the Benghazi attacks how far the Clintons and the Obamas are willing to go to hide the truth.\u201d Klein did not agree to a more extensive interview for this article, and a spokeswoman for his publisher issued a blanket denial to a series of questions put by the Guardian, some of which contained assertions that were demonstrably true.     Klein speaks at an Accuracy in Media event in 2014. Photograph: /YouTube    &apos;The eternal lessons of good and right journalism&apos; Klein was born in Yonkers in October 1936. His father owned a dress shop, he has said, but he wanted to be a writer from a young age. He states on his personal website that after working as a copyboy for the New York Daily News, he graduated from Columbia University\u2019s journalism school, which awarded him a fellowship to go to Tokyo, where he worked as a correspondent for UPI. It was there that Klein also reportedly befriended Abe Rosenthal, a Pulitzer-winning foreign correspondent and future executive editor of the New York Times.  Around this time, Klein also met his first wife, Emiko, with whom he went on to have two children. Their daughter, Karen Klein Hirsch, floor-managed the Four Seasons restaurant in New York for a decade until 2004, and now has a daughter of her own. Their son, Alec Klein, is a professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Medill journalism school and a former award-winning investigative reporter for the Washington Post and other newspapers. In the acknowledgments to a 2007 book, Alec thanked his father \u201cfor teaching me the eternal lessons of good and right journalism\u201d. After returning to the US, Klein joined Newsweek and climbed the newsroom ladder. He rose to assistant managing editor, before being poached in 1977 by Rosenthal to run the prestigious Sunday magazine. By then, Klein and Emiko had divorced, and fought in the New York courts for custody of their children, in a case that involved the use of a court-appointed psychiatrist and reached the state appeals court. Almost 40 years later, court officials are not authorised to disclose how the case was resolved. Emiko, an artist now living in Westchester, could not be reached for comment. Klein subsequently married Tessa Namuth, a former colleague at Newsweek, in 1978. But two years later they, too, were divorced. \u201cTessa says it won\u2019t be amicable from her point of view,\u201d the syndicated gossip columnist Liz Smith wrote, in November 1980. Tessa\u2019s attorney told Smith that Klein \u201cserved on us a vicious complaint, alleging misconduct in the marriage\u201d. Klein\u2019s attorney told Smith: \u201cMy client made every effort to resolve this fairly.\u201d Tessa, who has since remarried and still lives in Manhattan, did not return a message seeking comment. Colleagues from the Times said that while Klein was sociable, he was too often cowed during working hours by Rosenthal, the boss who had brought him to the Gray Lady. He failed to fight their corner during inevitable newsroom disagreements, one claimed. \u201cHe had a very good staff, but I don\u2019t think he protected them as well as he could have,\u201d James Greenfield, who eventually took over from Klein as magazine editor, said in an interview. \u201cIf you run a magazine, you have to protect your people, both internally and externally, and if he got internal criticism I don\u2019t think he protected them enough.\u201d The magazine team \u201cneeded reassurance\u201d after Klein\u2019s departure, said Greenfield. Nonetheless, it was under Klein\u2019s leadership that the magazine won its first Pulitzer prize. The 1983 award for feature writing went to a cover story by the writer Nan Robertson about her struggle with toxic shock syndrome, which caused her to lose the ends of eight fingers.  Yet by 1987, a pair of embarrassing errors on successive Sundays led to public speculation about Klein\u2019s position. Newsday reported at the time that the magazine was first forced to clarify a not-so-rags-to-riches story about a first-time novelist, and then explain that a photograph of a dramatic drugs bust in Miami had in fact been staged for an advertisement. The errors were only the final straw, said Max Frankel, who succeeded Rosenthal as executive editor in 1986. \u201cHe was the first person that I let go when I became editor,\u201d Frankel said in an interview. \u201cHe and I just \u2026 I just found him \u2026 uhh ... unable to work with him, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d Frankel explained that he was troubled by Klein&apos;s aversion to \u201cstraight answers\u201d and \u201cthe degree of supervision he was willing to submit to\u201d. He said: \u201cAll that he thought he was doing with the magazine just had no relation to what I thought we should be doing, and I suggested we part ways very quickly.\u201d Klein also found himself lambasted repeatedly in the pages of Spy, a boisterous monthly launched by Cond\u00e9 Nast in 1986 and co-edited by Graydon Carter, the future Vanity Fair supremo. The magazine, which frequently devoted a full-page column to internal machinations at the Times, reported after Rosenthal\u2019s departure that while Klein was \u201cuniversally despised\u201d, he probably remained \u201cthe right man for the job of keeping the magazine stolid and unsurprising\u201d.     Klein's book Blood Feud has ousted Clinton's memoir from the top of the New York Times bestseller list. Photograph: Shannon Stapleton /Reuters    Walter Scott and Ed Slime: brainchildren of a distinguished editor He finally departed the Times in late 1987 just before his third wedding, to Dolores Barrett, a PR consultant, who died in December last year after more than a quarter-century of marriage. \u201cShe was everything to him,\u201d said John LeBoutillier, a former Republican congressman and friend of the author, who co-wrote an unsuccessful satirical political novel with him in 2010. \u201cBut he\u2019s handling it OK. He was right in the middle of working on [Blood Feud] when it happened, so he had something to do every day.\u201d Spy magazine celebrated Klein\u2019s fall from the paper by reporting gleefully that he was trying to found a new magazine, Newsplay. Spy said Klein described it in his own pitch document, targeting the big shots of the New York media industry, as \u201cthe brainchild of a distinguished editor\u201d. The review was scathing. \u201cKlein refers to himself in the third person no fewer than 20 times in the prospectus\u2019s 30 pages of overwritten yet uninspiring prose,\u201d Spy disclosed, warning would-be investors: \u201cNo pushing or shoving, please. One person at a time!\u201d The new venture did not get off the ground. Instead, as the 1990s dawned, Klein became a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, while also quietly taking on the Personality Parade column, bylined to \u201cWalter Scott\u201d, in Parade magazine and syndicated in hundreds of Sunday newspapers around the US, for which he reportedly received between $300,000 and $350,000 a year.  At Vanity Fair, he specialised in splashy profiles of some of the decade\u2019s biggest names, including Donald Trump, Jackie Kennedy Onassis, Diane Sawyer and Mort Zuckerman. His pieces caused the requisite stir of follow-up in New York\u2019s tabloids. He and Dolores partied with Sally Quinn\u2019s high-society set in Washington. Yet the magazine\u2019s then-editor, Tina Brown, later joined Klein\u2019s detractors, speculating in a 2005 article that a \u201csecret fantasy of girl-on-girl action\u201d had led him to \u201cobsess\u201d in the pages of his first book about Clinton about rumours that she had a \u201clesbian ethos\u201d. Brown, who lamented that \u201cKlein used to be a workmanlike scribe\u201d and renamed him \u201cEd Slime\u201d, told the Guardian in an email: \u201cEd figured out where the big bucks were and tailored his \u2018reporting\u2019 accordingly.\u201d  The big bucks were in books, sensational ones, beginning with four in eight years about the dependably chaotic Kennedy clan. Claiming to have been a friend of Jackie Kennedy Onassis, Klein was mocked by more earnest Kennedy historians but made headlines by reporting that Jackie had lost her virginity in a lift in Paris and had an extramarital affair of her own. &apos;The difference between the truth and a lie&apos;     Klein's 2012 book The Amateur asserted Michelle Obama had Photograph: Jose Luis Magana/AP    But it was not until 2005, and The Truth About Hillary, that Klein enraged the present-day powerful, alienated swaths of critics and \u2013 according to people who know him \u2013 pushed himself firmly to the right. The book notoriously implied, via anonymous sources, that Chelsea Clinton was conceived in 1979 in Bermuda during a rape, and that Hillary Clinton was a closeted lesbian. It was dismissed by some conservatives \u2013 \u201cPoorly written, poorly thought, poorly sourced,\u201d wrote Peggy Noonan; \u201cThirty pages into it, I wanted to take a shower,\u201d pleaded John Podhoretz \u2013 but viscerally appalled many critics on the left such as Jamison Foser, a former Democratic operative, who wrote an 11,000-word debunk of it for Media Matters. It appears to have been a turning point for Klein, who in the past had rarely disclosed any \u201cbasic convictions or political agenda\u201d, according to Frankel, the former New York Times editor. \u201cHe really got angry over the way he was treated by his then-fellow liberals,\u201d said LeBoutillier. \u201cHe was somewhat liberal, but his friends on the left were so horrible to him because he dared to criticise Hillary Clinton. That that was a big moment for him.\u201d Things might have turned out differently. In the 1990s, Klein had a contract with Little, Brown to write a book about George HW and Barbara Bush. But the project fell apart when Bush\u2019s team withdrew an apparent offer of cooperation, and the New York Observer reported that Klein was ordered by a judge in New York state supreme court to return an advance of more than $165,000. Instead, he turned his attentions to Clinton before continuing to infuriate Democrats with 2012\u2019s The Amateur, in which he painted a picture of chaos in the White House and claimed that marital relations between the Obamas had plumbed to such depths that Michelle at one stage had divorce papers drawn up. A White House spokesman accused him of having \u201ca proven history of reckless fabrication in order to sell books,\u201d correctly predicting the volume would fly off shelves. Klein\u2019s friends are quick to defend his integrity. \u201cEd is a hard-working reporter,\u201d said LeBoutillier. \u201cHe\u2019s a professional reporter.\u201d Another complained that Klein is unfairly maligned for blind quoting while other journalists who play the same game, such as Bob Woodward, are hailed as genuine scoop-getters. Yet there is unquestionably something more disconcerting about Klein\u2019s work. Aside from the errors and the miraculous quotes, there are the details reported like exclusive disclosures \u2013 such as the names of novels on Obama\u2019s bedside table during his summer vacation, attributed to a housekeeper \u2013 that were already in the public domain. Two publishing industry sources familiar with the situation confirmed a report by BuzzFeed earlier this year that Blood Feud had been dropped by its original publisher, William Morrow, because the content did not pass a vetting by in-house lawyers. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at an imprint of HarperCollins, which is part of NewsCorp, they take that stuff very seriously, and they check all of your sources and notes and they want to know where you got stuff,\u201d said one. The book has instead been released by Regnery, the Washington-based conservative imprint that has also published Ann Coulter and Newt Gingrich.  Klein does not appear troubled in the slightest. \u201cI just think he has decided he could make a lot of money on that side of the street, so he has gone over there,\u201d said Frankel. But while Klein is wealthier now, friends say that his lifestyle is little changed. He still splits his time between the Upper East Side apartment on Park Avenue where he has lived and worked for decades, and an upstate getaway in Ghent. Klein also fell behind on payment of his taxes several times in recent years, according to state and federal records, owing as much as $218,000 to the IRS between 2009 and 2010. He is now fully paid and up to date. He remains impeccably turned out \u2013 his teeth rows of perfect white, his skin tanned and what is left of his hair neatly cropped in mounds above his ears. It could not be confirmed whether he still practices krava maga, an Israeli hand-to-hand martial art, as was reported in 2002. But Klein can often be found, in one of his double-breasted suits, lunching at Michael\u2019s, the West 55th Street spot long beloved by major players in publishing. As he approaches his 79th year, Klein shows no sign of mellowing. \u201cKnowing him, he will get right back on to another book,\u201d said LeBoutillier. And as the 2016 presidential primary approaches, he made clear to Sean Hannity on Fox News during the promotional swing for his book last month that he has not stopped thinking about one subject in particular. \u201cYou know, Hillary has a very tenuous hold on reality,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real characterlogical (sic) problem. I think the problem really is that this is a woman that wants to be president, but I don\u2019t think she knows the difference between the truth and a lie.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["It recalled a reception held in the early 90s at the British embassy in Tokyo, where some attache was guffing on about how the dreaming spires of Albion were going to become centres of enterprise \u2013 just like the private sector."], "tags": ["King's College London", "Science", "Higher education", "Education", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-15T05:30:01Z", "title": "King's College London: world leaders in business nonsense | Aditya Chakrabortty", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/15/kings-college-london-business-marketplace-higher-education-managers", "article": "Last November a letter appeared in the London Review of Books that should be carved into stone. It recalled a reception held in the early 90s at the British embassy in Tokyo, where some attache was guffing on about how the dreaming spires of Albion were going to become centres of enterprise \u2013 just like the private sector. On hearing this, a normally &quot;polite and reserved&quot; Japanese professor felt moved to protest: &quot;Your universities \u2013 they will follow British business model? But British business is \u2026 I am sorry \u2026 it is not well. It is dead, and your universities are famous and respected. They are not dead.&quot; Not yet, sensei \u2013 but we&apos;re working on it, with a succession of reforming blows and improving cuts. The latest assault is taking place on the Strand, in the centre of the capital, at one of the most renowned universities in the UK. The phrase &quot;university in crisis&quot; does not bring to mind King&apos;s College London. Established in 1829, it has worldwide renown, along with well over \u00a31bn in assets, endowments, investments and cash. Yet in the past couple of months it has become the setting for a farce \u2013 an especially odd farce, mind, that winds up making you furious. In May, university managers announced that 120 scientists would lose their jobs. Just like that: no warning, no testing of the waters to see who might go for voluntary redundancies. Nor any budgetary emergency: the most recent accounts begin with &quot;The college is in a strong financial position&quot;, and last year it had income of \u00a3587m. Yet managers claim more cash is needed to fund expansion \u2013 especially to buy and maintain buildings. We&apos;ll come back to that point. But first put yourself in the loafers of an executive at King&apos;s, looking to make mass redundancies. How to choose who should go? Perhaps, I can hear you venturing, perhaps let go of the less able, or the ones pursuing less vital lines of inquiry? Ah, how naive. The axe-wielders at King&apos;s have set two primary criteria for which health researchers get to keep their jobs: either they are already teaching students for a minimum number of hours, or they are bringing in lots of grant money. According to a confidential college &quot;consultation document&quot;, a professor at the Institute of Psychiatry is expected to be making his college \u00a3200,000 in grant funding. Every year. The paper makes no mention of the quality of the research, nor of its independence from commercial interests. Going by these criteria, a psychiatry professor taking 200 grand from Nando&apos;s to prove that grilled chicken engenders wellbeing would be golden; his colleague looking into schizophrenia in the prison system on half that amount would be for the chop. You may think this boneheaded; you haven&apos;t heard the half of it. After the Times Higher Education published a criticism of the cuts by the Oxford psychology professor Dorothy Bishop, King&apos;s representatives went below her online article to announce that they&apos;d changed their mind on the cuts announced just six weeks earlier \u2013 there would be only half the layoffs. The new sum of 57 was described as the &quot;result of a robust and thorough review&quot;. You may justifiably ask if that meant the earlier review had been done just for laughs. You may, with even more justification, ask what kind of employer informs its staff whether or not they&apos;ll be keeping their jobs through an internet comments thread. But this is King&apos;s \u2013 an institute of higher education ever keen to mimic whatever nonsense it sees as businesslike practice. This is the college where IT staff have to fill in performance appraisals asking if they&apos;ve &quot;delighted our customers&quot;; where executives have previously told students not to worry about cuts to teaching staff, because they&apos;ll have better Wi-Fi to compensate; where the outgoing college principal, Rick Trainor, recently justified his \u00a3321,000 annual pay package by saying: &quot;If you want the best, you have to pay the best.&quot; If anyone has a claim to be among the best, it&apos;s the health researchers at King&apos;s. Over the past century college alumni have won 12 Nobel prizes, for work including the development of beta-blockers, a vaccine for yellow fever and mapping DNA. Just last week staff at one of the threatened schools were all over the papers for having discovered a blood test that makes it easier to detect Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Why do King&apos;s bosses want to trash this? It&apos;s not for financial security: the credit-rating agency S&amp;P warned managers last year that &quot;pressure to maintain academic and non-academic service standards will weigh on ability to cut costs further&quot;. Partly it&apos;s so that the college, which already has one of the most valuable property portfolios in Britain, can keep buying buildings \u2013 as if real estate lay at the core of the academic ideal. But it also reflects a bigger trend in our universities, which are increasingly beset by league-table watching and groupthink. In their plans, King&apos;s managers make much of their hopes of being just below Imperial and Oxbridge. Asked which league table they were looking at, senior management replied: &quot;As a single measure of league table ranking, we use income or research income.&quot; In other words: forget about academic quality \u2013 feel my wad. That Japanese professor was right: pushed into a marketplace, the managers of higher education don&apos;t really know how to act. So they ape each other, pass off what they are doing to what&apos;s left of the staff as the new wisdom \u2013 and pay themselves vast sums for wrecking one of the few sectors in which Britain leads the world. The result in all its strategic confusion and grasping anxiety is the university version of The Thick of It: from bean to cup, those HE bosses fuck up.

In June last year Unesco added it to the World Heritage list as a &quot;sacred place and source of artistic inspiration&quot;. But it is still an active volcano, standing at the junction between the Pacific, Eurasian and Philippine tectonic plates. Though it has rarely stirred in recorded history, it is still potentially explosive. The Tohoku \u2013 or Great East Japan \u2013 earthquake on 11 March 2011 triggered a devastating tsunami, which in turn caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. According to a Franco-Japanese study published by Science (PDF), the magnitude-9 tremor also increased the pressure on Mount Fuji. &quot;Our work does not say that the volcano will start erupting, but it does show that it&apos;s in a critical state,&quot; says Florent Brenguier, a researcher at the Institute of Earth Sciences (IST) in Grenoble, France, and lead author of the publication, to which the Institute of Global Physics (IPG) in Paris also contributed. Adopting a novel approach, the scientists carried out a sort of giant echo-scan of the bowels of the Earth, based on the huge mass of data recorded after the mega-quake by Japan&apos;s Hi-net system, the densest network in the world, with 800 seismic sensors. They focused on signals commonly known as seismic noise, the result of constant interaction between ocean swell and &quot;solid&quot; earth. In the past such data has generally been dismissed as background interference. By recording fluctuations in this barely perceptible subterranean noise they were able to map geological disturbances in the bedrock of Japan caused by the seismic waves following the violent quake in March 2011. &quot;Seismic waves travel a very long way, going round the world several times,&quot; Brenguier explains. &quot;Their movement makes the Earth&apos;s crust vibrate, and rather like a shock wave this produces breaks or cracks in the rock.&quot;     A snow-capped Mount Fuji. A Franco-Japanese study of seismic data suggests pressure is building for a new eruption. Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun/Getty    One might well imagine that such disturbance is greatest close to the epicentre of a quake, but this is not the case. The Franco-Japanese study shows that the area where the Earth&apos;s crust suffered the greatest damage was not around Tohoku, in the north-east of Honshu island, but in the volcanic regions, in particular under Mount Fuji, some 400km away. &quot;The volcanic regions are the ones where the fluids trapped in the rock \u2013 boiling water, gas, liquid magma, which cause an eruption when they rise to the surface \u2013 exert the greatest pressure. The seismic waves add to this pressure, causing even more disturbance,&quot; Brenguier says. The magnitude 6.4 quake that occurred four days after the tsunami, followed by many smaller aftershocks, was a further indication that Mount Fuji is under high pressure. So should Japan be on red alert? &quot;We cannot establish a direct relation of cause and effect between quakes and volcanic eruptions, even if statistically the former lead to an increase in the latter,&quot; Brenguier says. &quot;All we can say is that Mount Fuji is now in a state of pressure, which means it displays a high potential for eruption. The risk is clearly higher.&quot; Science, however, has no way of predicting when this might happen. But there is a precedent. The last eruption of Mount Fuji occurred in 1707. It projected almost a billion cubic metres of ash and debris into the atmosphere, some of which reached Tokyo (then called Edo) 100km away. It was preceded, 49 days earlier, by a magnitude 8.7 quake to the south of Japan that, in conjunction with the tidal wave it raised, claimed more than 5,000 lives. This time, more than three years have already passed since the Tohoku quake. But that does not mean that Mount Fuji, under the constant supervision of Japanese geologists, is slumbering. Come what may, the method developed by the Franco-Japanese team for investigating volcanic areas should improve the accuracy of efforts all over the world to assess the risk of major volcanic eruptions.

The reference by the mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes, to the vow to stage the \u201cCopa das Copas\u201d in Brazil, was perhaps tongue in cheek but the sentiment is deadly serious. \u201cThe mistrust we had two months ago is not there. We\u2019re convinced we\u2019ll deliver everything on time. It\u2019s going to be a great party,\u201d he promised. Yet while a successful World Cup has shifted sentiment about Rio\u2019s lagging progress towards the Olympics in 2016, serious questions remain. Those concerns burst into the open two months ago when the International Olympic Committee vice-president, John Coates, warned Rio was further behind than the notoriously last-minute Athens Games of 2004. That stoked fears among international federations that Rio\u2019s ambitious pitch to hold the Games entirely within the confines of a city that looks spectacular but requires urgent infrastructure upgrades would be a bold legacy vision too far. As Paes admits, holding the equivalent of 28 simultaneous world championships and hosting 10,500 athletes, 45,000 volunteers and 21,500 accredited media is of a different order to seven World Cup matches. But Mario Andrada, a former Nike executive who joined Rio 2016 last year as the communications director, said the German IOC president, Thomas Bach, had returned to Lausanne after a series of meetings with doubts assuaged. \u201cHe\u2019s taking home the World Cup and also the information that we are back on track,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mood in the country has swung. The fears of collapse of transportation did not take place. The World Cup was a big success. Everyone who came to watch had a great month.\u201d \u201cHow ready are we? Ready enough in terms of venues. We began double shifts on the Olympic Park and we have started work on Deodoro,\u201d says Andrada. Organisers admit that construction remains 10 to 15% behind schedule but promise to be back on track by September. The Deodoro cluster of venues that will host seven sports including shooting, fencing and mountain biking has been the one causing most concern for the IOC. Agberto Guimar\u00e3es, Rio 2016\u2019s executive director of sport and Paralympic integration, insisted that now construction was finally underway visible progress would be made. \u201cWe broke ground on 3 July. People are moving machines and doing foundation work. We have chosen excellent companies who can deliver,\u201d he said. \u201cSo even though this is the last venue we have started we are moving according to the schedule presented to the federations.\u201d One of the stumbling blocks to date has been unlocking the promised funding amid wrangling between Brazil\u2019s three layers of government. But Paes, who has staked his political future on a successful Games, has now underwritten key budget lines and the IOC has promised to forward income from broadcasting contracts. Aside from Deodoro, there are major concerns over the behind schedule golf course and the sailing venue at Guarana Bay, which contains dangerously high levels of sewage. Andrada said a plan was in place to make it \u201ccleaner and cleaner\u201d. The reaction of the sport\u2019s federation when they arrive for a test event, the first of 40-plus in Rio, in August will be key. \u201cWe are very confident it will be perfect for the test event. We wouldn\u2019t think about risking the health of the athletes if a sailor falls into the water. We have two meetings a week with State authorities to make the water cleaner.\u201d The city\u2019s choked transport infrastructure, the overhaul of which Paes claims will be a major legacy benefit for the city, is a key problem for a host with ambitious plans to hold the Games in four zones scattered around the city. Construction of a key metro line that will link with high speed buses to ferry spectators to the Olympic Park at Barra is not scheduled to finish until May 2016. As during the World Cup, the atmosphere and vitality of the city itself is likely to help smooth any rough edges. A modern Olympics remains a complex logistical puzzle and any repeat of the transport chaos of Atlanta in 1996 would quickly kill the party mood. Meanwhile, there remain wider questions about spending priorities and forced evictions. Paes claims the $36.7bn budget \u2013 60% of which is raised from the commercial sector \u2013 is justified because it will turbocharge improvements in the city\u2019s infrastructure. He said the bill for fixed sporting venues was $5.6bn, three-quarters of which would be raised from private investment. The successful World Cup has already caused Rio 2016 organisers to revise their estimates upwards for the number of international visitors. They have also come up with a new plan to cater for the invasion of motor homes from other South American nations that became a feature of the World Cup. Paes argued that the rationale behind the Games, to deliver an Olympics that would help transform the city, remained sound. \u201cWe won the Olympic bid because of our problems. That\u2019s the point of the Olympics in Rio. The IOC will probably have an easier time in Tokyo,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is already built. But what will the Olympics mean to the city of Rio versus the city of Tokyo?\u201d Andrada admits that the pressure will only get more intense from here but is confident Rio will ultimately deliver. \u201cI learned from London and Sochi that two years to go is when you get out of the tunnel, out of the darkness,\u201d he said."}, {"sentences": ["The artist, whose real name is Megumi Igarashi, was held in custody in Tokyo on suspicion of breaking Japanese obscenity laws."], "tags": ["Japan", "Censorship", "Gender", "World news", "Art and design", "3D printing", "Technology", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-16T03:28:08Z", "title": "Vagina selfie for 3D printers lands Japanese artist in trouble", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/15/vagina-selfie-for-3d-printers-lands-japanese-artist-in-trouble", "article": " Last month it took more than 20 firefighters to free a US student who had become trapped inside a giant sculpture of a vagina in Germany. But genital art elicited a very different response in Japan this week, when police arrested an artist for distributing data that enables recipients to make 3D prints of her vagina. The artist, who works under the pseudonym Rokudenashiko \u2013 which roughly translates as \u201cgood-for-nothing girl\u201d \u2013 was arrested after emailing the data to 30 people who had answered a crowd-funding request for her recent artistic venture: a kayak inspired on her own genitalia she calls \u201cpussy boat\u201d, according to Brian Ashcraft at the gaming website Kotaku. The artist, whose real name is Megumi Igarashi, was held in custody in Tokyo on suspicion of breaking Japanese obscenity laws. Media reports said Igarashi, 42, denied the allegations. She pointed out that had not sent images of her vagina in return for money and did not recognise the scanned 3D data as obscene. Kyodo quoted unnamed police sources as saying Igarashi had collected about 1m yen in exchange for the data. While Igarashi&apos;s art has a fun-loving and cheeky theme, her situation is serious as far as the law is concerned: if convicted she could receive up to two years in jail or a fine of as much as 2.5 million yen (\u00a314,300/US$24,500), according to her lawyer.  Commentators have pointed out the hypocrisy of her arrest, which comes soon after Japanese authorities resisted pressure to ban pornographic images of children in manga comics and animated films. The activist Minori Kitahara said police raided Igarashi&apos;s office and seized 20 of her artworks. &quot;Japan is still a society where those who try to express women&apos;s sexuality are suppressed, while men&apos;s sexuality is overly tolerated,&quot; she said.  Igarashi has made a name for herself with her Decoman \u201cDecorated Vagina\u201d series of sculptures. The titles of the works incorporate the word \u201cman\u201d, from manko, the Japanese for vagina. Igarashi said she was once asked not to use the word Decoman during a TV appearance. Because female genitalia were \u201coverly hidden\u201d in Japanese society, \u201cI did not know what a pussy should look like,\u201d she said in an online post. \u201cI thought it was just funny to decorate my [moulded] pussy and make it a diorama, but I was very surprised to see how people get upset to see my works or even to hear me say manko.\u201d One of the works, described as a \u201cvaginal battle scene\u201d, shows a group of toy soldiers taking cover in an unmistakeably pudic crevice; another diorama titled Fukushiman \u2013 a \u201ctaboo on top of taboo\u201d \u2013 shows workers at the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in similar surroundings.  She has also designed iPhone covers and recently posted an image of Gundaman, a figurine based on the popular anime character Gundam, sporting an oversized vagina, according to the Japanese art and design website Spoon &amp; Tamago. Igarashi has said she is on a mission to \u201cdemystify\u201d female genitalia in Japan, a country where thousands flock to an officially sanctioned annual penis festival in Kawasaki every April."}, {"sentences": ["Forget Scrabble or Risk \u2013 expect to play games such as King of Tokyo, Chicken Cha Cha Cha or Munchkin."], "tags": ["London holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Europe holidays", "England holidays", "Travel", "Bars and clubs", "City breaks", "London", "UK news", "Board games", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-16T10:45:44Z", "title": "London\u2019s first board game cafe to open in Hackney", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jul/16/london-first-board-game-cafe-to-open-in-hackney", "article": "You could say that Toby Hamand \u2013 who quit his job a year ago to pursue his dream of opening London\u2019s first board game cafe \u2013 likes to live by the roll of a dice. Now, with the launch date of the cafe rapidly approaching, the former sound engineer is finally able to admit his dream is becoming a reality. \u201cWhen I first told people they reacted with amusement and disbelief,\u201d he says. \u201cA common response is: \u2018My pub\u2019s got board games \u2013 how are you going to be any different?\u2019 But when they hear how many we\u2019ll have they realise quite how different it\u2019s going to be.\u201d With the aim of stocking 500 games (and counting), Draughts, which will open in Hackney, east London, in September, hopes to be a significant fixture in what seems to be a burgeoning scene. Last July Thirsty Meeples in Oxford became the first board game cafe to open in the UK \u2013 stocking over 1,700 games along with high-quality coffee and a fridge full of craft beer. And much of the inspiration for both has come from the Canadian cafe Snakes and Lattes, which opened in Toronto in 2010 and has proved so popular that in January they opened a second, licensed venue in the city, Snakes and Lagers. \u201cOver the last 10-15 years board games has grown as a hobby,\u201d says John Morgan, proprietor of Thirsty Meeples. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more choice and the games are much more involving. But it\u2019s also about switching off from the internet and wireless culture we have in cafes now and having that interaction with people. I think that it\u2019s inevitable more cafes will open.\u201d Indeed, for Hamand, the real impetus to open Draughts came from the fact that he thought if he didn\u2019t do it soon, someone else would. This fear was confirmed when he discovered another man called Nick Curci was also planning to open one in Hackney \u2013 but rather than compete they decided to team up and open one together. The project follows a series of concept cafes and bars to open in London \u2013 Lady Dinah\u2019s Cat Emporium, the capital\u2019s first cat cafe, was covered relentlessly by the national press, while a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d cafe in Shoreditch garnered similar interest, and The Four Quarters, a vintage arcade games bar, opened in Peckham this month. But while we can all agree on the universal appeal of cats, some may find it harder to imagine there being quite so much interest in board games. Hamand, however, who has taken out a bank and government loan to fund the project, is confident. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole generation who grew up playing video games but are now at an age where they don\u2019t want to sit around doing that in the evening anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming it at people in their 20s and 30s who feel like they\u2019re past going out and listening to rave music, but want to do an activity that\u2019s a bit different to drinking at the pub.\u201d The cafe will feature an entire corner with shelves stacked full of games to choose from \u2013 making it as much a library as a place to socialise. Visitors to the cafe will be charged a flat fee of \u00a35 to play the games for as long as they like, while members will be able to pay a reduced fee of \u00a33.50. Trained staff will also be on hand to help introduce players to the rules of unfamiliar games. Forget Scrabble or Risk \u2013 expect to play games such as King of Tokyo, Chicken Cha Cha Cha or Munchkin. And just like Thirsty Meeples and Snakes and Lagers, Draughts (as the name suggests) will serve a wide selection of beer on tap. Yet despite the reputation Monopoly has as a homewrecker, Hamand isn\u2019t worried that the combination of alcohol and board games could lead to drunken brawls. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to be getting mashed while they\u2019re playing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only concern I\u2019ve got is drinks getting spilled on the boards.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Details: 1857.no     Izu Photo Museum     Tokyo Leave the capital to its 35 million inhabitants; hop on a westbound bullet train, and in less than an hour you&apos;ll reach Shizuoka&apos;s sublime Izu Photo Museum, whose single-storey stone building (designed in collaboration with photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto) sits in a serene sculpture garden."], "tags": ["Art", "Photography", "Sculpture", "Painting", "Amsterdam holidays", "Venice holidays", "Oslo holidays", "Tokyo holidays", "New York holidays", "Rio de Janeiro holidays", "Paris holidays", "Madrid holidays", "Vienna holidays", "Athens holidays", "Brussels holidays", "Berlin holidays", "Art and design", "The Hague holidays", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-17T06:00:00Z", "title": "Art to see on your summer holidays", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jul/17/art-to-see-summer-holidays", "article": "New York  In summer, the Big Apple becomes\u00a0an incinerator.

Australia confirms climate pariah status by axing carbon tax     Factory emissions are seen across Botany Bay in Sydney. Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images    Australia has demonstrated its commitment to climate change \u2013 by axing the only legislative measure it had in place to reduce carbon emissions. The senate voted this week to repeal the carbon tax, which was introduced only two years ago. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, described the tax as useless and destructive and said his government had listened to the Australian people by repealing the measure. His party had argued that the policy unfairly penalised businesses.  The change will leave an estimated A$7bn (\u00a33.8bn) hole in the government budget, with 350 energy providers and manufacturing companies no longer required to pay the tax. Australia has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 5% from its 2000 levels by 2020. Labor and the Greens have vowed to reintroduce the measure if elected in 2016.

The mine, to be located at the edge of Hluhluwe-Imfolozi reserve in South Africa, would pollute the air and rivers, turn the land into waste dumps and provide easier access to the already numerous poachers in the area, according to opponents.  Figures released last week showed that 2014 has already had a high number of rhino deaths at the hands of poachers, with 558 deaths recorded \u2013 100 more than this time last year, which saw a record-breaking 1,051 killed over the whole of 2013. Since 2005, there has been a surge in poaching in Africa, fuelled largely by demand from some south Asian countries where people believe properties of the horns are able to cure diseases such as cancer. South Africa, which is home to about 80% of the world&apos;s rhino population, signed an agreement with neighbouring Mozambique in April to tackle the issue.

It began with the news that the foreign secretary William Hague was departing, before the No 10 spin machine went into overdrive to make much of the new female entrants in cabinet.

Home field The 2014 World Cup is over. But what future do all those shiny new Brazilian stadiums have? Of the 12 that were built or renovated for the World Cup, CityLab reports that four will likely struggle to attract the crowds needed to support their massive upkeep costs.  Casa Futebol, an architectural proposal from 1 Week 1 Project, suggests converting the stadiums into housing complexes, while leaving the fields empty for occasional football games. Affordability, fire safety and outright feasibility are all restrictive issues, however. Sometimes dismissed as \u201cwhimsical\u201d, creative solutions like this are necessary to address Brazil&apos;s severe housing shortage, especially for the low-income communities who were displaced by the stadiums in the first place. Chinese urbanism ... in Africa China is well-known for its rapid urban development projects, but these efforts are not simply focused inside its borders \u2013 Chinese urbanism is being exported to Africa. Metropolis explains that while Chinese developments may offer vital housing and infrastructure quickly in growing African cities, they present both social and economic problems. Many developments do not relate to the local context, the article argues, including the Great Wall Apartments in Nairobi that &quot;look exactly like housing units found across China&quot;. Furthermore, Chinese companies are often able to undercut African competitors, resulting in a loss of local jobs and businesses. Furniture for the homeless A new project in Vancouver is providing multi-functional street furniture that serves as sleeping places for the homeless, including benches that transform into temporary rain shelters. There has been much discussion lately about tactics such as \u201canti-homeless\u201d spikes and other defensive urban architecture that deters perceived undesirable behaviour in cities. \u201cThe campaign shows that a city can be more open and hospitable to the homeless,\u201d Pop-Up City reports \u2013 though the project is currently running only for one month. Street or road: what&apos;s the difference? Drive, boulevard, avenue, close, crescent ... ever thought about why exactly we have so many names for what are essentially all city streets, and whether they actually mean anything? Canada.com has, and has gone to the trouble of building an interactive map that reveals how Toronto is organised by road type (broadly speaking, streets and roads are arteries and avenues are veins, though there is plenty of discrepancy). The resulting pattern is a reflection of Toronto&apos;s urban planning history, and there&apos;s a similar one for Vancouver here.  Blowing away Mexico&apos;s pollution Mexico City is another city that underwent exponential growth in the second half of the 20th century; it is now home to approximately 20 million people. With this growth came one of the city&apos;s most defining issues: pollution. In uncube magazine, Tatiana Bilbao describes the range of ideas that have emerged over the years to solve the city&apos;s pollution problem, from a programme curbing car use and relocation of industry to the installation of giant ventilators to blow the polluted air away from the valley. \u201cIt will take a very big wind to blow all its problems away,\u201d Bilbao writes of her city, \u201cand maybe wind is simply not enough.\u201d The piece is illustrated with a gallery of aerial photographs showing the huge scale of the city, and the rest of the magazine beautifully explores the architecture and urban life of Mexico&apos;s capital. Tokyo&apos;s &quot;water stress&quot; Tokyo is the largest \u201cwater-stressed\u201d city in the word, according to the Nature Conservancy. The findings, reported by Fast Co Exist, show that one out of every four cities in the world has a stressed water supply, often exacerbated by rapid urbanisation. \u201cTokyo is a wealthy city with a well-run water system, but there&apos;s not a lot of room to deal with drought,\u201d the article explains. \u201cThe next step for Tokyo, if water stress becomes too large of a problem, would likely be to build costly desalination plants that can turn sea water into drinking water.\u201d How can Brazil address its housing shortage \u2013 or Mexico City solve its pollution problem?

Hall is Britain&apos;s leading designer of marching banners for trade unions and other campaign groups, an odd sort of career into which he stumbled more than 30 years ago (by training, he is an architect). But Hall is also, thanks to an ongoing collaboration with Jeremy Deller, the Turner prize-winning artist who represented Britain at the 2013 Venice Biennale, fairly used to seeing his work in galleries. &quot;Basel, Venice, Paris\u2026 Jeremy has given me some of the most amazing experiences of my life,&quot; he says. &quot;I made 50 banners for his exhibition [From One Revolution to Another, 2008] at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. Just to wander through that city knowing I&apos;d work to do there! It was wonderful.&quot;            Deller discovered Hall a decade ago at the Lambeth country show in Brockwell Park, south London; the banner that caught his eye \u2013 it eventually appeared in Deller&apos;s show Folk Archive \u2013 commemorated the Brixton bomb of 1999 and an anti-racist march that followed it. In the years since, Hall has made him many hundreds more. &quot;They&apos;ve become a bit of a motif in my work,&quot; Deller says. &quot;Though it must be boring for Ed because I often ask for very simple text banners.&quot; Hall nods. &quot;That&apos;s true. For Venice, I was hoping to get the Salute and the Lagoon. But there was none of that, sadly.&quot; Hand-sewn union banners are unique to these islands, perhaps because \u2013 this is Hall&apos;s theory \u2013 in Catholic Europe, people put their efforts into stitching for saints&apos; days: &quot;When the trade unions came along, they adopted the pictorial imagery of the Bible \u2013 rising suns and so on \u2013 without having to worry about the church.&quot; His favourite banners, though, are those made by the suffragettes in their own ateliers. Does he feel he must work within the traditions, or is he keen to suggest new iconography? &quot;Not really. Most of the groups that commission me want dignity and gravitas in their banners, and that&apos;s what I&apos;m interested in too. I don&apos;t think you could successfully make a jokey banner.&quot; Has he ever made one for a right-wing group? &quot;Well, the Countryside Alliance have never asked. But I wouldn&apos;t make one that, say, promoted grammar schools. Then again, I wouldn&apos;t make a Stalinist banner either.&quot; Come and hear Jeremy Deller speak at the Observer Ideas festival          Given the history of the past 25 years, in which union power has grown ever more limited, it is perhaps surprising to hear how busy Hall is. &quot;The order book is always just at the point of panic. I&apos;ve got eight to do at the moment, including one for Newcastle RMT which will have the Tyne and its bridges in it.&quot; So Deller must wait in line? They laugh, but no answer is forthcoming.

Grim news today. MH17 World anger is growing at Russia for not forcing pro-Russian rebels to cooperate in allowing international experts to examine the scene of the MH17 air disaster, in which 298 people were killed when their passenger plane was shot out of the sky. 198 bodies have reportedly been moved from the crash site, to be stored in refrigerated railway carriages. Three pro-Russia rebel leaders are at the centre of suspicions over the downed plane, and US secretary of state John Kerry has laid out the evidence against pro-Russian separatists on US television. Tony Abbott has said Russia cannot &quot;wash its hands&quot; of the tragedy, adding: &quot;My fear is that Russia will say the right thing but that on the ground interference with the site, interference with investigators, interference with the dignified treatment of bodies will continue.&quot; It has been claimed that MH17 was guided off its course in the hope of avoiding thunderstorms, explaining why the plane was miles north of its previous flight paths through the area. At a special mass in Sydney, Bishop Peter Comensoli remembered Australian victims, calling the disaster &quot;the outcome of a trail of human evil&quot;, while in Moscow ordinary Russians are expressing horror at the tragedy. Sky News has apologised after one of its presenters was shown rifling through hand luggage belonging to a passenger.

Photograph: Mohammed Abed/AFP/Getty Images    Israel has killed scores of people in Shujai&apos;iya, a suburb of Gaza City, in a deadly assault that has left bodies littering the streets.   At least 87 Palestinians were killed yesterday in the bloodiest day of the recent conflict, overwhelming hospitals.  A Palestinian human rights group has accused Israel of using flechette shells, which spray out thousands of tiny and potentially lethal metal darts.  Groups of Israelis have gathered on hilltops close to the Gaza border to watch and cheer as bombs fall, and an Israeli soldier has posted what appears to be a photograph showing a Palestinian child in the crosshairs of a sniper rifle to Instagram.  International efforts to secure a ceasefire are focusing on Qatar, whose close links to Hamas could help it to mediate the conflict.  Our Gaza correspondent Peter Beaumont writes about his experience of the conflict, and especially of its impact on the children of Gaza: &quot;A few minutes later I come across the dead children&apos;s sister, a girl aged about seven with a long dark ponytail, cheeks glistening with tears.

For ever. The museum, which reopened last month after two years&apos; renovation work, will no longer allow Vermeer&apos;s masterpiece out. Officially the Mona Lisa of the North has been gated in order to please visitors to the Mauritshuis who only want to see that painting. Its fame has steadily increased since Tracy Chevalier published her novel in 1999 followed in 2004 by the film by Peter Webber starring Scarlett Johansson. Anyone wanting to see the portrait will have make the trip to the Dutch city. Girl with a Pearl Earring thus joins the select band of art treasures that never see the outside world. Botticelli&apos;s Birth of Venus never leaves the Uffizi in Florence; Las Meninas by Vel\u00e1zquez stays put at the Prado in Madrid; Picasso&apos;s Guernica remains just down the road at the Reina Sofia museum; and his Demoiselles d&apos;Avignon can only be seen at MoMA in New York. Other sedentary art works include La Joie de Vivre by Matisse, Le Facteur Roulin by Van Gogh and Les Joueurs de Cartes by C\u00e9zanne, which are unlikely ever to leave the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia. It is impossible for the Isenheim altarpiece to leave the Unterlinden museum in Colmar, or for Degas&apos; Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans to escape from the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC. Needless to say, the Mona Lisa is under lock and key in the Louvre, Paris. So why are all these famous pieces so stay-at-home? Predictably the principal reason is their state of health. Many of them, including the Mona Lisa, were painted on wood and are very sensitive to climatic changes, making travel a major worry. This is equally true of anything made of wax, as is the case with Degas&apos; original Danseuse, which is dressed in a silk bodice, a tutu and slippers, with a wig of real hair. &quot;We cannot even imagine a situation in which we might loan it,&quot; says Deborah Ziska, head of public information at the National Gallery of Art. The versions seen elsewhere \u2013 in the Musee d&apos;Orsay or the Metropolitan, for example \u2013 are bronze casts made in 1922, five years after the artist&apos;s death. Many 19th-century paintings are fragile. &quot;They were the victims of artists testing new materials which aged badly,&quot; says S\u00e9bastien Allard, head of the painting department at the Louvre. For instance, when G\u00e9ricault painted Le Radeau de la M\u00e9duse, he used Judea bitumen as a primer. It took so long to dry that tiny cracks have formed on the surface. As it happens, just the size of the painting (4.9 metres by 7.2 metres) makes it impossible to remove from the museum. The canvas would have to be rolled up, a practice most curators now consider far too risky. Many paintings in the Louvre never move, due to their dimensions. &quot;When we wanted to restore Veronese&apos;s Wedding Feast at Cana (6.8 metres by 9.9 metres) or La Bataille d&apos;Eylau by Gros (5.2m by 7.8m) we put up scaffolding and screens, and the restorers worked on the spot,&quot; Allard explains. &quot;In the early 1990s, to move David&apos;s Sacre de Napol\u00e9on (6.8 metres by 9.8 metres) from the Mollien room to the Daru room, we had to cut notches in the door frames; otherwise it wouldn&apos;t have gone through.&quot; Loaning these king-size works to other museums is obviously unthinkable.     Crowds view Pablo Picasso's Guernica at the Reina Sofia museum in Madrid, Spain. Photograph: Denis Doyle/AP    Weight is a problem too. The job of restoring the Winged Victory of Samothrace is a case in point. The statue alone weighs 32 tonnes, not counting the 23 blocks of marble that make up the pedestal. There is no question of transporting it to the laboratory of the Centre for Research and Restoration of the Museums of France, at the other end of the Louvre. After 10 years&apos; hesitation and preparation, it has finally been moved almost next door to undergo restoration. But the last wishes of donors represent the most pressing constraint. When they leave their treasures to a museum many collectors impose strict conditions. The Van Gogh paintings at Mus\u00e9e d&apos;Orsay donated by Paul Gachet&apos;s son can only be lent to another institution for retrospectives. Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l&apos;herbe by Manet and Les Coquelicots  by Monet , which originally belonged to Etienne Moreau-N\u00e9laton, cannot be shown anywhere else. &quot;The same rule applies to La Jeune Fille au Jardin, by Mary Cassatt, for which we receive many applications,&quot; says Xavier Rey, head of collections at the Mus\u00e9e d&apos;Orsay. &quot;We always say no because the painting, along with our finest pointillist Pissarros, belongs to the group of works bequeathed by Antonin Personnaz, with no scope for loans. Obviously we always comply with the conditions for a donation, if only as a matter of respect, not to mention legality. But also not to put off future donors.&quot; This is an important consideration, because as all curators know well, museum collections would not be what they are without the generosity of private collectors. The most extreme restrictions often concern museums set up by private collectors. Convinced that their collection is a work in its own right, they confine it forever behind the walls of an institution. Witness the Wallace Collection in London (one of the finest sets of 14th- to 19th-century paintings, including Fragonard&apos;s delightful Swing). The same applies to two-thirds of the Frick Collection in New York (the fortunate owner of three of the 37 known Vermeers). Albert Barnes, a successful pharmacist from Philadelphia, forbade his foundation from lending anything or even making minor changes to the disposition of his 2,500 works, which include 150 by Renoir, 69 by C\u00e9zanne, 60 by Matisse, several dozen by Picasso, not to mention some superb pieces by Monet, Toulouse-Lautrec and Van Gogh ... and the world&apos;s most beautiful Seurat, Les Poseuses. The Duc d&apos;Aumale, the fifth son of King Louis-Philippe, gave his estate at Chantilly to the Institut de France, along with his collection, which included three paintings by Raphael, three by Fra Angelico, five by Ingres and more works by Clouet than even the Louvre. They draw art enthusiasts from around the world. But this may not be good news for the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9. &quot;The world of museums is highly competitive. It&apos;s a real handicap not to be able to loan works,&quot; says Nicole Garnier, the head of the museum. &quot;It&apos;s quite simple, if you don&apos;t lend to others they won&apos;t lend to you.&quot; Which means it is difficult to stage exhibitions that attract the general public. Curators must work very hard to organise events that will draw local visitors, and convince them to repeat their visit, one of the key challenges for museums today. &quot;In scientific terms it really is a pity not to be able to take part in major international shows,&quot; Garnier adds. &quot;That&apos;s where art history is happening now, through the confrontation of works.&quot; A well-designed exhibition does not simply bring together paintings or sculptures; it should also be an opportunity for curators to confront and examine works close-up, some of which were created centuries apart. Or to gauge the influence of one artist over another. &quot;We [have sent] The Burial of Casagemas to the Prado for an exhibition on El Greco, who was a major inspiration for Picasso,&quot; says Sophie Krebs, head of collections at the Mus\u00e9e d&apos;Art Moderne in Paris. &quot;The museum in Madrid has nothing to lend us in return, but it&apos;s a very useful contact.&quot;     In 2013 Titian's Venus of Urbino was moved from the Uffizi in Florence to Venice after the museum's curator yielded to a request by then Italian premier Mario Monti. Photograph: Nicola Lorusso/Alinari Archives/Corbis    Some masterpieces are not quite as immovable as one would be led to believe. There is growing pressure for them to venture outside their safe havens, the number of exhibitions having steadily increased since the second world war and rising steeply since the 1980s. Not only are museums in need of funds, but they also have an image to promote. For example Daniel Percheron, the leader of the Nord-Pas de Calais regional council, is determined that the Louvre in Lens should one day exhibit the Mona Lisa. Even the biggest attractions have to move sometimes. During the second world war the immovable Winged Victory was taken to the Ch\u00e2teau de Valencay, near Ch\u00e2teauroux, and the lady with the inscrutable smile was hidden under a curator&apos;s bed. Museums sometimes have to close for repair work, and rather than putting paintings in storage curators rent them out, to pay for part of the work. So the terms of Barnes&apos;s will did not prevent part of the collection going on a rewarding tour in the 1990s. &quot;A curator is by definition a rather schizophrenic character,&quot; Rey asserts. &quot;It is their duty to protect their charge \u2013 which taken to its logical extreme means putting everything in the freezer \u2013 but also to show it to the largest possible audience.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s all a question of balancing risks and benefits,&quot; says curator David Cueco. &quot;For example Delaunay&apos;s Equipe de Cardiff wasn&apos;t in very good shape when Suzanne Pag\u00e9, head of the Paris Mus\u00e9e d&apos;Art Moderne, agreed to lend it to the MoMA for the High and Low show. But her move opened the way for some great Rothko paintings we&apos;d never seen in France.&quot; Lastly, curators are not immune to political pressure. In 2013, Antonio Natali, head of the Uffizi Gallery, allowed Titian&apos;s Venus of Urbino to be shown in Venice, yielding to the Italian premier, Mario Monti, in person. It was a symbolically powerful moment, the aim being to compare the old master with Manet&apos;s Olympia, the painting it had inspired, loaned by the Orsay. Even the Mona Lisa has taken part in two diplomatic missions, to New York in 1963 and Tokyo in 1974, stopping off on her way back in Moscow. Each time it was due to a request by the French president, against the curators&apos; recommendations. Would that be possible now? &quot;I doubt it,&quot; says Allard. &quot;Above all for its own protection. The context has changed too. There are far more visitors now: 9.3 million a year, compared with a few hundred thousand in those days. And over two-thirds are foreign visitors often on a once-in-a-lifetime outing to the Louvre ... to see the Mona Lisa.&quot; It would be terrible to disappoint them, just as for Girl with a Pearl Earring in The Hague. &quot;Museums are increasingly inclined to turn their masterpieces into icons, and in so doing into tools for communication,&quot; says arts management consultant Jean-Michel Tobelem. &quot;Successfully so, what&apos;s more. The opposite extreme is the Pompidou Centre, which is packed with fabulous art none of which has come to symbolise the museum. Which is probably why there&apos;s rarely a big queue for the permanent collection. It&apos;s hard to strike a balance between investing excessive importance in specific pieces and the need for fame.&quot; To be on the safe side it is probably best to book ahead for the Mauritshuis.

Working with JP Aerospace, the Tokyo artist has sent a bonsai tree, orchids, lilies and other plants into the stratosphere, suspended in a balloon. The resulting images beautifully state the mystery of life on Earth. Makoto claims that by putting them on the borders of space, beyond their earthly home, he has transformed them into &quot;exobiotanica&quot;, extraterrestrial plant life. But to me, these images dramatise the startling nature of planet Earth itself. Until liveable atmospheres and chemical indicators of organic life are detected on planets beyond the solar system \u2013 which may happen soon as astronomy becomes ever more refined \u2013 we don&apos;t know of any other planet that is alive. The richness of Earth&apos;s living forms is gorgeously apparent in Makoto&apos;s arrangements of brightly-coloured flowers taken up from the ground that is their home to be seen against the darkness of space. Ever since William Anders of Apollo 8 took a photograph of the blue planet rising over the moon in 1968, that iconic shot known as Earthrise, the image of Earth from space has deepened humanity&apos;s sense of our planet as a quasi-living thing. It is surely no coincidence that James Lovelock announced the Gaia hypothesis, which understands Earth that way, in 1973, in the wake of the Apollo missions and their new view of Earth. Yet long before anyone actually saw the Earth from space, artists in China, Japan and Europe intuited that all life here is mysteriously intertwined: that the planet resembles a spaceship nurturing its passengers. Great landscape pictures, from Fan Kuan&apos;s Travellers Among Mountains and Streams (painted in around 1000AD) to Rubens&apos; The Rainbow Landscape (painted about 1636) and Hokusai&apos;s 35 Views of Mount Fuji (created as coloured woodblock prints from about 1830 to 1835), again and again imagine life as an abundant interlinked system between sky and Earth.

The monument, dedicated to Koreans who died after being brought to Japan to work in coalmines and factories amid a wartime labour shortage, was erected by a friendship society in a public park in 2004. The government in Gunma prefecture, north-west of Tokyo, has ordered it removed after what the Asahi Shimbun newspaper described as petitions from &quot;anti-Korean&quot; groups and individuals complaining that it was anti-Japanese and had become the focus of political activity in a publicly owned space. Part of the inscription, written in Japanese and Korean, reads: &quot;We hereby express our determination not to repeat the same mistake by remembering and reflecting on the historical fact that our country inflicted tremendous damage and suffering on Koreans in the past.&quot; Many of the 600,000 ethnic Koreans living in Japan are the descendants of labourers who remained in the country after its defeat in 1945. The Gunma assembly adopted a resolution to remove the monument after accepting criticism that it had been the focus for political activity during a memorial service in 2012. Prefectural authorities said they would refuse to extend the monument&apos;s 10-year licence if the friendship society failed to remove it voluntarily. Giichi Tsunoda, a former upper house MP and representative of the group that commissioned the monument, said the officials had acted unreasonably. &quot;The gathering is a memorial event and the prefectural government&apos;s decision to remove the monument is tantamount to abusing its authority,&quot; Tsunoda said. &quot;Its conclusion that the gathering was politically motivated is also arbitrary.&quot; Commemorating the use of forced labour is causing similar controversy in other parts of Japan. In Nagasaki, a row has erupted over a proposed monument to Korean victims of the atomic bombing of the city in August 1945. A draft text of the epitaph reportedly condemns imperial Japan for its use of slave labour. The controversies are being played out against a rise in anti-Korean sentiment in Japan, fuelled by disputes between Tokyo and Seoul over territory and Japan&apos;s conduct during its 1910-1945 occupation of the Korean peninsula. The UN human rights committee has called on Japan to do more to clamp down on hate speech directed at Koreans during demonstrations in Tokyo and other cities. The committee, which noted that there were more than 360 such demonstrations and speeches last year, mainly in Korean neighbourhoods in Tokyo, is expected to make recommendations to Japan on Wednesday, possibly including the introduction of legislation against hate speech. On Wednesday, officials from both countries met in Seoul to discuss Japan&apos;s use of as many as 200,000 mainly Korean and Chinese women as sex slaves before and during the war. Japan recently ruled out a revision to a 1993 official apology, but suggested that the statement was the result of a political compromise and not an accurate reflection of Japanese involvement in wartime sex slavery. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is one of several prominent conservative politicians who have questioned claims that the imperial Japanese army coerced the women \u2013 euphemistically referred to as comfort women \u2013 into working in frontline brothels."}, {"sentences": ["In Tokyo during the early 1950s, he created the Bathroom series (1953-54), which depicted naked figures in various states of mutilation, in a tiled room with slug-like creatures crawling on the floor and walls."], "tags": ["Art", "Painting", "Art and design", "Culture", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "New York", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-24T09:50:41Z", "title": "On Kawara obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jul/24/on-kawara", "article": "The Japanese artist On Kawara, who has died aged 81, would not have wanted an obituary like this. He would have preferred the page to be left blank except for his name and the number of days he had been alive. He was preoccupied with the passing of time, and when asked for his biography for an exhibition catalogue he would respond simply with the number of days elapsed between his date of birth and the date of the exhibition opening. This was consistent with the existentialist proposition of his work: that human life does not add up to anything beyond itself. He explored the nature of our consciousness, enhanced by a kind of meditation on living through time. His most famous work, the Today Series (1966\u20132014), is an accumulation of thousands of &quot;Date Paintings&quot;. In these works the date on which the painting was made is meticulously painted in white sans serif text, at the centre of a canvas coated with flat colour, with the month spelled out in the language of the place where it was made (unless the Roman alphabet was not used for the first language, in which case Kawara resorted to Esperanto). The paintings were produced in more than 112 cities worldwide. If a Date Painting was not finished by the end of the day, by midnight, he would destroy it. In 1997, the Pure Consciousness project saw Date Paintings installed in nursery classrooms in 21 locations from Abidjan to Istanbul, from Reykjavik to a rainforest in Colombia. Pure Consciousness suggested an aspiration to the condition of children&apos;s perception, a consciousness that has not yet been mediated or habituated by experience. It\u00a0is a work that is key to our understanding of Karawa&apos;s artistic practice. The same could be said for One Million Years [Past] (1969), a book in which the years 998,031BC to AD1969 were spelled out in typewritten text. This was followed, in 1981, by One Million Years [Future], which included the years AD1996 to AD1,001,995. Together these volumes cover 2m years, consisting of 10 volumes and 20,000 pages each. The subtitle for One Million Years [Past] is &quot;For all those who have lived and died&quot;; for One Million Years [Future] it is &quot;For the last one&quot;. The work reminds us that our time is short within the universal scheme of things, not only as individuals but also as a species.     A continuous reading lasting seven days and nights in 2004 of On Kawara's One Million Years [Past] and [Future] in Trafalgar Square, London.  Photograph: Chris Young/PA    There have been many public readings from the One Million Years books, most notably at Documenta 2002 and on Trafalgar Square in 2004. Another will be a central feature of the forthcoming retrospective at the Guggenheim in New York, opening in February 2015. The son of an engineer father, he was born On Kawahara in Kariya, near Nagoya, Japan. He was a high school student there when the second world war ended with the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, events that had a profound impact on his formation as an artist. In Tokyo during the early 1950s, he created the Bathroom series (1953-54), which depicted naked figures in various states of mutilation, in a tiled room with slug-like creatures crawling on the floor and walls. Kawara settled in New York in 1964, and his later work is devoid of such overt references to the horrors of war, but it is informed by them. The telegrams he frequently sent to friends and acquaintances, for example, were often inscribed simply &quot;I am Still Alive&quot; \u2013 for a serial work ongoing from 1970 until telegrams became obsolete. This preoccupation with mortality could be read as a legacy of the nuclear cataclysms wreaked on Japan. Kawara did not attend exhibition openings, as it was his conviction that his art work was not about him. In the same spirit, he did not want to be photographed or interviewed and (with some youthful exceptions) did not publish statements. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to think of him as a recluse. On the contrary, he enjoyed the company of others, and he laughed a lot. In 2006 I visited him at his Paris apartment, where we watched the world cup, played that year in Germany. Amused by the unusual amount of obvious play acting and faked injuries, instead of gambling on teams winning or losing, he made bets with me about the number of times paramedics would be called on to the pitch during matches. He is survived by his wife and two children. \u2022 On Kawara, artist, 29,771 days between late December 1932 and late June 2014"}, {"sentences": ["In 2008, a woman in Tokyo realised her virtual husband had divorced her without warning, and as revenge she used the man&apos;s login information to delete his avatar."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "UK news", "Role playing games", "World of Warcraft", "PC", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-24T13:13:31Z", "title": "Should thieves in World of Warcraft be sent to real prisons?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2014/jul/24/thieves-world-warcraft-real-prisons-tory-mike-weatherley", "article": "All right, own up: did you steal Mike Weatherley&apos;s sword on World of Warcraft?

Weatherley, the MP for Hove, East Sussex and a Warcraft player himself, says that since players can spend serious amounts of real-world cash on items, even though they exist only online, they should be offered the same protection as victims of theft in the world of solid objects. &quot;If you&apos;ve spent \u00a3500 building up your armed forces and someone takes them away online, I guess you can feel hard done-by and you want your \u00a3500 back,&quot; he told Buzzfeed. He also pointed out: &quot;The perception from some people is that if you steal online it&apos;s less of a crime than if you steal physically.&quot; It&apos;s hard to argue with his logic. Gamers spend a lot of money on virtual items, and invest time in building armed forces or gigantic warships. These things may be nothing more than a collection of pixels on a screen, but the money isn&apos;t virtual, and neither is the time, or the feeling of having been robbed. There are international precedents for giving virtual items real-world value in the courts. In 2008, a woman in Tokyo realised her virtual husband had divorced her without warning, and as revenge she used the man&apos;s login information to delete his avatar. Essentially, it was virtual murder, though she was jailed for &quot;illegally accessing a computer and manipulating electronic data&quot;. In the same year, two Dutch teens were also found guilty of forcing a younger player to log into his RuneScape account and hand over an amulet and a mask, the digital-age version of stealing another kid&apos;s lunch money. The Dutch court ruled: &quot;These virtual goods are goods (under Dutch law), so this is theft.&quot; However, it&apos;s hard not to feel Weatherley&apos;s argument crumbled a little bit when he said that if it was &quot;a minor thing, a \u00a35 item&quot;, he wouldn&apos;t waste the authorities&apos; time \u2013 &quot;but if I found someone doing it a thousand times over, then it&apos;s obviously a problem.&quot; So, whoever stole 1,000 wizard robes from Weatherley, he&apos;s coming after you \u2013 with the full force of the real-life law."}, {"sentences": ["Professor Shin-ichi Hayama, at the Nippon Veterinary and Life Science University in Tokyo, told the Guardian that during Japan\u2019s snowy winters the monkeys feed on tree buds and bark, where caesium has been shown to accumulate at high concentrations."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan", "Wildlife", "Environment", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Asia Pacific", "Japan disaster", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-24T15:34:36Z", "title": "Japanese monkeys' abnormal blood linked to Fukushima disaster \u2013 study", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/24/japanese-monkeys-abnormal-blood-linked-to-fukushima-disaster-study", "article": "Wild monkeys in the Fukushima region of Japan have blood abnormalities linked to the radioactive fall-out from the 2011 nuclear power plant disaster, according to a new scientific study that may help increase the understanding of radiation on human health. The Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) were found to have low white and red blood cell levels and low haemoglobin, which the researchers say could make them more prone to infectious diseases.  But critics of the study say the link between the abnormal blood tests and the radiation exposure of the monkeys remains unproven and that the radiation doses may have been too small to cause the effect. The scientists compared 61 monkeys living 70km (44 miles) from the the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant with 31 monkeys from the Shimokita Penisula, over 400km (249 miles) from Fukushima. The Fukushima monkeys had low blood counts and radioactive caesium in their bodies, related to caesium levels in the soils where they lived. No caesium was detected in the Shimokita troop. Professor Shin-ichi Hayama, at the Nippon Veterinary and Life Science University in Tokyo, told the Guardian that during Japan\u2019s snowy winters the monkeys feed on tree buds and bark, where caesium has been shown to accumulate at high concentrations.  \u201cThis first data from non-human primates \u2014 the closest taxonomic relatives of humans \u2014 should make a notable contribution to future research on the health effects of radiation exposure in humans,\u201d he said. The work, which ruled out disease or malnutrition as a cause of the low blood counts, is published in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports. White blood cell counts were lowest for immature monkeys with the highest caesium concentrations, suggesting younger monkeys may be more vulnerable to radioactive contamination. Hayama noted: \u201cAbnormalities such as a decreased blood cell count in people living in contaminated areas have been reported from Chernobyl as a long-term effect of low-dose radiation exposure.\u201d But other blood measures did not correlate with caesium levels, which vary with the seasons. Prof Geraldine Thomas, at Imperial College London, said the Chernobyl studies were not \u201cnot regarded as scientifically validated\u201d and that the correlations between the caesium and low blood counts in the Fukushima study were not statistically strong. \u201cUnfortunately this is yet another paper with insufficient power to distinguish real effects and relevance to human health,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that one of the most damaging health effects comes from fear of radiation, not radiation itself.\u201d She also noted that people, unlike the monkeys, could avoid eating contaminated food from the Fukushima region. Another critic, Prof Jim Smith, at the University of Portsmouth, said: \u201cI am highly sceptical of the claim. The levels of radiocaesium in the Fukushima monkeys are about the same as those found in sheep in some parts of the UK following the Chernobyl accident, i.e. extremely low in terms of damage to the animals themselves. I think it much more likely that the apparently low blood cell counts are caused by something other than radiation.\u201d Prof Hayama said that caesium levels were used as an indicator of the radiation exposure of the monkeys. \u201cThe low haematological values in the Fukushima monkeys could have therefore been due to the effect of any radioactive materials,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did not conclude the low-blood cell counts are caused by caesium but so far we cannot find other reasons except radiation.\u201d Engineers at Fukushima are currently working to contain thousands of tonnes of irradiated water groundwater by next March by surrounding the four damaged reactors by an underground frozen wall. Other research published on Wednesday showed children, teenagers and young adults living near two UK nuclear power stations since the 1990s are not at an increased risk of developing cancer."}, {"sentences": ["\u201cThe blatant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been pointed out very clearly by the UN\u2019s commissioner for human rights,&quot; Amos told the Guardian during a visit to Tokyo, where she was attending a conference on improving responses to humanitarian crises in the Asia-Pacific."], "tags": ["Gaza", "Israel", "United Nations", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-25T04:53:21Z", "title": "Gaza: attack on UN school 'appalling', says humanitarian chief", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/25/gaza-attack-on-un-school-appalling-says-humanitarian-chief", "article": "Valerie Amos, the UN\u2019s top humanitarian official, has described Israel\u2019s deadly attack on a United Nations school in northern Gaza on Thursday as \u201cappalling\u201d and warned that conditions for civilians taking shelter at UN facilities were quickly deteriorating amid shortages of food and water.

It\u2019s clearly something that is not winnable \u2026 you\u2019re going to have more and more civilians who are caught in the middle of this, and that has got to be our focus right now. \u201cWe\u2019re all using all of the different networks and contacts that we have to try to bring about some kind of shift in the situation.

The survey also confirmed some national stereotypes. Beer was cheapest in Germany, while New Yorkers have the lowest prices for Coca-Cola. Potatoes are a bargain, guess where, in Ireland. And Britain? We have the cheapest bananas. Europeans generally fared better than North Americans or Australians. The vast prairies of the US make it the bread basket of the world, yet shoppers in New York pay twice the price for a loaf of bread than those in London or Berlin. In Toronto, sky-high prices for meat pushed a typical trolley of goods to the highest in the survey. We don&apos;t claim our survey is an exhaustive or scientific analysis of grocery prices around the world. We asked our correspondents and contributors in the seven cities to go to their usual supermarket \u2013 which may not necessarily be the cheapest. Kaiser&apos;s in Berlin is pricier than Lidl. Auchan may not have had the same offers as Carrefour in Paris. We created the shopping list in London, and it inevitably reflects British purchasing habits. Fresh milk appears madly expensive in Paris \u2013 more than double the price charged in London \u2013 but the French buy relatively little fresh milk, preferring UHT instead. We tried to match items as closely as possible, yet local variations make comparisons difficult. Some chains offer ultra-cheap &quot;basics&quot; items, such as Tesco&apos;s &quot;everyday value&quot; sliced white bread, which at 47p a loaf is one third the price of Kingsmill wholemeal bread. Parisians might turn up their noses at such low-cost items \u2013 in Auchan, loaves started at around \u00a31.40, but they are probably a very different product to English sliced white. And how should we account for local tastes? In London, our shopper bought cheddar, in Paris it was camembert and in Berlin, gouda. We didn&apos;t even try to compare with Shanghai or Tokyo, where dairy products remain a very infrequent purchase. New York presented the biggest challenge. Our shopper used a mix of local stores \u2013 reflecting the fact that while Londoners might see a Tesco on every major shopping street, New Yorkers do not have a Walmart on their doorsteps. Interestingly, our New York and Toronto shoppers specified that they had bought &quot;free from hormones&quot; meat; in the EU, beef with injected hormones is banned. Finally, fluctuating exchange rates make price comparisons treacherous. Both the Australian and Canadian dollars rapidly appreciated against sterling, and although the pound has recovered some ground this year, it is still a long way below its peak \u2013 making prices in those countries appear very high, although compared with local wages they are much less so. However, the examples below do represent the experience of local people in real supermarkets, and give a flavour of who is, and who isn&apos;t (that&apos;s you, Canada) getting a good deal. Berlin Cheapest for bread, butter, eggs, sugar, apples, olive oil, beer, toilet paper Pricey for almost nothing     berlin    The Guardian&apos;s Berlin correspondent Philip Oltermann and his partner (above) went shopping at Kaiser&apos;s, a pricier and more upmarket chain than fellow German giants such as Lidl or Aldi \u2013 yet he was still charged significantly less than at any other supermarket we surveyed around the world. Most German supermarkets have copied the discounters, offering cheap prices on milk and meat, and as in Britain, there has been a significant shift from branded to own-brand goods. &quot;Whereas both Lidl and Aldi are enjoying runaway success abroad, their situation has been less comfortable in Germany,&quot; says Oltermann. &quot;If anything, the past few years have seen a trend of shoppers moving away from discounters towards premium supermarkets like Edeka and Rewe, many of whom have copied their cheaper rivals&apos; success and offer own-brand goods. According to Germany&apos;s biggest market research institute, GfK, the percentage of branded goods across German supermarkets has sunk by 9% since 2008.&quot; Meanwhile, German shopping habits are evolving fast. According to a GfK survey from October last year the number of people who say they deliberately buy less so they don&apos;t have to throw away has risen from 44% to 52% since 2010. &quot;Demographic change plays a crucial role in this trend. In Germany, the number of large households who do their weekly shop in one go is shrinking. Young, single-household shoppers tend to shop more spontaneously, and are more likely to ignore supermarkets altogether in favour of eating out, or do their shopping at local markets.&quot; London Cheapest for milk, bananas, baked beans, cornflakes, carrots Pricey for mince, wine, cheese, Coca-Cola     london    London may be viewed internationally as a very expensive city, but in our survey it was second cheapest for groceries. Some things appear crazily cheap \u2013 for example, bananas in Tesco are half the price of those at Auchan in Paris and a quarter of those in Loblaws in Toronto. Milk is also a fraction of the price charged in other international cities, and eggs too. But these super-low prices have attracted controversy. When Tesco slashed the price of a four-pint 2.27 litre carton from \u00a31.39 to \u00a31 earlier this year, it prompted howls of outrage from dairy farmers. The Fairtrade Foundation says the price war over bananas is seriously damaging developing countries. But British shoppers fare poorly in some areas. Duties make wine prices high while, oddly, Tesco sells Coca-Cola at almost three times the price we found in New York. And what explains why Tesco sells beef lean steak mince for \u00a38 a kg in the UK , while in Dublin it sells Irish lean steak mince at \u00a34.31 a kg (mind you, that&apos;s about the only bargain in Ireland)? Money writer Jill Papworth (above) shops for her husband, son and daughter at Tesco, and reckons her bill is around \u00a3150 a week. She buys bread locally and has milk delivered. Like many British shoppers, she finds she has to play a cat-and-mouse game with Tesco&apos;s myriad offers (some real, some less authentic) to keep costs down. &quot;I only buy washing-up liquid when it&apos;s on offer, and then I buy in bulk. I do the same with the three-for-two offers. Every time I look at my bill I expect to see that I&apos;ve saved around \u00a35 from these offers, although how real they are I&apos;m not so sure.&quot; She could save more by switching to &quot;everyday&quot; basics, but is hesitant about the quality. &quot;I&apos;ve got quite a fussy family. I steer clear of a lot of the basics offers on food, although I&apos;m quite happy to buy own-brand on non-food items.&quot; Paris Cheapest for wine, onions Pricey for milk, lamb, bananas     paris    Freelance journalist Judith Prescott (above), who has lived in the French capital for two decades, shops at supermarket chain Auchan for her husband and two daughters, and reckons her bill is around \u20ac100 a week (\u00a379), although that doesn&apos;t include the fruit and veg she tends to buy in local markets. Prices, she says, have stayed fairly constant in recent years. &quot;For the French, culturally and psychologically, any real rise in living costs is reflected in the price of a baguette \u2013 still a daily purchase for many. A standard baguette costs around \u20ac0.90 at the local boulangerie, a figure that hasn&apos;t changed significantly for over two years.&quot; But the stereotype of French shoppers merrily heading from boulangerie to charcuterie doesn&apos;t quite ring true. &quot;Figures show 87% of French people prefer to shop for most items at the supermarket,&quot; says Prescott. The low cost of wine \u2013 and quality wine at that \u2013 helped to keep Paris towards the bottom of the table for the total cost of our basket of goods. &quot;Autumn sees annual wine fairs in most supermarkets, where you can stock up on cases of excellent, well-priced wines for a fraction of the price in the UK \u2013 with even a wine expert on hand to discuss the best bargains. But it&apos;s a struggle to buy what are termed &apos;foreign&apos; wines \u2013 those from Italy, Spain, Australia, Chile etc. You have to head to the dust-covered shelf at the back of the shop for those.&quot; The same goes for cheese. &quot;You will find a huge range of French cheeses at affordable prices such as brie at just \u20ac7.05 a kg, but again you won&apos;t find much that isn&apos;t French. For a nice chunk of mature cheddar, it&apos;s off to Marks &amp; Spencer, which has just reopened in Paris. On the downside, the cost of everyday toiletries is expensive. You won&apos;t get much change from \u20ac4 for a standard 250ml bottle of shampoo, and the same for a name-brand deodorant or shower gel.&quot; Prescott adds that French supermarkets rarely have the two-for-one or buy-one-get-one-free offers common in Britain. &quot;Instead shoppers are offered substantial discounts on a range of goods if they choose a particular brand. This earns points on their loyalty card, which are then converted into cash.&quot; Dublin Cheapest for potatoes, mince, peas Pricey for toothpaste, washing powder, dishwasher tablets, wine     dublin    During the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot; years, Ireland became renowned for eye-watering prices, with a hugely popular TV show called Rip-Off Republic reflecting despair over soaring costs for basic items. But despite the country&apos;s economic crash, our survey found groceries still remain significantly pricier than in other European capitals. Dublin may not quite be the mega-size of other cities featured in our survey, but is interesting because we were able to directly compare the prices at Tesco.com in the UK with virtually identical items (with identical packaging) at Tesco.ie in the Republic \u2013 and found some shocking differences. As is the case in Britain, Tesco is Ireland&apos;s biggest supermarket chain. Tesco eggs in Dublin are 44% pricier than in London. Tesco onions are 51% more. Weirdly, broccoli is 201% pricier (\u20ac5.35/\u00a34.22 per kg vs \u00a31.40 a kg). The same pack of Finish dishwasher tablets were half the price in the UK compared to Ireland. But it raises a cheer to see that potatoes, at 59p a kg, were the cheapest in our survey and compare to 80p a kg at Tesco in Britain. Dubliner Karen Murphy (above) reckons her family food spend is around \u20ac200 (\u00a3158) a week, spread over Tesco, Lidl and local butchers and fruit and veg markets. &quot;What is annoying is that we all get the British TV channels here, and we know from the adverts that we are paying way over the odds,&quot; she says. &quot;I tend to use Tesco for branded household goods such as shampoo, Lidl for things such as pasta and tinned tomatoes \u2013 and the local butchers for meat.&quot; Hard-pressed Irish shoppers, though, benefited from a vegetable price war that broke out between new arrivals Aldi, Lidl and local Dunnes Stores just before Christmas last year. Dunnes began offering 500g of Brussels sprouts, parsnips or clementines at just 6c (5p), while Lidl countered with a price of just 5c (4p) for a bag of potatoes, onions and carrots. &quot;It was mad. I got four bags of carrots for just 20c,&quot; says Murphy. But Irish farmers descended on the capital to protest, joined by smaller store keepers who saw their sales of vegetables decimated as shoppers switched to the discounters. New York Cheapest for Coca-Cola, cheese, rice Pricey for toilet paper, beer     new york    New York is unlike any other major world city in that the deep-discount supermarkets \u2013 such as Walmart and Costco \u2013 have zero presence in the city. Our survey, which showed that prices in New York were second highest after Toronto, gives a skewed picture of the United States overall. Many Manhattan residents shop at smaller stores, which don&apos;t have huge buying power, but they also tend to eat out more than residents in other capitals. Our shopper, Georganne MacCallum (above), an English teacher in Brooklyn, says keeping costs under control is a constant struggle, and that with four children her monthly grocery bill is typically $1,400 (\u00a3820). &quot;New York is not the easiest place to save money on groceries. We have many small grocery stores with limited choices. Now, we have a few newer, larger grocery stores, but they are higher priced because the quality of food is better (organic, free-range, hormone free). These stores have lower priced good-quality foods but few bargain brands to choose from. &quot;We eat a lot of whole foods, but limit our organic produce and meats because we just can&apos;t afford them. Fish is very expensive so it is not a regular product.&quot; Toronto Cheapest for salmon Pricey for almost everything else Canada&apos;s biggest city came out the surprise loser in our survey, with our basket of goods costing 40% more in Toronto than in Berlin. Meat prices were especially high, as was wine and beer. Canada, like Scandinavia, strictly controls the sale of liquor and has set minimum prices for alcohol, designed to reduce excessive drinking. High prices in Canada come as no surprise to local residents, who have long complained they pay more for groceries than their neighbours in the US. Critics say price competition is limited by the concentration of store ownership in just a few major chains. But some things in Canada are relatively low-cost, with salmon the lowest price in the survey. Our Toronto shopper, environmental consultant Nicola Crawhall, headed to Loblaws, Canada&apos;s biggest supermarket chain, where she shops for her partner, Nicky, and their two young boys. &quot;It is considered a bit upscale, but not quite as upscale as, say, Waitrose in Britain. Loblaws&apos; prices are fairly competitive, but it has irresistible speciality products that jack up the weekly shopping cost to well over $200 (\u00a3110) for our family of four. &quot;The grocery list provided by the Guardian was uncannily close to our regular shopping list, save for the leg of lamb (very expensive in Canada, and rarely fresh), the Coke (not good for the teeth!), and the chips (OK, we buy tortilla chips). &quot;The price of meat has skyrocketed this past year. Mince is so expensive that we buy one packet, not two, a week. Same with chicken breasts. Some weeks it is so expensive that I&apos;ll buy chicken thighs instead. I also buy hormone-free meat, which adds several dollars per pack. Meat easily adds $35-40 to my grocery bill. Sydney Cheapest for ice cream Pricey for tomatoes, coffee, cornflakes, oranges, apples, potatoes British tourists to Australia return home with stories of gob-smacking local prices \u2013 largely the result of the vertiginous rise in the Australian dollar on the back of a two-decades long economic boom. When commissioning this survey, we expected prices in Sydney to be the worst \u2013 yet we found that with meat and wine prices relatively in line or even below other places, our basket of goods came in below the level of Toronto. There was even one item cheaper than anywhere else: at Coles supermarket in Sydney basic vanilla ice cream costs just 60p a litre. Giles Rafferty and Kate Musgrove live in Sydney&apos;s inner west with their two boys, Ruari, four, and one-year-old Fionn. They moved to Australia from London 18 months ago and reckon they spend up to $200 a week (\u00a3110) on the weekly shop. The biggest difference Giles has noticed between the UK and Australia is the high price of &quot;some seasonal fresh foods like grapes and potatoes&quot; but also fresh meat and washing detergents/fabric conditioner. To keep costs down, he has little brand loyalty, buying own-brand where he can. He adds that local house prices and rents are ridiculously high, placing a significant drain on take-home pay and forcing people to tighten their belts on the weekly shop. And why, he asks, do Mars Bars cost so much here?"}, {"sentences": ["Once, I had been rehabbing from a long illness before making my comeback in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Culture", "Music", "Nick Cave", "Paul Weller", "Kate Bush", "Warpaint", "John Grant", "Pop and rock", "Apps", "Film", "Technology", "Playlists"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-27T08:30:00Z", "title": "Sun, sea and sound: top playlists of the summer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/27/sun-sea-sound-stars-playlists-summer-songs-films-apps-downloading-holidays", "article": "Nigel Slater, food writer My listening is about as varied as you could imagine, with the exception of sentimental ballads, which generally make me want to hurl a brick through the nearest window. James Thompson, my best friend and business partner, knows my tastes and often puts playlists together for my birthday and Christmas. He is the reason I am currently listening to and loving John Talabot&apos;s latest offering for DJ-Kicks. It&apos;s my summer soundtrack. I am never happier than when I am flying. It is one of the few times I am ever on my own and I enjoy every second. I have different playlists for different journeys, basically a long-haul list and another for short haul. The long-haul list has taken years to assemble: a mixture that includes everything from Throwing Snow and Daedelus to the Rolling Stones. Black Sands by Bonobo is pretty essential, but the backbone of the list is from Pantha du Prince&apos;s album Black Noise. Like the Beatles&apos; Revolver, it is an album I associate with being in a good place. If ever I couldn&apos;t access it while in the air, I would probably be in tears. Short haul is more energetic \u2013 the Shoes, Crystal Fighters and tracks from the Kitsun\u00e9 Maison compilation albums. I love flying so much that I rarely sleep on board so I can get through several films. I generally watch whatever is on offer, but favourites I would take with me are Fight Club, Enemy of the State, All About My Mother and The Dark Knight. A mixed bag. As for apps, Spotify is a must. Citymapper is incredibly useful and I would find it frustrating to be without my Shazam. Anna Calvi, singer-songwriter and guitarist I haven&apos;t had a holiday in a very long time but I&apos;m really enjoying Blood Orange&apos;s recent album, Cupid Deluxe; it has an 80s New York feel and reminds me of the film Paris Is Burning. I&apos;m also enjoying Frank Ocean&apos;s song Pyramids, which is like a mini-opera, with many different moods and moments. While travelling around Europe doing festivals, I&apos;ve been listening to Leonard Cohen&apos;s album Death of a Ladies Man. I love how absurd, beautiful, uplifting and miserable this record is.   Frank Ocean - Pyramids on MUZU.TV.   Arcade Fire&apos;s latest album, Reflektor, really makes me think of my autumn European tour, when I listened to this on repeat. It has good memories for me of driving through the Spanish countryside. I like to listen to David Bowie&apos;s Scary Monsters album as I&apos;m taking off in a plane because it&apos;s unhinged and makes me feel braver. When I&apos;m flying I don&apos;t really watch films or play games. I much prefer looking out of the window and getting lost in my thoughts. I&apos;m not very good with directions so I rely on the blue Google map marker to tell me where to go, which is a bit scary actually. I like the idea of carrying an actual compass. Lauren Cuthbertson, Royal Ballet principal dancer I&apos;m performing most of this summer so I will mainly be listening to music when I&apos;m warming up or training. I find the soundtrack to Midnight in Paris creates a perfect tendu tempo! Daft Punk are a favourite too. If I need motivating to really push, I play the Rocky theme tune or perhaps Peach by Prince, Beyonc\u00e9&apos;s Single Ladies, Mark Ronson&apos;s Somebody to Love Me, or Bang Bang by Will.i.am. I&apos;m a stay-up-all-night-procrastinating type of packer and this always involves thought-provoking music. Abel Korzeniowski&apos;s soundtrack for A Single Man, Ana Silvera&apos;s album The Aviary, drummer Andy Burrows&apos;s Company, a little bit of Drake in the mix and Keaton Henson&apos;s new collection of romantic folk-rock all allow me to drift more than concentrate, but I enjoy that quiet time in the middle of the night, even if it does take me hours to pack. Music can really remind you of a time and place. Once, I had been rehabbing from a long illness before making my comeback in Tokyo. When I was rehearsing, I would eat lunch at the same cafe nearly every day. I heard a really lovely song that captured exactly how I felt at the time. It was Icelandic singer Emiliana Torrini&apos;s Big Jumps, which I was making in different ways at that time. If I&apos;m travelling for a performance, I will listen to the ballets I&apos;ll be dancing \u2013 this summer, it&apos;s Prokofiev, Tchaikovsky and Massenet. I love the time I have when flying to get swept away by music. It makes me think about where I am and where I&apos;m going. Lauren Cuthbertson will be performing in Manon on 5 and 9 October; roh.org.uk  Cerys Matthews, musician and presenter This summer I&apos;ll be listening to Paprika (a Romanian/Serbian gypsy band), Connan Mockasin, Louis Armstrong, Jessie Mae Hemphill, Belle and Sebastian, Sturgill Simpson, Georgia Ruth and Joe Gibbs&apos;s African Dub All-Mighty, Chapter 3. They are all different but have a definite &quot;smell&quot; of summer. I was in Memphis last summer and despite all the blues bands you can&apos;t help &quot;bumping&quot; into, it is Stax that is the perfect soundtrack, so I&apos;ll add Melting Pot by Booker T &amp; the MG&apos;s [the label&apos;s house-band], Otis Redding&apos;s These Arms of Mine or Dock of the Bay, and Isaac Hayes&apos;s Shaft. They may seem obvious choices, but hear any of these sounds while walking through the &quot;barbecued pork capital of the world&quot; and you know you&apos;ve arrived.     \u2018Hear Otis Redding\u2019s These Arms of Mine in Memphis and you\u2019ll know you\u2019ve arrived,' says Cerys Matthews. Photograph: Gab Archive/Redferns    Car journeys are now spent listening to all the submissions for my Sunday morning 6 Music show. There is a sack a week and I like to choose every track I play, which means listening to everything that gets sent to me. I don&apos;t like flying, so I&apos;m looking for music that would be the aural equivalent of a G&amp;T. When we go away as a family, we&apos;re strictly analogue: the children listen to what we listen to, we all do a lot of reading and have plenty of singalongs. It&apos;s pointless having a family holiday only for everyone to be buried in their gadgets. Cerys Matthews hosts Cerys on 6, Sundays, 10am to 1pm. She has also set up The Good Life Experience, a one-day festival of food, music and culture in Flintshire, Wales on 20 September; thegoodlifeexperience.co.uk Sadiq Khan, MP On journeys it&apos;s my daughters&apos; music that gets played not mine. That&apos;s one fight I never win! If I was on a long car journey on my own I&apos;d probably put on something like Paul Weller&apos;s self-titled first solo album. I was still a student when it came out in 1992 so it brings back happy memories of putting the hours in at the library. It represented the future for me, and songs such as Into Tomorrow and Above the Clouds put me at ease when I hear them. I still rate it as one of Weller&apos;s best records. I&apos;m not a big fan of flying so I&apos;d probably go for something that puts me in a holiday mood, like the fifth album by the Police, Synchronicity. I&apos;m a big Police fan and this album had the classic singles Wrapped Around Your Finger and King of Pain. I was 13 when it was released and I remember getting it on cassette after hearing Every Breath You Take on Top of the Pops and playing it to death. When on the way to somewhere hot, Tea in the Sahara is perfect. On a long-haul flight, I like to watch something that will pass the time without me realising. So it&apos;s got to be a film with sequels or a trilogy such as The Godfather. Either that or a decent box set. You can&apos;t beat a good fix of The West Wing, even if it is a bit close to real life. Both my daughters are pretty tech-savvy so I don&apos;t need to download music or films for them. They do it for me. They both have Kindles, but I still love the feel of a book so there&apos;s no way I&apos;ll be joining them. We don&apos;t tend to play games when travelling: the Khan family are all very competitive so it&apos;s not a particularly relaxing way of passing time on a journey! \u00a0 Sadiq Khan MP is the shadow justice secretary and shadow minister for London  Viv Albertine, musician and writer What will I be listening to this summer? Warpaint, always Warpaint. I can listen to them any time, anywhere. Their music is hypnotic and trancey, which makes it a great soundtrack for travelling. The rhythm suggests motion. Chris Watson, once of Cabaret Voltaire, is now a specialised sound recordist, mainly of natural history. I love his album, El Tren Fantasma (The Ghost Train). He recreates the sounds of a trans-Mexico train journey \u2013 birds, wheels, humans and added electronic rhythm. It sounds like the insides of your heart chamber.      I don&apos;t like to listen to music while flying, I like to listen to the sound of the vehicle. Flying makes me thoughtful. I write lots of snippets for songs or have ideas for books, films, dance. Often, when the plane lands and I look at my notes, they read like I&apos;ve been on drugs. My head has been in the clouds, unfettered, my mind unleashed. The ideas are outlandish, quite often crap. People don&apos;t stare out of windows so much any more. I think it&apos;s important to have space in your life and in your mind, and flying is one of the times I just let myself blank out. I find it almost meditative. If I had to watch a film, it would be something dreamy such as The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (Vittorio de Sica), Zabriskie Point and The Passenger (Michelangelo Antonioni), or Walkabout (Nicolas Roeg). They&apos;re all about landscape and a time and place. They are almost translucent; the images don&apos;t impose. They would be at home floating in the sky. I use a translation app if I&apos;m going somewhere I don&apos;t speak the language. The best app I take away is Headspace, a great mindfulness app that helps keep me sane-ish. This year my daughter and I will be going to Iceland and have decided to leave our phones at the hotel each morning, to give our brains a rest from that side of things. Hashtag righteous. Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys is published by\u00a0Faber Eimear McBride I&apos;ve completely lost touch with what&apos;s going on in music this summer so I&apos;ll be relying on old favourites to get me through: the complete Tindersticks back catalogue as well as all manner of Bill Callahan and Will Oldham records. Nick Cave&apos;s The Mercy Seat is always associated with Amalfi \u2013 I played it repeatedly to cheer myself up for having unwittingly chosen to stay in a place filled with the despicable. I like to listen to the Stooges in the car and Bach on the plane, in case it&apos;s the last sound I ever hear. My in-flight film: Taxi Driver followed by the first two Godfather films would be perfect. Also The Turning Point, because there&apos;s just not been enough Anne Bancroft in my life. I&apos;m not a gaming fan so my two-year-old daughter will be listening to a lot of stories \u2013 the Mog the Cat stories by Judith Kerr are proving popular at the moment. And, for the sake of family unity \u2013 as well as sanity \u2013 the wonderful Stuart Staples/Dave Boulter-produced Songs for the Young at Heart album. Thank God for it. A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing is published by Faber Tara Erraught, opera singer For me, Claudio Baglioni is the sound of summer. He was an Italian pop star in the 70s and reminds me of my summers spent in Italy as a student. There is something so beautifully peaceful in these memories that his music evokes in me. I feel the sun and the sea breeze. When travelling for work, I&apos;m usually listening to whatever repertoire I am preparing, but I always have some Sinatra at hand. He can make any airport delay more comfortable. The same is true of Adele, whose voice is full of soul. The app I can&apos;t travel without is TripCase; it keeps all my flight, accommodation and transportation details handy. You send it your flight confirmation and hotel bookings, and it neatly prepares a trip schedule for you. I also like the app AroundMe \u2013 a super-useful way to find your nearest everything. John Grant, singer-songwriter I love the soundtrack by Mica Levi to Under the Skin, and I love listening to music like this outside in bright, hot weather. Maybe it&apos;s all about soundtracks this summer for me. \u00a0[French composer] Rob&apos;s soundtrack to the Maniac reboot is still at the top of my list. I listened to it the other night while jogging in the forest in Heidelberg and it was terrifying and amazing and beautiful.     Kelis\u2019s \u2018fantastic\u2019 new album, Food, is the choice of Gemma Cairney and John Grant Photograph: Nicky J Sims/Redferns via Getty Images    Solvent&apos;s release New Ways: Music from the Documentary | Dream of Wires, from earlier this year, is pure synth love and continues to make me a very happy man. Kelis&apos;s new album, Food, is fantastic and I&apos;ll be enjoying that all summer as well. Meshell Ndegeocello&apos;s new record is gorgeous, as are all of her records. A friend just introduced me to the soundtrack from The Conversation and that is simply exquisite. Oh and some B-52s for good\u00a0measure, and lots of Hildegard Knef. Duh. Last but not least, check out\u00a0the song Alien in My Pocket by Rune Lindbaek &amp; Lindstr\u00f8m. Awesome. TripAdvisor Offline City Guides are very helpful when looking for places to eat. I have an app that quizzes me on Icelandic noun declensions, which is useful, and I use dictionaries from Collins in several languages, such as French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and German, because they contain idiomatic usage of the language and colloquialisms. Spend the money; you&apos;ll use them for ever. My band uses Master Tour, which is fantastic. It contains all the information for every day on the road: crew names and mobile numbers, hotel address, sound check info, guest lists, etc. John Grant tours the UK in November Alan Johnson, Labour MP My summer playlist will include Haim, Lorde and a mesmerising album by John Grant, Pale Green Ghosts. I adore Kate Bush, and Hounds of Love \u2013 and Cloudbusting in particular \u2013 will forever be associated with a family holiday in Somerset when we were still having to listen to music on car cassette players. Marshall Crenshaw&apos;s first album, released in 1982, is still the perfect summer record that I associate with driving to holiday destinations in the sunshine. On a flight I&apos;d watch The Lord of the Rings, but it would have to be a long flight. Sometimes I play iPhone chess against myself. Mollie King, singer with the Saturdays I&apos;m definitely going to be listening to the new Ed Sheeran album, x. His first album, +, is probably one of my favourite albums of all time. There&apos;s also a new song on the radio at the moment called Rude by Magic and I love it. It was playing a lot a few months ago when I was in LA, and a lot of the time when I go to America I come back and the music here isn&apos;t the same, so I was really happy to hear this song on British radio. Another song that reminds me of LA is Ellie Goulding&apos;s Lights, because when the girls and I were out there filming our TV show for three months that song was always on. A song that I always listen to on a girly holiday is When Love Takes Over by David Guetta and Kelly Rowland. I went to Ibiza with Frankie [Sandford] two years ago and we listened to it on repeat; it&apos;s definitely my summer anthem.            On a flight I like to have something quite relaxed because I&apos;m not a very good flyer, so I always listen to Ray LaMontagne or James Vincent McMorrow. When we&apos;re on tour we have a lot of time travelling in our tour bus and it&apos;s the same then; I like to listen to more acoustic, laidback stuff than the sort of music our band does. This is a bit of a sad one but I use my Starbucks app to see where the nearest one is when I&apos;m in a city I don&apos;t know very well. There&apos;s also a great restaurant app, Urbanspoon, where you select the type of cuisine you&apos;d like and how much you want to pay and it tells you all the nearest restaurants that fit your selection. The Saturdays release their new album, Finest Selection: The Greatest Hits, on 11 August. The Greatest Hits tour kicks off in Glasgow on 7 September Rachel Reeves, Labour MP I&apos;ll be spending my summer recess in Leeds and North Yorkshire with my husband and daughter. We&apos;ve rented a little farmhouse just north of Scarborough by the sea. My husband took me to see the jazz singer Claire Martin for my birthday recently, so her album Too Much in Love to Care will be on my summer playlist. I haven&apos;t seen Homeland yet, so will probably watch that. Also, there is a documentary called Shopgirls: The True Story of Life Behind the Counter that looks fantastic. It&apos;s about the growth of consumerism through the eyes of the people who serve us \u2013 looking at culture, wages, liberation and exploitation. Gemma Cairney, Radio 1 presenter The most recent Kelis album, Food, is so sexy, I love it. I&apos;m a sucker for a soul tempo and caramel voice. There is a track on there called Bless the Telephone that made me cry because it&apos;s so simple and beautiful. After researching it, I found out it was a cover of a Labi Siffre song, and I am now in love with both versions. There is also a producer called Tourist who&apos;s worked on a deliciously summery track with Lianne La Havas called Patterns. It&apos;s got one of those joyous house beats that make you feel like you&apos;re in a music video set by a pool and surrounded by smiling faces.            Last October, I travelled to Mali to make a documentary for 6 Music about\u00a0the political struggle with the jihadists in the north and how, as a result, there is a ban on music. Damon Albarn and his Africa Express collective of producers and artists made an album (Maison des Jeunes) in a week with a whole host of Malian artists and musicians. It was a phenomenal experience, a heady swirl of Africa at its best and hardest. Listening to that album makes me shiver, knowing that many of the people on it had had to flee their home\u00a0towns just so they could make music. I went to Australia a few years ago and found a strange pleasure in being able to switch off all my gadgets and consume films, music and wine for such an amount of time on the flight. I listened to Joni Mitchell&apos;s Blue \u2013 a recommended classic as part of the in-flight entertainment. I&apos;d never heard it before. Listening to it, in what seemed like solitude, was pretty lovely. When it comes to films, I&apos;m a weeper and like something based on romance. I remember watching Celeste and Jesse Forever on a flight a while ago and crying lots. It&apos;s a romcom about a long, drawn-out break-up. I went through my own, not long afterwards. I try to turn my phone off when I&apos;m away \u2013 unless to add to Spotify or use Google Maps. If I&apos;m in a city that has it, I may be tempted to try and get an Uber taxi ride in a moment of need. Florence Knight, chef Order of the Golden Dawn by Daedelus\u00a0and Svefn-G-Englar by Sigur\u00a0R\u00f3s are great tracks for chilling on the beach. I&apos;m still slightly addicted to Pa-Pa-Power by Dead Man&apos;s Bones and am into anything by the Black Angels but especially Bad Vibrations. I always associate driving home with Broken Bells by Broken Bells. It&apos;s one of those albums where every track is excellent and I never tire of listening to it. My perfect in-flight film would be\u00a0Beasts of the Southern Wild. I have downloaded copies of Despicable Me 2 and Up for my nieces and nephews for the afternoon downtime on our family holiday. I have been known to watch them on my own too."}, {"sentences": ["And such are the rewards of the World Marathon Majors circuit, on which athletes can earn hundreds of thousands of pounds running in London and Boston, Tokyo and New York, Chicago and Berlin, that going for Commonwealth Games gold could leave them severely out of pocket."], "tags": ["Commonwealth Games 2014", "Commonwealth Games", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-27T11:41:19Z", "title": "Commonwealth Games 2014: Shelley and Cheyech win marathon golds", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/27/commonwealth-games-2014-shelley-cheyech-marathon", "article": "In the drizzly murk of a Glasgow Sunday morning, an unexpected flash of green and gold. As the crowds banged the security boards at the finish Michael Shelley, a 30-year-old Australian, crossed the line to become the first non-African to win the Commonwealth Games men\u2019s marathon in 20 years. His time \u2013 2hr 11min 15sec \u2013 was nothing special, but the euphoria afterwards certainly was. Shelley called it \u201cindescribable\u201d and seemed to be staggering around in a karmic daze. \u201cI just dug deep and I was hoping I wouldn\u2019t blow up like I have done in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI am intimidated by the Kenyans all the time. I was just very fortunate that the training paid off.\u201d One of the first things Shelley did was to hug his countryman Steve Moneghetti, who had triumphed in the marathon in Victoria, British Columbia, back in 1994. Behind them the Kenyan Stephen Chemlany, the fastest man in the field with a best time of 2:06:24, finished 43sec back to claim silver, while Uganda\u2019s Abraham Kiplimo, who had earlier slipped at a drinks station, collected the bronze in 2:12:23. Moneghetti, Australia\u2019s chef de mission at these Games, was generous in his praise. \u201cI just think the way he dominated the Africans was fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter who he was up against \u2013 Africans, Welsh, English \u2013 he just came here to win. And he\u2019s run a PB.\u201d Even Moneghetti would concede that his comments require an asterisk. The elite marathon runners, including the Kenyan world record holder, Wilson Kipsang, and the Ugandan Olympic and world champion, Stephen Kiprotich \u2013 were not here. Such are the demands of racing 26.2 miles that completing more than two \u2013 or at a stretch, three \u2013 in a year is impossible at top speed. And such are the rewards of the World Marathon Majors circuit, on which athletes can earn hundreds of thousands of pounds running in London and Boston, Tokyo and New York, Chicago and Berlin, that going for Commonwealth Games gold could leave them severely out of pocket. But while the quality failed to hit the highest notes, the atmosphere certainly did. Many athletes afterwards talked of the barrage of noise along the two laps of the course \u2013 starting at the city centre and looping around Merchant City, George Square and Buchanan Street as well as Bellahouston and Pollok Park \u2013 and of people coming out of their houses to shout their names and urge them on. In particular they cheered Scotland\u2019s Derek Hawkins, who finished ninth in 2:14.15 despite repeatedly being sick in the later stages \u2013 \u201cnot the first time someone has done that on Sunday morning in Glasgow\u2019s East End,\u201d chuckled one wag. \u201cIt was a bit embarrassing puking up in the home straight like that,\u201d Hawkins admitted sheepishly. Hawkins, who was only 11 seconds outside his personal best, also paid tribute to the thousands who piled on to the streets to watch. \u201cIt was tough but they managed to pull me through,\u201d he said. \u201cThe noise was unbelievable, especially when they started banging the boards. I did London last year and I thought that was loud, but this was twice as loud.\u201d One place further back was England\u2019s Steve Way. The 40-year-old is one of these Games\u2019 most remarkable stories, having only taken up running in 2007 after his weight had ballooned to 16\u00bd stone. Back then he struggled to breathe because of a 20-a-day smoking habit; now he was doing much the same after running 2:15.16 \u2013 a time that not only beat his personal best by more than a minute, but was the fastest ever by a British athlete over 40. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have wished for a better day,\u201d said Way, who burst into tears at the finish. \u201cI normally say something is second best to my wedding day but this one matches it. I\u2019ve punched above my weight. I was even leading at 10km, which I thought might be a bit scary, but was really good fun.\u201d When Way was asked whether he will try to contest the marathon at the 2016 Olympics he responded with a look of utter bemusement. \u201cThat would be ridiculous but I\u2019m not going to stop trying,\u201d he said. But the greater glories belonged to Shelley, who needed an operation to correct a hole in his diaphragm hours after he was born, but had no difficulties in producing a sustained burst between 35km and 40km that scattered the field. The women\u2019s event predictably came down to a battle between the two Kenyan favourites, with the Paris marathon winner Flomena Cheyech Daniel pulling away in the final two miles to beat her compatriot Caroline Kilel in a time of 2:26:45. The Australian Jess Trengrove ran a personal best of 2:30.12 to take bronze. Of the home athletes, Scotland\u2019s Susan Partridge was the best in sixth in 2:32:18, with England\u2019s Louise Damen just behind in seventh. But one of the biggest cheers of the day came long after most athletes had warmed down, in celebration of Malawi\u2019s Tereza Master, barefoot, completing in a national record of 2:50:54."}, {"sentences": ["On the evening before its release, queues began forming in bookshops in Tokyo and, a week after its publication, the book had been reprinted eight times, with sales of more than 1m copies."], "tags": ["Haruki Murakami", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-28T06:30:00Z", "title": "Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage review \u2013 Haruki Murakami's familiar tale of a man's odd past and his empty present", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/28/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-his-years-pilgrimage-review-haruki-murakami-man", "article": "Haruki Murakami is unique among contemporary novelists insofar as he has somehow managed to remain a cult writer while selling millions of copies of his books both in his native Japan and in the many countries where his novels are now read in translation. In February 2013, when the Japanese publication date of his latest novel was announced, the pre-order sales alone made it the fastest-selling book ever on Amazon Japan, where the first hardback edition numbered 300,000. On the evening before its release, queues began forming in bookshops in Tokyo and, a week after its publication, the book had been reprinted eight times, with sales of more than 1m copies. Though not quite in the Harry Potter league, a new Murakami novel is now an event. As evinced by the use of his surname alone on this new book, Murakami is now also a global brand. What does that brand deliver that has made it such a worldwide literary phenomenon? And, more problematically, what impact, if any, does Murakami&apos;s huge global popularity have on his writing? Has the seemingly effortless invention of his earlier fiction become a kind of signature that now comes close to formula? The intriguingly titled Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage goes some way towards answering the first of these questions, but leaves the other two hanging in the\u00a0air. Essentially, Murakami writes two kinds of novels: the deftly delineated personal odyssey of self-discovery narrative \u2013 Norwegian Wood, South of the Border, West of the Sun (both 2000) \u2013 and the more ambitiously plotted, often supernaturally shaded, epic shaggy dog story \u2013 A Wild Sheep Chase (1989), Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World (1991), The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (1997). The latter approach, which incorporates elements of magic realism, science fiction and Japanese mythology, reached an apogee of sorts with his most recent novel, the three-volume 1Q84, which by turns mesmerised and baffled with its bewildering and, in places, disturbing plot. It involved a female character who wandered off a freeway into a parallel universe and a darkly mystical cult led by a self-styled prophet who indulged in creepy sex with the young female assassin hired by a mysterious dowager to kill him. Colorless Tsukuru, perhaps as a reaction to the excesses of IQ84, falls into the first category, its relatively straightforward narrative centring on an archetypal Murakami character: a lonely young Japanese man whose life has been dislocated by a traumatic event he cannot make sense of. We learn early on that his emotionally empty, doggedly conformist existence is, in his mind, the result of his sudden banishment from the close circle of friends whose collective insularity had once given his life a meaning. As always with Murakami, symbolism and metaphor loom large. Each of Tsukuru&apos;s former friends has a last name that contains a colour: the boys are called Akamatsu (red pine)and Oumi (blue sea); the girls Shirane (white root) and Kurono (black field). Thus, it transpires that even when Tsukuru was part of this tightly bonded group, he often felt like an outsider, his self-perceived lack of personality leading him to question constantly why he was included in their group at all. Outside it, he becomes even more &quot;colourless&quot;, dogged by thoughts of suicide, but devoid of the energy to carry them through. Instead, he lives a quietly ordered life as a designer of railway stations, his love life consisting of a series of low-key relationships that never quite lead anywhere. At least until he meets Sara Kimoto, a character who flits in and out of the narrative as Tsukuru&apos;s first potentially serious girlfriend, but whose curiosity about his odd past and\u00a0oddly empty present is the catalyst\u00a0for the retrospective journey of self-discovery he reluctantly undertakes. In its singularly understated way, Colorless Tsukuru and His Years of Pilgrimage, is, as its title suggests, a quest novel, though one without any dramatic epiphanies. This, too, is typically Murakamian. I had the lingering sense throughout that I had read this story before, or at least a version of it, so familiar were the characters, their ways of conversing and the abiding undercurrent of passivity that underpins their lives. They seemed, at times, close to stock Murakami characters, just as the supernaturally tinged story within the story that a passing character tells Tsukuru seemed to echo other tall tales from Murakami novels past. Even the viscerally sensual dream sequence \u2013 that may be some kind of astral visitation or psychic invasion \u2013 recalled the truly bizarre sexual interlude towards the denouement of 1Q84. Once again, too, Murakami weaves a well-chosen piece of music \u2013 Franz Liszt&apos;s deceptively simple Le mal du pays from his Years of Pilgrimage suite \u2013 into the story to underscore the abiding sense of loss and melancholy felt by his protagonist. The jazz classic Round Midnight, played solo, Thelonious Monk-style, by a dying musician, also makes a fleeting appearance. Murakami&apos;s fiction constantly alerts us to his characters&apos; \u2013 and his own \u2013 sublime taste. By now, too, there is definable sense of familiarity to Murakami&apos;s style, which, when it works, is as deceptively understated and unerringly effective as Liszt&apos;s seductive piano piece. Characters meet for dinner or drinks, sometimes sleep together, sometimes return alone to their solitary apartments, all the while revealing just enough about themselves to keep us interested in their meanderingly oddball existences. This kind of Murakami novel is like life, then, but less so yet somehow more so. For all its familiarity, I read Colorless Tsukuru as I have read all Murakami&apos;s previous books, with the exception of the sprawling, often frustratingly tangential 1Q84: voraciously while, simultaneously not wanting it to end. Inevitably, Tsukuru becomes less colourless, less lost as the story unfolds. The big lesson he learns about living is that one cannot do it fully without risk \u2013 the risk of disappointment, heartbreak or, as he puts it, &quot;getting lost in the dark forest&quot;. What I learned is that, like other Murakami characters before him, Tsukuru seems to have grown older without really growing up. His discontents are essentially adolescent and one cannot help harbouring the suspicion that the majority of Murakami&apos;s vast global fanbase either recognise and share those discontents or are themselves adolescents. It may even be that he is the one writer who speaks most meaningfully to the in-between generations caught in a culture where youth is fetishised to such an extent that its values and myriad small traumas, as well as its styles and trends, can now be carried without embarrassment into middle age. As the book ends, his latest contemporary Everyman, still uncertain but no longer adrift, is poised \u00a0on the brink of a new consciousness in which, as Tsukuru puts it, &quot;not everything was lost to the flow of time&quot;. When I finished the book, I searched\u00a0on YouTube for Liszt&apos;s Le mal\u00a0du pays as performed by Lazar Berman, only to find that countless others had already done the same. One post read &quot;Murakami brought me here&quot; and most of the others echoed that message in one way or another. Their satisfaction was as heartfelt and unquestioned as that of any true believers. As oddly satisfying as Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years\u00a0of Pilgrimage is, though, it is perhaps time that Murakami shifted gear and brought his vast and adoring global readership somewhere else entirely, shaking up their preconceptions in the process. Now that would be an event."}, {"sentences": ["This network can be &quot;jacked&quot; into, while in the real world characters flit from Tokyo to the Sprawl, an urban agglomeration running down the east coast of the US."], "tags": ["William Gibson", "Books", "Culture", "Science fiction", "Fiction", "The Matrix", "Film", "Technology", "Internet", "Awards and prizes"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-28T07:00:00Z", "title": "William Gibson and Neuromancer: the man who saw tomorrow", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/28/william-gibson-neuromancer-cyberpunk-books", "article": "Prescience can be tedious for science-fiction writers. Being proven right about a piece of technology or a trend distracts from the main aim of the work: to show us how we live now. William Gibson knows this as well as anyone. Since the late 70s, the American-born novelist has been pulling at the loose threads of our culture to imagine what will come out. He has been right about a great deal, but mainly about the shape of the internet and how it filters down to the lowest strata of society. In Neuromancer, published 30 years ago this month, Gibson popularised the idea of cyberspace: a &quot;consensual hallucination&quot; created by millions of connected computers. This network can be &quot;jacked&quot; into, while in the real world characters flit from Tokyo to the Sprawl, an urban agglomeration running down the east coast of the US. Gritty urban clinics carry out horrendous sounding plastic surgery. A junkie-hacker, Case, is coaxed into hacking the system of a major corporation. What once seemed impossibly futuristic is now eerily familiar. &quot;Neuromancer,&quot; says novelist and blogger Cory Doctorow, &quot;remains a vividly imagined allegory for the world of the 1980s, when the first seeds of massive, globalised wealth-disparity were planted, and when the inchoate rumblings of technological rebellion were first felt. A generation later, we&apos;re living in a future that is both nothing like the Gibson future and instantly recognisable as its less stylish, less romantic cousin. Instead of zaibatsus [large conglomerates] run by faceless salarymen, we have doctrinaire thrusting young neocons and neoliberals who want to treat everything from schools to hospitals as businesses.&quot;     Neuromancer, winner of the 'big three' for science fiction: the Nebula, Philip K Dick and Hugo awards    On its release, Neuromancer won the &quot;big three&quot; for science fiction: the Nebula, Philip K Dick and Hugo awards. It sold more than 6m copies and launched an entire aesthetic: cyberpunk. In predicting this future, Gibson can be said to have helped shape our conception of the internet. Other novelists are held in higher esteem by literary critics, but few can claim to have had such a wide-ranging influence. The Wachowskis made The Matrix by mashing Gibson&apos;s vision together with that of French philosopher Jean Baudrillard. Stieg Larsson&apos;s Lisbeth Salander is a facsimile of Molly Millions, the femme fatale in Neuromancer. Every social network, online game or hacking scandal takes us a step closer to the universe Gibson imagined in 1984. The vision was not perfect, though. As Gibson himself has joked, Neuromancer has a &quot;complete absence of cellphones, which I&apos;m sure young readers must assume is a key plot point&quot;. Other features of the novel are still lumbering towards us from the horizon. Despite Facebook&apos;s $2.3bn purchase of the Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset system, we remain some way from Neuromancer&apos;s favourite entertainment: &quot;simstim&quot;, where users share a star&apos;s whole sensory experience. Yet our world has enough of a Gibsonian hue for the writer to have acquired the mantle of a prophet. &quot;The Ed Snowden moment is very Gibsonian,&quot; adds Doctorow. &quot;Snowden could be Case&apos;s back-office support, an ex-spook trapped behind Putin&apos;s iron curtain, offering intermittent but vital support to people trapped in the system&apos;s relentless gear grinding.&quot; As the world has caught up with Gibson&apos;s vision, the author, now 66, has turned his gaze closer to the present. (His next novel, The Peripheral, will be the first he has set in the far future.) Neuromancer is Gibson&apos;s most famous novel but not his most accomplished. Pattern Recognition was written in the wake of 9/11 and published in 2003. If Neuromancer looks at the future through a high-powered telescope, Pattern Recognition has its face pressed right up to the glass. Set partly in Camden Town, London, the book has as its protagonist Cayce Pollard, a marketing consultant who has a literal allergy to brands and logos. This makes her valuable to companies keen to seem cooler and less corporate. The book is more than a decade old but, re-read today, it feels more astute than 99% of the novels written since. Gibson has written many times of his belief that all cultural change is essentially technologically driven. As the progress of technology speeds up, it becomes more incumbent on authors to examine its effects. It is unthinkable that you could write a novel set in the UK today that did not in some address way the spread of computers into every crevice of the world. &quot;We have plenty of Booker-type authors who are lauded for their exquisite lyrical realism,&quot; says Ned Beauman, himself a Booker-nominated author. &quot;But, for me, Gibson is better than almost anybody at noticing what&apos;s genuinely interesting about the world. He&apos;s the only living writer who was one of my favourites when I was 13 and is still one of my favourites. In that respect, he&apos;s been deeply influential on me.&quot; Beauman&apos;s latest novel, Glow, is unmistakably shaped by Pattern Recognition and its two sequels, Spook Country and Zero History. Tech-savvy Londoners try strange new drugs while vast corporations employ strange new marketing techniques. Like Gibson&apos;s work, it shows us the present by imagining a hyper-real near future. &quot;Gibson does texture and function in a way that I&apos;m constantly trying to imitate,&quot; he says. &quot;Like many great writers, he has a specific imaginative territory that he keeps going back to, but that territory happens to be where a lot of us now find ourselves living. Not only in terms of Google Glass and Uber, which are comparatively trivial, but in terms of the gap between rich and poor, the impunity of globalised commerce, the declining relevance of the west. It&apos;s a crime that he&apos;s not regarded as one of our most important novelists.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["\u201cOne of best moments of my professional life,\u201d says Davis, \u201cWas walking into a panel that Aaron was speaking at, and he happened to be telling this story of how I steered him towards this voice.\u201d He tells me this story and appears to tear up, but keeps it together by adding, \u201cDo you know how much ass I got that night?\u201d The Black Panel will next make an appearance in August in Tokyo (\u201cat a hotel I can\u2019t pronounce the name of\u201d)."], "tags": ["Comic-Con 2014", "Comics and graphic novels", "Comic-Con", "Race issues", "Culture", "Marvel"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-28T17:26:51Z", "title": "The Black Panel at Comic-Con: 'African American culture is American culture'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/28/comic-con-black-panel-african-american-culture", "article": "Of the hundreds of panels available at Comic-Con, which drew to a close on Sunday, none are more respected than the long-running Black Panel, hosted by the comic book creator and Milestone Media co-founder Michael Davis. Unlike most of the other panels at Comic-Con, the Black Panel has nothing to sell, and features guests who also have nothing to promote. Instead, it is a discussion between audience and panel members about black culture, a way for prominent figures in African American entertainment to reach out to those who hope to emulate their paths to success. Davis started the panel in 1998, five years after he founded Milestone, a comic book entertainment company responsible for some of the most successful black superheroes of the 90s, like Icon, a 300-year-old alien whose first earthly encounter was with a slave woman in the American south, and Static, about a high school teenager who receives superpowers after being mistakenly caught up in a gang war.  Today, the Black Panel is an institution. It is given a 90-minute slot at Comic-Con, a rare honour for any panel, and the panel alum have included RZA, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Nichelle Nichols, aka Lieutenant Uhura of Star Trek. This year, the Black Panel played host to Ne-Yo, J August Richards, Kevin Grevioux, Cree Summer, Erika Alexander, Tatiana El Khouri and Orlando Jones. \u201cWhen I first started the panel,\u201d says Davis, during an interview that took 40 minutes to get to because he kept being mobbed by passersby, \u201cThere was a panel here at Comic-Con called Blacks in Comics, and that was a bitch fest, people saying \u2018Oh, Marvel won\u2019t hire me \u2026\u2019 So I created the Black Panel, which is positive. We ask, \u2018How do we create our own heroes?\u2019\u201d The Black Panel sometimes chooses a theme, says Davis, \u201cYou have to understand that the the audience is made up of all sorts of people. It\u2019s called the Black Panel but it\u2019s a diverse group of people. We agreed that we can\u2019t wait for Marvel and DC to make characters that look like us, that feature women in more than supporting roles, and African American men as something other than thugs. This year, we discussed diversity, but the recurring theme is how can we create stories and characters that look like ourselves? It should be easy: you sit down and create it. But then how do we get people to look at it?\u201d Davis is known through many channels besides Milestone. He\u2019s one of those people who seems able to be in many places at the same. He once headed up Magic Johnson\u2019s entertainment company. He once lent his Tribeca apartment for the pottery scene in the film Ghost. While we are walking to the Comic-Con press room, he receives a text from his old assistant, who now works at Disney, who has left him a gift of a $1,000 rare comic in the Comic-Con HQ. He fears no one, he tells me, joking that the worse thing that could happen is a studio refusing to pay him (\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018You don\u2019t pay me anyway!\u2019\u201d), and his goal is singular.

I want to let them know that this is possible. I want to tell them to know these people on the Black Panel, stay in touch with these people.\u201d And it works. This year, an audience member mentioned a comic book idea featuring an African American woman as its star. \u201cOrlando Jones said: \u2018Send it to me, I\u2019ll put it on my networks.\u2019 That\u2019s not a small thing, he\u2019s got 100,000 followers on Twitter.\u201d Davis\u2019 mentoring programme, Badboy Studios Mentoring Program, also has a history of success, helping to launch the careers of people like N Steven Harris, an Eisner-nominated writer for Watson &amp; Holmes, and Aaron McGruder, the creator of Adult Swim\u2019s wildly popular animation The Boondocks.  Davis was the first person to tell McGruder not to draw, but to focus on sharing his voice as a writer, and McGruder, who is now enjoying the beginning of stratospheric fame as Adult Swim prepares to launch his new show Black Jesus, tells this story during interviews. \u201cOne of best moments of my professional life,\u201d says Davis, \u201cWas walking into a panel that Aaron was speaking at, and he happened to be telling this story of how I steered him towards this voice.\u201d He tells me this story and appears to tear up, but keeps it together by adding, \u201cDo you know how much ass I got that night?\u201d The Black Panel will next make an appearance in August in Tokyo (\u201cat a hotel I can\u2019t pronounce the name of\u201d). Right now, Davis is considering future guests. \u201cOne day I\u2019m going to do a black panel with nobody on the panel except white people who have huge influence on African American culture, like Rick Rubin, Quentin Tarantino, Bill Clinton, who was in my mind the first black president. People who appreciate and respect black culture.\u201d \u201cTo me the Black Panel is not just about black people. It\u2019s about black culture. African American culture is American culture. It\u2019s the source of youth culture all over the world.\u201d  A picture caption was amended on 29 July to add that Michael Davis co-created Static Shock with Dwayne McDuffie.

Along with the US department of justice \u2013 which handed Lloyds a two-year deferred prosecution agreement \u2013 and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, also in the US, the FCA published a series of emails and electronic chats showing jovial exchanges between traders. Referring to each other as mate, dude and lad, the trader emails are signed off with phrases such as &quot;grovel grovel&quot; and spelling errors such as &quot;happy to ablige \u2026 rubbery jubbery&quot;. Among those suspended by Lloyds on Monday were three of the four unnamed individuals cited by the FCA who may have been involved in depriving the Bank of England of emergency funding fees of almost \u00a38m. A total of 22 people are understood to be bound up in the latest regulatory crackdown on benchmark manipulation; six\u00a0had already been suspended before Monday and the rest have already left the bank. Their identities are not revealed in a series of damning emails and electronic chats released by regulators as they handed out fines. Instead the individuals are referred to as &quot;manager a&quot; or &quot;trader b&quot;. The latest regulatory actions cover three main issues which date back to the financial crisis when Lloyds TSB \u2013 as it was then known \u2013 rescued HBOS three days after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. HBOS owned Halifax and Royal Bank of Scotland. The three issues are: Libor &apos;lowballing&apos; There were deliberate attempts by traders at Bank of Scotland \u2013 part of HBOS \u2013 to cut their submissions to the Libor panel to avoid giving the impression the bank was facing financial difficulty. This was dubbed &quot;lowballing&quot; by regulators. During the period, Libor was set by a group of banks. They made submissions to a panel, estimating how much they thought their rivals would charge to lend them money in certain currencies and across a range of timescales from overnight to 12 months. Any bank submitting a higher rate than rivals could be regarded as being in financial distress. In August 2008, a Bank of Scotland manager circulated a memo in which the warning was given that paying too a high a rate &quot;may give the impression of HBOS being a desperate borrower and so lead to a general withdrawal of wholesale funds&quot;. A month later, after Lehman Brothers had collapsed, the deal to rescue HBOS was announced. A Bank of Scotland trader submitting Libor estimates told a rival: &quot;Youll like this ive been pressured by senior management to bring my rates down into line with everyone else.&quot; The submitter then cut rates by as much as half a percentage point. Libor manipulation Traders were found to have colluded with rivals at Dutch rival Rabobank over the yen Libor rate. In one exchange, a Rabobank trader submitting yen estimates was reported to have told a rival at Lloyds: &quot;morning skip \u2026 my little [racial epithet redacted] friend in Tokyo wants a high 1m (one month) fix from me today.&quot; In another, a Lloyds trader remarked when asked about reducing a Libor rate: &quot;Every little helps \u2026 It&apos;s like Tescos.&quot; He got the reply: &quot;Absolutely every little helps.&quot; In another instance, one trader was found to have been focusing on &quot;forcing Libor&quot; from September 2006 in order to drive up the value of trading positions. Abuse of liquidity scheme This involved cutting the fees paid to the Bank of England for the special liquidity scheme (SLS), which pumped money into the financial markets when the crisis was at its deepest. During the period, Lloyds TSB and HBOS paid \u00a31.3bn in fees to the Bank. This was just under half of all fees owed by the industry under the scheme, which was regarded as crucial in keeping the banks afloat. Four individuals took steps that saved just under \u00a38m by changing the so-called repo rate, which was crucial in setting the fees their banks were charged. Between January 2009 and September 2009 there were attempts by Bank of Scotland and Lloyds traders to inflate their repo rates, which had the impact of cutting the fees of their joint owner, Lloyds Banking Group. A dialogue between a Lloyds trader and a Bank of Scotland manager shows a discussion about the fees: &quot;I think we worked out ours is going to cost another 6.8 million quid,&quot; the Lloyds trader said, to which the response was: &quot;Just keeps on going up and up and up doesn&apos;t it?&quot; The regulator shows a manager from Bank of Scotland and a trader at Lloyds acknowledging their influence over the repo rate used to price the SLS. &quot;While we&apos;ve got two votes we should use this to our advantage, you know what I mean?&quot; the Bank of Scotland manager told his colleague in April 2009, four months after Lloyds completed its takeover of HBOS. There were 12 banks on the panel which set the repo rate, and Lloyds had two places as a result of the HBOS deal."}, {"sentences": ["The figures, compiled by business data specialists Qlik, found that Oxbridge and Harvard were the most common training grounds for company bosses, with Manchester University, Imperial College London and Tokyo University not far behind."], "tags": ["Women in the boardroom", "Gender", "Business", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-29T08:45:00Z", "title": "Male + 54 + Oxbridge or Harvard educated = average company CEO", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/29/male-54-oxbridge-harvard-average-ceo", "article": "The average company boss is 54 years old, male and studied economics at Oxford, Cambridge or Harvard, according to a survey of management in eight countries.

In the previous year, the US had made Tinian, 6,000 miles west of San Francisco, the largest airport in the world. That night the Enola Gay&apos;s commander, Colonel Paul Tibbets, was piloting a 65-ton plane \u2013 carrying 7,000 gallons of aviation fuel and a four and a half ton bomb. The bomber struggled into the air just 100 feet (30 metres) short of the end of the two-mile runway, 1,500 miles from Japan. Van Kirk was the Enola Gay&apos;s navigator. The B29 had been assigned, depending on the weather, to drop the world&apos;s first atomic bomb on either Kokura, Nagasaki or Hiroshima. Three weather planes had flown ahead to assess cloud cover. At 7.30am Japanese time, the B29 Straight Flush reported that conditions over Hiroshima, the US army air force&apos;s preferred target, were excellent. It was a beautiful, sunlit day in the 350-year-old city. At 8.07am Van Kirk sighted Hiroshima. It was home to about 280,000 civilians and 43,000 military, and had hitherto escaped the incendiary raids that had laid waste to most of Japan&apos;s urban centres. Van Kirk consulted with the bomb-aimer Thomas Ferebee. The aiming point was the T-shaped Aioi bridge. After a six-and-a-half-hour flight Van Kirk had navigated the plane to within 17 seconds of the scheduled dropping time of 8.15am. The uranium bomb nicknamed Little Boy, the culmination of the $2bn Manhattan Project, was released. Forty-three seconds later it exploded, 1,890ft above the ground, 550ft from the Aioi bridge. At the site of the fireball, the temperature exceeded 3,000C (5,400F). Human beings became charred detritus. A firestorm ensued. &quot;Men whose whole bodies were covered with blood, and women whose skin hung from them like a kimono, plunged shrieking into the river,&quot; recalled a schoolboy, quoted in Richard Rhodes&apos;s The Making of the Atomic Bomb. &quot;All these became corpses and their bodies were carried by the current towards the sea.&quot; The B29 was 11 and a half miles away when the first of two shockwaves rolled over it with a sound, Van Kirk recalled, like that of a piece of sheet metal flapping. He had been told to wear darkened googles, but forgot and saw a 40,000ft-high white cloud, and below him what he likened to &quot;a pot of boiling black oil&quot;. He recalled thanking God that the war was over. &quot;I don&apos;t have to get shot at any more. I can go home.&quot; The war was not fully over: a second A-bomb was dropped on Nagasaki on 9 August, before the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945. People are still dying from the effects of both raids, but at Hiroshima, in the year from the moment of detonation, about 140,000 people died. The Anglo-American raid on Dresden, six months before Hiroshima, killed about 50,000 people. In March 1945, 100,000 people had died in a conventional B29 raid on Tokyo. Van Kirk was chosen for the Hiroshima raid because he had previously worked with Tibbets \u2013 one of the USAAF&apos;s best bomber pilots \u2013 and because of his competence as a navigator. Born and raised in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, Van Kirk, known as &quot;Dutch&quot;, went to Susquehanna College for a year before joining the US army air corps&apos;s aviation cadet programme in October 1941. Two months later, with the Japanese bombing raid on Pearl Harbor, came US entry into the second world war. Van Kirk was commissioned in April 1942, receiving his wings as a navigator at Kelly Field in Texas. The USAAF was beginning its build-up in Britain for the strategic bomber offensive against Germany. The first operational unit flying Boeing B17 Flying Fortresses was the 97th Bomber Group, initially based at Polebrook, near Peterborough. By July that year Van Kirk had joined the 97th, navigating his B17 on the hazardous route from Bangor, Maine, via Labrador, Greenland and Iceland, to Prestwick in Scotland. It was then that the relationship with Tibbets and Ferebee was established. The three men flew together for much of the rest of the war \u2013 initially in the B17 &quot;Red Gremlin&quot; \u2013 bombing targets in France and the Netherlands. That October Red Gremlin flew the US generals Mark Clark and Dwight Eisenhower to Gibraltar as the north African Anglo-American Torch landings were being prepared. A month later they were in action in Tunisia. By the time Van Kirk returned to the US in June 1943, he had flown 58 combat and eight transport missions. After a time as an instructor he was transferred, late in 1944, to become group navigator to the 509th composite group. Its commander was Tibbets, the group bombardier was Ferebee and the unit&apos;s function \u2013 although only Tibbets then knew it \u2013 was to deliver the A-bomb.     Theodore Van Kirk in his retirement years. Photograph: Dan Callister/Rex    Long after Hiroshima, Van Kirk observed that the Enola Gay&apos;s crew were a &quot;bunch of civilians they put uniforms on&quot; whose collective ambition was to get the war over and get out of the USAAF. Although Tibbets was to remain with the US military until 1966, Van Kirk was out of the forces by 1946, with the rank of major and the US DFC and a Silver Star. Back in Pennsylvania he took a bachelor&apos;s degree in chemical engineering from Bucknell University, Lewisburg, in 1949 and a master&apos;s a year later. For the next 35 years he held technical and managerial posts with the DuPont chemical corporation. He left his home state and settled in Novato, California. In later years Van Kirk lectured and gave interviews about that day in August. He did it, he said, to educate, not to glorify. In his opinion the raid had saved lives, because it forced Japan&apos;s surrender and prevented a series of bloody battles into 1946. His wife, Mary Jane (nee Young), died in 1975. He is survived by his sons, Thomas and Larry, his daughters, Vicki and Joanne, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. \u2022 Theodore Van Kirk, navigator, born 27 February 1921; died 28 July 2014"}, {"sentences": ["This resulted in South Africa&apos;s exclusion from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics."], "tags": ["South Africa", "Africa", "Race issues", "Politics", "World news", "Sport politics", "Weightlifting", "Olympic Games", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-30T14:48:54Z", "title": "Chris de Broglio obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/30/chris-de-broglio", "article": "Chris de Broglio, who has died aged 84, contributed substantially to South Africa&apos;s expulsion from the Olympic movement in 1970, a pivotal moment in the demise of apartheid. A champion weightlifter, De Broglio was dedicated to fighting racism in sport and was, with Dennis Brutus, a founder member of the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (San-Roc). As Nelson Mandela subsequently told me, the success of the sports boycott campaign was vital. It boosted the freedom struggle at a critical time in the early 1970s when internal resistance had been crushed. De Broglio was born in Mauritius, to Maurice, a civil servant, and his wife Suzanne. He got into weightlifting as a teenager, having been seriously ill as a child. His parents never found out what was wrong with him, and after a year in bed he recovered, but he remained smaller and shorter than a brother who was only 18 months older than him. He took up weightlifting as a way to build his strength and physique. Migrating to South Africa to study accountancy, he came into contact with institutionalised discrimination in sport for the first time. South Africa was the only country in the world that excluded &quot;non-white&quot; sportsmen from selection for national teams. He met other weightlifters, including Precious McKenzie, who were being discriminated against. He found it unjust that black and white weightlifters could not train or compete with each other, and decided that needed to be challenged. From 1950 to 1962 he was South African weightlifting champion and he competed in the World Championships in Sweden in 1958 and Vienna in 1961. He became secretary and then chairman of the Natal and Transvaal Weightlifting Associations, where, in defiance of fellow white sports officials, he helped multi-racial weightlifting organisations. When, in 1954, he organised a multi-racial championship in Durban, the whites-only federation threatened him with expulsion. By the early 60s De Broglio was working as southern Africa manager for Air France, and he arranged for the chairman of San-Roc, John Harris, to leave the country without the knowledge of the security police to lobby a meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). This resulted in South Africa&apos;s exclusion from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. In 1965, Harris became the only white anti-apartheid campaigner to be executed after he participated in the bombing of a whites-only area of Park station in Johannesburg, which killed one person and injured many others. In 1963 San-Roc had achieved South Africa&apos;s suspension from world football. The security police put De Broglio under surveillance and threatened his employers, forcing him into exile in London, where in 1966 San-Roc was recreated, operating out of the basement of a hotel leased by De Broglio, the Portman Court in Marble Arch. The IOC old guard were prevented from reversing South Africa&apos;s suspension from the 1968 Mexico Olympics, when De Broglio organised a mass boycott by most African and Asian countries. By now San-Roc&apos;s leaders \u2013 mainly De Broglio and the charismatic Brutus \u2013 were regular attendees at meetings of international sports organisations, from football to athletics. When I was a 19-year-old anti-apartheid activist, De Broglio, with Brutus, became something of a mentor, pushing me to take the leadership of the Stop the Seventy Tour campaign, in which I had expected to be a foot soldier when it was launched in September 1969. Soon its non-violent direct action, including hotel protests and pitch invasions, laid siege to the 1969-70 Springbok rugby tour. The De Broglio family home in Twickenham, not far from the rugby ground, was a distribution point for tickets for demonstrators to invade the pitch. Threats to wreck the summer 1970 cricket tour, coupled with a San-Roc-initiated boycott by African, Asian and Caribbean countries of the Edinburgh Commonwealth Games, forced the tour&apos;s cancellation. Within months, white South Africa was expelled from most international sport, but San-Roc&apos;s work continued to hold and extend the boycott. By the late 1970s white rugby and cricket officials were trying desperately to get it lifted. In 1987 that desperation led De Broglio to help organise the historic meeting between ANC officials and leading Afrikaners, held at Dakar, which helped pave the way for the final defeat of apartheid and the creation of the new South Africa. He was awarded the Olympic Order in 1997 in recognition of his action against racism in sport and in defence of the Olympic Charter. De Broglio spent his final years in Corsica, giving up the gym onlyat the age of 80. He remained gregarious, with an infectious sense of humour, and was an accomplished cook. He married June Von Solms in 1954; she died in 1982. He is survived by his second wife, Renee, whom he married in 1988; by the six children of his first marriage; and by 11 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. \u2022 Marie Christian Dubruel de Broglio, weightlifter and anti-apartheid activist, born 14 May 1930; died 12 July 2014"}, {"sentences": ["Going beyond the concept of Cool Japan, Tokyo today sees creatives, thinkers, designers and black-market movements mixing up culture, innovation and technology.", "The country is an inspiring urban mix of creativity, consumption and tradition, and on a recent visit to Tokyo and neighbouring Yokohama I explored where and how these things are meeting, fusing and exploding into new ideas.", "Open data citiesThe City of Yokohama, a metropolis that merges with Tokyo, has been embracing the possibilities of open data for the benefit of its citizens.", "Out of its Tokyo studio \u2013 which has its own R&amp;D and internal hackspace, 4nchor5 La6 \u2013 the are masters of experimental work that includes musical shoes (planned by W+K Tokyo), human/drone dance performances and the Museum of Me, which uses your Facebook profile to create a digital exhibition all about you.", "Museum robotsIn Tokyo, the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation (Miraikan) has a giant 10m pixel, LED-screen Geo-Cosmos globe complete with soundtrack by techno DJ Jeff Mills."], "tags": ["Culture professionals network", "Digital", "Audiences", "Communications", "Japan", "World news", "Museums", "Culture", "Art and design", "Art", "Design", "Internet", "Big data", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-01T06:30:00Z", "title": "Musical shoes and dancing drones: the arts meet technology in Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/aug/01/dancing-drones-arts-technology-japan", "article": "Going beyond the concept of Cool Japan, Tokyo today sees creatives, thinkers, designers and black-market movements mixing up culture, innovation and technology. The country is an inspiring urban mix of creativity, consumption and tradition, and on a recent visit to Tokyo and neighbouring Yokohama I explored where and how these things are meeting, fusing and exploding into new ideas. I was introduced to a whole host of fascinating organisations and people: art galleries, science museums, creative agencies, co-working spaces, city government policy teams, makers, artists, technologists and the open data movement. Here are just a few examples of the innovative work being done there. The Internet Yami-ichiThe IDPW is a voluntary organisation and web-based secret society that celebrates the &quot;back streets of the internet&quot; by hosting online parties, developing useless software and holding a regular offline internet-themed flea market called the Internet Yami-ichi (Yami means &quot;dark side&quot;). At its 2012 event, 500 people came to buy things as diverse as glitch art-embroidered hoodies, internet-flavoured coffee and the real world retweet: a service in which a man shouts your message at Yami-ichi attendees. Described as the internet black market, the event also saw artist Tomoya Watanabe peddle pebbles. With each stone came a CD-rom of its 3D scan data as an IP address. The work was a direct response to the fear the internet might one day use up every possible IP address, but it turns out that if you assign one to every single rock on earth, you still wouldn&apos;t run out.            Digital music pillsThe Japan Pill-harmonic is a project that takes a user-centred design approach to the problem of dwindling audience figures in classical music. The solution? Consumable, neatly-packaged micro SD card &quot;pills&quot; loaded with music ready to cure your ailment or affliction. Want a better night&apos;s sleep? Simply connect the pill to your laptop and feel the benefits. For this particular project, the Japan Philharmonic Orchestra worked with advertising agency BBDO Japan to prescribe different pills to improve various aspects of your health or mind. For beautiful skin, try Vivaldi&apos;s Four Seasons; for an enhanced appetite, swallow up Rossini&apos;s Barber of Seville; and for constipation issues, relax with Brahms&apos; Symphony No 1: The First Movement. Open data citiesThe City of Yokohama, a metropolis that merges with Tokyo, has been embracing the possibilities of open data for the benefit of its citizens. Leading the way in the Japanese open data movement with its policy of &quot;giving power to the people&quot;, the city is using open data as a tool to identify issues and create policies.            RhizomatiksCreative collective Rhizomatiks produces digital art installations, commercial design work and education programmes. Out of its Tokyo studio \u2013 which has its own R&amp;D and internal hackspace, 4nchor5 La6 \u2013 the are masters of experimental work that includes musical shoes (planned by W+K Tokyo), human/drone dance performances and the Museum of Me, which uses your Facebook profile to create a digital exhibition all about you. Interestingly, the company implements a truly flat structure \u2013 much touted in agency land, but in reality poorly realised \u2013 where employees get to decide on things they want to work on and can veto projects. Museum robotsIn Tokyo, the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation (Miraikan) has a giant 10m pixel, LED-screen Geo-Cosmos globe complete with soundtrack by techno DJ Jeff Mills. The installation itself shows a live, scaled version of the Earth based on everyday image data taken by weather satellites. Another highlight of the museum are its human-like robots that can run and kick balls around, much to the delight of visiting school children. Art hacksChildren are also catered for by Canvas, an organisation that has an anarchic approach to bringing together arts and science. One of its projects, Workshop Collection, brought together 100,000 people for hundreds of self-facilitated free workshops over just one weekend, opening up coding, crafts, art and design to the public. On another project, the company hacked public spaces by hijacking digital screens across Japan to display children&apos;s artwork in over 6,000 places, including TVs for sale in shops and screens in train stations and airports.      Musical treesThe Yamaguchi Centre for Arts and Media (YCAM) was founded in 2003 to work at the forefront of art and technology. It supports the work of innovative practitioners, such as Sakamoto&apos;s Forest Symphony, an installation that takes bioelectric data from trees and turns it into hypnotic soundscapes. Open source disaster designDesign firm Nosigner is an expert in open source and social innovation design, applying it in the face of natural disasters with Olive: an open source, Wikipedia-style resource for people to use after the last major earthquake. The project gathered useful open source designs, for example how to make a temporary toilet, wash your dishes, make a water purifier, make rubber bands from old bicycle tube and increase the size of a battery with paper. It was made in just 40 hours by four people.

I slotted it into my laptop and poured a solitary glass of wine. I was a recent graduate, living in Edinburgh, which I had loved, knowing it only in festival time. It&apos;s weird, but Lost in Translation, set in Tokyo, was the film that gave Edinburgh back to me, reintroducing me to the heady romance of being a young girl granted the infinite freedom of a new city. I instantly felt a kinship for Scarlett Johansson&apos;s Charlotte, the lost girl, who is unable to do the gushy, lovey sort of thing that characterises her husband and his friends, and is unfairly maligned because of it. Unlike Charlotte, however, I am on the autistic spectrum, and this has led to me feeling unable to find the right words, play the right game, and undergo the pretence of social interactions as smoothly as others. To see a heroine who also struggles with this, who also is uncertain, unsure, unable to connect, was refreshing. Previously, the beautiful girls I had seen celebrated in films were either fluent in the language of social discourse, or adorably awkward in a trying-to-look-elegant-then-falling-down-the-stairs kind of way. Charlotte is neither of these. Rather, she is a young girl lost in a big city and unhappy in her relationship. She is also about to embark on an incredible journey. &quot;Can you keep a secret?&quot; asks Bill Murray&apos;s jaded film star, Bob Harris, &quot;I&apos;m trying to organise a prison break, I&apos;m looking for, like, an accomplice \u2026&quot; Disillusionment has never looked so good. Charlotte is, of course, the accomplice he is, like, looking for. And his flippant comment is a call to adventure, in the same way that Gandalf calls Bilbo Baggins to adventure in The Hobbit, or Luke Skywalker is called to adventure in Star Wars.            Reading on mobile? Click to view video Bob and Charlotte&apos;s adventure is not a quest against evil forces, but one of self-discovery. Sure, when described like this, the concept sounds a little self-indulgent. And Lost in Translation is self-indulgent \u2013 but deliciously so, in the way that a bath with a glass of wine is self-indulgent. It is a luxury for me to watch it and imagine that I am Charlotte. I do it whenever I feel lost, alone or sad. Lost in Translation was made before Johansson became a big-screen bombshell, but to me, the image of Charlotte, with her wonky fringe applying lipstick straight from the bullet, is more beautiful than her socially confident Cristina in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. The way she looks in the mirror, uncertainly, rearranging strands of hair on her face is something many girls do when they wonder: &quot;Am I pretty? Am I pretty enough to be loved?&quot; I guess that from a feminist point of view, wanting to be Scarlett Johansson in Lost in Translation is problematic. Charlotte has no career, choosing instead to tag along after her husband. She has a vague desire to write, but she hates the things she writes, and she went through a phase where she took photos of her feet. She is a directionless heroine and her rescuer is an older man.     The freedom of an unknown city \u2026\u00a0Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray in Tokyo.    But this film is not about making a political statement; it&apos;s about how people connect and start to figure out who they truly are. So yes, I would like to be Charlotte. I want to sing Brass in Pocket on karaoke in a baby-pink wig. I want the freedom of an unknown city; a small girl anonymous amid the crowds under the neon billboards. I want to steal Bill Murray&apos;s jacket and return it to him with tears in my eyes in a hotel foyer, and all of this in the intimate soft focus of an Aaton camera. I want to figure stuff out and I want everything to be OK. &quot;Keep writing,&quot; says Bob to Charlotte.

Last July, a seemingly innocuous decision to extend an artificial reef in Gibraltarian waters caused a diplomatic rumpus. Spain slowed down customs checks to create six-hour delays at the border, threats were made to charge \u20ac50 to enter Gibraltar, Royal Navy warships set sail for the Mediterranean, while Ian Paisley Jr helpfully told the Spanish ambassador in London to &quot;pack his sombrero, sangria and straw donkey and go&quot;. Meanwhile, Channel 5&apos;s documentary Gibraltar: Britain in the Sun received unexpectedly high ratings. As\u00a0the Scottish referendum draws closer, this strange outcrop of rock that\u00a0actually wants to stay British takes\u00a0on an extra fascination. But what of Gibraltar from a literary perspective? Ever since an Anglo-Dutch force captured the Rock in the war of the Spanish succession, few writers have dared to visit, and those who have don&apos;t seem to have liked what they found. Daniel Defoe created some pamphlets about it in the 1720s; mostly, though, he complained about the food: &quot;Mutton from the Barbary Coast \u2026 poor thin stuff without any fat \u2026 The wine was thought cheap because five pence a pint, but was at the same time so miserably bad, that in England we should have thought it dear at two pence a quart ...&quot; Samuel Taylor Coleridge stopped off in 1804, en route for a new job with the governor of Malta. &quot;I felt myself ill,&quot; he\u00a0wrote in his Notebooks, &quot;a sense of suffocation and convulsive snatches in my stomach and limbs \u2026 I could not eat breakfast \u2013 my tongue furry-white, my pulse quick and low and my nostrils haunted by fever smells ...&quot; William Thackeray&apos;s account begins promisingly: &quot;At evening,&quot; he wrote after a visit in 1844, &quot;the place becomes quite romantic.&quot; Then comes the killer line: &quot;It is too dark to see the dust on the dried leaves.&quot; He goes on to issue what sounds like a warning to writers, describing &quot;sentries marching everywhere, and (this is a caution to artists) I am told have orders to run any man through who is discovered making a sketch of the place.&quot; Even Mark Twain, that most companionable of travellers, described Gibraltar in 1869 as &quot;suggestive of a &apos;gob&apos; of mud on the end of a shingle&quot;. Perhaps it is the unambiguous nature of the military fortress that sounded the death knell for creative thought. In 1782, Mozart was commissioned to write a symphony celebrating the siege of Gibraltar. He gave up, declaring the subject matter &quot;too bombastic&quot;. The Rock has fared little better in the 20th century. Arguably the greatest Gibraltar novel of all is A Vision of Battlements by Anthony Burgess. Burgess was stationed there in the second world war and his loathing for the place \u2013 &quot;an emblem of waste and loneliness&quot; \u2013 pours from his writing: &quot;carious yellow stucco, wooden lattices shutting in bugs, stink, babies&quot;. The book, though, is superb \u2013 a sort of military Lucky Jim shot through with squalid Burgessian nastiness. In his autobiography, Burgess takes to task another writer who tackled Gibraltar \u2013 his idol, James Joyce. The last chapter of Ulysses is larded with Molly Bloom&apos;s sultry reminiscences of her childhood &quot;and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I\u00a0was a Flower of the mountain&quot;. However, as Burgess points out, Joyce should have made Molly&apos;s father a sergeant major rather than a major, andher mother Gibraltarian rather than Spanish. &quot;What is curious,&quot; Burgess concludes with not a little glee, &quot;is the\u00a0fact that Joyce the traveller never showed any desire to visit the Rock.&quot; So why, you might ask, would anyone choose to research a novel in Gibraltar? My Damascene moment came 10 years ago, in the unlikely setting of a law conversion course in London. In a rare break, a lecturer posed a question: &quot;Which city has the highest proportion of lawyers per capita in the world?&quot; A few hands went up at the front. New York? Tokyo? &quot;Gibraltar,&quot; came the answer. Really, I thought, remembering a trip there in my youth \u2013 Rock, Union Jacks, Barbary apes. But lawyers? A few months later, exams over, I found myself on an a flight to Gibraltar. Immediately, the reason for the legal invasion became clear. The military have all but deserted the Rock, leaving Gibraltarians in need of new employment. The local government has lowered corporation tax, and high finance has come storming in \u2013 online gaming companies, hedge funds, private banks. I sat in on a few cases at\u00a0the supreme court and had some informal interviews with local law firms. Already, my mind was wandering \u2013 what would it be like to grow up here, one of 30,000 residents in an area no bigger than London&apos;s Hyde Park? With Spain threatening to swallow you up and London, threatening to give you away? I started to explore. The Barbary apes roaming the Upper Rock were actually monkeys. How did they get there? Nobody knew. Most of the surnames of the locals were neither British nor Spanish, but Italian \u2013 after Britain seized the Rock, hordes of sailors and merchants streamed in from Genoa to service the garrison&apos;s needs. Even the Rock itself, that great symbol of solidity and strength seemed to defy expectations. Its Roman name is Mons Calpe, Hollow Mountain, due to the caverns that honeycomb its limestone, many of them so deep that they were thought to mark the entrance to hell. These are now interlinked by 33 miles of hand-bored tunnels \u2013 leaving more road inside the Rock than out. The impregnable fortress has a hollow centre. Between interviews, I sat in the Alameda botanical gardens. Somewhere as full of contradictions as Gibraltar would be a troubling place to practise as a lawyer, I decided.

It\u2019s the first evening of my surfing holiday in the small coastal village but with the Easter celebrations in full flow, it\u2019s impossible not to get sucked into what I can only describe as Ghanaian Spring Break. Besides, with most of the village \u2013 surfers included \u2013 fully preoccupied with the party, it was always going to be a case of dance first, surf later. No surprise, then, that the surfing competition due to take place the following morning starts a little \u2013 well, a lot \u2013 later than planned. Making my way down to the beach, head still fuzzy from tropical punch and \u201catomic bombs\u201d (an energy drink mixed with a brand of whisky called K20 that comes in plastic sachets and numbs the mouth on contact), I pitch up on the sand outside the Black Star Surf Shop and wait for its owners to drag themselves out of bed.     Local surfers - taught to ride by Black Star Surf School and Mr Brights - pose on the beach before the competition. All photographs below: Will Coldwell for The Guardian    Soon enough Ben Dewar, a 24-year-old Welsh lad with a shock of blond hair and a penchant for fluorescent green clothing, arrives to open the store. He hands me a board: \u201cCareful dragging the fins along the sand,\u201d he says. \u201cThey keep on breaking and it\u2019s not like I can nip down the local shop to get them repaired \u2026\u201d Indeed. As surf destinations go, Busua really is a frontier town: it\u2019s home to the only two surf shops in Ghana, and almost every one of the country\u2019s surfers live in the village. Not that there are very many of them. \u201cPlaces like America have many generations of surfers,\u201d says Ben. \u201cHere, we only have two. It\u2019s got that real Dogtown spirit about it.\u201d         A short documentary telling the story of Black Star Surf Shop, featuring interviews with its founders.    Ben has been running Black Star along with partners Peter Ansah and Kofi Acquah \u2013 who both grew up in Busua \u2013 since taking it over last summer. The store was founded in 2006 by two Americans, former Peace Corp volunteers Peter and Katrina Nardini, who teamed up with local cab driver Frankee Bordes and began encouraging locals to get into the sport. Before then, the region had only seen the odd surfing hippy or those looking for more intrepid spots, perhaps inspired by the footage of these same beaches in Bruce Brown\u2019s seminal 60s surf flick The Endless Summer. Black Star was the country\u2019s first significant surfing outpost. Now, with the addition of a second shop, Mr Brights, and the collaborative efforts of both businesses to build up the Ghana Surfing Association, the scene in Busua has been experiencing a momentum not felt since the Nardinis first started teaching local kids how to ride the waves. When Mr Brights (owned by Brett Davies, originally from Cornwall) opens his second shop in Kokrobite, the country\u2019s primary beach destination, near Accra, this summer, Ghana will be on its way to developing a countrywide scene.     MCs hype the crowd on Busua beach as the Easter celebrations get started.    But for now, visitors to this exotic stretch of coast dotted with peaceful villages and colonial slave forts can still enjoy the experience so coveted by the surfing community \u2013 being the only person in the water. As I paddle past the breakers, there are only a handful of other surfers out there to share the clean beach break that Busua enjoys at this time of the year. There\u2019s Etienne, a young German on a two-week surfing holiday, a couple of NGO workers down from the north of the country for the weekend, and three or four local teenagers, shredding effortlessly down the waves and putting everyone else to shame.     Surfers head out to sea for the Easter Sunday surf competition.     With gentle waves, 25C water and an apparent absence of sharks, the beach is an alluring proposition for anyone looking to learn to surf in a tropical destination off the usual circuit (and lessons with Black Star offer great value). It is perfect for beginner to intermediate surfers, but the more experienced can make easy trips along the coast to find more challenging, quieter and potentially unridden waves. The village of Dixcove, just round a headland, boasts a fantastic point break, surfed predominantly by incoming fishing boats, while Cape Three Points, a 30-minute drive west, has a sometimes surfable right-hand break on a wild beach that is completely deserted but for the Escape eco-treehouse resort, with its ramshackle bamboo bar. After a morning spent cruising the waves on a long board, I return to find that Busua has whirred back into party mode. The sound system is pumping from outside Coconut Dreams bar, MCs are hyping the crowd and at least 50 people have gathered to watch the surf competition. It\u2019s a true community event: young children dance with impressive fluidity in the sand, effortlessly ripped lads do backflips (losing their Ray-Bans in the process) and women in bright batik dresses cast their eyes over the action.     Busua was experiencing a \u201cGhanian Spring Break\u201d that weekend and dozens of visitors showed up to watch the surfing. In the blue t-shirt is Brett Davies, of Mr Brights Surf School    The biggest whoops and cheers are saved for teenager Michael \u201cBallack Obama\u201d Bentum, who became the first Ghanaian to win a surf contest outside the country when he took home a trophy from a recent competition in Ivory Coast. Not surprisingly, he steals the show this day, too. Even a power cut caused by a dramatic thunderstorm can\u2019t stop the dancing that evening; a generator keeps the speakers going till the early hours. As the weekend fades away, Busua gets back into the laid-back swing of daily life. For us, that means surfing every day (and there is surf, every day) and slowly moving between the beach, the restaurants and the small shops selling ice cold \u201cpure water\u201d out of 500ml plastic bags to keep us cool in the muggy 30C heat. We spend our evenings drinking Club lager and gossiping with locals, surfers and other travellers on the beach, before walking back through the dusty paths of the village at night. We pass sleeping goats and oil lamp-illuminated domestic scenes; a woman grinding yam with a long stick, or a man stitching fabric with an old Singer sewing machine.     Peter Ansah and Kofi Acquah inside the Black Star Surf Shop.    One evening we join Ben and Kofi for dinner at the Busua Inn. A French-Ghanain restaurant, it\u2019s a notably smarter choice for dinner than the other friendly, delicious yet low-key joints on the beach and the road behind it, such as Florence\u2019s and Okorye Tree. It\u2019s a chance to hear more from 24-year-old Kofi about how he came to join the steadily growing crew of surfers in the village. \u201cI had to learn to swim first,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d been trying to swim at the lagoon but almost drowned. I started surfing to be able to save people in trouble in the water. I started out working for Black Star about six years ago, helping out in the shop, but eventually I told Peter I just wanted to be surfing. Last year I got my life guard certificate.\u201d Kofi now gives lessons and hopes to eventually set up his own shop. He is especially proud to see the younger kids taking to the waves. The surf school is also partners with Black Star Development, which runs the Surf N Impact volunteer programme set up by Ebenezer Felix Bentum - who is also from Busua. The programme ties together surfing, environmentalism, community projects and education. \u201cWe do lessons with the local school children,\u201d says Ben. \u201cBut only if they turn up for classes. Attendance just went right up.\u201d     Ben Dewar (left) with the owner of the Coconut Dreams bar on Busua beach.     As the scene grows and attracts more tourists, other villages still largely untouched by tourism are becoming curious. \u201cSome of them find it really interesting,\u201d says Kofi, \u201cand some people in Agona and Takoradi just think its funny that I\u2019m teaching white people to do things.\u201d When the tide is less favourable and the waves a bit \u201cdumpy\u201d we explore the surrounding villages. Butre, to the east, can be reached via a spectacular walk (far safer to be done with a local guide), through the shrub and over the peninsula with views back over Busua. A few miles inland is Agona - taken over every Wednesday by a weekly market. Peter joins us on a walk westwards along the jungle path to Dixcove, a small bay filled with brightly painted fishing boats, their coloured flags \u2013from the Union Jack to the stars and stripes \u2013 flickering in the wind. While the village has the same affection for Chelsea FC as Busua (the club\u2019s crest can be found hand painted on carts and sheds) there is almost no sign of tourism there. Our arrival is greeted with cries of \u201cObruni! Obruni!\u201d (white person! white person!) from the local children. \u201cBibini!\u201d (meaning black person!) is the stock reply, usually greeted by laughs.     Kofi Stephen Yankey has seen Busua develop from a quiet fishing village into the heart of the country\u2019s surf scene.    As the night falls on our final evening, we take to the beach once more. Bamboo is piled up to make a bonfire and we drink and dance as the waves crash into darkness. I take the opportunity to speak to one of the village elders, Kofi Stephen Yankey, to find out more about Busua\u2019s past. Kofi, who\u2019s in his 70s and has lived in Busua for over 50 years, acts as security outside Black Star and Coconut Dreams, where he sits in dazzling Hawaiian shirts and shakes his stick at the kids if they get too close. He has seen Busua develop into an increasingly popular resort. Now, not least because of the laid-back and inclusive community cultivated by the surfers, visitors are more involved with village life. \u201cBefore, we could only sell kerosene and cigarettes to visitors,\u201d he says. \u201cNow everyone eats banku, everyone eats foo foo (Ghanaian casava dumplings). Previously, we would take any plank of wood and surf on our fronts. Now, things are very different.\u201d As the fire starts to dim, people drift off from the beach to their beds. We have only been in Busua for a week but every face is already a familiar one. \u201cThere\u2019s a phrase we have here,\u201d says Kofi, sipping on his beer, as I try to imagine him surfing on a plank as a youngster. \u201cA village without strangers is not a good village.\u201d \u2022 Flights were provided by KLM (020-7660 0293, klm.com), which flies from London Heathrow and 14 other UK regional airports to Accra via Amsterdam from \u00a3526 return.

Studio Ghibli will cease film-making after 29 years of production, Suzuki told the show Jounetsu Tairiku, downsizing its staff to manage trademarks and copyrights on its existing portfolio of 20 feature films.

The reason for his extreme existential ennui was that his four closest friends Aka, Ao, Shiro and Kuro, from whom he had been inseparable for 10 years, had announced they didn&apos;t want to speak to him ever again. Rather than ask them why, he had decided the fault lay in his name. Aka\u00a0meant Red, Ao meant Blue, Shiro meant Black and Kuro meant White. His name had no colour; it just meant Making a Mountain out of a Molehill. &quot;I\u00a0am colorless,&quot; he thought. &quot;So colorless I don&apos;t even have a &apos;U&apos; in the\u00a0word.&quot; By the time he had reached his late 30s, Tsukuru had visited nearly every railway station in Japan and had designed a notice board on a suburban platform outside Tokyo. More impressively, he had finally met a woman who didn&apos;t think it was about time he grew up a bit and stopped taking Camus so personally. &quot;I think I quite like you,&quot; he told Sara, as he entered her vagina that was unnecessarily described in terms of excessive moistness. &quot;I quite like you, too,&quot; she replied. &quot;Though I can&apos;t help feeling you are rather detached and have unresolved personal issues.&quot; &quot;As the great teacher Donald Rumsfeld once said, &apos;There are known knowns; there are things that we know that we know.

She was commissioned to write a piece \u201clooking back at the Velvet Underground\u201d. \u201cWhy always looking back?\u201d she asked, and went off to work in a situationist fetish shop in Chelsea instead. The Velvet Underground had split up a mere four years earlier, in 1970. When I first read this, I was reading Jon Savage writing in 1991 looking back at her refusing to look back in 1974; and to remember why this interested me, I suppose I have to look back at myself in 1997. I bought England\u2019s Dreaming with a book token in the basement of Southampton\u2019s branch of Waterstones in the summer when I received unexpectedly decent GCSE results \u2013 mostly Cs, Ds and Es, but top heavy with A*s in history and English literature. The book token was a reward for this achievement, although from which parent I can\u2019t remember. I\u2019d had my eye on the book for a while, dipping into it while doing work experience at the local radical bookshop. Over the next two years I would read and reread it until the spine broke, and do what it implored me to do: move to London.  The first two of the book\u2019s many epigraphs were from Jonathan Raban\u2019s Soft City \u2013 \u201cIn the city we can change our identities at will\u201d \u2013 and Lionel Bart\u2019s Oliver! \u2013 \u201cWe wander through London, who knows what we might find?\u201d How could you refuse? The meat of England\u2019s Dreaming is a great pop tragedy: spoilt brat, ultra-leftist art student Malcolm McLaren starts shop, makes clothes, meets kleptomaniac glam rock fan Steve Jones, meets hyperintelligent London-Irish krautrock fan John Lydon, starts band \u201cto sell a lot of trousers\u201d, succeeds way beyond expectations, and makes \u201ccash from chaos\u201d before it all dissolves under media pressure and speed psychosis into acrimony, litigation and murder. But after finishing the story, it was the extraneous detail, the interweaving scene-setting on fashion, pop, far-left terrorism, psychoanalysis, the avant garde and the termination of the postwar consensus that I would compulsively reread. Unlike Greil Marcus\u2019s similar Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, with its fanciful marriage of John Lydon and John of Leiden, all this was concrete, as real as the stories of puking and gobbing. The book built a picture of, to quote Savage quoting McLaren, \u201cthe human architecture of the city\u201d, and provided an apocalyptic vision of England on the eve of Thatcherism \u2013 for Savage, a mirror image of punk\u2019s suburban sado-masochism and its contempt for the woolly compromise of the welfare state. First of all, the book made me notice London. Suburban Southampton is an interminable, Americanised sprawl. I remember in May 1997, the morning after the Labour landslide, when I was allowed to stay up most of the night, going to an Asda somewhere on the M27 and moping around the aisles thinking: \u201cNothing here is going to change.\u201d Savage, meanwhile, described a landscape everyone apparently found unbearable, but which sounded thrilling to me \u2013 \u201cafter Ballard\u2019s High Rise and Crash, it was possible to see high-rises as both appalling and vertiginously exciting\u201d. This appalling excitement he perhaps too kindly ascribes to the sound of the early Clash. The summer I bought the book, we moved from a large, dull, casually violent 1930s estate in the suburbs to Shirley, closer to the docks and the town centre. You could walk around Shirley, with its enormous tower blocks and its endless high street of caffs and charity shops, and pretend the 1970s had never ended. This was something a bit like the \u201curbanism\u201d England\u2019s Dreaming constantly talked about, but it wasn\u2019t London. When I made it there, to study \u2013 like McLaren! I thought \u2013 at Goldsmiths College, the saggy apoliticism of late-90s London was crushingly disappointing, and I wouldn\u2019t discover the traces of Savage\u2019s city until some years later. I also wanted to hear the apocalyptic records mentioned, which widened my listening from the retro rock bands \u2013 Suede, the Manic Street Preachers and the like \u2013 whose citations had made me want to read England\u2019s Dreaming in the first place. This music did not look back: Prince Far I\u2019s Under Heavy Manners \u2013 \u201cas Far I chanted, a synthesiser made otherwordly sounds that resolved into the wail of a police siren\u201d, writes Savage; or Pere Ubu\u2019s 30 Seconds over Tokyo, \u201ca suicide ride so enveloping that you were dissolved in a future that was at once hopeful and dread\u201d. The effect of Savage\u2019s book in praise of pop and the \u201cnow\u201d was that I now listened to more old music than new. England\u2019s Dreaming\u2019s conundrum is the pop-modernist dialectic, and the only writer who caught it as well as Savage was Marshall Berman, who wrote about Hollywood both offering a \u201cdream of escape\u201d from capitalism to his parents\u2019 generation and a \u201cforce that bound them to it\u201d. So too with punk: this generation \u2013 that of my parents \u2013 owed everything to the welfare state, yet they destroyed as much of it as they could. Decades later, I\u2019d find its remnants a lifeline in a society otherwise dominated by privilege and capital. They fucked it up because it wouldn\u2019t let them express themselves, and in the process destroyed all the preconditions \u2013 indulgent art schools, a decent rate of dole, a cheap London and Manchester of council flats and squats \u2013 that made punk possible.

The scene is uncomfortable to watch, even when it takes place on stage. In real life, Price and Deans have had to defend themselves from insults like this for years. They have disabilities, like their co-stars in the Back to Back theatre company. And now some of them are playing the Nazis who once did their best to exterminate the &quot;feebleminded&quot;. The Nazi mass extermination programme for disabled people \u2013 known as T4 \u2013 casts a long shadow over Back to Back&apos;s production of Ganesh Versus the Third Reich. As well as Hitler himself, who is played by Simon Laferty, we meet a character based on Dr Josef Mengele (David Woods). He walks across the stage in an SS uniform, waxing lyrical about his passion for &quot;the abnormal: birth defects, dwarfs, mongoloids, degenerative conditions&quot;. At one point during the play the actors break, remove their costumes \u2013 Ganesh&apos;s elephant head, the SS armband \u2013 and discuss the ethics of the play. &quot;Do we have the right to perform this?&quot; they ask.     The production uses backlit plastic curtains to evoke a night sky in India, a train journey through war-torn Europe and Hitler's bunker. Photograph: Jeff Busby    The main narrative traces the journey of Hindu deity Ganesh (played by Brian Tilley) travelling to Germany to reclaim the swastika, an ancient Sanskrit symbol, from the Nazis. But the actors continually drop out of character to challenge the director. They question the ethics of telling the story. None of the actors are Hindu, and none are Jewish. How could they even dare take on the Holocaust? This discomfort with the production occurred in real life, during rehearsals \u2013 and fragments have made their way into the script. It wasn&apos;t until a residency in Linz, Austria when Back to Back members visited the concentration camp Mauthausen and a nearby institution that had housed disabled people before the second world war \u2013 that the group were convinced they had a moral right to stage the play. &quot;T4 was something we came to and it pushed us over the edge. If a company like Back to Back can&apos;t do it then no one can,&quot; says artistic director Bruce Gladwin. In Ganesh the audience are also pushed to their edge. It&apos;s far from politically correct theatre \u2013 there are a lot of sly laughs, but it&apos;s hard to escape the shadow over this play: the actors are the people Hitler wanted to exterminate. It&apos;s not a cosy production. The actors taunt the audience, (&quot;You&apos;ve come to see some freak porn&quot;) and the slightest and most gentle member of the cast plays its biggest monster (Simon Laherty as Hitler) \u2013 resulting in a visual disconnect.     At one point during the play the actors break, remove their costumes, and ask: 'Do we have the right to perform this?' Photograph: Jeff Busby    Not everyone comes away feeling comfortable with the play. An audience member in Belgium stood up during a Q&amp;A and said: &quot;I don&apos;t believe these actors are capable of creating this. I&apos;m not convinced they made this show. I know these type of people and I don&apos;t think they can do it.&quot; Scott Price took the microphone and told the man to leave. &quot;It&apos;s not pretty but I&apos;ve stood up for people,&quot; he says. &quot;In Geelong at a workshop a woman called me mentally challenged. I don&apos;t like that.&quot; Ganesh versus the Third Reich evolved during a workshop held several years before the play was first staged in Melbourne in 2011. &quot;We started off Ganesh very open \u2013 we had no idea about content,&quot; says Gladwin. One of the actors developed an obsession with Ganesh during the workshop and was constantly drawing the figure. Gladwin began experimenting with amplifying and distorting the actors&apos; voices and from this a &quot;terrifying neo-Nazi character&quot; was created. Unsure what to do with a Hindu god and a neo-Nazi, a Google search provided a link. &quot;We learned that they shared a symbol. There were a number of websites dedicated to this idea that the Nazis had appropriated the swastika from the Hindus. We were all just fascinated with that.&quot; The stunning production \u2013 which has travelled to New York, London, Paris and Tokyo - uses backlit plastic curtains to evoke a night sky in India, a train journey through war-torn Europe, Hitler&apos;s bunker and the fall of the Brandenburg Gate. The New York Times critic Ben Brantley described the play as a &quot;vital, senses-sharpening tonic for theatregoers who feel they&apos;ve seen it all&apos;&apos;. It was named one of the Guardian&apos;s best plays of 2012. But Back to Back are no flash in the pan. They are one of the few theatre companies operating in Australia that has a full-time ensemble. The company was established in 1987 following the deinstitutionalisation of mental health services in Victoria, and has toured around half a dozen major works. None has been more popular than Ganesh Versus the Third Reich. Gladwin loves watching the audience reactions \u2013 particularly during the more confronting parts of the play. &quot;You can feel that tension when the audience starts sitting forwards on their seats,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s an interesting piece that provokes different reactions \u2013 where someone is in shock and someone can be laughing and they are sitting next to each other.&quot; \u2022 Ganesh Versus the Third Reich is at the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, from 9-12 August as part of the Edinburgh international festival."}, {"sentences": ["He was a young man who worked in a bar in Tokyo but he left and dedicated his whole life to art and when people asked him to do social things he would say: &apos;No, I&apos;m going to write.&apos; He made writing a real priority and I admire that.&quot; Quick wrote his thesis on another Asian author, Gao Xingjian."], "tags": ["Children and teenagers", "Books", "Culture", "Teen books", "Edinburgh international book festival", "Edinburgh festival", "Edinburgh international book festival 2014"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-12T10:21:00Z", "title": "Matthew Quick: \"I wouldn't be here right now if I wasn't writing.\"", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/aug/12/matthew-quick-interview-edinburgh-international-book-festival-2014", "article": "On a sombre, damp day at the Edinburgh international book festival, in a freezing tent streaked with paint, I met Matthew Quick. Earlier that day, the YA and fiction author was up on stage with fellow YA heavyweight Melvin Burgess. The two authors had never met prior to this year&apos;s Edinburgh international book festival but they had visible chemistry, stirring in me a sudden desire to see a collaboration between the two. &quot;I remember reading The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway when I was young and getting that it was more than just a story, that it was a metaphor,&quot; Quick says when I ask him about the books that inspired him to write. &quot;As clich\u00e9 as that sounds I felt that I was accessing this new world and it was one of the first times that I knew what a story did, and I knew I wanted to write.&apos;&quot; &quot;But,&quot; he continues. &quot;There have been many other books like Kurt Vonnegut&apos;s Slaughterhouse Five, and that&apos;s when I realised I could write something smart, but also be crass and curse and speak like the people I grew up with. That was very liberating for me because in the neighbourhood where I grew up (Quick lived in Philadelphia), people were not expected to write novels so that, I felt, was a gift Kurt gave to me.&quot; What would today&apos;s Quick tell himself back then? &quot;Not to worry so much \u2013 but I knew I would worry anyway,&quot; he says. &quot;I would say that childhood doesn&apos;t last that long because I don&apos;t remember being particularly happy as a teenager and I didn&apos;t know what was going to come next.&quot; &quot;A lot of amazing things did come after I was out of my teenage years that I never believed would happen. If you had told me at ten, or twelve, or fifteen that I would ever leave the United States, I wouldn&apos;t have believed you, but here I am today, in Scotland. It was an impossibility for someone who lived in the neighbourhood I grew up in.&quot; We move on to the topic of The Good Luck of Right Now, his latest book which is, right now, transitioning from the page to the silver screen. With Quick&apos;s The Silver Linings Playbook adapted into an Oscar-winning film, he clearly has a healthy relationship with Hollywood right now. &quot;DreamWorks optioned [The Good Luck of Right Now] and it was fully cast except for Bartholomew (the book&apos;s lead character) this spring. Dayton and Faris (the husband and wife directing team behind Little Miss Sunshine) were scheduled to direct and I met with them in LA; they&apos;re amazing people. But they had a disagreement with Steven Spielberg over who should be cast as Bartholomew and so they dropped out \u2013 and now they&apos;re recasting.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s a lot of stuff going on that&apos;s very, very cool but I&apos;m not allowed to tell you about it,&quot; he explains with a laugh. Who was his childhood hero? Quick thinks for a moment before responding. &quot;My grandfather,&quot; he says firmly, &quot;because my dad was hard on me and my grandfather always picked up the slack. He was the one who took me to the movies and gave me some bucks on the side. He was also somebody who made me feel loved at a time when I didn&apos;t feel loved. He got me through a rough period.&quot; Does he have heroes now, in adulthood? &quot;I have a lot of literary heroes, you know. There are a lot of people I admire, but especially writers. Look at someone like Haruki Murakami: I admire him not because of his success or the money he has, but it&apos;s his dedication to writing. He was a young man who worked in a bar in Tokyo but he left and dedicated his whole life to art and when people asked him to do social things he would say: &apos;No, I&apos;m going to write.&apos; He made writing a real priority and I admire that.&quot; Quick wrote his thesis on another Asian author, Gao Xingjian. &quot;[Gao] wrote Soul Mountain and he talked a lot about &apos;cold&apos; literature in his Nobel Prize award acceptance speech. What that meant was that we should not write about what trends are hot, that cold literature is what we want to write. When I write I think about that a lot. I really admire both of those writers tremendously.&quot; What would have Quick done if he was not a writer? &quot;This is going to sound morbid,&quot; he begins candidly, &quot;but I was a teacher at a high school and I wanted to be a writer and I was deeply unhappy when I was teaching and I would go in every day, putting a mask on and pretending I was happy. At the end of that, I fell into a really serious depression. I don&apos;t say this lightly but I don&apos;t think I would be here right now if I wasn&apos;t writing.&quot; &quot;My mentor used to say that if you&apos;re an artist and you don&apos;t make art then the best part of you dies. That&apos;s how I felt when I was teaching. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything else from me other than writing. It scares the hell out of me to think if someone stopped giving me money to write\u2026 I wouldn&apos;t know what to do.&quot; If you live in the UK, you can contact ChildLine at any time on 0800 1111.

Kobayashi is cheating, but with honourable intentions. Almost three decades after Sigourney Weaver&apos;s power loader made short work of heavy lifting in Aliens, he is the brains behind a new generation of &quot;muscle suits&quot; specially designed for Japan&apos;s rising number of elderly citizens, and their care workers. &quot;The idea is to help people live independently and self-sufficiently,&quot; said Kobayashi, a professor at Tokyo University of Science who has been perfecting the prototype device for more than a decade. &quot;The joints are moved by artificial muscles, so the wearer is able to move about unencumbered. There is zero risk to the wearer, even if it malfunctions.&quot; Kobayashi&apos;s 5kg muscle suit, which goes on sale next month, is expected to be adopted first by manual and agricultural workers, who are prone to lower back pain, as well as employees at daycare and retirement homes. As the suits become more sophisticated and affordable, Kobayashi and his collaborators at the die maker Kikuchi Seisakusho predict they will be in common use among disabled and elderly people with mobility problems, possibly by the end of this decade. The muscle suit has earned good reviews where it has been trialled \u2013 not least from care workers who had been forced to take time off with back problems brought on by, among other tasks, lifting residents into and out of baths. &quot;In the past when workers lifted people, they had to really exert themselves, which also had the effect of causing anxiety among the elderly people they were caring for,&quot; Kobayashi said. &quot;The muscle suit makes lifting so much easier, and the people being cared for don&apos;t have to worry about being dropped.&quot; Kikuchi Seisakusho&apos;s factory in Fukushima prefecture is expected to manufacture up to 200 muscle suits a month, starting this summer. Initially, the suits will be rented out for about 25,000 yen (\u00a3146) a month, with a smaller number being sold for \u00a5300,000-\u00a5800,000, the firm&apos;s president, Isao Kikuchi, said. &quot;It&apos;s very rare that a piece of equipment like this is made commercially available,&quot; he added. &quot;The elderly care and medical markets are only going to get bigger, so we want to make the most of the opportunity. Tokyo University of Science and Kikuchi Seisakusho are not alone in trying to develop affordable, fully functional exoskeletons. Cyberdyne, based near Tokyo, has had some success with its Hybrid Assistive Limb [HAL] robotic suit, which it rents out to hospitals and care facilities, including several in Europe. And Japan&apos;s government is offering subsidies to encourage engineers to develop even more sophisticated robotics for the medical and elderly care markets. The care robotics industry alone will be worth \u00a535bn (\u00a3200m) by the end of the decade, according to a study by Yano Research Institute. &quot;I don&apos;t think anyone else is doing what we&apos;re doing with the muscle suit,&quot; Kobayashi said. &quot;No other suit can be worn with this much ease that also enables its wearer to pick up something weighing as much as 30kg. The US military has something similar, but even that&apos;s not as easy to use as ours, which takes 10 seconds to put on.&quot; In the coming years, the suits could be common sights in places such as JC Group&apos;s facility, a once-vacant traditional-style house that has been converted into a care home for the elderly as the country attempts to ease the social and financial strain of supporting its greying population. The house, in Koganei, western Tokyo, is part of a shift towards smaller care facilities for the elderly as traditional nursing homes struggle to cope with the 520,000 people on waiting lists for specialised care. &quot;I entered this market seven years ago and already we have almost 800 facilities throughout Japan,&quot; said JC Group&apos;s chairman, Hideaki Fujita. &quot;You only have to look around to see how much demand there is, particularly among elderly people with Alzheimer&apos;s.&quot; Japan will feel the pressure of its ageing population even more keenly in the decades to come. Almost 5.4 million of its 31 million-strong population of over-64s need assistance with daily activities, according to the health and welfare ministry. The average life expectancy of Japanese men exceeded 80 years for the first time last year, according to government figures, while the country&apos;s women retained their place at the top of the global longevity rankings with a record average life expectancy of 86.6 years. &quot;I&apos;ve come across countless families who can&apos;t cope with the demands of looking after an elderly relative,&quot; said Fujita, whose Koganei facility can accommodate 10 elderly people during the day and up to five overnight. &quot;In the end, the stress becomes too much for them and they go to pieces. But here, they know that elderly members of their family are being looked after somewhere that isn&apos;t much different from their own homes. &quot;We keep numbers low so that users quickly get to know each other and the members of staff. It gives everyone peace of mind.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["According to Associated Press, Taylor did not want to talk about the case during his time in court, instead musing on the \u201cquality of trees on the train ride between Tokyo and Kyoto, the Kabuki dancers he had once seen in a Balanchine ballet, and the conductor Pierre Boulez\u201d."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Jazz", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-13T12:27:06Z", "title": "Jazz pioneer Cecil Taylor allegedly swindled of $500,000 Kyoto prize", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/13/jazz-pioneer-cecil-taylor-allegedly-swindled-of-500000-kyoto-prize", "article": "Cecil Taylor had a prize sum of nearly half a million dollars stolen from him by a general contractor who befriended the pioneering jazz pianist while working next to his house in New York City, according to a criminal court in Brooklyn.

He is currently waiting arraignment on a charge of grand larceny in Brooklyn\u2019s criminal court.

According to a statement by the district attorney in Brooklyn, Muir, a contractor who had worked for Taylor\u2019s neighbour, joined him for the event and helped the musician prepare for the trip. While in Japan, Taylor, 85, is said to have provided the Inamori Foundation with details of his bank account in order for the Kyoto prize money to be wired directly.

Soon afterwards, Tokyo eased sanctions against Pyongyang.  Lee, who uses the slogan the \u201cgod of vocal\u201d, broke on to the pop scene in the 1980s with the band Boohwal.

Lake \u2013 the youngest athlete in Zurich \u2013 competes in the high jump in which she has cleared 1.94m this season but her real speciality is the heptathlon, where rosy comparisons have been made with the Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis-Hill as well as Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who leads the world this year but is missing these championships with a foot injury. The teenager is better than both of them at the same age. In February she broke the world indoor youth pentathlon record of the 2004 Olympic champion Carolina Kluft. Then three months later, at 16, she entered and won her first senior heptathlon at the Multistars event in Florence, beating the Commonwealth silver medallist Jessica Zelinka and smashing Johnson-Thompson\u2019s UK youth record of 5,481 points by more than 400 points. A breakthrough spring has extended into a glorious summer. In June, Lake crashed through the 6,000 points barrier \u2013 the marker of a world-class heptathlete \u2013 for the first time, while in July she won a double gold in the heptathlon and high jump at the world junior championships in Eugene. And while no one expects Lake to continue the magic against the best high jumpers in the world, it would be unwise to underestimate the studious schoolgirl from Surrey who is enjoying every moment of her step up to the big time. \u201cIt\u2019s cool being with the senior team for the first time,\u201d she says,before admitting to being starstruck when she had lunch with Dwain Chambers earlier this week. \u201cBut it\u2019s quite weird too. When I was really young I was watching these people.\u201d When Jo Pavey, the 40-year-old who won gold in the 10,000m on Tuesday, first competed in a Great Britain vest at the 1997 world championships in Athens, Lake was two months old. And the first Olympics she remembers watching is Beijing in 2008. She has the confidence of youth but it is tinged with realism. While the favourite Blanka Vlasic \u2013 who has jumped 2m this season \u2013 is missing through injury, Lake knows she will have to improve her outdoor personal best of 1.94m by at least a couple of centimetres to enter into medal contention. \u201cMost of the best high jumpers in the world are here, and I\u2019m not ranked that highly so I am really here to try to pick up as much experience as I can,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I am hoping for a personal best or a height around my PB.\u201d She is not competing in the heptathlon because the exertions of the world junior championships are still lingering, and at her age it is about making a splash, not drowning in the high waves of expectation. \u201cI took a lot from competing in Eugene,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was quite an experience but it was never the plan to do the high jump as well. I entered it as a back-up just in case the heptathlon didn\u2019t go as well as planned. But I was there, so I thought I might as well try it.\u201d Lake, who is studying for A-Levels in PE, English and business at the prestigious Wellington College boarding school, whose alumni include George Orwell, admits it can be a struggle to fit in training with studying. \u201cI don\u2019t get special dispensation, so it\u2019s been quite hard to fit everything in.

By then she hopes to have gone to University of Bath and competed a degree in sports science or psychology. For now, though, she wants to wallow in the present. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have pressure on me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only pressure comes from what I put on myself \u2013 and to be honest I\u2019m more excited than nervous.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Hannah J Davies The Last Bomb9pm, PBS America With occasional footnotes from a modern-day US air force expert, this programme is essentially a propaganda documentary (made at the time) of a daylight raid on Tokyo in 1945, as the US homed in on victory over the Japanese."], "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Sport TV", "Documentary", "Reality TV"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-15T06:30:10Z", "title": "TV highlights 15/08/2014", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/15/on-yorkshire-buses-tv-highlights", "article": "International Test Cricket: England v India10am, Sky Sports 2 The Oval plays host to the fifth and final Test of a series that has seen England arrest a 354-day lean spell by picking up an unexpected victory in the third Test.

The previous meeting here between the sides ended with a comprehensive home victory \u2013 a repeat this time around will surely brighten the summer of all English cricket fans. Mark Jones On the Yorkshire Buses8pm, Channel 5 While it may now seem that there isn&apos;t a business left in Britain that has not at some time been the subject of a fly-on-the-wall series, there&apos;s always something usefully humbling \u2013 and at least a bit interesting \u2013 about seeing how much work goes into the things we take for granted, in this instance catching a bus in East Yorkshire. In tonight&apos;s episode, roadworks wreak havoc with the timetables, a protest march wreaks havoc in downtown Hull, and a hen party wreaks havoc on an open-top tourer. Andrew Mueller Scrappers8.30pm, BBC1 Terry and Lyndsay, the king and queen of Bolton scrap, have been getting on famously so far in this fly-on-the-wall series, but when Terry decides to hold an open day-cum-birthday bash at Metro Salvage to celebrate 21 years in the business, things start to get tense. Terry finds out that his young protege Boyle has been arrested after a police chase on his dirt bike and, combined with the pressure of a lull in business and the open day looming, he blows up at Lyndsay in Debs&apos;s on-site cafe, putting both the event and their marriage in jeopardy. Ben Arnold Boomers9pm, BBC1 Imagine a world where Russ Abbot is shacked up with Stephanie Beacham, but threatened by the appearance of Nigel Planer, who has a thirtysomething Lithuanian wife. Welcome to the first episode of this frisky 60-plus sitcom, which is ushered in with a funeral. Even though the cast don&apos;t get any hilarious one-liners to show off yet, there&apos;s also the charming promise of Alison Steadman as Joyce, the ringleader for the newly retired and easily-bored posse, as well as June Whitfield, who&apos;s set to appear later in the series. Hannah Verdier The Singer Takes it All9pm, Channel 4 Earlier in the year E4 aired Party House, a reality knees-up that saw a rolling cast of ravers enjoy blink-and-you&apos;ll-miss-it infamy. Now they&apos;ve brought the same brand of cold disposability to the humble singing competition, with pop potentials plucked from obscurity and critiqued by savvy app-using viewers. So far the show has suffered both poor ratings and technical gaffes bad enough to have left viewers nostalgic for good old premium rate phone lines and a judging panel. Alan Carr hosts. Hannah J Davies The Last Bomb9pm, PBS America With occasional footnotes from a modern-day US air force expert, this programme is essentially a propaganda documentary (made at the time) of a daylight raid on Tokyo in 1945, as the US homed in on victory over the Japanese. Gongs aplenty on the soundtrack as the B-29s hit their mark, while the bleached colours and dashing heroism of the pilots are eerily evocative. But there&apos;s much talk about &quot;engagement&quot; and little of the horror they wrought on the ground.

Consider, for instance, last week&apos;s excited headlines over the fact that American venture capitalists had invested $50m in Buzzfeed, the wunderkind of website growth (currently claimed at 75% a year). Factor in the usual Wall Street multiples and that, supposedly, makes BuzzFeed worth $850m \u2013 as against the $250m Jeff Bezos from Amazon paid last year for the Washington Post. What? BuzzFeed worth over three times more than the mighty Post? Or nearly half as much as the New York Times? Trim the tripe and pass the vinegar \u2026 Nothing, of course, diminishes the fact that BuzzFeed is an internet phenomenon \u2013 and an increasingly ominous media contender whenever publishers gather. Even the editor of the Sun told a Guardian interviewer the other day that now &quot;we understand that our competitive set is Google, Facebook and BuzzFeed \u2026 as much as the Mail&quot;. You can hear the editor-in-chief at the Telegraph sing much the same song every day, confirming that the Feed&apos;s trademark &quot;listicles&quot; are moving from innovation to cliche as his travel team invites readers to ponder &quot;the 27 most annoying things about flying&quot;. All around us, newspapers, magazines and websites are suddenly playing the same game. They list things here, they list things there: they dismember normal articles into instantly digestible points everywhere. There are allegedly umpteen ways to attract the young readers advertisers love in Buzz world. Thus, over eight spectacular years, BuzzFeed has grown from a gleam in its founder&apos;s eye to employing 550 staff in New York, London, Paris and Sydney. It stands at number 12 on Quantcast&apos;s monthly US top 100 unique visitors table: far ahead of the New York Times (59) or the Guardian (97); and 13 million uniques a month in the UK make it a potent force to be reckoned with here too.     American journalist Beverly Deepe talks to women in Vietnam in 1962. She spent seven years in the country, becoming the longest-serving western journalist to cover the war. Photograph: AP    Now last week&apos;s cash injection from Andreessen Horowitz \u2013 a notably successful investor in new media \u2013 will help to fuel more rapid expansion round the globe (offices in Berlin, Mexico City, Tokyo, Mumbai) plus BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, a new unit based in Los Angeles planning to produce everything from short videos to full-length feature films (perhaps remakes of Twelve Angry Men and 100 Spartans?). Meanwhile, Chris Dixon from Andreessen is joining the BuzzFeed board, lauding the way that &quot;internet native formats like lists, tweets, pins, animated gifs etc are treated as equals to older formats like photos, videos and long form essays \u2013 BuzzFeed takes the internet and computer science seriously&quot;. Dixon, &quot;a small, early investor in the project&quot; himself, duly hails Jonah Peretti and his founding team. &quot;BuzzFeed now reaches 105 million people a month, is consistently profitable and will generate triple digit millions in revenues this year.&quot; Which is the natural moment to reach for that bottle of best balsamic. The buzz is, indeed, terrific. The ambition involved stands as tall as the headlines. But $100m \u2013 those fabled triple digits \u2013 means only \u00a359.5m at prevailing rates. Dixon&apos;s venture capital punt comes in under \u00a330m. Consistent profitability, without hard numbers attached, has been claimed only since 2013. As for &quot;competitive set&quot; newspaper figures, the New York Times took $1,577,230,000 in total revenues last year, a profusion of digits, with online ads alone \u2013 at $163m, a 10.3% slice of the whole \u2013 leaving BuzzFeed far behind. On what sensible basis, pray, is BuzzFeed worth nearly 50% of the great grey Times? And how can we take an &quot;early investor&apos;s&quot; word for it? Is this yet what Dixon can truly call an emerging &quot;pre-eminent media company&quot;? It&apos;s a question of both balance and overall ambition. Founder Peretti remembers the moment &quot;when we went from being a tech company experimenting with content to being a company that took editorial seriously&quot;. He hired Ben Smith, a seasoned professional from the Politico site, as editor-in-chief. He moved to embrace &quot;not just serious editorial, but to take entertaining editorial seriously, and news content seriously, and to have a more ambitious editorial mission&quot;. &quot;Seriously&quot; is the buzz word of the moment. BuzzFeed wants to move away \u2013 or, rather, broaden away \u2013 from its stock, parodied image as the monarch of glib listings. From &quot;16 Awesome Six-toed cats Who Live In Ernest Hemingway&apos;s Old House&quot;, through &quot;17 Hacks That Will Make Your BBQ Awesome&quot;, to &quot;15 Harrowing Pictures Of Iraq&apos;s Yazidi Fleeing The Advance of Isis&quot;. But those three postings, and many more like them, sat together on the site last week. The barbecue list is sponsored by Hellman&apos;s. Other adjacent lists come courtesy of Volvo and Asda. For the way BuzzFeed makes its money hinges on native advertising, aka sponsored lists of goodies that plug a product but fit seamlessly with the look and style of the site so that they&apos;re instantly able to roam the wide open spaces of Facebook at the click of a mobile button: another cash-coining device being copied far and print wide, another &quot;serious&quot; contribution to modern media survival. The last time I wrote about BuzzFeed in the Observer (in April), Ben Smith came steaming back. He cited the hiring of Miriam Elder and Paul Hamilos from the Guardian, Max Seddon&apos;s reports from Ukraine, Mike Giglio&apos;s coverage of Syria, Pulitzer Prize-winning Chris Hamby&apos;s new investigation team \u2026 and much, much more: &quot;You&apos;ll find that we are doing both deep reporting and original entertainment, and some formal experimentation \u2013 but we are not looking for some lame hybrid of the two, but to hit as hard as possible wherever we play.&quot; And there&apos;s the rub. The whole point of such aspirational net operation is that it does need to be comprehensive. Newspapers, after all, have to provide a bit of everything: news, weather, TV programmes, finance, sport, crosswords, the lot. You need &quot;to play&quot; everywhere. This is what makes any transition to the web, and a rolling out around the globe, so hard and costly. But BuzzFeed \u2013 like the Huffington Post, where Peretti started his digital career \u2013 doesn&apos;t compete across the piste. Its sports section doesn&apos;t acknowledge Europe, let alone Great Britain. (Try &quot;61 Thoughts People Who Don&apos;t Work Out Have At The Gym&quot; instead). Its UK politics spread is better than that \u2013 &quot;Watch This Half-Naked Scottish Nationalist Deliver A Passionate Poem for Independence&quot; \u2013 but still not remotely up-to-the-minute or comprehensive enough. Why should it be when BBC.com can throw many times the resources at it? No: BuzzFeed, just like Vice, Vox and other new stars in the same online firmament, is basically an eclectic agglomeration of news and entertainment, essentially a magazine: part the Tit-Bits that George Newnes started in 1881, part the Answers that set Lord Northcliffe on his path to glory, part Economist and Sunday Times colour mag. Young readers are supposed to put in a thumb and pull out a plum, with or without a squirt of Hellman&apos;s. There is no overall news vision. Anyone who wants to understand what&apos;s going on around them will need to scan a conventional paper or tune into proper TV or radio bulletins first. The Feed is extra. The Buzz is a blend of algorithms and gloriously mixed messages. Look at the top trending items and you won&apos;t find gritty seriousness making much of a show. You can make sense of all this if BuzzFeed is seen as the launching pad for millions of social messages, a referral resource rather than a coherent product. Does it matter if tweets and Facebook pages pass on quite separate stories (or lists) and make money in the process? Who cares if disguised mayo ads and Syrian bloodshed lie side by side in Buzz world? &quot;The most interesting tech companies aren&apos;t trying to sell software to other companies,&quot; Dixon says. &quot;They are trying to reshape industries from top to bottom. BuzzFeed has technology at its core. Its 100-plus tech team has created world-class systems for analytics, advertising and content management. Engineers are first-class citizens.&quot; In one sense, you can admire a lot of that. You can admire the Feed&apos;s technical skill, its innovative way of finding an audience. But there&apos;s a second problem lurking behind; what is it finding it for? And how can it keep adding staff and costs without seeing those &quot;consistent profits&quot; slide away? There&apos;s more than hype here. But no one, amid so much febrile buzz, can tell how much \u2013 or prefer a proper accounting of pros and cons, the ultimate, pre-eminent list of survival."}, {"sentences": ["Every day is somewhere different and there are moments of true jet-lagged confusion: you wake up in the Swiss hotel in Tokyo and you think you&apos;re in Geneva because it says Swiss on the fittings."], "tags": ["The 1975", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-17T18:00:00Z", "title": "The 1975's Matt Healy: how I survived two years on the road", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/17/the-1975-s-matt-healy-how-i-survived-two-years-on-the-road", "article": "In December 2012, Matt Healy got in a van with his bandmates and started touring bars, clubs and dives \u2013 wherever the 1975 could play. Now, more than 18 months on, he&apos;s still touring, capping the summer festival season with yet another UK tour, yet another European tour and yet another US tour, which will take the band through to the end of 2014 with two solid years on the road. The result has been a No 1 album in the UK, a worldwide fanbase and the sense that this band could actually be huge in the US, rather than just pictured on the cover of the NME in front of the Statue of Liberty waving a Union Jack with the claim they will &quot;conquer America&quot;. But how did Healy survive life on the road that long? And what did he learn along the way? I can&apos;t do planes All our crew go: &quot;You know what? I can&apos;t wait for a nice seven-hour sitdown, watch a couple of films.&quot; But I have to take as many legal drugs as I can to pass out, because when I get on a plane it&apos;s like how an exam used to be at school. At no point did I think: &quot;I&apos;ve got two hours to do the best I can.&quot; I just used to think: &quot;I&apos;ve got two hours until I&apos;m allowed out of this fucking room.&quot; So I sleep. Because if I&apos;m watching a film, it&apos;s like watching a clock count down. \u2026 but I love tour buses The tour bus lounge is a beautiful place. If you&apos;ve got a good driver, what you have is a travelling hotel. I&apos;d much rather be on the bus for a month than in a car and a new hotel every day. Glastonbury was incredible: I&apos;d been on that bus for two weeks, sleeping in the same bunk every night. So I basically got to take my bed to Glastonbury. I absolutely loved that. In the depths of boredom, you&apos;ll do\u00a0anything There&apos;s a game we have called Birds Eye Potato Waffles. You sit in a circle and take it in turns to say any kind of food that comes to mind. That&apos;s when you know you&apos;ve reached the depths of boredom \u2013 after six hours at Heathrow, say, when you&apos;re meant to be in Florida. But the best way to deal with boredom on the road is to be creative: give us a night off and a laptop and we&apos;ll record a song. . I read a lot, too, though I can&apos;t figure out if I&apos;m reading all these books because I want to be clever enough to deal with everything, or whether I&apos;m reading them for enjoyment. If I&apos;m really bored, I&apos;ll have a look at the internet, see what people are saying. When you&apos;re in a room on your own in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and @monkfish125 calls you a knob, getting wound up about it can be entertaining. I&apos;m not as good at keeping in touch as I thought Gigs in Britain are pretty much the only time I see or talk to my family. Sometimes, I feel guilty when I get a call from someone saying: &quot;I haven&apos;t heard from you in a month.&quot; I think: &quot;Wow, that&apos;s not right.&quot; You have to make an effort. That kind of thing keeps you grounded and sane. I feel that my family are more understanding than my friends, though. They get it.            There&apos;s no such thing as time off The most continuous time off I&apos;ve had since December 2012 is five days. I consider a night off and a day off to be two days off. The other weekend we played a festival in Plymouth, then drove back through the night towards London for our day off. That starts when we get off the bus at six in the morning. I go back home, settle in, have a shower, cup of tea. Ah, back home! And then the silence is\u00a0deafening. It&apos;s not like being home where you can go and see your mum for a couple of days, or go and do something. You know you can&apos;t really leave the flat because you need to be leaving the next morning. I can&apos;t have a walk up to Primrose Hill or get the lads round. It doesn&apos;t happen \u2013 it&apos;s just a day in between gigs. I really want to go home and have fuck all to do. I haven&apos;t done that in ages. It&apos;s not that I want to do fuck all; I just want to remember what that feels like. I spent 10 years thinking: &quot;Fucking hell, I&apos;ve got nothing to do.&quot; But you miss that kind of thing. Maybe we don&apos;t have to say yes to everything, but then we wouldn&apos;t be reaching our full potential. So strike while the iron&apos;s hot. I&apos;m terrified of my metabolism catching up with me Because right now, I can eat whatever I want. I&apos;ll never not have a burger \u2013 but I like good food and I eat quite healthily on tour. You find yourself having to eat fast food for days in America, though, so when we reach a wholefood store, we love green beans and sushi. Our tour manager says: &quot;Eat this salad or you&apos;re going to die.&quot; I don&apos;t have to worry about my weight \u2013 and that&apos;s something that worries me in itself. The second I start getting fat, I&apos;m going to be on the treadmill. I don&apos;t go to the gym at the moment, but then I do play 300 shows in a year. I&apos;m very flamboyant and it does take a lot out of you. And I do press-ups and sit-ups on the bus, maybe go for a jog, but I don&apos;t have a fitness regime. I drink quite a lot of wine now I never used to really drink, but the bottle of wine on stage quickly became something to calm the nerves, and then part of the show. When you have a drink on stage, it changes things. I&apos;m slightly guilty of becoming a bit of a parody of myself, but truly I don&apos;t really put it on \u2013 I am the shirtless moptop with a bottle of wine now. Put it this way: does anyone want a clean Libertines album? There&apos;s a desire for those kind of cliches and there always will be. What people want to see from our band is the personality they connected with in the first place \u2013 the personality who&apos;s slightly confused, who gets overwhelmed and overexcited. I don&apos;t look too far ahead If I did, I&apos;d drive myself crazy. Every day is somewhere different and there are moments of true jet-lagged confusion: you wake up in the Swiss hotel in Tokyo and you think you&apos;re in Geneva because it says Swiss on the fittings. There are moments of falling asleep on your feet. You use things to punctuate your day: up at eight, do a radio show \u2013 then I know I can smoke a joint at 11. Six months ago I was always worrying about what was coming next, but now I realise worrying about things I don&apos;t have control over is pointless.            I like to have people I know and trust around me It&apos;s a massive thing. I&apos;m at the helm of this operation that now involves a lot of people and their jobs. I always wanted it to be like that programme Entourage: I want to take all my mates with me, have us be a crew. And\u00a0it feels like that sometimes. But\u00a0I&apos;m also proud that I haven&apos;t compromised myself creatively or professionally \u2013 the reason the guys are on the crew is\u00a0that they&apos;re the best men for the job, and the reason they&apos;re the best men for the job is they&apos;ve been working as hard as I have for the whole time. We have a relationship where we can tell each other openly that we love each other and to fuck off in the same sentence. It needs to be like that. People aren&apos;t going to relate to someone with an inflated ego. One of the reason our fans have invested in the band is that there&apos;s a humility to it and a naivety to it that I haven&apos;t lost. I know who I am. I&apos;m not a cock. I don&apos;t get any enjoyment from being remotely negative to anyone \u2013 the only thing you have is your connection with people. If I&apos;m as nice as I am to everybody for the rest of my career, say it lasts 10 years, no one will be calling me a knobhead in 10 years. The audience are what keeps every show exciting Because we do a show with triggered lighting and sound, every set is pretty much the same. So if I do five shows on consecutive nights, the fifth night starts to feel like Groundhog Day. I find myself having to think of things to say. But there&apos;s something Nils Lofgren said about playing with Bruce Springsteen. He was asked if he got bored by playing Born to Run 200 nights a year, every year. He said he looks into the audience, because they don&apos;t get to hear Born to Run 200 nights a year, every year. He looks at the faces at the front, and how they&apos;re reacting, and he feeds off that. I get lost in\u00a0people&apos;s faces, in the kids who are crying. It&apos;s very seldom I don&apos;t jump down after a song to hug a kid who&apos;s crying, because it means so much to me \u2013 it&apos;s not about your experience, it&apos;s about their\u00a0experience. And I understand the sense of connection fans get when I interact with them at a show.     Matty Healy. Photograph: Tony Woollscroft    I used to love this little band called the Maple State. I remember seeing them at the Academy 3 in Manchester. There couldn&apos;t have been more than 10 people there, but in my head there were about 35,000. The guitarist did a move where he turned round and pointed at me \u2013 it meant so much to me that I&apos;m still talking about it 10 years later. When you become part of the show, when the lead singer or the guitarist invites you in, you never forget it. A space where you can get away from it all matters The sea is a beacon for us. Perhaps because it&apos;s the unknown and we could leave for ever. Every time it&apos;s sunny and we&apos;ve got some free time and we&apos;re near the sea, we get a boat, whether it&apos;s Australia, Florida, Newquay. And we go out there and have half an hour with no music. We sit there and smoke fags and we&apos;re away from the world. But I always worry about\u00a0capsizing. \u2022 The 1975 tour the UK from 21 September to 1 October. The single Hearts Out is out on Dirty Hit/Polydor today.

The actor is waiting for me in a central London hotel and I\u2019ve been asked if I mind having a TV crew follow me to record our initial encounter. The crew have been shadowing Radcliffe for a few days, capturing a hectic schedule that involves promoting his new film What If, juggling a daunting list of commitments \u2013 preparing for stage plays; researching film roles \u2013 and, right now, filming what must surely be the most dazzling onscreen role of his career to date: meeting a bloke from the Guardian. \u201cHello! Great to meet you!\u201d says the artist formerly known as Harry Potter with actorly exaggeration, shaking my hand and welcoming me into his room. I sit down on the designated chair and we pretend to start the interview, until the cameras have slowly retreated from sight. Radcliffe gives me an awkward grimace: \u201cYeah, sorry about that,\u201d he says, \u201cthey just want some footage of me meeting people to show what a press day is like.\u201d Of course, Radcliffe has spent virtually his entire life in front of cameras \u2013 whether they were capturing his onscreen debut as a 10-year-old in the BBC\u2019s David Copperfield, his teen years spent filming eight Harry Potter films or his every paparazzi-snapped public movement. Like any child star, he\u2019s had to grow up in public, which has meant having to conceal any slight streak of bad behaviour \u2013 Radcliffe admitted to having had a drink problem in 2011, several months after he\u2019d gone teetotal \u2013 and spending an awful lot of time being asked if his career was likely to implode before most people\u2019s has even begun.     Daniel Radcliffe in the first Harry Potter film. Photograph: Peter Mountain/AP    \u201cWhich is hard to deal with,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause a lot of us already have those fears anyway: what if this doesn\u2019t last for ever?; what if I don\u2019t end up working in 10 years? So for other people to then be asking you about those things all the time is like having your innermost fears confirmed by somebody outside of yourself. And that\u2019s quite a challenging thing when you\u2019re 17.\u201d Today, Radcliffe still faces the same challenge: namely, trying to convince people, and maybe himself, that he\u2019s just a normal guy at heart rather than a damaged boy-wizard. The challenge is no doubt made trickier by the fact he has an estimated net worth of $110m (\u00a366m), according to Forbes, and he was the star of a franchise in which all eight films make the list for the top 50 grossing films of all time (the highest, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2, sits at number four, with a whopping $1.3bn). Having to appear like a normal guy when you\u2019re clearly not \u2013 and everyone wants to remind you that you\u2019re not \u2013 is likely to be pretty stressful. Then again, Radcliffe seems to run on stress. It\u2019s midday when we meet and he\u2019s already been packing things into his morning. Early on he had to see his doctor about the intense-sounding cluster headaches he gets: \u201cYou have to be on blood pressure medication and have an ECG every so often ... but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m perfectly fine!\u201d Following that he was at the US embassy for an interview, only to be told that he looked tired and not getting enough sleep \u2013 \u201cI was like, er, thanks random fucking person who works at the embassy.\u201d     Daniel Radcliffe as Allen Ginsberg in Kill Your Darling (2013). Photograph: Allstar/The Works/Sportsphoto Ltd.    He doesn\u2019t appear the least bit tired when we meet \u2013 instead he buzzes with the livewire energy of a workaholic. Radcliffe has talked of working 90-hour weeks and since finishing Potter he has thrown himself into the research-heavy role of Allen Ginsberg in Kill Your Darlings, undergone a physically demanding performance in The Cripple of Inishmaan and endured a stamina-sapping 11-month run in Broadway musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. He\u2019s currently having to learn 50 lines of Japanese for the movie Tokyo Vice, which he thinks might be the hardest of the lot. \u201cI can\u2019t even watch plays or films when I\u2019m learning lines,\u201d he says. \u201cI start to think, hang on, they know all their lines and I don\u2019t ... so I have to go home immediately and learn them.\u201d           The Guardian film team review What If    You might assume that the role Radcliffe\u2019s here to promote today was slightly less stressful: he plays Wallace in twee indie romcom What If, a nerdy yet quick-witted character who he admits is quite similar to himself. But playing himself brought its own headaches: \u201cThere\u2019s something quite unnerving about doing so little,\u201d he says, a look of panic suddenly etched on his face. \u201cLike, is this funny? Is this enough? Will this make anyone laugh?\u201d What If follows Wallace\u2019s friendship with Chantry (played by Zoe Kazan) and involves a will-they-won\u2019t-they-oh-come-on-surely-they-would-have-by-now storyline that makes the characters in One Day seem like hot-headed slaves to reckless abandon. Chantry has a boyfriend, which makes things tricky, although that\u2019s not as much of an obstacle as Wallace\u2019s general rubbishness with the opposite sex, something that threatens to leave him languishing in the \u201cfriend zone\u201d. Outside of the UK and US, the film is called The F Word \u2013 the F meaning friend, of course \u2013 and Radcliffe says the makers were considering calling it The Friend Zone outright before he stepped in.     Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan in What If. Photograph: Caitlin Cronenberg    \u201cI was like, no, we can\u2019t do that, because it\u2019s not a [phrase] I love,\u201d he says, no doubt aware that the phrase has increasingly been under attack from feminists. \u201cThe friend zone refers to a very male thing ... you never hear women say they\u2019ve been put in the friend zone. And I think that\u2019s because it\u2019s just used by men who are pissed off that their mate won\u2019t sleep with them.\u201d Despite sharing characteristics with Wallace, Radcliffe says he\u2019s not nearly as useless with women himself: \u201cNo, I\u2019m a lot better at being direct at things, I\u2019m not good at suppressing that stuff. If I have a crush on a girl she\u2019s going to know about it.\u201d The girl who currently knows about it is actor Erin Darke, whose love of sports Radcliffe finds a turn on: \u201cShe\u2019s an obsessive Detroit Redwings fan \u2013 when your girlfriend can talk shit about sports better than the men she\u2019s doing that with, that\u2019s pretty sexy.\u201d What If also features yet another naked scene \u2013 something that Radcliffe seems to be making a name for himself with \u2013 first onstage in Equus, then for the gay sex scene in Kill Your Darlings and next in the forthcoming Horns.     Daniel Radcliffe as Alan Strang in Equus at the Gielgud Theatre, London, in 2007. Photograph: Ray Tang/REX    \u201cI don\u2019t mind it, but I\u2019d like to make clear it\u2019s not a request,\u201d he says, with a nervous grin. \u201cI\u2019m not sat there reading scripts thinking, how can I get my dick out in this one?\u201d He admits the naked scenes have caused him to increase his time in the gym, especially since he watched Kill Your Darlings and thought, \u201cFuck, I\u2019m skinny as a rat!\u201d With its folky soundtrack and cutesy animation \u2013 girls with big, sad eyes abound \u2013 What If is an indie film aesthetically as well as technically. Radcliffe has been a vocal indie fan since his teens, when he would turn up in the NME raving about bands like the Libertines and the Cribs in a rather endearing manner. Even today he sounds thrilled that he once got to meet Pete Doherty in a Eurostar station: \u201cHe was really really sweet. He let me waffle on for five minutes about how brilliant I thought his music was.\u201d Compared with most, Radcliffe\u2019s musical education was pretty unorthodox. He was introduced to Pink Floyd and the Kinks by the driver who took him to the Harry Potter studios each day, and his dresser on Potter taught him about 1970s punk. Eventually he found his own thing and even went to Reading festival a couple of times. Didn\u2019t he get hassled? \u201cNo, not too much. I wore a gas mask for most of the time.\u201d A gas mask?! \u201cI was with Rupert Grint and we really didn\u2019t want to be recognised.\u201d There seems something slightly sad about having to go to a music festival dressed as if you were heading to the western front. Does Radcliffe worry that he missed out on a normal teenagedom? He sighs. \u201cI mean, maybe? I don\u2019t know. I still got to go to Reading. I still had a great time. It\u2019s one of those things that everyone wants to tell me I missed out on ... but I wouldn\u2019t know, I\u2019ve only lived my life this way.\u201d            In 2012, Radcliffe starred in the video for Slow Club\u2019s Beginners, in which he stumbled around a London pub, playing air guitar in the part of someone drunk out of their mind. He says he doesn\u2019t like to talk about his drinking problems, but admits that they did inspire his performance in that video: \u201cOf course, it would be foolish to pretend it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Yet when I ask if that means he\u2019d ever been in quite that much of a mess himself during his drinking days he fixes me with a surprisingly icy stare: \u201cWhy would you ask that when you know I don\u2019t like to talk about it?\u201d Radcliffe is still scarred by the fact he ever admitted to having an issue with alcohol. \u201cIf I had to give my younger self one piece of advice it would be, don\u2019t talk about that in an interview,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve answered questions on it for three or four years since. And it\u2019s such an insignificant part of my life that everyone just wants to talk about.\u201d     Daniel Radcliffe as Billy and Sarah Greene as Helen in The Cripple of Inishmaan Photograph: Johan Persson    The thing is, I say, the crux of what he was saying was refreshingly open and mature: that he was cutting out all drink and drugs to avoid the cliched route of the tortured child star. \u201cWell, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t really a matter of maturity, it was just something I needed to do.\u201d It\u2019s hard to argue with Radcliffe\u2019s contention that everyone wants to talk about it. I wonder if he has ever Googled himself and seen the automatic search entries, but before I finish the question he\u2019s started reeling them off: \u201cDaniel Radcliffe alcoholic. Daniel Radcliffe gay. Daniel Radcliffe girlfriend,\u201d he says, sighing as he does. Actually, I tell him, girlfriend is the top result these days. \u201cOh great \u2013 I\u2019ll take that, as these things go. I\u2019m pleased my girlfriend comes up before alcoholic or gay. When I first did that, I got really annoyed for about half a minute, until I tried a few other people\u2019s names and I found out [gay] comes up after almost everyone if they\u2019re a man, and even some women \u2013 Florence Welch had it, and I was like, really?\u201d            Maybe it\u2019s a sign that a star has made it. \u201cProbably. If people are speculating about your sexuality, then you\u2019re doing OK,\u201d he laughs, then says that these days he resists the temptation to self-Google as \u201cit fucks you up. You shouldn\u2019t be on there if you\u2019re an actor. There\u2019s a line in The Thick Of It \u2013 Googling yourself is like opening the door to a room full of people telling you how shit you are \u2013 and it\u2019s exactly that. I first did it in my late teens and it was such a destructive thing for me to do.\u201d These days, Radcliffe says smoking is his only remaining vice \u2013 and he does much less of that since he\u2019s taken up running in preparation to play Seb Coe in the Olympics film Gold. Running, learning Japanese, 90-hour weeks ... does he put too much pressure on himself? He says not, so I ask him about a quote in which he said he sometimes heard voices telling him he was going to fail. \u201cI was obviously not being literal,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think I have to apply that amount of pressure to myself because I want to do well. Now, maybe that\u2019s not the healthiest way to function \u2026 but also, frankly, since the age of 20, all of the interviews I\u2019ve done have involved people asking about my impending failure, and how I felt about the possibility of that. And so, when you\u2019re confronted with that so often, you start to react to it. My own reaction was always to kick hard against it and think, fuck it, you might as well be bold now, make some interesting choices and see where that takes you.\u201d Wherever that may be, you suspect there will be plenty more cameras around \u2013 and Radcliffe won\u2019t be giving himself much of a break. \u2022 What If is released in the UK on Wednesday 20 August"}, {"sentences": ["Okuta, a home renovation firm near Tokyo, allows its employees to take a 20-minute power nap at their desks or in the staff lounge.", "At Gmo Internet, an IT firm in Tokyo, employees have sofas to curl up on, while workers in the Umeda business district of Osaka can go off-site to a nearby public napping facility with beds.", "Tokyo&apos;s Ohirune Caf\u00e9 Corne has eight beds for working women who want to sleep in partitioned comfort, soothed by the scent of essential oils."], "tags": ["Japan", "Sleep", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-18T09:02:00Z", "title": "Japanese firms encourage their dozy workers to sleep on the job", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/japanese-firms-encourage-workers-sleep-on-job", "article": "It&apos;s a daily struggle known to \u00adoffice workers the world over: a productive morning rewarded with a decent lunch, and then, at about 3pm, the leaden eyelids and urge to snatch 40 winks. In Japan, where workers get less sleep on work nights than those in other countries, more and more companies are encouraging employees to sleep on the job, convinced that it leads to better work performance. Okuta, a home renovation firm near Tokyo, allows its employees to take a 20-minute power nap at their desks or in the staff lounge. Introduced two years ago on the orders of the firm&apos;s chairman, Isamu Okuta, it has proved a huge hit. &quot;If I use a calculator when I&apos;m sleepy, I have to double-check my work for fear of making mistakes, so it takes longer,&quot; Ikuko Yamada, who works in accounts, told the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. &quot;I think my work performance has improved since I started \u00adtaking naps.&quot; Hugo Inc, an internet consulting company based in Osaka, has a more flexible approach: employees can take a 30-\u00adminute siesta any time between 1pm and 4pm. Japan&apos;s legions of salaried workers have more reason than most to give in to the urge for an afternoon nap. According to the US National Sleep Foundation&apos;s poll of sleeping habits around the world, Japanese workers sleep, on average, for just six hours 22 minutes on work nights \u2013 less than those in any other country. Not surprisingly, only 54% of Japanese respondents to the &quot;bedroom poll&quot; felt they got a good night&apos;s sleep every or almost every night. Only 8% managed more than eight hours. British workers get only 27 minutes more, at six hours 49 minutes, but Canadians, Mexicans and Germans all regularly achieve more than seven hours sleep, according to the poll. In Japan inemuri \u2013 or &quot;sleeping while present&quot; \u2013 is considered the preserve of employees exhausted by their commitment to hard work, rather than a sign of indolence. Exponents of inemuri, however, generally have to remain upright to avoid appearing slovenly.  Japan&apos;s new approach is less about saving face than burying it in a plump pillow. The sanctioned siesta has spawned an industry in daytime sleep services. At Gmo Internet, an IT firm in Tokyo, employees have sofas to curl up on, while workers in the Umeda business district of Osaka can go off-site to a nearby public napping facility with beds.  Tokyo&apos;s Ohirune Caf\u00e9 Corne has eight beds for working women who want to sleep in partitioned comfort, soothed by the scent of essential oils. It charges 160 yen (93p) for every 10 minutes \u2013 and a pair of pyjamas for 100 yen \u2013 and clients stay for almost an hour on average, according to the Asahi Shimbun. Japan&apos;s growing tolerance for undisguised dozing during office hours comes after the government issued new guidelines on the importance of sleep, with the health ministry recommending that all working-age people take a nap of up to 30 minutes in the early afternoon."}, {"sentences": ["We\u2019re thinking a sort of pre-historic Sims meets Tokyo Jungle."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "PlayStation", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox", "Xbox One", "PC", "Indie games", "Microsoft", "Sony"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-18T10:40:05Z", "title": "The 10 most interesting new games at Gamescom 2014", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/18/new-games-gamescom-2014", "article": "Hundreds of games, 350,000 visitors and roughly a billion years\u2019 worth of hyperbole, the gigantic GamesCom exhibition is over for another year. Although never as packed with announcements as the E3 event in Los Angeles, there\u2019s always plenty of new stuff to discover at this European behemoth. So, putting aside all the usual mega franchises (you don\u2019t need us to tell you that there are new Call of Duty, Battlefield, Dragon Age and Fable titles), here are the revelations that got most people talking as they fought through the madding crowds.  Alienation (Housemarque, PS4)       Finnish shoot-\u2019em-up specialist Housemarque produced one of the few must-have titles of the next-gen console launch period \u2013 the gorgeous Resogun. Now the team is working on another PS4 exclusive, Alienation, a frenetic twin-stick shooter, allowing teams of players to mow down swarming aliens. OK, so Robotron-style co-op experiences aren\u2019t exactly rare, but this studio is a true artisan in the shooter genre and is bound to introduce new mechanics and flourishes. It\u2019s due out in 2015. Hellblade (Ninja Theory, PS4)       British studio Ninja Theory has produced some of the most visually arresting titles of the last decade in the form of Heavenly Sword, Enslaved and the underrated, Devil May Cry reboot, DmC. Now it\u2019s back with another stylish stab-\u2019em-up, which, judging by the title and the look of the lead character, has at least a passing relationship with Heavenly Sword. Although initially a PS4 exclusive, it will be coming to other platforms, but there are no release details just yet. Life is Strange (Dontnod, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One)     Life is Strange    Memorably described by IGN as \u201cGone Home meets The Walking Dead,\u201d this episodic narrative adventure is the latest work from Parisian studio, Dontnod, the creator of last year\u2019s cult sci-fi title, Remember Me. This time the action follows a student who returns to her small Oregon town to meet old friend Chloe and investigate the disappearance of local girl, Rachel Amber. The set up looks similar to all the current titles from episodic specialist Telltale Games, but here, the lead character has time-travelling abilities, adding a wrinkle to the formula. P.T./Silent Hills (7780s Studio, PS4)       Sony uploaded an interactive teaser for this nerve-jangling horror romp just before Gamescom, and then revealed that the project was, in fact, a new Silent Hill title from Hideo Kojima and director, Guillermo Del Toro. So okay, this long-running psychological terror series is hardly \u201cnew\u201d but it was the PT demo that had everyone talking with its creepy haunted house setting and unsettling looping corridors. Plus, Silent Hills, as its known, looks set to be a very singular take on the franchise when it releases in \u2026 oh who knows, this is a Kojima production. ScreamRide (Frontier Developments, Xbox One)       Again, this is not exactly a newcomer \u2013 its a sort of offshoot from the ageing Rollercoaster Tycoon series. But developer Frontier Developments is doing something fresh with the \u2018build your own theme park\u2019 concept, setting it in the future and adding physics-defying rides and destructible environments. It was also one of the few new announcements at Microsoft\u2019s Gamescom press conference. Expect it on Xbox platforms in spring 2015.  Shadow Realms (BioWare, PC)       Despite the fact that \u201cShadow Realms\u201d may be the most generic name ever given to a fantasy-themed action adventure, this new project from BioWare Austin looks intriguing. Monsters from another dimension have invaded Earth and now it\u2019s up to a small group of humans with currently unexplained super powers to fight them off. Like Evolve and Fable: Legends it features asymmetrical multiplayer, allowing four friends to co-op as humans, while a fifth perhaps less popular member of the social group controls the invading Shadowlord. It\u2019s hitting the PC in late 2015. Superhot (Superhot, PC, Xbox One)       Although you play an assassin in this hyper-stylised first-person project, it\u2019s much more like a weird spatial puzzler than a shooter. Cleverly, time only moves when you do, so you must carefully navigate a series of armed encounters by ducking and strafing enemy bullets, then pausing to work out the next move. Imagine a maze game crossed with a \u201cbullet time\u201d action title \u2013 and for the ultimate first-person bullet dodging thrill, it supports Oculus Rift. The game is due out in June 2015. But there\u2019s a prototype on the website of the game\u2019s eponymous dev team.  The Tomorrow Children (Q-Games, PS4)       The latest title from Pixel-Junk creator Q-Games is set in a post-apocalyptic world devestated by a 1960s Russian experiement to meld all human minds into one super-consciousness. Somehow, somehow, it failed, plunging civilization into chaos and destruction. Now, you must enter the Void, a sort of sci-fi Marxist collective, and save the world from monsters, while abiding by the strict rules of this surreal Communist society. It\u2019s okay, head of Q-Games Dylan Cuthbert does a better job of explaining it. There\u2019s no release date just yet. Until Dawn (Supermassive Games, PS4)       Originally intended as a PS3 title then seemingly lost in development hell, Suppermassive\u2019s horror adventure has returned as a next-gen title, complete with a glittering voice cast (Hayden Panettiere, Rami Malek, Brett Dalton) and a graphical overhaul courtesy of the Killzone engine. It looks like a creepy haunted house yarn with eight friends holed up in a remote mountain shack \u2013 but when the gruesome deaths start, there are hundreds of plot-altering decisions available to the player, providing a true sense of involvement and , of course, nightmarishly escalating terror. Which is something we all enjoy. Wild (Wild Sheep Studios, PS4)       Michel Ancel, the brilliantly talented creator of Rayman and Beyond Good and Evil, has a new studio named Wild Sheep, and a fresh project \u2013 the intriguing open-world simulation, Wild. Set ten thousand years ago in a huge rural environment, players can take part either as human tribespeople or as several species of animals, fighting to survive against the elements and predators. Little else is known just yet, but Ancel is promising a completely different experience every time you play. We\u2019re thinking a sort of pre-historic Sims meets Tokyo Jungle. That would be amazing."}, {"sentences": ["A series of fires, often referred to as the \u201cflowers of Edo\u201d, raged during the 17th and 18th centuries in the Japanese city we now know as Tokyo.", "In the 20th century, roughly one million of the Tokyo residents who survived the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake did so because they escaped to tracts of forest and farmland.", "Statesman Shinpei Got\u014d led the post-earthquake reconstruction of Tokyo, deliberately incorporating refuge parks where residents could go to escape fire and crumbling buildings.", "Today, Tokyo is still building such refuge parks \u2013 similar to the ones Got\u014d planned almost a century ago, but far more advanced.", "Tokyo\u2019s refuge parks are cleverly disguised survival bunkers for the masses during times of urban chaos and dysfunction.", "The Tokyo metropolitan government aims to increase green spaces in the city while simultaneously building 185 acres of new disaster-survival parks by the year 2020.", "Perhaps the best-known of these is the Tokyo Rinkai disaster prevention park, a base from which officials can direct the flow of information and emergency services for the entire city.", "Located on reclaimed land in Tokyo Bay, far from dense residential areas within the central metro area, it\u2019s not really for everyday use.", "In addition to providing power, cooking facilities and provisions, it serves as a local hub, relaying information from officials at the Tokyo Rinkai disaster prevention park to local residents.", "But walking through them, one gets the sense that these parks are part of a deeper inequality that is concomitant with how disasters in Tokyo are managed.", "These also happen to be the poorer parts of Tokyo, filled with densely packed wooden houses, many of which are owned by vulnerable, elderly residents."], "tags": ["Cities", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Green space"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-19T10:44:40Z", "title": "Tokyo\u2019s disaster parks: hi-tech survival bunkers hidden under green spaces", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/aug/19/tokyo-disaster-parks-hi-tech-survival-bunkers-hidden-green-spaces-earthquake", "article": "A series of fires, often referred to as the \u201cflowers of Edo\u201d, raged during the 17th and 18th centuries in the Japanese city we now know as Tokyo. Each horrible blossom reduced a part of the metropolis to ashes. It\u2019s not known exactly how many fires earned the sardonic nickname, but we do know they were particularly deadly \u2013 because the city was largely built of wood, and because people had very few places to hide.  In the 20th century, roughly one million of the Tokyo residents who survived the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake did so because they escaped to tracts of forest and farmland. If you were in the centre of the city, however, you were surrounded by flammable materials on all sides. After the 1923 earthquake, the need for open spaces within urban areas became clear. Statesman Shinpei Got\u014d led the post-earthquake reconstruction of Tokyo, deliberately incorporating refuge parks where residents could go to escape fire and crumbling buildings. Today, Tokyo is still building such refuge parks \u2013 similar to the ones Got\u014d planned almost a century ago, but far more advanced. Tokyo\u2019s refuge parks are cleverly disguised survival bunkers for the masses during times of urban chaos and dysfunction. They are outfitted with solar-powered charging stations for electric bicycles and smart phones in case of electrical failure, public benches that transform into cooking stoves, and manholes that double as emergency toilets. Under the rolling grass hills and cherry blossom trees are water reservoirs and storehouses containing enough food to allow entire districts to survive the critically important first 72 hours following a disaster.     Survival tools on display at Rinkai disaster prevention park. Photograph: Aflo/Rex    These parks are a precise extension of Got\u014d\u2019s original redevelopment. The Tokyo metropolitan government aims to increase green spaces in the city while simultaneously building 185 acres of new disaster-survival parks by the year 2020. Perhaps the best-known of these is the Tokyo Rinkai disaster prevention park, a base from which officials can direct the flow of information and emergency services for the entire city. Like most refuge parks, the 33-acre space features lampposts fitted with electric outlets and LAN connections, temporary toilets, and benches that double as stoves. But this park is primarily a headquarters for disaster-response efforts. Located on reclaimed land in Tokyo Bay, far from dense residential areas within the central metro area, it\u2019s not really for everyday use. Other disaster parks, however, are integrated into the daily lives of citizens. Hikarigaoka Park was built in 1940, a year that marked the 2,600th anniversary of the founding of Japan. It includes a bird sanctuary, camp grounds, archery fields and gardens, and can support approximately 270,000 stranded people in the event of disaster. In addition to providing power, cooking facilities and provisions, it serves as a local hub, relaying information from officials at the Tokyo Rinkai disaster prevention park to local residents. Nakano Central Park is another example of a park that has more fully integrated disaster mitigation into spaces such as offices, restaurants and meeting spots. \u201cIt proposes a new style of working in greenery that is impossible with conventional offices,\u201d says the park\u2019s website. Its 8.6 acres of open space, which have many of the same functions as Hikarigaoka Park, are surrounded by a hospital, police station, three universities, offices and an apartment block \u2014 almost all built using a seismic isolation system 1.25 times more powerful than current requirements. Hidden underneath the open space is a well, water tanks and a storehouse containing emergency supplies for the ward the park is built in.     Rows of desks in the operation room at Rinkai disaster park. Photograph: Aflo/Rex    These full service disaster parks are a boon to a city that\u2019s both desperate for breathing room and at constant risk of a high magnitude earthquake. But walking through them, one gets the sense that these parks are part of a deeper inequality that is concomitant with how disasters in Tokyo are managed. Nakano Central Park is in an area of stable bedrock, meaning that destruction of properties there will be minimised, resulting in fewer casualties and refugees. The need for a hi-tech disaster park here is much less critical than in those low-lying parts of the city, built on alluvial soil, where destruction will be amplified.  These also happen to be the poorer parts of Tokyo, filled with densely packed wooden houses, many of which are owned by vulnerable, elderly residents. These homes not only resemble old Edo \u2014 they\u2019re built on top of it. It\u2019s ironic that the areas most at risk are those that sit on the site of the old city, whose residents suffered from fires so frequent they gave them a nickname.

Gothamist headlined its article: \u201cSurrender, Brooklyn: Mysterious White Flags Top Brooklyn Bridge.\u201dBut for the NYPD, it was an embarrassing security breach, committed right on their doorstep and on one of the city\u2019s most recognisable landmarks. The NYPD would much prefer that New Yorkers consider the possibility of an attack on Brooklyn Bridge as being confined to movies such as Independence Day. An investigation was launched, but even though Wermke and Leinkauf remained in Brooklyn for a short time to witness the reaction to their stunt, they were able to slip out of the country unhindered.     Detail of the flag substituted on top of the Brooklyn Bridge last month, with stars and stripes in white. Photograph: Matthias Wermke and Mischa Leinkauf    Two weeks later the police commissioner, William Bratton, claimed to have a very good idea about who carried out the stunt. \u201cWhen we have the proof, we\u2019ll move,\u201d he told CBS. \u201cWe\u2019ve put, as you might appreciate, exhaustive efforts into this investigation,\u201d he said. The NYPD has been more reticent since the authors of the stunt revealed themselves. Asked to comment on Tuesday, a spokesman provided a prepared statement: \u201cThe NYPD is aware of the public statements made by the German artists, Mishcha Leinkauf and Matthias Wermke, in regard to the Brooklyn Bridge flag case. The investigation is continuing.\u201d The artists, who being advised by lawyers in the US and in Germany, said they didn\u2019t want to speculate on the legal repercussions of their performance. They also declined to explain exactly how they had managed to hoist the flags from the top of the bridge without being noticed by the authorities, but told the Guardian that they had stayed to watch the reaction in the area. \u201cEverything was really peaceful,\u201d said Leinkauf. \u201cLife in the streets slowly awoke: people walked their dogs, the first tourists popped up, people made their way to work.\u201cI asked a construction worker if I could set up my camera within a fenced area. She asked what I would be filming. \u2018White American flags on Brooklyn Bridge,\u2019 I answered. \u2018Oh yeah,\u2019 she said, \u2018They\u2019re training the novices how to raise the flags. This happens from time to time.\u2019\u201dWermke said he had a similar experience: \u201cWhile I was watching joggers taking pictures, a burly American with a cowboy hat approached me and said: \u2018Did you see the white flags? Usually there are American flags up there, but now they\u2019re white. Did Brooklyn surrender to Manhattan? I mean what else do white flags mean?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I answered. \u2018White also means peace.\u2019 He laughed and said: \u2018Oh yes, New York surrendered and America is the most peaceful country in the world.\u2019\u201d\u201cAfter a while reporters showed up, you saw cameras everywhere,\u201d Leinkauf said. \u201cAround 10.30am, when the first mobile units and helicopters showed up, followed by police, the atmosphere and also my mood changed. It added another meaning to the flags: the possibility of a threat.\u201d\u201cI remember many more reactions in the city in the days following,\u201d Wermke said. \u201cAfter we claimed responsibility these were personally directed at us for the first time. We got some angry emails, but mainly we got feedback we appreciated. There were some really touching statements by people who told us how the piece emotionally amazed them and how it will change their view on the city from now on.\u201dWermke and Leinkau first met when they lived on the same street in East Berlin as teenagers. Some critics have described their work as \u201cpost-graffiti\u201d for its conscious use of public space.             Previous projects have involved the artists hanging or swinging off tall buildings or bridges, driving a homemade handcar through Berlin\u2019s metro tunnels and scaling skyscrapers in Tokyo and Prague. The first that the public has seen most of these performances has been when films of the stunts were shown at art exhibitions.Wermke said he and Leinkauf had a similar run-in with the law in Tokyo. \u201cThe city had officially invited us to work there. We arrived just a couple of months after the disaster in Fukushima, and naturally the city was very sensitive about actions in public space.\u201cIn our work \u2018Drifter\u2019 we performed on the rooftops of the vertical city. When I unknowingly tried to climb the energy museum of Tepco, the company responsible for the catastrophe, both of us got arrested. This was a very delicate situation but due to the great support of the Tokyo Wonder Site residency we were released quickly and could continue our work and complete the piece.\u201d Unlike conventional hand-held street art videos, the two artists\u2019 films aren\u2019t shaky but calm, lending their films a poetic quality. In the New York Times article which revealed the pair as the artists behind the flags, the paper\u2019s architecture critic Michael Kimmelman described their project as \u201cplayful, respectful, even poetic\u201d.Yet a closer look at the artists\u2019 back catalogue shows that most of their works have a strong political quality too. A video work from 2006 shows Wermke swimming across the river Spree outside the German parliament, at the precise spot a group of GDR refugees escaped across the border in 1988.  As critic Bettina Klein has put it, Wermke and Leinkauf \u201crepeatedly choose places and buildings that symbolise the existing political and economic balance of power\u201d.In that context, reading the white American flags as a deliberate tactic to expose the paranoia of the US surveillance state doesn\u2019t seem too far fetched.Asked if there was a political dimension to their projects, Leinkauf answered: \u201cIs there any way not to be political for artists? I think you cannot deny that art is supposed to have a social function,whether it\u2019s a painting or a performance.\u201d\u201cAmbiguity is a quality of a good piece, as it raises questions and fosters public dialogue,\u201d Wermke said. \u201cOthers engage in being political. Every article on the piece, as well as every online comment \u2013 from \u2018Now completely gluten-free\u2019 to \u2018They should be honoured\u2019 to \u2018These guys need to be taught the lesson of freedom with a trip to Gitmo\u2019 \u2013 is a political statement by the recipients. We consider this very important.\u201d Additional reporting by Jessica Glenza in New York"}, {"sentences": ["Can you imagine what would have happened in Tokyo or New York or London \u2026 if they&apos;d had an anniversary of this kind at their disposition?&quot; It would be unfair to discount what Rome has organised to mark Augustus&apos;s passing."], "tags": ["Italy", "Europe", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-19T17:09:10Z", "title": "Mausoleum of Augustus stands derelict on anniversary of emperor's death", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/mausoleum-augustus-anniversary-rome-emperor", "article": "Standing on a wall in central Rome and peering through the railings, Mario Adobati was not happy. The businessman and his family had come all the way from Bergamo, in northern Italy, to the capital on Tuesday to take part in celebrations marking the 2,000th anniversary of Emperor Augustus&apos;s death. Understandably, he had come to the monument that arguably the greatest of ancient Rome&apos;s leaders had built as a tomb for the imperial family, where Augustus&apos;s ashes were housed before being pillaged by rampaging Visigoths in 410. But Adobati&apos;s hopes of being able to enter the Mausoleum of Augustus were to be dashed. Except for a lucky few \u2013 90 people, to be precise \u2013 who managed to get tickets for three guided tours in the morning, the tomb was in its usual state of eerie quiet and abandon. Despite efforts to revamp it, the site has remained almost completely off-limits for years. &quot;I&apos;m disappointed,&quot; said Adobati. &quot;It really pains me to see such a historic monument in a state of neglect like this, and I do not understand how our public administration is not capable of doing something about it. You [journalists] should write about it.&quot; If he had picked up a copy of La Stampa before setting off, Adobati would have seen that the media were indeed becoming exercised about the understated way in which contemporary Rome has chosen to mark such an important anniversary. &quot;Rome and Augustus: the dismal celebration,&quot; the Turin-based newspaper declared on its front page. &quot;It is certainly not for us \u2026 to discuss the artistic and academic range of the celebrations,&quot; wrote the journalist Mattia Feltri. &quot;But as a tourist attraction, or as a simple city occasion, it&apos;s objectively pretty shameful. Can you imagine what would have happened in Tokyo or New York or London \u2026 if they&apos;d had an anniversary of this kind at their disposition?&quot; It would be unfair to discount what Rome has organised to mark Augustus&apos;s passing. There are several events and exhibitions taking place around the capital, from a summer-long narrated light show at the forum named after him to a musical reworking of ancient Roman poetry at Trajan&apos;s Markets. More than 160,000 people visited an exhibition devoted to Augustus at the Scuderie del Quirinale gallery, which ran from October to February. And on Tuesday night the Ara Pacis museum, which houses a magnificent altar built to honour Augustus&apos;s triumphant return from Hispania and Gaul, will be illuminated in its original colours. But the sum of all these parts is, some say, underwhelming. There is a decided absence of buzz. A lack of funds in the cash-strapped city has undoubtedly played a role. But, according to Francesco Rutelli, a former culture minister and mayor of Rome, there is more to the &quot;missed opportunity&quot; than that. &quot;The first [reason] is that there is a kind of unuttered self-censorship which stems from Augustus&apos;s preceding bimillennium, that of his birth, which fell in 1937,&quot; he told La Stampa. &quot;Benito Mussolini took it as an opportunity to promote and celebrate himself and fascism and the reborn empire.&quot; The second reason, Rutelli added, was Italy&apos;s political discontinuity: the country has had five culture ministers in three and a half years. Whatever the reasons, the result is plain to see in the state of the Mausoleum. Built in 28BC as a suitably glorious tomb for Augustus and his relatives, with pink granite obelisks, golden urns and a bronze statue of the emperor on top, it has suffered innumerable indignities ever since the sack of Rome. Now, fenced off and often used as a dumping site for litter, and even as an unofficial public lavatory, it goes almost unnoticed by the diners who crowd into the restaurants of the square around it. The city council had long been aware of the bimillennium, and tried to jump-start a restoration plan by appealing for a private sponsor, as happened with the Colosseum and the Trevi fountain, which are both being restored by elite fashion brands. But no one came forward to bring the mausoleum back to life. A \u20ac2m wedge of central government funding unblocked last year will enable the restoration to begin, with another \u20ac2.3m expected to come from the city&apos;s coffers. But another \u20ac7.7m will be needed to complete it. A separate \u20ac17m plan to pedestrianise the surrounding piazza should begin next year, a spokesman for Rome city council said. It may therefore be some time before Adobati, or anyone else, can experience the wonders of Augustus&apos;s mausoleum. But the Lombard, for one, was employing a healthy dose of stoicism a la romana. &quot;We&apos;ll go and eat a gelato,&quot; he said, stepping away from the railings and smiling. &quot;Instead of crying or mocking, I&apos;d always prefer to go and eat a gelato.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Officials overseeing preparations for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 had been hoping for a trouble-free runup to those Games, following criticism of the cost of hosting the event and of the design of the planned main stadium."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Winter Olympics 2014"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-21T15:20:12Z", "title": "Japanese Olympian turned MP denies sexually harassing skater at Sochi party", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/21/japanese-mp-seiko-hashimoto-denies-sexually-harassing-ice-skater-sochi", "article": "Japan&apos;s most celebrated Olympic athlete turned politician has denied sexually harassing a popular ice skater in a scandal that could embarrass the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, as he attempts to promote the role of women in public life. Seiko Hashimoto, who represented Japan in speed skating at four winter Games and track cycling at three summer Games before becoming a Liberal Democratic party (LDP) politician, denied any wrongdoing after a magazine printed images of her making apparently unwanted advances towards Daisuke Takahashi during a party after Winter Olympics in Sochi in February. Hashimoto, 49, a speed skating bronze medallist in 1992, was appointed Japan&apos;s chef de mission in Sochi, with Takahashi \u2013 whose fans call him the &quot;prince on ice&quot; \u2013 representing the country at figure skating. Hashimoto, who was elected as a LDP member of the upper house in 1995, claimed she had simply shown Takahashi the same affection she would other athletes, who often &quot;hug and kiss each other very naturally&quot;. She added: &quot;If this invited misunderstanding from other people, I regret it and think I should be careful.&quot; Her alleged behaviour has drawn accusations that she abused her position as head of the Japan Skating Federation. &quot;All athletes and officials [in Sochi] had respect and gratitude towards Mr Takahashi and I have no further particular feelings [towards him],&quot; she said. Hashimoto, who campaigned successfully for childcare facilities for MPs, has been touted for possible promotion to Abe&apos;s cabinet next month. He has promised to increase female representation in senior positions over the next six years. Shukan Bunshun, which published the photographs, described the encounter as &quot;unprecedented&quot;, claiming the MP had forced Takahashi to let her kiss him repeatedly. &quot;Hashimoto is the supreme figure in the [Japanese] skating world,&quot; the magazine said, adding that the encounter could be described as &quot;power harassment or sexual harassment&quot;. Takahashi, an Olympic bronze medallist in 2010, has not lodged a formal complaint against Hashimoto, according to his agent. &quot;Takahashi does not think he was a victim of power or sexual harassment,&quot; the agent was quoted as saying. Shukan Bunshun, the bestselling of a crop of Japanese weeklies that mix serious and salacious content, quoted an unnamed witness as saying that Hashimoto had &quot;pounced&quot; on Takahashi at an alcohol-fuelled party at the athletes&apos; village in Sochi. The report will also have caused disquiet at the Japan Olympic Committee, where Hashimoto, who has appeared at more Games than any other Japanese athlete, serves as head of development. Officials overseeing preparations for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 had been hoping for a trouble-free runup to those Games, following criticism of the cost of hosting the event and of the design of the planned main stadium."}, {"sentences": ["Together for 40 years     Setsuo Kato and Jill Fanshawe Kato: 'We\u2019ve both had admirers over the years, but we have got strong self-discipline.\u2019 Photograph: Bohdan Cap for the Guardian    Jill Fanshawe Kato, 68, and Setsuo Kato, 72, met in London in the early 70s and married in Tokyo in\u00a01974.", "We had a traditional Japanese wedding in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Marriage", "Family", "Relationships", "Sex", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-22T12:00:00Z", "title": "The secrets of long-term love", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/22/the-secrets-of-long-term-love", "article": "     Together for 56 years Gem, 74, and Ezra Harris, 74, grew up in Glengoffe, a village in St\u00a0Catherine, Jamaica. Ezra emigrated to England at 19, Gem followed him two months later, and they married in August 1958. They settled in Bradford. Ezra was a forklift driver and Gem worked in domestic service until they both retired. They have three children, Jennifer, 55, Christopher, 52 and Samantha, 45, and four grandchildren.     Ezra and Gem Harris: \u2018We have a good time. We used to love a dance, listen to reggae, calypso. But it\u2019s hard now with our bad knees.\u2019 Photograph: Bohdan Cap for the Guardian    Ezra: Back home, people used to talk about abroad as if the whole place was paved with gold. When a\u00a0plane passed overhead we would all look up and wish we were on it. One day I\u00a0heard an advertisement on\u00a0the radio, saying you could come\u00a0to Britain and get work. It\u00a0was\u00a0a promise of a future. I wanted to make myself better off and be somebody. I arrived in Bradford in June. It was supposed to be summer but I\u00a0can remember the cold, the smell of the coal. The first day I was here, I\u00a0felt like going back. You feel lonely; you miss your parents. I thought it would be much easier if I got a wife. Gem had been two years below me in church school. I didn&apos;t know anything about women. My father was a preacher and very strict. I\u00a0wrote to her saying I&apos;d like to send for her to come and marry me. I\u00a0hoped she&apos;d agree and she did \u2013 she was glad to come because I bought her a ticket out of Jamaica. I knew she would make a good wife. We didn&apos;t go back to Jamaica until 1973. Everything seemed different \u2013 smaller, farther away. It didn&apos;t feel like home. But still, after all this time, I can&apos;t get shot of my accent. Gem always tells me, &quot;Speak English!&quot; But you cannot teach an old dog new tricks. Fifty-six years we have been married. You must work at it. Talk to each other. Disagree, but don&apos;t let arguments drag on. Don&apos;t go around having lots of kids with women and not looking after them. And believe in God. If you trust in Him, everything is going to be all right. I try to be a good husband. I try not to come in with mucky hands. She worries about me passing first, and I tell her, &quot;Don&apos;t worry about a\u00a0thing.&quot; But if she goes first I will be\u00a0miserable. We&apos;re going to go on a cruise, and\u00a0when I booked it the lady asked\u00a0if we would like separate beds. I said, &quot;What are you talking about, woman?&quot; We are husband and wife. Sometimes you still get some fun! Gem:\u00a0I remember looking down from\u00a0the plane as I flew into England\u00a0for the first time, and seeing all this smoke coming from the chimneys. It looked as if the whole place was on fire. Even now, I don&apos;t know how I\u00a0managed to get to Bradford alone. Ezra didn&apos;t come to meet me at the station \u2013 I am still angry with him about that \u2013 so I got a taxi to his lodgings. It was just a room, really, with a coal fire and a paraffin heater. I&apos;d brought a wedding dress from home, and my mother&apos;s veil. I arrived on 12 August, and we married on 30 August in a register office. I missed my family very much at first, but you get used to it. The winters were hardest. There was a lot of racism back then. People would shout, &quot;Go back to your dirty country!&quot; They treated you as though you were nothing. It was hurtful, but you just try to keep away from trouble. Ezra calls me &quot;the wife&quot;, which he\u00a0shouldn&apos;t do. I&apos;ll tidy up the house and he&apos;ll go and leave crumbs. We quarrel every day, but we always make up. He likes to cuddle, but I don&apos;t bother. I am always telling him to talk properly, but when I get mad, I talk in patois: &quot;Shuttup and come dung ere, man!&quot; He just laughs. We have a good time. We used to love a drink and a dance at the African-Caribbean centre, listen to some reggae, some calypso \u2013 but it is upstairs and it&apos;s hard to get up there now with our bad knees. On Sundays I&apos;ll always cook Jamaican food for the family \u2013 curried goat, rice and peas, but always with yorkshire pudding, too. Together for 52 years     Mick and Barbara Wilson: \u2018I know many couples can\u2019t survive such loss, but we could always talk and cry together.\u2019 Photograph: Bohdan Cap for the Guardian    Barbara, 72, and Mick Wilson, 79, met in 1960 and married in 1962. Their eldest daughter, Sarah, died in a\u00a0white-water rafting accident 14\u00a0years ago in Peru, when she was 36. Barbara is a neuropsychologist; Mick is a retired English teacher, and they live in Bury St Edmunds. They have two surviving children, Anna and Matthew, and four grandchildren. Barbara: I was in my first year at teacher-training college when Mick, in the year above, invited me to his room for coffee. &quot;Mick Wilson never invites people for coffee,&quot; a friend told me. He gave me a large German beer mug full of Nescaf\u00e9; I think he wanted to make a good impression. Mick thought we should wait to have children, but I decided we shouldn&apos;t. We were hippies: no TV, no car, we made our own bread. Mick had long hair and a beard and wore bell-bottoms. We had lots of cats and stick insects. I was a housewife, but Mick wanted me educated. I took my psychology A-level when I was 29, then a degree, a master&apos;s, and a PhD. In 2000, I was leaving work when a colleague said, &quot;Mick&apos;s on his way over.&quot; I just knew something awful had happened. Maybe it&apos;s the cat, I\u00a0thought. Please let it be the cat. Mick called from the motorway. &quot;There&apos;s terrible news.&quot; Some part of me already knew. &quot;Is it Sarah? Is she dead?&quot; He said, &quot;I think so.&quot; We somehow got through that night. Some kind of madness takes over. It&apos;s anguish, grief and everything in between. We took turns to be strong, I think. We talked and cried and held each other. We arranged to go out to Peru the following week and Mick paid \u00a310,000 for a helicopter to look for Sarah&apos;s body. It was pointless, of course, but I knew he needed to do it, so I let him. Sarah has never been a taboo: we talk about her every day. Mick: It was always a strong marriage. We&apos;ve done daft things, of course. Back in the old, hippy days we thought we wanted an open marriage, but we tried it once or twice and it didn&apos;t work out for us. It taught us both that the best kind of arousal comes through affection, not sex with just anyone. Our daughter Sarah&apos;s marriage had broken down after years of failed fertility treatments and she went to Peru to rethink her life. To this day, we&apos;ve never had a body to bury. We\u00a0won&apos;t ever have closure. You can learn to live with it, but you&apos;ll never close the book. I know many couples find their relationship can&apos;t survive this kind of loss, but ours did because we could always talk to each other and cry together. We are in our old age now and, the\u00a0way we see it, we&apos;ve lived a happy life, apart from one terrible tragedy. We have two wonderful children, and four grandchildren. To\u00a0have the marriage we have, the life we have together, I think we&apos;ve been very privileged. Together for 36 years     Howard Shepherdson (left) and Rod Marten: \u2018We have no separate lives. We\u00a0spend every day\u00a0together and it never gets boring.\u2019 Photograph: Bohdan Cap for the Guardian    Rod Marten, 71, and Howard Shepherdson, 60, met in a pub in London in 1978. Rod is a retired tax inspector; Howard is a semi-retired management consultant. They were the UK&apos;s first same-sex couple to be legal long-term foster parents; their son, Glen, is 43. Rod and Howard have two grandchildren, and have been civil partners since 2005. They live in\u00a0Ealing, west London. Howard: I had always thought the idea of love at first sight was a cliche. But one Thursday night in 1978, that&apos;s what happened. I spotted Rod at the bar and it was just lovely from the moment we started chatting. I\u00a0went home to my parents in Sussex that weekend feeling quite delirious. I thought, &quot;What is this?&quot; It was like catching pneumonia. In 1985 I was a school counsellor and had been working with a 14-year-old boy, Glen, from a children&apos;s home. One day, Glen just asked me: &quot;Will you be my dad?&quot; I thought it was best to be honest with him, so I said I was afraid it was impossible, because I&apos;m gay. Glen said, &quot;Why should that matter?&quot; And it struck a chord. Rod and I decided we might as well try. No gay couple had formally adopted \u2013 or long-term fostered, as we did \u2013 before. It was very strengthening, loving someone together and them loving you back. He now lives in France with his wife, Isabelle. We visit all the time, and Skype. Having grandchildren has been a deeply enriching experience for us. Rod and I are not at all independent of each other. We have no separate lives. We spend every day together and it never gets boring. Yes, sex does start to slow down at our age, but physical intimacy shouldn&apos;t. We still curl up on the sofa together, as we have done for ever. There&apos;s just one thing we avoid completely as it would mean instant divorce \u2013 DIY. Rod: When I went into work the day after I&apos;d met Howard, a colleague said\u00a0I seemed different, extra-happy. I was. We met in September and by December we were looking to buy a flat together. I think my family thought it was a bit soon, but we&apos;re still in the same flat, 36 years later. In the 80s, being openly gay on the street was not something you felt particularly secure doing. We&apos;ve never walked around holding hands. If we were 21 now we&apos;d do it, but you can&apos;t just start doing that in your 60s. Getting our civil partnership was a\u00a0political statement, but as the date got closer, it felt very romantic. I think relationships need rules. Work must never dominate your life. We never go to sleep on an argument. I am a terrible procrastinator, and Howard is an over-organiser, but you have to learn to love the other person for who they are, and not be frustrated by what you want them to be. It&apos;s no good being perpetually disappointed. Our other absolute rule is that we never, ever eat dinner in front of the television. We haven&apos;t done it once in 36 years.

Jill:\u00a0I had visited Japan in my 20s\u00a0and found it a very chauvinistic\u00a0place. But I&apos;d got quite\u00a0far with my Japanese and wanted to carry on learning, so I\u00a0joined an evening class in Holborn. Setsuo turned up one night to interview students for an\u00a0article that he was writing. Luckily for us, our families were\u00a0very supportive. We had a traditional Japanese wedding in Tokyo. I wore a pink kimono with kanzashi hair ornaments. I think after all these years together, I have started looking a\u00a0bit Japanese. I&apos;ve always used kohl round my eyes, and I like to wear Japanese textiles. I suppose it&apos;s attitude and behaviour, too. I&apos;m\u00a0from Devon, but British people can never tell where I&apos;m from. We never had children \u2013 perhaps that is the thing that has kept us together, and given us greater independence. We&apos;ve both had admirers over the years, but we have got strong self-discipline. You\u00a0need to be kind to each other, remember the value of what you\u00a0have. There should always be an unknown area of your partner. There is a lot of mystery about Setsuo. We would never go to the\u00a0loo in front of each other; there\u00a0is privacy and respect between us. We&apos;ve lived in this house for more than 30 years, but\u00a0Setsuo has never\u00a0once gone into my studio at the top of the house. We are probably still finding\u00a0things out about each other,\u00a0even now. Setsuo:\u00a0Japanese men who travelled\u00a0to London in those days were not mainstream \u2013 we\u00a0were adventurous types. It\u00a0wasn&apos;t as if you just hopped on a plane. I&apos;d caught a Russian boat from Yokohama, and took the Siberian\u00a0railway all the way to\u00a0London. I have lived here a long time, but I always consider myself Japanese. I am not very good at being physically affectionate. I am a bit better at it than most Japanese men, but I\u00a0don&apos;t talk about my feelings. I\u00a0don&apos;t lose my temper. Jill and I give each other huge freedom. Jill will often go abroad\u00a0for a month or two to work,\u00a0and I\u00a0enjoy a social life more\u00a0than her \u2013\u00a0I\u00a0zoom off and come back\u00a0as I wish. We&apos;ve always said we face the world\u00a0back\u00a0to back. I think you have to be patient. When life is down, people think changing partners will help \u2013 but\u00a0I&apos;m\u00a0not convinced anyone is better off in the long run. It\u00a0would just be awful to have to start again. We are like two trees that have\u00a0grown together; our roots are\u00a0entwined. Together for 59 years     Patrick and Doreen Skilling: \u2018We married at the Savoy, way above our station.' Photograph: Bohdan Cap for the Guardian    Doreen, 89, and Patrick Skilling, 86, married in 1955. They lived in Notting Hill for 50 years; Patrick was an advertising executive and Doreen designed wallpaper for Biba. In the 70s, the couple gave up their jobs to run a furniture stall together in Portobello Market. Doreen was diagnosed with Alzheimer&apos;s in 2006 and they now live together at the Sunrise care home in Beaconsfield. Patrick: A colleague had been trying to take Doreen out. He said to me, &quot;Take this bird out, will you? I can&apos;t handle her.&quot; So I took her for a drink. I was wildly impressed. We\u00a0dated for five years and were married in the Queen&apos;s Chapel at the Savoy. It was way above our station, but Doreen somehow managed it. We always thought we would have children, but by the time we realised it probably wasn&apos;t going to\u00a0happen, it was too late. We weren&apos;t sad about it at the time \u2013 it wasn&apos;t something we even talked about \u2013 but now I\u00a0think it may have been the greatest tragedy of our lives. When I see Doreen cuddling a\u00a0doll now, I\u00a0wonder whether it may have\u00a0affected her more than she let on, that there might be a deeper sense of loss. I was earning good money in advertising, smoking and drinking too much. I&apos;m sorry to say I failed her many times; falling into the pitfalls that husbands do. But Doreen was always very patient. We\u00a0decided I&apos;d leave my job and we&apos;d become business partners. So\u00a0we took a stall in Portobello Market, and started selling antiques\u00a0and junk furniture. It revitalised our married life. We had\u00a0time to talk. Ten years ago, I started to notice Doreen was having problems with numbers. She couldn&apos;t sort out the change. It was two years before we got a diagnosis, that she had Alzheimer&apos;s. She has never really understood what is happening to her. The change in her was slow and\u00a0almost imperceptible. But I\u00a0wept for her. It was so dreadful that such a lovely person should face such a\u00a0thing. All along I&apos;d assumed we&apos;d stay at home. But after six years, she developed problems I just couldn&apos;t cope with. She moved into a home, and for two months I visited her every day. It was obvious from day one that I should live there, too. I\u00a0wanted to continue being important in her life. Selling our house was like losing another partner. You mourn for these things, as if they were human; the conservatory full of plants we&apos;d tended together, all her paintings. Doreen lives on a secure wing, and I have a separate room. She doesn&apos;t communicate at all now. She sits around looking lovely. I envy her tranquillity. I go up every day. She doesn&apos;t know it&apos;s me \u2013 Pat, her husband \u2013 but I think she thinks I&apos;m a friendly face. That&apos;s good enough for me. I just cherish what&apos;s left. Now I must fill my days. I walk, garden, do my stamp albums. I don&apos;t want to sit slumped on a chair, like everyone else here. And Doreen, she&apos;ll just fade away. She won&apos;t be afraid of it. But I&apos;ll be shattered. Inertia will probably keep me here after she&apos;s gone. I am 86, and it&apos;s just too daunting to find a new house. But you live day by day. It&apos;s hard to live any other way. Together for 73 years     Fred and Gladys Croft: \u2018It will come some day, life without each other. We don\u2019t like to think about it\u2019 Photograph: Bohdan Cap for the Guardian    Gladys, 100, and Fred Croft, 96, met\u00a0at a dance in New Malden, south-west London, in 1931. Gladys was a factory worker; Fred an engineer who then joined the air force. They married in 1940, before Fred was posted abroad. After the war, Fred worked for the NHS, and the couple settled in the London suburbs. They have a daughter, Audrey, 69, and a grandson, Iain, 41.\u00a0They live in couples&apos; accommodation in the Acacia Mews care\u00a0home in St Albans. Gladys:\u00a0My mother died of an asthma attack when I was 18, and my father remarried and went off with his new family. He paid our rent, but we never saw him again. My\u00a0youngest sister was only eight, so we had to bring ourselves up \u2013 five sisters in a small flat in Raynes\u00a0Park. I would go out with the girls I\u00a0worked with at the weekend. We&apos;d\u00a0always have a good laugh. That&apos;s where I saw Fred for the first time, at a dance. I loved dancing back then. We got married just before he left\u00a0for the war and I wore a wedding dress that three of my sisters had already worn. We didn&apos;t\u00a0have many\u00a0guests, just my sisters and Fred&apos;s mum, who had made a fruitcake. I didn&apos;t want children during the war, because so many fathers didn&apos;t come back, you see. You can&apos;t think the worst, but my sister&apos;s husband was killed in the war \u2013 terribly sad. Audrey was born in May 1946. It was too late to have any more children, because I was so old \u2013 32. We decided that we wouldn&apos;t have any\u00a0more. We&apos;ve had some wonderful holidays. Fred would often surprise\u00a0me by booking a hotel for the weekend. We both love seeing places \u2013 Denmark, Spain, Ireland \u2013 but we&apos;d never take a package tour. We liked to do it ourselves, see a lot of things. We don&apos;t get flustered; I think that&apos;s the secret. Fred is very easy-going. He&apos;ll go into the garden and I&apos;ll leave him be. He has been a\u00a0good husband, and I think I&apos;ve been a good wife. We haven&apos;t had difficult times or problems like many other people have \u2013 we&apos;ve had good health, nice holidays, and we&apos;ve worked hard. We&apos;ve done everything together, and always had each other. We&apos;ve never been lonely. I have never been unhappy in all my life. You have to make your own pleasures, don&apos;t you? Fred: There&apos;s nothing magical about\u00a0it, really. We&apos;ve just lived a normal life. If you&apos;ve got problems, you sort them out. We have arguments, but we&apos;ve never had a\u00a0row. Not a proper one. Yes, there are things we would have liked to have, but if we couldn&apos;t afford it, we didn&apos;t buy it. We never bought a house. Borrowing money makes for trouble. I&apos;ve met two people in\u00a0my\u00a0life with plenty of money and\u00a0they&apos;ve never been happy. Money causes terrible worries for\u00a0people. The things you saw in the war, they shaped you. These days, youngsters don&apos;t seem satisfied with life. They think nothing of getting married three times. Our grandson, Iain, is divorced. I think you&apos;ve got to try to be happy with what you have. Don&apos;t always be looking elsewhere. Don&apos;t aim for the moon. I&apos;ve always let Gladys do what she pleased. If she wanted to go out\u00a0with the girls, she just went. I didn&apos;t worry. But I&apos;ve always included her in my interests, that&apos;s the thing. I love boats, and we had wonderful barge holidays together for 30 years. It&apos;ll come some day, life without each other. We don&apos;t like to think about it. Gladys gets panic attacks. I can&apos;t stand up on my own any more, so I can&apos;t help her. It&apos;s terrible to watch. I wouldn&apos;t want to be without her."}, {"sentences": ["Hometown: Tokyo, Japan."], "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Culture", "Steely Dan"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-22T14:18:23Z", "title": "New band of the week: Shintaro Sakamoto (No 19)", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/22/new-band-of-the-week-shintaro-sakamoto-no-19", "article": "Hometown: Tokyo, Japan. The lineup: Shintaro Sakamoto (vocals, instruments). The background: Shintaro Sakamoto is a cult star in Japan. Formerly a member of psychedelic band Yura Yura Teikoku, a mainstream success back home with enough of a reputation for James Murphy to re-issue an LP of theirs on his Death from Abroad imprint in 2009, he only released his solo debut album, How to Live With a Phantom, in 2012. That album saw Sakamoto produce and play most of the instruments, conjuring, as Pitchfork put it, \u201cthe image of [Todd] Rundgren-as-golden god secluded in his hotel room of the Something/Anything? gatefold photo\u201d. His second LP, Let\u2019s Dance Raw, is a refinement of his style. Again, Sakamoto handles the bulk of the instrumental duties, with help from drummer and percussionist Yuta Suganuma and bassist Aya from fellow Japanese psych band OOIOO. The results are a blend of space-age bachelor pad muzak, jazz-tinged funk-lite, \u201870s AM radio pop, tropicalia, krautrock, Hawaiian music and y\u00e9-y\u00e9. It\u2019s not J-pop. Think Stereolab jamming with Steely Dan, or a Japanese analogue to MOR-slick revivalists such as Gayngs and Destroyer, with a Todd-like approach to studio control freakery.      It\u2019s quite hard to pin down, really, because he essays a different style virtually on every track. There is an overarching atmosphere or aesthetic, however. The sleeve features Sakamoto as a smiling skeleton against a nuclear mushroom cloud, a horrific image made all the more disturbing when juxtaposed with the super-nice music. Suddenly, the breezy bossa nova of Dancing With Pain takes on a different meaning, sounding creepily lovely, telegraphing the idea that surface attractiveness is just a lie, an illusion concealing the ugly truth about reality and death. There would seem to be a preoccupation with unpleasantness, even as Sakamoto ramps up the musical prettiness: songs on his two albums include From the Dead, Extremely Bad Man and World Without Sadness. Suddenly, the avant-schmaltz of You Just Decided assumes a darker quality. The titles are very self-aware: there\u2019s one called Future Lullaby that works neatly as a term for these lulling sci-fi maladies about the downfall of the human race although Birth of the Super Cult is less likely to be about Sakamoto himself than a totalitarian dictator currently preparing to edge mankind towards destruction. The use of robotic voices, cartoon chipmunk squeaks and unearthly female coos add to the sense of cloying-sweet disruption. Sakamoto fetishises the uncool and glamourises the naff in a similar way that Lawrence did with Denim. He would have been in his element 20 years ago, part of that wave - including Stereolab, High Llamas and Saint Etienne - of experimental types reared equally on \u201860s pop/lounge and \u201890s dance/electronica. Never Liked You, But Still Nostalgic brings to mind \u201880s band Microdisney, with a similar combination of the smooth and the acrid. Why Can\u2019t I Stop? moves at a krautrock pace. Birth of the Super Cult is like Young Rascals\u2019 Groovin\u2019 gone hula. Mask on Mask recalls novelty \u201870s whiteboy disco. The sax-fuelled Like an Obligation has the sardonic air of Gaucho-era Steely Dan, when they were at their most etiolated and wan, supine and sterile. It\u2019s washed-out jazz-funk, as pallid as the photos doing the rounds of Sakamoto, who is a grinning spectre, a hipster ghost in pop\u2019s machine.  The buzz: \u201cDon\u2019t call it J-pop.\u201d  The truth: Can buy a thrill.  Most likely to: Countdown to ecstasy.  Least likely to: Love your enemies.  What to buy: Let\u2019s Dance Raw is released by Other Music Recording Co on 15 September.  File next to: Stereolab, Steely Dan, Microdisney, Super Furry Animals.

In the previous 15 minutes, Holt has related one story about a fellow theatre\u00a0producer (unprintable), two stories about a theatre owner (possibly libellous), a yarn about an encounter with the crown prince of Japan (probable diplomatic incident) and a\u00a0saga that swerves from the crisis in Gaza to David Cameron&apos;s taste in suits. It might be better to stick with the life and times, I say. She rolls her eyes theatrically, and her voice plunges to\u00a0Lady Bracknell-like depths. &quot;Well, darling. If you must.&quot; She may be a little unsteady on her feet these days, the flame-coloured hair a little thinner than it was, but Holt, now 82, has lost none of her ability to command attention. She learned the skill early, as a young Rada\u00a0graduate in the 1950s. And it has proved useful when she left acting to become an impresario and producer, one of the most influential in the business. Theatre is hardly known for its\u00a0shrinking violets, but few people can\u00a0boast both of having played Lady Macbeth in a transparent nightie (and\u00a0afterwards debating it on TV with\u00a0Mary\u00a0Whitehouse) then been awarded the Order of the Rising Sun for contributions to Japanese drama. And that&apos;s not to mention the epic rows with Robert Maxwell, treasurer when Holt ran London&apos;s Roundhouse in the late 1970s. &quot;I&apos;ve been so very lucky, you know,&quot; Holt says: &quot;If you want it badly enough you&apos;ll get it.&quot; Her beginnings in theatre have been written about before, but bear repeating for the insight they shed into Holt&apos;s way with a yarn (a fellow producer once said that &quot;there is genius, which she has in abundance. But there is also more than a touch of Looney Tunes.&quot;). Brought up Catholic \u2013 the faith remains important to her \u2013 she was taken to mass at the age of four. &quot;I saw the priest came on last, went off first, had the most lines and a\u00a0beautiful dress. And I thought, I want to\u00a0be a priest.&quot; She pats my wrist. &quot;Clearly I was ahead of my time, dear. Seventy years.&quot; Realising that a career in the priesthood was beyond even her, Holt switched her sights to theatre, &quot;the other place where you get the best frock and all the words&quot;. She joined Rada in 1950, the same year as Joe Orton (&quot;as wicked as can be&quot;). She did well enough, but had an inkling that her true talents lay in other\u00a0directions. &quot;I was understudying Vanessa Redgrave on a show in Bath, it\u00a0must have been the early 60s, and there were still posters up from the actors who&apos;d been playing the week before. Vanessa turned to me and said, &apos;If you&apos;d been doing it, that wouldn&apos;t have happened.&apos; So I thought, &apos;I&apos;ll make it possible for them to do what they do.&apos;&quot; Her voice drops. &quot;Also, I&apos;ll be\u00a0honest, I thought: I&apos;m never going to be as good as Vanessa.&quot; She was spotted in a fringe show\u00a0in\u00a01965 by a young American director, Charles Marowitz, who had collaborated with Peter Brook at the Royal Shakespeare Company and was\u00a0looking to set up his\u00a0own group. Overawed by Holt, he invited her to\u00a0join; she proved that she was as valuable as an organiser and fundraiser as she was on stage. &quot;One day,&quot; she recalls, &quot;Charles sent\u00a0me a telegram saying, &apos;I&apos;ve found a space.&apos; This was 1967, in Tottenham Court Road, a basement. It cost \u00a33,700 to convert. I&apos;ve forgotten many things, but I remember that.&quot; The theatre was called the Open Space, a &quot;theatrical laboratory&quot; in which Marowitz and a group of young actors could conduct experiments on scripts old and new \u2013 and often on the audience. Some plays were rapid reactions to the news (1970&apos;s The Chicago Conspiracy made headlines for starring the author William Burroughs), but others were Shakespeare collages compiled by Marowitz, who tore up texts and spliced them into provocative new composites: a dadaist Hamlet (1965) that recast the hero as a &quot;slob&quot; who deserved what was coming to him, an unyielding Taming of the Shew (1973) that resulted in Holt&apos;s Katherine being anally raped onstage by Petruchio. Though the Open Space lasted only\u00a011 years \u2013 it collapsed in fittingly eccentric form after a fight about whether Marowitz had claimed a new\u00a0bathroom on the production budget \u2013 it brought an explosive sense of danger to British theatre. &quot;I loved it,&quot; Holt recalls. &quot;I was 40 going on 12. I\u00a0like risk.&quot; Not just professionally, one might add: having married a fellow actor, Patrick Graucob, who\u00a0later became a bookseller, she fell for the American actor Lawrence Pressman, whom she later married (despite her Catholicism) in a Jewish ceremony in New York. The\u00a0marriage lasted just six weeks (she\u00a0quietly remarried Graucob in 2011); reflecting about it on Desert Island Discs years later, Holt briskly opined: &quot;It is an English tradition to hang on to things longer than you should.&quot; Why did they marry in the first place? She smiles, a little pityingly. &quot;It was a fantastic party. We stamped on a glass. Would anyone say no to that?&quot; She sighs happily. &quot;Anyway, he\u00a0had wonderful legs.&quot; And was there another marriage somewhere in the middle? An Italian? &quot;Oh yes, he was a passing fancy, very attractive, but he died young.&quot; She stops. &quot;Do you want a list? I&apos;ll ask Malcolm [her assistant]. He&apos;s much better at this than me.&quot; Somewhat more constant than her love life has been Holt&apos;s passion for international drama, another thing she\u00a0discovered during the Open Space\u00a0days. While rehearsing Gertrude in Marowitz&apos;s Hamlet, she was astonished one day to be asked to perform alongside the titanic Russian actor Innokenti Smoktunovsky, who had starred in Grigori Kosintsev&apos;s film of Hamlet and had come to London to\u00a0perform. &quot;He and his wife acted in French; we did it in English. When we met later, he was convinced I could speak beautiful Russian. He can&apos;t have been listening.&quot; After the Open Space went under, Holt was persuaded to take her producing talents to the Roundhouse in Camden, which had been reborn as\u00a0an arts venue but by the late 1970s was\u00a0slipping into an ocean of debt. Alongside punk gigs that paid the bills and canny transfers from regional theatre, Holt imported a mix of non-English and defiantly non-traditional drama: Australia&apos;s Circus Oz, the radical director Antoine Vitez from France, and most famously Georgia&apos;s Robert Sturua, whose Hieronymus Bosch-inspired Richard III, which arrived in 1980 just after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, brought British audiences into bloody proximity with theatre behind the iron curtain. A decade later, having been courted by Peter Hall to perform the same trick at the National, she invited Ingmar Bergman and Peter Stein, and arranged visits from Chicago&apos;s Steppenwolf and the Moscow Art theatre. &quot;I grew up in an island race,&quot; she explains. &quot;When I went to Rada I was stuffed like a chicken with Shakespeare, when I left I was stuffed with more Shakespeare. I had never seen Chekhov done in his mother tongue, I\u00a0had seen no Ibsen in Norwegian. I just wanted to experience some of that.&quot; One of the relationships she forged was with the Japanese director Yukio Ninagawa, whom she brought to the NT in 1986, and again the following year, astonishing audiences with a &quot;cherry-blossom&quot; Macbeth and an epic, stylised all-male Medea that blended kabuki, bunraku puppetry and musical-style production values. Since then Holt has brought over 15 more Ninagawa productions to the UK (most recently 2012&apos;s Cymbeline), championing the cause of Asian drama in the west and forging a form of theatre that feels decisively modern. &quot;I went barmy when I first I saw Yukio&apos;s productions. I\u00a0was absolutely passionate about them. I suddenly realised that theatre is a way to learn not just about our own\u00a0country but the world.&quot; Holt&apos;s courage makes her stand out:\u00a0her bloody-minded determination that the project should happen, come what\u00a0may \u2013 whether it&apos;s bringing the sprawling Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil ensemble to Bradford or casting Janet McTeer opposite Mark Rylance in Much Ado About Nothing (&quot;Mark phoned me and said, &apos;Thelma, you think I&apos;m Benedick? Have you actually read the script?&apos; Of course he agreed to do it eventually.&quot;). In a West End reliant on film rehashes, 30-year-old musicals and shows that have been roadtested in the subsidised sector, Holt is that rarest of creatures: a veteran producer who has lost none of her appetite for the new. &quot;I believe in people,&quot; she says. &quot;That&apos;s what keeps me going. Someone\u00a0comes to me with an idea \u2013 Ninagawa comes, or Greg Doran from the RSC, anyone. It&apos;s all about making the idea happen.&quot; She&apos;s as active as ever: a transfer of the Menier&apos;s production of Forbidden Broadway has just been announced, and a new adaptation of Frank McGuinness is being lined up for early next year. Two days after we speak she&apos;s flying to\u00a0Tokyo with the Oxford University Drama Society, which she has supported since a stint as the Cameron Mackintosh professor of contemporary theatre. Next year&apos;s big event \u2013 a celebration of Ninagawa&apos;s 80th birthday at the Barbican \u2013 is just being finalised. Her 2016 diary is already filling with a\u00a0new collaboration with the RSC. What would she like her legacy to be? She draws breath for what seems like the first time. &quot;For my failed productions as much as my successful ones. The nicest thing that anyone&apos;s ever said to me is if you&apos;re in a production of Thelma&apos;s that fails you actually don&apos;t know. There are just as many balloons, and just as much alcohol at the party as if it were a success.&quot; She sets her jaw. &quot;Failure is not a bad thing, you get better at it. If I have a failure, we&apos;ll do the fucking thing again. We can&apos;t die and not get it right.&quot; Death is on her mind, you sense. Graucob died last January at the age of\u00a084, followed in May by Marowitz. Ever-pragmatic, she has made an advance booking for herself at Kensal Green cemetery in north London, in the same plot as her husband. &quot;I&apos;m on top. That seems to make sense.&quot; But she&apos;s adamant she can&apos;t imagine retiring. &quot;Where am I going to live, in Denville Hall with all the other old actors?&quot; She cackles. &quot;Actually that&apos;s quite fun, you&apos;d go downstairs and you&apos;d bitch. I&apos;d like that.&quot; We get talking about a time she was\u00a0at the Roundhouse and the cast decided they&apos;d do a group parachute jump. Holt insisted she&apos;d join them, despite having no previous experience. &quot;The doctor had seen me as Lady Macbeth. He said, &apos;Have you done this before?&apos; I said no. Everyone else was petrified, but I wasn&apos;t, quite honestly.&quot; I believe her, I say. &quot;You just leap, darling. As easy as that.&quot; \u2022 Forbidden Broadway will be at the Vaudeville theatre, London WC2, from 9 September to 22 November, menierchocolatefactory.com."}, {"sentences": ["However, a translator was on hand to help out \u2013 a woman who, he revealed, was once upon a time a waitress at a bar he and his wife Yoko ran in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Haruki Murakami", "Edinburgh international book festival", "Edinburgh", "Festivals", "Edinburgh festival", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Japan", "UK news", "Asia Pacific", "Edinburgh international book festival 2014"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-24T08:03:54Z", "title": "Haruki Murakami: 'My lifetime dream is to be sitting at the bottom of a well'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/24/haruki-murakami-my-lifetime-dream-is-to-be-sitting-at-the-bottom-of-a-well", "article": "When you start reading Murakami novels, life starts being like them. That\u2019s their special magic. So said Guardian book club host John Mullan, introducing this month\u2019s guest, the revered and multi-selling Japanese writer, at Edinburgh international book festival Mullan told of having that very experience as he ordered a coffee on the train to Edinburgh. \u201cYou like Haruki Murakami!\u201d exclaimed the waitress, noticing his copy of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. \u201cSo do I, what a coincidence!\u201d You and 27 million other people, he was tempted to say \u2013 but instead he couldn\u2019t help but mention that he would meet the author later the same day. Rarely seen in public or in the media, Murakami was cheerful, relaxed and very funny as he answered all the questions in English (\u201cI\u2019ve lived in Hawaii for a while, so my English is different than yours\u201d, he warned). However, a translator was on hand to help out \u2013 a woman who, he revealed, was once upon a time a waitress at a bar he and his wife Yoko ran in Tokyo.  The author of 13 novels and many short stories admitted to having completely forgotten what he has written \u2013 or indeed why \u2013 when asked about specific plot points, without seeming bothered at all. \u201cReally?\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t remember that\u201d were two of his most frequent answers, and he had the audience laughing at his frankness every time. \u201cIt was published 20 years ago and I haven\u2019t read it since then!\u201d he said of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, around which the event centred. Here we offer you the main points of the session, in quotes, including his answers to some of your questions. NOTE: even if there was very limited time for the session and therefore for squeezing in as many of your questions as we would have liked, many of your queries were answered during the event anyway, so hopefully this summary will satisfy a good amount of your curiosities. 1. \u201cI feel uncomfortable writing in the third person: it\u2019s like looking down on your characters\u201d  I wrote my first novel in 1979. Since then, I\u2019ve written every novel in the first person. I tried a couple of times to do the third person (it took me 20 years: the first was Kafka on the Shore) \u2013 and every time, I feel uncomfortable, like I\u2019m looking down from above. I wanted to stand at the same level as my characters. It\u2019s democratic!   2. \u201cWhen I was younger, I wanted to be a quiet person and live a quiet life\u201d  Toru Okada [the protagonist of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle] is my hero. When I was younger I wanted to be like him. I just wanted to be a quiet person and live a quiet life. It\u2019s not so quiet anymore! Life is strange.   3. \u201cI love ironing. And I do my wife\u2019s too!\u201d Murakami explained that a lot of the recurring themes in his books are from his own life \u2013 his cats, his cooking, his music and his obsessions. Continuing with his writing process, here\u2019s his comment on why he creates many different storylines in one book:  When I write a novel, it takes one or two years \u2013 and I write day after day \u2026 I get tired! I have to open up the window to get fresh air. I write another line of the story to get entertained \u2013 I hope the readers will be entertained as well! Also, I write in the first person, so I need something else [to develop these storylines]: letters, or somebody\u2019s story.  4. \u201cI don\u2019t like writing about violence and sex abuse \u2013 but I have to for the story\u2019s sake\u201d Some of his stories are about terrible things \u2013 he talked about a couple of horribly gripping moments in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle:   I was so scared when I was writing it! All the translators complained to me, saying it was scary. But writing it was much scarier! / I have to do that. The violence and sex abuse are a kind of stimulation for the story. I don\u2019t like to write them but I have to for the story\u2019s sake.  5. \u201cMy lifetime dream is to be sitting at the bottom of a well\u201c  It\u2019s my lifetime dream to be sitting at the bottom of a well. It\u2019s a dream come true. [Not a nightmare? asks John Mullan. \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI dont know.\u201d] I thought: it\u2019s fun to write a novel, you can be anything! So I thought: I can sit at the bottom of a well, isolated \u2026 Wonderful!  6. About translations of his books: \u201cYou can relax!\u201d Many readers asked about translation and his involvement in the English translations of his books. Beaslie asked:  Given much of his storytelling relies on nuance and subtlety, I\u2019d like to know what he thinks readers who experience his novels in translation lose by not reading in the original Japanese language.   I can read the books in English. Not in French, Russian, German or others. But when an English translation is complete, they send me the manuscript. When I read it, it\u2019s fine for me! I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next! My point is that if I enjoyed it, the translation is good. So you can relax! . Sometimes I find mistakes and I call the translator. But three or four things in a book, maybe.  7. \u201cWhen writing (as well as every day), I don\u2019t have any idea at all of what is to come\u201d Several readers wanted to know about his writing process. EdwardLlewellyn asked:  Is each book you write fully formed in your mind before you start to write or is it a journey for you as the writer as it is for us as readers?   I don\u2019t have any idea at all, when I start writing, of what is to come. For instance, for The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, the first thing I had was the call of the bird, because I heard a bird in my back yard (it was the first time I heard that kind of sound and I never have since then. I felt like it was predicting something. So I wanted to write about it). The next thing was cooking spaghetti \u2013 these are things that happen to me! I was cooking spaghetti, and somebody call. So I had just these two things at the start. Two years I kept on writing. It\u2019s fun! I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next, every day. I get up, go to the desk, switch on the computer, etc. and say to myself: \u201cso what\u2019s going to happen today?\u201dIt\u2019s fun!  8. \u201cMy imagination is a kind of animal. So what I do is keep it alive\u201d  I\u2019m obsessed with the well. And the elephant. The refrigerator. The cat. And the ironing. I can\u2019t explain it.  9. \u201cMy life is full of strange coincidences\u201d Mullan asked why he was so keen on using coincidence in his novels, when so many writers tried to avoid them because they often seemed unlikely to readers.  Dickens\u2019s books are full of coincidences; so are Raymond Chandler\u2019s: Philip Marlowe encounters numerous dead bodies in the City of Angels. It\u2019s unrealistic \u2013 even in LA! But nobody complains about it, as without it, how could the story happen? That\u2019s my point. / And so many coincidences happen in my real life. Many strange coincidences have happened in many junctures in my life.  10. What is good about being a novelist? \u201cNo commuting, no meetings, no boss.\u201d No need to add anything, as he didn\u2019t either. This was a question from a member of the audience. 11. \u201cWhen writing fiction, I need music\u201d An audience member asked how he chooses the music he includes in his novels \u2013 does he set out to have a soundtrack? Many of our readers asked questions along similar lines. Here\u2019s what he said:  It comes naturally. When writing fiction, I need something musical, and the songs come automatically to me. I have learned so many things from music \u2013 harmony, rhythm, improvisation. Rhythm is important to me \u2013 you need it to get the readers to keep writing. Usually I listen to music when I\u2019m writing, and that\u2019s where the songs in the books tend to come from.   12. \u201cI have no intention to write about sad characters\u201d An audience member asked why so many of his characters seem so sad. \u201cReally?\u201d, he asked, astounded. Toru Okada is certainly sad about his marriage, offered Mullan. \u201cEverybody is!\u201d, joked (we think) Murakami. \u201cI have no intention to write about sad characters\u201d, he concluded."}, {"sentences": ["For the Economist, it&apos;s Melbourne, Vienna and Toronto; for Monocle magazine, it is Melbourne, Tokyo and Copenhagen; for the global recruitment consultancy Mercer, the index of &quot;most liveable cities&quot; begins with Vienna, Zurich and Auckland."], "tags": ["Cities", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-25T07:59:00Z", "title": "The 10 things a perfect city needs | Paul Mason", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/25/10-things-a-perfect-city-needs", "article": "For the Economist, it&apos;s Melbourne, Vienna and Toronto; for Monocle magazine, it is Melbourne, Tokyo and Copenhagen; for the global recruitment consultancy Mercer, the index of &quot;most liveable cities&quot; begins with Vienna, Zurich and Auckland. When I read these lists, which are nearly always topped by cities in Australia, Canada and Scandinavia, I imagine them being compiled by a terrified, monogamous young couple dressed head to toe in Uniqlo or Gap. Their typical criteria \u2013 low crime rates, cheap private schools and access to world-class outdoor sports \u2013 always seem to match those of the stereotypical modern salaryman, not the complex real-world individual. The Economist&apos;s 2014 Liveability Ranking, released last week, reported a five-year fall in overall quality of city life, primarily driven by political unrest. More than half the cities surveyed had seen a fall in living standards, due to &quot;heightened unrest in the wake of the global economic crisis, which has undermined many of the developmental gains that cities may have experienced through public policy and investment&quot;. Though you can see their point when it comes to Damascus, Tripoli or Donetsk, equating political instability with negativity is perverse. The unrest that has swept many cities in the so-called emerging market countries, from Rio to Kiev to Istanbul, is actually a measure of how the new middle classes in these countries aspire to make things better. Speaking from experience, Istanbul during the Taksim Square protest and Athens during the indignado camp of 2011 became, momentarily, better places to live. You could argue that New York City after the Occupy movement experienced a positive change in social atmosphere, a democratisation of artistic space, and a revival of its radical mojo. George Orwell once imagined an ideal pub \u2013 which he called the Moon Under Water \u2013 that embodied the 10 key qualities no real pub possessed, from barmaids who call you &quot;Dear&quot; to serving stout on draught. In that spirit, and as an antidote to league tables that judge cities against Ikea-like qualities, I will describe the city I would like to live in. First, it is near the sea, or another body of water warm enough to swim in. Second, it has entire neighbourhoods designed around hipster economics. Though currently maligned, hipsters are crucial signifiers of a successful city economy. Their presence shows it is possible to live on your wits even as neoliberalism stagnates. Such neighbourhoods (I am thinking of Little Five Points in Atlanta) typically contain: vintage clothes stores, a micro-brewery, a gay club, burger joints, coffee bars not owned by global chains, and a lot of small workshops for creative microbusinesses. In the ideal form, these areas are home both to hipsters and ethnically diverse poor communities, who refrain from fighting each other. Third, the finance sector has to be big enough to mobilise global capital and local savings, but not so big that it allows the global elite to run things through their usual mixture of aristocratic men&apos;s club and organised crime. Fourth, and this is crucial, it has to have theatres. Not just big ones, such as the Vienna State Opera, where the elite can parade their jewellery and their furs, but tiny theatres, in warehouses or open courtyards (this ideal city is somewhere sunny). The city has to have a recognisable demos: you have to be able to go somewhere and, as in the Paris of Zola&apos;s Nana, point across the stalls to celebrities and statespeople, misbehaving in public. Fifth, bicycle lanes and trams. The most touching thing about the Chinese city of Tianjin, when I first visited in the mid-2000s, was its bike lanes separated by concrete kerbs from the traffic: on cold nights, young couples would ride home side by side holding hands. Equally important to trams and bike supremacy is a heavily regulated taxi system, as efficient as Uber but under the control of old-style London working-class cabbies, who&apos;ve been persuaded to give women and ethnic minorities equal access to the trade, and who are banned from giving you their opinion. Sixth, a massive ecosystem of gay, lesbian, transgender, BDSM and plain old sleazy heterosexual hangouts: clubs, bars, dancehalls, cabarets and all the dim-lit alleyways and grassy knolls inbetween. For it is a truth unacknowledged by those who make the official league tables that Joe Corporate, with his squash racquet and sober suit, and Joanna Corporate, with her nanny and pushchair, really want to live many other secret and parallel lives, and the ideal city is one big, analogue version of Craigslist. Seventh \u2013 like Orwell&apos;s mythic pub \u2013 it must be happy with its Victorian and Edwardian architecture, and with anything salvagable that used to be a factory or warehouse. Harlem in New York, Fitzroy in Melbourne, Prenzlauer Berg in Berlin all derive an intangible positive atmosphere from their combination of brick, ornament, renovation and re-use. Eighth, it must be ethnically mixed and tolerant and hospitable to women. Some of the &quot;safest&quot; cities on these world league tables are actually ones where women can&apos;t live an equal or modern life, because whole areas are locked down by religious conservatism, or harsh policing of minorities. The city of Gijon, in northern Spain, has a government that plasters the streets with ever more inventive propaganda against sexual harassment, domestic violence and general sexism. Stuff like that. Ninth, any slums have to be what UN Habitat calls &quot;slums of hope&quot; \u2013 staging posts for upward mobility, self-policing and non-chaotic (ideally you would have no slums at all). Tenth, indispensably, is a democratic political culture the inhabitants are proud of, that calls them regularly to the streets, to loud arguments in small squares, keeps their police demilitarised and in check, and allows them to assimilate the migrants that will inevitably flow inwards, and to self-identify as products of the city as they themselves navigate the global labour market. As with Orwell&apos;s pub, no one city has all these qualities. Athens, Lima and Barcelona would come close if they could sort out corrupt political oligarchies, racism, sexism and, of course, poverty. Vienna lacks diversity, downtown Melbourne needs a better theatre scene and in truth the sea there is bloody freezing. If you could cut and paste everything east of Bondi Junction on to London&apos;s Soho and Barcelona&apos;s Raval, giving the whole city a feminist government recruited in Scandinavia, you might come close. But you can&apos;t so you have to dream. And remember it was the imagination of those who built the best of the world&apos;s cities that made these global league tables possible: not the housing market or planning regulations but exalted visions of urban space transformed. So dream on. Paul Mason is economics editor of Channel 4 News.

Designers from around the world showcased housing and products for living small \u2013 from transformable furniture and pre-fab trailers to 3D printed interior objects. Often their strategies sought to reduce the human footprint on the environment and save energy as well. Urban housing supplies are already straining worldwide with 54% of the global population of 7.2 billion living in cities, according to the United Nation\u2019s World Urbanization Prospects 2014 report. By 2050, that number is expected to rise to 6.33 billion, or 66% of a forecasted world population of 9.6 billion. In North America, about 82% of the total population \u2013 roughly 473.8 million people \u2013 lives in urban areas. The number of single-person households is rising, although housing has not kept pace with demographic change. Many of the new units being built are getting smaller and smaller, challenging municipal housing codes and zoning regulations.     At Dwell on Design Los Angeles, attendees examine zero-energy housing units designed by students from the Georgia Tech College of Architecture. Photograph: Courtesy Michael Gamble, Georgia Tech College of Architecture    Micro-apartments tricked out with scaled-down, adaptable furniture and decor could make urban dwelling more compatible with the way people increasingly live now \u2013 and help cities as they attempt to absorb more people in the future. The challenges include how to do so affordably, comfortably and with enough privacy to make these spaces homes as well as housing. Breathing room It\u2019s not just about the buildings, however. Cities need more friendly parks and outdoor space to compensate for the lack of indoor spaces, said architect Michael Gamble, an associate professor at the Georgia Tech School of Architecture. Gamble guides students in examining the social and ethical issues involved in creating tiny spaces.     Some of the younger crowd at Dwell on Design LA found that the model created by Georgia Tech College of Architecture students was a perfect doll house. Photograph: Courtesy of Michael Gamble, Georgia Tech College of Architecture    Gamble believes that micro-units must take into account the environment around the building. \u201cThere has to be a very healthy balance between what we call the public realm and the private realm,\u201d he said. Without big windows and sufficient green space nearby, residents may feel constrained within their apartments.  \u201cPeople need space to go to when they leave their apartment,\u201d Gamble said. \u201cThey cannot be relegated to hanging out in a shopping mall or having to pay for a cup of coffee to use the Internet.\u201d  Smaller spaces also may be linked to health risks and privacy issues. \u201cThere\u2019s a tipping point related to general health and small apartments,\u201d Gamble said. Trapped in Hong Kong Cramming more people into less space is nothing new in Asian cities like Hong Kong. The city\u2019s Society for Community Organization (SoCO) recently hosted a photo exhibition called Trapped which showed photos of low-income families \u2013 sometimes made up of more than two generations \u2013 forced to live in subdivided apartments, some as small as 28 sq feet (2.6 sq meters). Children must eat, sleep and do homework on their beds.      These subdivided units in Hong Kong are so tiny they have to be photographed from the ceiling. Photograph: Benny Lam/Society for Community Organization (SoCO), Hong Kong    According to SoCO, Hong Kong is home to nearly 300,000 children under 18 years old who are living below the poverty line. The organization also points to a survey by Policy 21 Limited, which showed that over 20,000 children under the age of 15 live in these types of subdivided units. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people still live in caged homes and wood-partitioned cubicles, while the unemployed, newly-arrived families from [mainland] China and children in poverty struggle for survival,\u201d said a SoCO spokesperson. \u201cSoCO\u2019s underprivileged clients are increasing in numbers \u2013 while the city\u2019s wealth continues to accumulate.\u201d Compact New York  Cities need to move beyond old-fashioned ideas of what they think people need, and look into alternatives such as micro-units for single-person households and legal shared housing, according to Sarah Watson, deputy director of Citizens Housing and Planning Council (CHPC). \u201cThere\u2019s a very fixed idea of what an apartment needs to be\u201d, she said. \u201cWho you expect to live in the unit will affect the design.\u201d     A micro-apartment complex now under construction in New York City will feature small units designed for one or two adults \u2013 fast becoming the majority of the city\u2019s households. Photograph: /Courtesty nARCHITECTS    CHPC, which hosted the Making Room exhibition on tiny living at the Museum of the City of New York in 2013, has found that 47% of New Yorkers over the age of 25 do not live with a spouse or partner. Many singles share apartments that were designed for families, with large master bedrooms and smaller rooms for children \u2013 a layout that doesn\u2019t make sense for adult roommates. \u201cIt\u2019s a real crisis because it ends up being hugely dysfunctional in the housing market,\u201d Watson said.  The disconnect can also lead to dangerous situations. After a series of deaths from fires in illegally subdivided apartments  in 2011, city officials vowed to step up regulation of these unregulated conversions. But weighed down by its established housing codes (pdf), the city is taking longer to respond to the changing demographics when it comes to new construction. In 2012, then-mayor Michael Bloomberg launched the adAPT NYC competition to spur new designs for one- and two-person households. The mayor waived some zoning regulations so that construction of the winning proposal could start on a city-owned lot on East 27th Street in 2013.     Construction of the MyMicro NYC micro-apartment complex is underway. It will offer 55 micro-housing units ranging between 250 and 370 sq ft. Photograph: Courtesty nARCHITECTS    Still under construction, the new complex will feature 55 micro-units ranging between 250 to 370 sq ft. Around 40% of the apartments will be affordable housing units priced below market rates. To \u201coptimize space and maximize the sense of openness\u201d, the design team integrated features like high ceilings and small \u201cJuliet\u201d balconies, refinements often neglected in low- and middle-income housing. Adult tree houses Mitchell Joachim, a New York University associate professor and co-founder of Terreform One, aims to create a wholly new concept for micro-dwelling by rethinking the interaction of ecology, botany and design. This version of the childhood dream hideaway is not a house in a tree, however; instead, it\u2019s a house made of living trees.     Tree branches would be trained around pre-fabricated spheres to create these \u201ctree ball\u201d dwelling units. Image: Courtesy Terreform ONE    Among Terreform One\u2019s recent designs are tree spheres called Willow Balls. They are living treehouses just 8 feet (2.43 meters) in diameter. Joachim considers them semi-permanent, and says they can be used as seasonal spaces like gazebos or other outdoor recreational spaces. They\u2019re made by growing ficus trees over a scaffolding frame similar to what gardeners do when they use pliable living plants to create archways. Once the fast-growing ficus trees cover the sphere, the scaffolding can be removed and re-used with another set of plants.  While the living-plants portion of the sphere is natural, Terreform One will manufacture the scaffoldings in Brooklyn out of wood or metal. Terreform One is currently taking orders for the scaffoldings \u2013 priced at $8,000 \u2013 and expects to put them on sale in early 2015. The goal is to \u201cnudge nature in its place into a geometric shape that is usable by people\u201d, Joachim said. The design challenges the traditional idea of forestry because instead of growing trees, chopping them down and milling them into lumber to build houses, the trees transform into a house as they grow. Acknowledging that shipping an 8 ft tree sphere through the mail is not energy-efficient, the design group is working on ways to mitigate this \u2013 perhaps by growing the sphere in place to lower the dwelling\u2019s carbon footprint. Re-thinking the toilet The greater Tokyo area is the world\u2019s most densely populated metropolitan region with some 38 million residents packed into about 5,200 sq miles. So small sinks and showers are nothing new in compact Japanese bathrooms. TOTO, the Japanese bathroom fixtures and plumbing company, showcased micro-toilet design for bathrooms as small as 9 sq feet (0.84 meters) at the Dwell on Design conference.     The Aquia Wall-Hung Dual Flush toilet is mounted onto the wall \u2013 hiding its water tank out of sight and saving space in small bathrooms. Photograph: Toto USA    One of TOTO\u2019s newest tiny toilets conserves floor space by hanging suspended from the wall with a thin high-efficiency water tank hidden from view within the wall. According to TOTO, it is 9 inches shorter in length than the average toilet.  The design also carries the EPA WaterSense label, averaging a lean 1 gallon per flush. This \u201csaves a family of four more than $90 annually on their water bill, and $2,000 over the lifetime of the toilet\u201d, said TOTO USA\u2019s Lenora Campos. Convertible furniture re-imagined To furnish a micro-apartment comfortably, Resource Furniture has re-imagined the old Murphy beds and folding tables of yore with sophisticated book shelves, desks and sofas that can convert into beds. Drawers pull out from under stairs. Storage space is cleverly hidden within walls and pushed up to ceilings.      This transformable bed by Resource Furniture conserves micro-apartment space by folding out from the wall \u2013 as seen here at the 2013 Making Room exhibition in New York. Photograph: Courtesy Museum of the City of New York    Another trend on view at Dwell on Design was decor in vertical layers to help use every inch of available space from floor to ceiling. A sleeping layer might include a platform bed with a desk or closet space underneath, for example. The living space layer could host an elevated couch or lounge as well as small kitchen. Closets could be squeezed between kitchens and bathrooms, and storage spaces have been created by adding an extra layer near the ceiling or under an elevated floor, leaving no space left underutilized.

Me neither, but I reckon it would still be easier to get into one than to score a ticket for Melbourne\u2019s new cat cafe. About three weeks ago I inquired about a possible visit the next weekend. The person at the end of the line replied with just a hint of the tone of a disdainful ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel: \u201cSorry, we\u2019re full. Try another date on our website.\u201d And so I did, with an eye roll. Three weeks of waiting and a $10 booking fee to hang out with domestic animals for one hour? I might miss my own cat, Scully, who lives in the UK, but this seemed over the top. On paper, a cat cafe seems like a good, if silly, idea for people living in Tokyo, where living spaces are so small that having a pet is often out of the question. But I did suspect that city dwellers in Melbourne and Paris (where Le Caf\u00e9 des Chats opened this year) do not need an equivalent.  And then there\u2019s the hygiene question. A colleague who visited a grubby cat cafe at the top of a Japanese high-rise told me the space felt like a doctor\u2019s waiting room, only with furniture covered in cat hair. To her horror, visitors could only pet the cats if they offered them food sold on the premises. Some of the star attractions were obese. Which brings me to my reservations about the cats\u2019 welfare. Do the Cat Cafe Melbourne residents \u2013 all rescue animals \u2013 like their new quarters? Are they not exhausted by the unwanted attention they have to suffer through, the hundreds of strangers\u2019 hands running through their fur? Would it feel like visiting a grim, sad brothel ... only with cats?      Toys on sale in the gift shop    My fears, as it turned out, were largely unfounded.  We arrived at a few minutes early and were ushered into the waiting area that doubles as a gift shop. It was eerily silent. We all paced the room, starring at cat toys, cat trophies, cat beds and clothes with cat prints before being asked to sign a waiver. Don\u2019t pull the cats\u2019 tails and don\u2019t feed them, it says, warning that you may be scratched. At eight on the dot we were asked to wash our hands and made our way upstairs.  Before my visit, I had pictured the cafe as a single room where people would sit at tables to drink, with animals roaming free between their legs. Melbourne\u2019s cafe is nothing like that: the upstairs is a spacious four-bedroom flat decorated with a slightly Victorian air, cut in the middle by a majestic staircase which the cats love to run up and down. It has been renovated specifically to host the 12 felines in residence.     Lottie, tired of having her picture taken, decides to feign sleep    The rooms are tastefully decorated. There\u2019s a bookshelf with scores of cat-related tome, a TV showing fake aquarium footage on a loop, various cat toys and other paraphernalia, and a special retreat accessible only to the animals should they feel the need to escape the business that humans bring. The atmosphere was hushed and our group was quite timid about touching the cats at first \u2013 although that didn\u2019t last. I sat down next to Winter, a beauty of a grey creature who was lounging on the floor. I then moved to the next one, and the next one, and the next one, laughing at my own stupid grin. That\u2019s the thing about cats: they are so aloof that each time you manage to foist affection on them \u2013 however grudgingly they receive it \u2013 it feels like a personal victory.     Portraits of bygone cat generations    In the biggest room, fellow visitors gathered to play with Waldo and Braveheart, the most mischievous cat of the bunch, and joined the chitchat. At this stage, those who had ordered coffee, tea or muffins were served \u2013 but the choices are limited, more of a token effort than a genuine offering. This is where the Melbourne cafe differs from its Parisian equivalent: you clearly don\u2019t go there to eat fancy pastries or sip the finest of tea. I decided to pass. As such, it\u2019s not so much a cafe as it is a \u201changing out with cats\u201d space. So what about the guests \u2013 and what brought them here? Well, one of them clearly took her visit very seriously; she was sporting full feline facepaint to match her pointy-eared hairband.      Cat-related tomes on the bookshelf    The majority of the cafe\u2019s clients already had cats but they still had a lot of questions, which the cat minder patiently fielded. Why isn\u2019t my cat as cuddly as these ones? Why do my two pets not get along and what can I do about them bullying each other? Are certain breeds more keen to socialise than others? The circle reminded me of an AA meeting for cat owners \u2013 advice was freely distributed, war stories exchanged and courage disseminated (\u201cYes, they\u2019re largely deranged little creatures. No, I don\u2019t get mine either.\u201d) But answers to puzzlement at cats\u2019 behaviour (which I believe is at the root of the internet\u2019s preference for cats over dogs) was only one benefit of the experience. It turns out that being in a room surrounded by felines is strangely relaxing. You already know that cats are said to have therapeutic powers \u2013 research has shown that being in company of pets triggers the human brain to release oxytocin, sometimes referred to as the love hormone for its bonding properties.     Yes, we are just waiting for your departure to really have fun    So is the cat cafe a place for weirdos and cat ladies to find some company or just another public space created to bring people and animals together? I would argue that a visit isn\u2019t all that different to taking part in a book club, a knitting group, a poker night or a sci-fi convention. Visitors meet, find their feet and do something that makes them feel good, creating a bond in doing so \u2013 if only for an hour. It\u2019s perhaps not on par with a church visit (or an atheist church visit) in promoting a sense of interconnectedness but it\u2019s not a bad place to start.

One of the many interesting things that I ran across in my communications with the congress attendees was an online video game that challenges the viewer to spot a camouflaged bird egg in a short period of time. This video game, which is entertaining and rather addictive, is designed to follow the evolution and function of camouflage in wild animals and to explore how different types of camouflage work.  The guiding principle for camouflage is intuitive to most people: to blend in with the surroundings. The military uses camouflage to hide their troops and weapons, but it\u2019s also used in civilian life to hide mobile phone signal transmission towers or ugly buildings. But the reverse is also true: some things, such as traffic signs and advertising, are designed specifically to stand out from the background. Since we are well-acquainted with both camouflage and \u201canti-camouflage\u201d in our modern world, it might surprise you to learn that scientists don\u2019t know much about the types of camouflage that are most important for wild animals nor especially, how different sorts of camouflage affect survival. This is partly the result of two variables; the type of camouflage and the predator\u2019s visual system that the camouflaged animal is trying to evade. Other challenges include the difficulty in simply finding these cryptic animals in the field for study and of course, the camouflaged animal\u2019s mobility. But the nests and eggs of ground-nesting birds don\u2019t tend to move around, so they provide a good model system for investigating camouflage in the real world. To do this work, Martin Stevens, a BBSRC David Phillips Senior Research Fellow in the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter, and Claire Spottiswoode, a BBSRC David Phillips Research Fellow in the Department of Zoology at the University of Cambridge, teamed up with Jolyon Troscianko, a postdoctoral fellow, and Jared Wilson-Aggarwal, a research assistant, both at Exeter. This team is part of several other groups that investigate the sensory and evolutionary ecology in a wide variety of animals. Of the five senses, the Exeter group focuses on animal vision, anti-predator coloration (such as camouflage, warning signals, and eyespots), brood parasitism, and visual communication. The avian brainchild of this collaboration is \u201cProject Nightjar\u201d, which uses lab and fieldwork -- and citizen science! -- to investigate how visual systems are related to nightjars, a group of ground-nesting birds that rely on camouflage to keep themselves, their nests and eggs, hidden from predators.  The online video game -- the citizen science aspect of this project -- is what I ran across when chatting with Dr Stevens on twitter and via email about the team\u2019s research (he tweets at @SensoryEcology). Being an avid birder as well as an avid gamer, I had to give this game a go. And yes, it\u2019s educational and thought-provoking, but equally important, it\u2019s great fun.  \u201cThe online games seemed like a great way to tell people about how exciting camouflage and bird behaviour/evolution is, in addition to being genuine science experiments\u201d, writes Dr Stevens in email. To create the online games, Project Nightjar teamed up with Dave Griffiths, a game designer at FoAM Kernow in Cornwall, who made three online games for them. The first two online games that were developed challenge people to find either hidden nightjars or their nests.  \u201cThe main twist with these [games] is that we can change the display to simulate the visual system of different predators, such as a trichromatic primate (which has three types of cone cell in the eye to see colour, as do humans), and a dichromatic predator like a mongoose (just two cones involved in colour vision and so sees fewer colour types). By doing this we can analyse how the colour vision of the predator affects how effective camouflage is\u201d, explains Dr Stevens in email. Some visual systems are better than others at detecting hidden objects in particular environments.  \u201cWe\u2019re just finishing the analyses here but we\u2019ve found that colour vision type does affect how different types of camouflage are detected -- sometimes trichromats are better, sometimes dichromats, depending on how much potential colour information there is in the environment\u201d, writes Dr Stevens in email.     .    The third game, egglab -- the one I\u2019ve been playing -- is somewhat more complicated. It is designed to test how camouflage patterns and colours evolve to become harder to spot in different environments (read about it here). As people play this game, the eggs are ranked in terms of detection times, with those eggs that take longer to find being better hidden. Just as in the wild, the most obviously visible eggs die, whilst the most effectively camouflaged eggs survive and produce chicks. These chicks grow up and then lay the next generation of camouflaged eggs that form the next round of play. Of course, as in real life, some of those eggs have mutations that change their patterns and colours.     .    \u201cOver time, we expect to see camouflage become better, and to determine what types of camouflage evolve. For example, on very variable complex backgrounds we might expect disruptive camouflage that breaks up the shape and outline of the egg to arise, whereas on simple backgrounds eggs should just match the specific colours and patterns there\u201d, explains Dr Stevens in email. Although the human visual system is the selective force in this game, the researchers think their results will be broadly applicable to a wide range of visual systems, since the game is documenting the sorts of camouflage that evolve in different habitats and the strategies involved.

Photograph: Dr Martin Stevens/Project Nightjar    Each version tests 60 populations of eggs in total in separate runs of the game (there are 20 populations for each version/bird species). Each population comprises hundreds of eggs that are evolving separately.  \u201cIn total across all populations we\u2019ve tested something like 400,000 individual eggs so far\u201d, writes Dr Stevens in email. \u201cBy splitting the game [into separate species-based versions] like this we can analyse how different types of camouflage evolve in different habitats, and what happens when some species specialise and nest on one background alone whereas others are more generalist and nest on several background types and so can\u2019t match any one background so closely\u201d, writes Dr Stevens in email.  The first two games had roughly 15,000 people playing them. According to Dr Stevens, the artificial egg evolution \u201cegglab\u201d game has about 10,000 people playing it so far, testing hundreds of generations of camouflaged eggs.  \u201cOverall, I think it\u2019s reasonable to say that none of this -- neither the field project or the games -- have ever been done so extensively before in studies of animal camouflage,\u201d writes Dr Stevens in email.  \u201cEspecially not when quantifying colouration to predator vision and using such large scale artificial evolution experiments. We\u2019ve also been really keen to make the work as accessible and open as possible to wider audiences\u201d. The best part? You don\u2019t have to be a birder or bird-lover to love this game.

This is a laudable goal but in a society driven by consumption, it\u2019s not an achievable one. The world\u2019s population needs to both consume less and expand its resource base and seeking energy and raw materials from space is one way to do this. But surely this could never be economically viable? At today\u2019s prices perhaps not. Yet in 20 years it is a safe prediction that increasing scarcity will have driven up the cost of energy and many critical metals by at least 10 or 20 times in real terms. Space access technologies will also have improved. By the 2030s or 2040s, obtaining extraterrestrial resources will be cost effective. Some companies and governments have recognised this future reality and are making ambitious plans. The next commercial frontier In April 2014, researchers at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) revealed a technology road map for space-based solar power (SBSP). This would place vast solar power satellites in orbit, and could beam 1 gigawatt of power to a \u2018rectenna\u2019 island off Tokyo sometime in the 2030s. In another plan to utilise the resources of space, US companies Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, intend to mine asteroids. About 1,500 near-Earth asteroids are prime candidates for mining operations, with some estimated to contain 1.5 times the known world-reserves of platinum group metals. Even at today\u2019s prices, many individual asteroids are thought to harbour raw materials worth more than $100bn. Given the above, it is not surprising that corporate interest in space is growing. Test flights of Virgin Galactic\u2019s craft, which will carry passengers to and from space, continue, while Orbital Sciences Corporation and SpaceX have also each begun to provide a commercial cargo service to the International Space Station. In May 2014, SpaceX revealed its Dragon Version 2 spacecraft. Within a few years this will be ferrying astronauts as well as cargo for NASA. According to the company, it will also touch down \u201cwith the precision of a helicopter\u201d using its partially-3D-printed rocket engines. Governments are getting in on the action China is taking the lead with its Chang\u2019e lunar exploration program. This has already landed a space probe on the moon, and in 2017 intends to return a lander to the Earth with a cargo of lunar rock. If all goes well, there could be a manned Chinese moonbase by the 2030s. This could cement China as a dominant 21st century superpower, as well as deliver the kind of technological advantages that the US reaped from Apollo. China\u2019s lunar ambitions may also safeguard future energy supplies. Chang\u2019e chief scientist, professor Ouyang Ziyuan, is one of many who believe that a lunar resource called helium-3 could fuel future nuclear fusion power stations. Helium-3 is extremely rare on Earth, but in future could be worth billions of dollars a tonne as a clean nuclear fuel. The estimated 1.1m tonnes of helium-3 contained in the lunar topsoil could therefore justify a long-term industrial occupation of the moon. Alone among nations, China has both the money and the forward-looking political apparatus to achieve this. Russia has on occasion linked a potential future lunar presence to helium-3 mining. Unfortunately, plans by NASA to investigate the possibility were quashed in 2010 when President Obama cancelled a lunar programme called Constellation. In January 2014, NASA did announce a modest initiative called Lunar CATALYST to assist the private sector in developing \u2018lunar cargo transportation\u2019. In 2015, we will also enter the final straights of the Google Lunar XPRIZE. Launched in 2007, this offers $20m to the first private company to land a robot on the moon. The deadline is 31 December 2015, with eighteen teams still in the game. A future of exterrestrial resources Over the next few years these initiatives are likely to generate considerable interest in space as the next commercial frontier. In parallel, humanity\u2019s right to exploit extraterrestrial resources is likely to be questioned. We may, for example, come to debate whether it is more appropriate to desecrate the Arctic before mining the Moon. We cannot recklessly consume the finite resources of our motherworld forever. In addition to learning to live more sustainably, in the long-term we have to move beyond sustainability to obtain resources from space. Ever since our ancestors dragged themselves out of the oceans, rising to the challenge of a new frontier has been what we have done best.

Why not Stroud?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/27/disaster-movies-new-york-joe-queenan", "article": "This has been another banner year for movies in which great cities get pulped. In The Amazing Spider-Man 2, for the umpteenth time, New York gets trashed by malignant creatures with extraordinary powers, all of them destructive. In Godzilla, it is San Francisco that takes it on the chin. In Edge of Tomorrow, it is the Eiffel tower that ends up lying on its side, and the Louvre that gets pistol-whipped on an epic scale. For reasons too obvious to mention, when Hollywood decides to go to town on a great city, it usually sets its sights on New York first. Spider-Man 2, soon out on DVD, is a typical example. Here it is Manhattan, more photogenic and &quot;iconic&quot; than the four other boroughs, that bears the brunt of the assault, as well it should. Brooklyn, for all its shameless self-promotion, lacks those instantly recognisable buildings and legendary thoroughfares \u2013 the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, the Great White Way \u2013 that make it clear precisely what is being smashed to pieces, and where. Brooklyn has the Academy of Music; Manhattan has Carnegie Hall. Brooklyn has Grand Army Plaza; Manhattan has Times Square. Game, set and match to the Big Guy.           As for mobilising monsters to do a tune on dowdy, down-at-the-heels Queens or Staten Island or Da Bronx, forget it. If disaster strikes, if monsters loom, if armageddon is nigh \u2013 and when was the last time armageddon was not nigh? \u2013 it&apos;s Manhattan&apos;s assignment to take a pasting. Manhattan has been doing this stuff for a long, long time. Manhattan never fails to answer the bell. So, in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, skyscrapers topple, bridges collapse, the power grid goes down, chaos reigns. And, of course, a sea of blue-and-white police cruisers pile up in one of those massive NYPD car crashes we have all been watching for decades.      This is pretty much the same thing that happened in The Avengers and Cloverfield and Deep Impact and Independence Day and Escape from New York and The Day After Tomorrow and any number of other films, going all the way back to the original King Kong. Not to mention Ghostbusters. The cinematic despoliation of New York City is as kneejerk a cliche as the unvarying portrayal of the LAPD as unspeakably corrupt and uncompromisingly evil (LA Confidential, Training Day, Dark Blue, Internal Affairs) or at least not very nice (Gangster Squad, Mulholland Falls, Crash.) It&apos;s as predictable as making films \u2013 usually starring Colm Meaney \u2013 in which rustic Scots or Welsh or Hibernians are portrayed as canny. Or films in which Tilda Swinton plays somebody strange. It&apos;s like the running joke in Scream that no one in horror movies has ever seen a horror movie. In this case, no character in a film where Manhattan gets trashed has ever seen a film where Manhattan gets trashed. Nobody in The Amazing Spider Man 2 has ever seen Independence Day. They may not even have seen The Amazing Spider Man 1. Otherwise, they would size up the situation and head out to the Hamptons until this thing blew over. Indeed, the overwhelming evidence suggests that no one who has ever made a film in which New York gets trashed has ever seen a film in which New York gets trashed. It&apos;s as if directors and screenwriters are working in a parallel universe where everyone is an idiot. As opposed to Hollywood.           Obviously, other great cities have taken their on-screen lumps from time to time; like any other sentient creature, monsters get tired of dreary routines. In Transformers 4, it is Beijing that gets smacked around. In Godzilla, a cadre of resourceful monsters first wreck various parts of Japan, then obliterate large chunks of Hawaii, then put Las Vegas to the sword, before finally settling in to demolish San Francisco, previously ransacked in any number of films. Paris gets pulverised in Edge of Tomorrow, London gets a good walloping in Reign of Fire and 28 Days Later, and in World War Z, Jerusalem gets absolutely hammered by feisty, marauding vampires. Finally, in the lowly, earnestly cheesy Sharknado, killer flying sharks lay waste to the City of Angels. And there&apos;s not a damn thing the LAPD can do about it. Because the entire police force is busy elsewhere, being unspeakably corrupt. High-profile cities with instantly recognisable landmarks get attacked over and over and over again in the movies. Hollywood never gets tired of wreaking rack and ruin on the planet&apos;s most famous urban centres because it helps the audience get their bearings. Even little kids can say: Oh, the Eiffel Tower. That&apos;s in France. Whereas, if a film were set in Belfast, the little tykes would be at sea. The only reason no one has thought of devoting an entire film to destroying Buenos Aires on screen is because Buenos Aires is the most famous city in the world that doesn&apos;t have anything famous in it. Blow up Buenos Aires on screen and people could easily confuse it with Santiago or Caracas. Maybe even Lima. At least, unsophisticated moviegoers would. The kind of moviegoer who needs subtitles at the bottom of the screen reading: London, England Moscow, Russia Africa Let me make one thing perfectly clear: I like to watch New York and Los Angeles and Tokyo get blown up as much as the next guy. You wanna smash self-absorbed, self-adulating, holier-than-thou San Francisco to smithereens? Be my guest. But isn&apos;t this municipal-mayhem gambit getting a bit tired? Do we really need to see Manhattan destroyed again? Really? Just to give the rest of us a change from the same old, same old, couldn&apos;t some enterprising young director move all the gore and destruction away from the Big Apple and Vegas and the City of Lights to cities that could badly use the publicity? Cities that have never once been devastated on the screen? Or, even better, cities that a lot of moviegoers would like to see destroyed? Cities that really deserve to have the hammer brought down on them?           Suggestions? I have never forgiven Dallas for killing my president back in 1963. The experts always say that the murder was the work of a deranged commie marksman or the CIA or the Mafia or Fidel Castro, but I&apos;m not buying it: it was the city of Dallas that killed my charming, Catholic, Irish-American president. They were all in on it. So I would love to see the Transformers waltz right in there and give that lowbrow burgh a full-service ream job. Or maybe some of those disgusting insects from Edge of Tomorrow \u2013 via Starship Troopers \u2013 could stop by to mete out a quick dose of what Genghis Khan buffs refer to as urbicide. What other cities could benefit from a proper onscreen pasting? Toronto is another preening, self-infatuated city that has a huge chip on its shoulder. It&apos;s Brooklyn with More Ice. God, would I love to see that city get taken into the back alley for a good, long ass-kicking. Oh yes, in Godzilla 2, I&apos;d love to see Mothra and Ronin take this baby down. And then come back in Godzilla 3 to do it again. And then in Godzilla 4, just to show that they&apos;re serious about this, come back yet a fourth time and totally shred that fiercely annoying, self-worshipping yuppie metropolis. I know I&apos;ll be in the minority on this one, but I&apos;d also love to see\u00a0Edinburgh go down for the count. Twee, picture-perfect, pathologically self-congratulatory, Edinburgh is the kind of high-class tourist trap that could really benefit from a first-class pummeling, courtesy of some down-and-dirty extraterrestrials. Like Seattle and Austin and maybe even Seville, Edinburgh imagines itself as a world-class city. But\u00a0if it was really a city on a par with Berlin, Rome and New York, monsters would have stomped it decades ago. I would also love to see monsters, preferably from outer space, destroy cities on the silver screen that have already been destroyed in real life. They could call the film Re-Destroyers. Think of it as a weird brand of extraterrestrial urban renewal. Bloodthirsty drug cartels started the job in Trenton, Detroit and New Orleans; now Godzilla and Ronin are coming in to finish the job. I am not sure why I want this. Perhaps I am merely being ironic.           Some cities have unfairly been overlooked by the film industry. Amsterdam would be a perfect target for monsters. Ditto Cairo. I&apos;m sure there are even some second-tier cities \u2013 Marseille, Birmingham, Atlanta \u2013 that would actually pay film crews to pulverise their city on camera. On a personal note, one of my proudest moments as a film-goer was when I saw Philadelphia get totally jacked up by unpredictable zombies early in World War Z. As far as I can tell, my hometown had never been annihilated on the big screen and I was happy to see the City of Brotherly Love step up to the plate and get thumped like the big boys. Lots of people from second-tier cities probably feel the same way. Why don&apos;t weird creatures with thousands of tendrils ever take their anger out on Bristol? Or Liverpool? When was the last time monsters did a number on Oslo or Helsinki? And isn&apos;t it high time Reykjavik got a damned good thrashing? Finally, I know it&apos;s asking a lot, but I&apos;ve spent a lot of time in the Cotswolds, and I would be beholden to Hollywood if it would take out Stroud. And when I say &quot;take it out&quot;, I mean, take it out the right way. Take it out with extreme prejudice.

Reports of the tribute, made in April in a message Abe sent to an annual ceremony honouring war criminals at a Buddhist temple, only emerged this week and add to the strains on ties between Tokyo and Beijing. \u201cThe Japanese government needs to sincerely reflect on its history of aggression and make a clean break with militarism, that provides an important foundation for Japan to rebuild and develop relations with its Asian neighbours after the war,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said. \u201cWe urge Japan to abide to its commitment to post-war non-aggression and take practical action to win the trust of its Asian neighbours and the international community.\u201d Abe\u2019s message is expected to frustrate attempts to arrange a bilateral meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Apec summit in Beijing in November. Abe has not met Xi or his South Korean counterpart, Park Geun-hye, since becoming prime minister more than 18 months ago. The little-known ceremony at Koyasan temple in Wakayama, western Japan, is held every year before a monument to 1,180 war criminals, including Japan\u2019s wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo, one of 13 leaders sentenced to death as class A war criminals. The monument described the war crimes trial as \u201ca harsh and retaliatory trial never before seen in the world\u201d. Abe, who did not attend the ceremony, wrote: \u201cI humbly express my deepest sympathy for the martyrs who sacrificed their souls to become the foundation of peace and prosperity in Japan today. \u201cI hope for eternal peace and pledge to work toward a harmonious coexistence of mankind in the future.\u201d Many in China and South Korea will interpret the gesture as further evidence of Japan\u2019s lack of remorse over its wartime conduct on the Asian mainland. Abe provoked anger in China and South Korea in December 2013 when he visited the Yasukuni shrine, which honours almost 2.5 million Japanese who died in conflicts since the second half of the 19th century. Abe and other conservative politicians have questioned the convictions for crimes against humanity of Japan\u2019s former leaders by the international military tribunal for the far east. He has said that those convicted during the US-led allied occupation are not considered war criminals under domestic law. Kazuaki Naka, who organised the service at Koyasan temple, said more than 200 people had gathered at the cenotaph \u201cto console the souls of war dead, who sacrificed their lives for their home country, whether their executions were fair or unfair\u201d. The chief cabinet spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said Abe had sent the message in his capacity as head of the Liberal Democratic party and not as prime minister. \u201cAs such, the government thinks of [Abe] in this respect as a private citizen,\u201d Suga said, adding that Japan had accepted the judgement of the military tribunals when it signed the San Francisco peace treaty in 1951."}, {"sentences": ["In particular, in October 2013, Japan hosted a two-day OECD-GSF workshop in Tokyo, attended by representatives from 20 nations.", "Tateo Arimoto is director of the Innovation, Science and Technology Program of the Graduate Institute of Policy Studies, Tokyo."], "tags": ["Science policy", "Science", "Nuclear power", "Japan", "Politics", "Fukushima"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-28T20:25:01Z", "title": "Crisis, renewal and the prospects for science advice in Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2014/aug/29/crisis-renewal-and-the-prospects-for-science-advice-in-japan", "article": "Science plays a crucial role in the face of intractable problems, such as global warming, energy shortages, pandemics and large-scale technological accidents. But it is not easy for nations and international organisations to maintain effective systems for scientific advice. Sometimes, scientists can be exposed to political pressures; governments may not be able to identify the right experts; uncertainties accompanying scientific information may not be properly interpreted; and communication between scientists and policy makers can fail in times of crisis. Such problems were poignantly felt in Japan after the Great East Japan earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011. Many experts appeared in the media and spoke out about evacuation, food safety and other issues, but there was no mechanism to integrate their views for the benefit of the public and policymakers. At the same time, many people lost confidence in the words of scientists who were working closely with the government or the nuclear industry. Public trust in both science and policymaking was severely damaged. In the three years since these disasters hit Japan, politicians, government officials, prominent scientists, journalists and citizen representatives have had several opportunities to exchange views in a series of symposia on the prospects for scientific advice in Japan. These were organised by institutions such as the Science Council of Japan (SCJ, which is Japan\u2019s national academy of sciences), the Center for Research and Development Strategy (CRDS, a semi-public think-tank) at the Japan Science and Technology Agency, and the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS, an academic institution). Science advisers from overseas, including Sir John Beddington, the former UK government chief scientific adviser, and Bruce Alberts, the former president of the US National Academy of Sciences, joined those discussions. In the meantime, the Japanese government began moving forward with reform of the nation\u2019s scientific advisory structure. An expert study group issued a report in December 2011, calling for the appointment of science, technology and innovation advisers for the prime minister and other ministers. This report also called for a strengthening of the secretariat and think-tank functions of scientific advisory bodies, and for closer liaison between the government and the Science Council of Japan. In March 2012, one year after the cataclysm, CRDS issued a set of proposals for strengthening scientific advice in Japan. These included securing the independence of scientific advisers, ensuring transparency of the scientific advisory process, and proper handling of uncertainty and diversity of scientific views. While similar guidelines already existed in the UK, US and some other nations, CRDS\u2019s guidelines took into consideration Japan\u2019s particular political and cultural context, and factored in a wide range of stakeholders\u2019 views through workshops, symposia and personal exchanges. The Science Council of Japan also took action. In May 2012, it started discussing how to create new guidelines for scientific advice, taking notice of the principles proposed by CRDS. This resulted in January 2013, in SCJ\u2019s Statement on the Code of Conduct for Scientists, which included clauses on scientific advice and dialogue with society.  More recently, however, Japan\u2019s efforts at reconstructing its scientific advisory system have been losing momentum. The proposal to appoint new science advisers has not been acted upon, partly because of a change of government in Japan. The Council for Science and Technology Policy, the highest policy-making body in this field, has been busy launching new policies to boost innovation and revitalise Japan\u2019s economy, which seems a more urgent priority for Japan under the current administration. Hopefully, the Japanese government and scientific community will soon refocus their attention on issues of scientific advice and the relationships between science and society. We sit at a crossroads in modern science. A redefinition and reconstruction of science and society relations is an urgent task. And a critical aspect of that is to effectively mediate between science and policymaking. Failure to address these issues will impede wider efforts to rebuild public trust in science, and hold back other innovations to address social challenges. Meanwhile, international efforts to strengthen scientific advice have accelerated. In April 2013, the Global Science Forum of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established an expert group, co-chaired by the Netherlands, Japan, Germany and Italy, to examine the roles and responsibilities of scientists in policy-making. And in October 2013, the United Nations announced the creation of a Scientific Advisory Board for its Secretary General, with a first meeting taking place in Berlin in January 2014. Japan has participated in all of these international forums. In particular, in October 2013, Japan hosted a two-day OECD-GSF workshop in Tokyo, attended by representatives from 20 nations. It was agreed in the workshop that, while each nation\u2019s scientific advisory system depends on its historical and cultural contexts, international dialogue is extremely useful and beneficial in building common ground for scientific advice. The OECD Global Science Forum is now aiming to publish its report in early 2015. The result will be discussed at a ministerial meeting, to be held on 20-21 October 2015 in Korea. As well as discussing what constitutes a sound and effective scientific advisory system, the OECD report will deal with issues as scientific advice in crisis situations, the responsibility and legal liability of scientific advisory bodies and individuals, international collaboration in scientific advice, and the growing involvement of civil society in processes of scientific advice. All of these issues are also on the agenda at the Auckland summit on science advice, taking place this week. Such developments clearly indicate the international community\u2019s growing commitment to sound and effective scientific advice. This consensus will steadily propel individual nations and international organisations, such as the UN, to further improve that their scientific advisory systems. At the same time, the UN, OECD, the International Council for Science and other bodies should work towards global coordination mechanisms, a \u201csystem of systems for scientific advice\u201d. The need for such efforts will continue, as social and environmental challenges demand closer collaboration between scientists and policymakers on a global scale.

Plastic fantastic Cities around the world struggle to find attractive and innovative ways to encourage citizens to recycle. Beijing may have found the solution: the city is giving free train rides to people recycling plastic. Across the city, machines take your used water bottles, calculate their worth and issue a credit to your public transport pass. Fast Co Exist argue that the machine may be a good of way of raising awareness, but its impact is likely marginal. Going green in Beirut In Beirut, a green movement is growing. Aware of the city\u2019s severe lack of parks for a burgeoning population amid a boom in construction, activist Dima Boulad set up the Beirut Green Project, which has been spearheading public awareness campaigns about the need for green space \u2013 from city-wide installations to large events (they are also one of our Guardian Cities network of global city bloggers). The project publish the Beirut Green Guide, which identifies and maps all of Beirut\u2019s parks, even those that are run down and in need of a bit of attention.  It seems the municipal government is sitting up and taking notice but, as Citiscope reports, the money for opening and improving urban green spaces will need to come from private sources. Sanayeh Garden, newly opened this year, is one positive sign that this is slowly coming together.  City tweeters First we looked at the city that takes the most selfies (Manila, it turns out). But which city tweets the most? As CityMetric tells us, it\u2019s the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. Second and third places went to Tokyo and London \u2013 but Jakarta\u2019s top spot came as a surprise. Possible explanations include the fact that, depending on which statistics you read, Jakarta is the second largest city in the world. It is also one of the most densely populated and as a result, Jakartans apparently spend a lot of time in traffic jams. The perfect opportunity to tweet? We\u2019d rather not be stuck in traffic. Bio-cities  What will the bio-cities of tomorrow look like? Faced with depleting resources and excess waste, designers are now looking towards ecology to inspire more efficient systems of urban planning and living.  In an interview in Uncube magazine, urban designers ecoLogicStudio explain that we still rely on the logic of city \u201czoning\u201d, which may no longer be the best way forward for urban planning. While the zoned city originally \u201coperated like a large machine\u201d, our new understanding of machines has become more biological: \u201cit is a system that evolves.\u201d Sources of biological inspiration for urban design now include the communication systems of ants and the distribution systems of slime mould.  The magazine also discusses a project called Future Venice, in which \u201cprotocell\u201d technology is used to make the city more resilient to the elements, in a manner akin to a living organism. And the winning country for bike-shares is ... With over 400,000 shareable bikes, China boasts the largest and most-used bike share systems in the world. As Vox reports, the country has eight cities that have more shared bicycles than the entire US combined. There is also a fascinating and detailed bike-sharing world map where you can see all the systems around the world \u2013 successful and otherwise.

And India saw its manufacturing output chalk up the 10th straight month of expansion in\u00a0August. China ranks among the bad after its vast factory sector almost contracted in August. Firms blamed slackening foreign and domestic demand, though the beginnings of a crisis triggered by debt-fuelled consumer and business spending should also be considered. But chief among the uglies are the eurozone countries and Japan. Tokyo has suffered a slump since an increase in VAT to 8% earlier this year sparked a consumer spending strike. Output slumped more than 5% in the second quarter under the admittedly volatile annualised GDP measure. The manufacturing activity survey for the 18-member eurozone struck a similarly discordant note. Markit&apos;s August manufacturing PMI came in at 50.7, above the 50 points that mark expansion but the lowest level in over a year and well below July&apos;s 51.8. France dragged down the average, as did the Netherlands and Italy. Investors who have kept stock markets buoyant are betting on the European Central Bank (ECB) at least moving closer to quantitative easing to make credit even cheaper at its meeting on Thursday. Failing that, they expect Brussels to loosen the budget constraints on Paris and Rome, allowing them to invest and introduce structural reforms more painlessly (effectively giving them enough money to bribe reluctant or badly affected lobby groups). No doubt there will be a bit of both and neither will be effective, not least because German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is against both initiatives. He said last week that the ECB had run out of ways to help the currency zone. Only governments can spur growth, which he said they must do without running excessive deficits. &quot;Monetary policy can only buy time,&quot; he said. So Europe must rely on the German fetish for expansionary fiscal contraction \u2013 the idea that once big-spending government gets out of the way it stops crowding out the private sector. It is a theory that may work for small economies surrounded by fast-growing neighbours. But countries such as France and Italy, or Britain, export to each other and so their cuts in investment and welfare spending drag each other down.

Japan was forced to end its hunt in the Antarctic in March after the international court of justice (ICJ) in the Hague challenged Tokyo&apos;s contention that its annual pursuit of hundreds of whales in the area was necessary to conduct scientific research. The country&apos;s whaling fleet has sought to catch around 900 minke whales, and a much smaller number of fin and humpback whales, every winter after the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial whaling in 1986. The IWC&apos;s moratorium allowed meat from the hunts to be sold on the open market in Japan, where consumption of whale meat \u2013 once a rare source of protein, in the years after the second world war \u2013 has plummeted in recent decades. Environmental campaigners claim the &quot;scientific&quot; programme is a cover for commercial whaling. Having said they would abide by the UN court&apos;s ruling in March, Japanese officials are poised to submit a revised programme to the IWC&apos;s scientific committee in November. Japanese media quoted fisheries agency officials as saying that they would present a draft proposal at the IWC&apos;s general meeting in Slovenia this month and add the final touches, including catch quotas, in the following weeks. Reports said the hunts would probably involve catching fewer minke whales and no fin or humpback whales, as Japanese fisheries officials attempt to pass the &quot;scientific&quot; test set by the ICJ. The whaling fleet would collect &quot;data necessary to calculate the number of whale catch allowed&quot; after the eventual resumption of commercial whaling and &quot;construct a model of the Antarctic Ocean ecosystem,&quot; Agence France-Presse quoted an agency official as saying. Japan&apos;s whaling fleet came close to reaching its annual target of 935 minke whales in 2006, but catches have since slumped because of poor demand and confrontations with the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd. During the 2013-14 season, Japan took just 251 minke whales in the Antarctic \u2013 a quarter of its target. Any attempt by Japan to relaunch its Antarctic hunt is likely to meet with strong opposition from Australia and New Zealand, which were behind the legal challenge at the ICJ. The US, too, wants Tokyo to reconsider. &quot;We continue to view lethal scientific research as unnecessary in modern whale conservation and management,&quot; a state department official told Kyodo News on condition of anonymity. &quot;We encourage Japan to take this view into account when developing future research programmes.&quot; If it gets its way, the whaling fleet could be bound for the Antarctic by the end of next year. While the IWC&apos;s consent isn&apos;t a legal requirement to resume the hunts, Japan will struggle to gain international understanding unless it can win broad agreement among the IWC&apos;s 88 member countries, 49 of which regularly oppose whaling. \u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 4 September 2014 to correct the location of the IWC&apos;s general meeting."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I heard economic hardship was the main reason, but really, for anyone who is gay or lesbian or has mental health issues, life in North Korea is really tough,&quot; said Sandra Fahy, assistant professor at Sophia University in Tokyo and author of the forthcoming monogrpah Marching Through Suffering: Loss, Survival and North Korea."], "tags": ["North Korea", "World Health Organisation", "South Korea", "Society", "Suicide rates", "Health", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-04T14:44:00Z", "title": "North Korea's suicide rate among worst in world, says WHO report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/04/north-korea-suicide-rate-among-worst-world-who-report", "article": "South Korea&apos;s problem with suicide has been well documented.

The report, entitled Preventing Suicide: A Global Imperative, estimates that in 2012, 9,790 suicides took place in North Korea, with roughly equal numbers of males and females killing themselves. The report acknowledged that acquiring data was difficult, and that it had arrived at its North Korean estimate by factoring in a range of statistically predictive factors. Analysts say North Koreans may be driven to suicide by poverty, and the psychological stress of living in a restrictive environment. &quot;I heard economic hardship was the main reason, but really, for anyone who is gay or lesbian or has mental health issues, life in North Korea is really tough,&quot; said Sandra Fahy, assistant professor at Sophia University in Tokyo and author of the forthcoming monogrpah Marching Through Suffering: Loss, Survival and North Korea. The director of research and strategy at Liberty in North Korea, Sokeel Park, said some deaths reported as suicides could have been people who died while in state custody. &quot;It might be like in East Germany under the Stasi, where if someone died during an interrogation or while detained they just called it a suicide,&quot; Park said. The WHO&apos;s findings do not align with a paper released last year by the Unification Medical Centre at Seoul National University, which found that suicide was rare in North Korea, in part because people who take their own lives are labelled traitors and put surviving family members at risk of punishment. The study was based on interviews with three doctors who fled the North and now live in South Korea. In North Korea, punishment can extend to three generations of the accused&apos;s family. Fahy says North Korean escapees have told her of entire families killing themselves to avoid collective punishment. Financial hardship is a common motivator for suicide. South Korea&apos;s suicide rate began climbing around the economic crisis of the late 1990s and has continued to increase. Many who take their own lives had expressed hopelessness in a society that has stiff competition for a limited number of white-collar jobs. Experts also point to taboos about seeking assistance. A psychiatrist at the National Medical Centre in Seoul, Kim Hyun-chung, said: &quot;Koreans are reluctant to speak openly about their problems out of fear of being considered weak or unstable, and that just makes their situations worse.&quot; The objective of the WHO report is &quot;to increase the awareness of the public health significance of suicide and suicide attempts and to make suicide prevention a higher priority on the global public health agenda&quot;. In North Korea, mental health care is scarce and suicide is among the many negative aspects of society that the government tries to keep quiet domestically, and hidden from the outside world. &quot;North Korean media tends to use the high suicide rate in the South as proof to show off the superiority of their social system, and they barely mention North Koreans taking their own lives,&quot; Park Sang-min, the professor who led the Unification Medical Centre study, told Yonhap News Agency."}, {"sentences": ["Ducasse, who has restaurants around the world including Tokyo, New York and London (at the Dorchester hotel), and several in Paris including the Jules Verne in the Eiffel Tower, said the basic dishes would focus on &quot;fish, cereal and vegetables \u00a0\u2026 presented in an exceptional way&quot;."], "tags": ["Vegetarian food and drink", "Seafood", "Food & drink", "France", "Europe", "World news", "Life and style", "Vegetarianism"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-05T12:32:00Z", "title": "France's top chef Alain Ducasse reduces amount of meat on the menu", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/05/france-chef-alain-ducasse-bans-meat", "article": "As any vegetarian visiting Paris will know, the French do like their meat.

Last week, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said it would not contend a court ruling ordering it to pay almost $500,000 in compensation to the family of a woman who killed herself two months after being forced to flee her home near the plant. That claim, which could pave the way for similar suits, has been followed by a unprecedented attempt by four Fukushima Daiichi workers to sue the utility for unpaid wages. The two former and two current workers, aged in their 30s to 60s, claim that Tepco and its contractors failed to ensure they were paid mandatory hazard allowances, on top of their regular wages. In the first legal challenge of its kind against Tepco, the four men, who are not named and wore masks in court for fear of reprisals from their employers, are seeking $600,000 in unpaid wages from Tepco and several of its partner firms. The men&apos;s lawyer said he believed more could follow among the 6,000 workers \u2013 most of whom work for contractors \u2013 involved in the dangerous 40-year operation to decommission the plant. &quot;A year ago, the prime minister told the world that Fukushima was under control. But that&apos;s not the case,&quot; Tsuguo Hirota told Reuters. &quot;Workers are not getting promised hazard pay and skilled workers are leaving. It&apos;s becoming a place for amateurs only, and that has to worry anyone who lives near the plant.&quot; The hazardous nature of work to control the flow of radioactive water, and to prepare damaged reactors for the removal of melted nuclear fuel prompted Tepco to announce late last year that it would double daily danger money payments to $200 per worker. But labourers employed by some of the 800 firms involved in decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi say the extra cash is being withheld by contractors and subcontractors, which claim they need the extra cash to keep their businesses afloat. &quot;My health could suffer one day \u2026 I believe there are many people who can&apos;t speak out about this kind of problem,&quot; one of the workers told public broadcaster NHK. &quot;I may get fired or may be given no more work.

Nintendo brought in a whole new audience with its highly accessible Wii in 2006, and Microsoft loudly muscled into the market with the Xbox in 2001. But it\u2019s arguably Sony\u2019s multifarious PlayStation machines that have been the primary force in growing the industry. With 150m sales, PlayStation 2 was the biggest console of all time. PlayStation 4, launched last November, is currently on 10m and selling faster than all its predecessors.  The world is, however, very different from when the first PlayStation launched 20 years ago. In the fragmented 21st century, mobiles, tablets and social networks have emerged as major gaming platforms. There\u2019s a question mark over whether the latest Sony machine can really define a space for itself. The person with the most responsibility for ensuring that it does is Andrew House. The president and group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, he\u2019s the big boss of Sony\u2019s entire PlayStation operation. Yet he doesn\u2019t come across as the archetypal CEO, and is certainly more hands-on. It was House who brought in the veteran games developer Mark Cerny to design the PlayStation 4, and House who had to decide on the inclusion of two key elements: a hard disk drive, and 8gb of system memory rather than the previously mooted 4gb. According to Cerny\u2019s calculations, each of these could add $1bn to the PlayStation 4\u2019s manufacturing costs. Both went in.  House still recalls the deliberations: \u201cThe balance of the discussion was Mark advocating for the voice of the developer, and the consumer experience that he could deliver. I had to offset that with some fiscal responsibility. I basically felt that the memory increase was a slam-dunk. It was articulated very well by Mark as to what it was going to do for the majority of PlayStation 4 game experiences.  \u201cIn essence, we were placing a little bit of a bet that we were going to be good at reducing costs on the hardware and finding other trade-offs and offsets.\u201d 20 years of PlayStation House was born in Wales, and spent his formative years at state school in Weston-super-Mare. In the early 1990s, he moved out to Tokyo to teach English but later found himself working for Sony\u2019s international PR department. He joined the nascent PlayStation division and found himself at the sharp end of Sony\u2019s marketing drive to bring games to an older audience.  \u201cMy memories are about getting involved with the project even prior to launch \u2013 when it was still a nascent little thing, and nobody was sure whether it would go anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the big turning point for me was the launch of PlayStation 2, where we had this sense that it was moving games out of this position as a kid\u2019s toy and more into the entertainment mainstream.\u201d Emulating the PS2 PlayStation 2 is the biggest selling home console ever made; it\u2019s understandable that House wants to emulate that success with the PlayStation 4, the first iteration that is very much his baby. He\u2019s aware of the ever-mutating nature of the console business \u2013 that there are now a lot more devices that consumers can play games on, from phones to set-top boxes. But he believes the new machine could even outdo the PS2.  \u201cSo far, so good,\u201d he says simply. \u201cWe\u2019re significantly outpacing the ramp-up on PS2 to date. The PS4 is a much more fully-fledged general entertainment box, which I think increases its mass appeal. Analysts ask me about life-cycle comparisons. I always answer very honestly: that it\u2019s tough to calculate, because there have been several major shifts since the PlayStation 2, all of which can pull in different directions.  \u201cWith the PS2, we were pretty much unable to have any kind of business in Latin America or most of the Asian markets, because of piracy, but the PlayStation 3 got us to the point where we can actually have a healthy software business there. We\u2019ve had recent positive signs around China and our ability to launch PlayStation 4 there as well \u2013 that didn\u2019t exist on previous life-cycles.\u201d Consoles and the 21st century With the PlayStation 4 now successfully launched, Sony can start thinking about the peripheral technologies and services that are de rigueur for any console in the 21st century. PlayStation 4 owners are particularly keen to start using PlayStation Now, an online service which will allow them to stream PS3 games to their console over the Internet. A recent US trial trial of the system drew some negative press due to its rental pricing model that charged users $2.99 for just four hours of play. Sony said the model was experimental, but this is a whole new area for House to navigate. \u201cConsumer satisfaction levels with the streaming quality and low latency have been very, very good,\u201d says House. \u201cBut it does depend on the strength of your connection. We\u2019ve been very clear in our messaging, saying if it\u2019s not working for you, these are the reasons why. Fortunately, such issues have arisen in a very, very small minority of cases, and we\u2019re already, looking at ways we can iterate and make that a better experience.  \u201cThe other area for experimentation has been more around the business model itself. People were doing comparisons between the rental price and the purchase price. What we didn\u2019t do a good enough job of communicating was that the rental price had all of the downloadable content associated with the game as well, so it wasn\u2019t a fair equation. But this is why we\u2019re in beta: learning as we go along.\u201d What about the content itself? \u201cIt\u2019s going to be PS3-based mainly, but I think there is the opportunity, via emulation, to then offer up a broader catalogue of PlayStation 2 and even PlayStation content where appropriate,\u201d he says.  Apparently, there is no firm launch date yet \u2013 Sony is seeking to build a viable service in the US before expanding elsewhere. And PS4 is only one platform that the PS Now service will run on. \u201cThe exciting thing for me is not delivering PlayStation 3 experiences to a PlayStation 4, but delivering them to a smart TV,\u201d says House. \u201cThe next frontier of engagement for us is going to be with the TV manufacturers.\u201d Morpheus rising Then there\u2019s Project Morpheus, the prototype virtual reality headset for the PlayStation 4, which will allow gamers to inhabit games rather than view them on television screens. Virtual reality floundered as a consumer proposition in the early 90s, mostly because the technology wasn\u2019t advanced enough to produce a convincing experience. However, the hype surrounding the Oculus Rift VR headset for the PC, which has received millions in investor funding and has sold over 100,000 development kits, has thrust it back into the technological limelight.  In his keynote at this summer\u2019s Develop gaming conference, House said that virtual reality has reached a \u201cTipping point.\u201d Strikingly, few of the early Project Morpheus demos \u2013 which include street-luging and being suspended in a virtual shark cage \u2013 don\u2019t feel like conventional game experiences. Is that what we can expect from the technology? \u201cThey could be short, but very compelling and intense \u2013 get in, get out experiences,\u201d says House. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of interest from the movie studios \u2013 not necessarily in replicating a film experience, but even developing a sort of promotional tool for an upcoming film, which gives you a sense of what that movie is going to be.\u201d So how is Sony managing the development of this new platform? \u201cWe\u2019re getting to grips with the nuts and bolts of the hardware itself, and doing things like reducing any sense of nausea and so on,\u201d says House. \u201cWhat you\u2019re experiencing right now is not the final product. The benefit of engaging with a wide range of developers this early is that we\u2019re all learning together. I think it\u2019s important to open up to the broadest range of what those experiences could be, because that could create excitement for the platform overall. But as we move towards productisation and launch, we\u2019ll narrow that down in the more traditional way.\u201d \u201cI see my role as trying to strike a balance between the health of our company [Sony Computer Entertainment] and contributing to the health of the business [Sony as a whole]. We\u2019ve got to have a really good business in the here-and-now, but also be placing some bets on where we think technology could take us.\u201d Making TV for PS4 Although they\u2019re 20 years apart, House sees similarities in the way that the original PlayStation and the new PS4 represent key transitions for the games industry. The first machine switched from expensive game cartridges to much cheaper and more versatile CDs; the PlayStation 4 era is moving away from \u201cboxed products\u201d altogether toward the digital distribution of games. \u201cWe have a networked audience that has now reached scale,\u201d says House. \u201cFor me, that has been the defining shift between PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. We\u2019ve got something like 52 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network. When I put that audience in front of Sony Pictures it blew them away.\u201d Armed with that audience, House is taking a similar plunge to the likes of Netflix and Amazon, and has commissioned an original TV series for the PlayStation Network called Powers \u2013 based on a series of Marvel comics, it will be available free to PS Plus subscribers. Twenty years after the launch of PlayStation, Sony retains the experimental approach to the industry; back then it was marketing to twenty-somethings and putting games on CDs, now it\u2019s virtual reality and TV. But it seems the underlying philosophy remains: give it a try, but concentrate on quality. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to go charging out there with a raft of reality-based content and different kinds of shows,\u201d says House. \u201cTV content is new and experimental for us, but we\u2019ll make something that people will watch and talk about, and then we\u2019ll see where we\u2019ll take it.\u201d   Why has the PlayStation 4 been so successful?

Widespread anti-nuclear sentiment has simmered in Japan ever since an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused meltdowns at the Fukushima power plant, sparking the worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl. The country&apos;s nuclear reactors were switched off after the catastrophe. Two reactors were briefly restarted last year but all of Japan&apos;s nuclear plants are currently offline. The go-ahead from the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) for two reactors at the Sendai plant in southern Japan comes after it issued a more than 400-page safety report in July and follows a month-long public consultation period. But any restart is unlikely before the year end as the operator, Kyushu Electric Power, is also required to get two more NRA approvals for other facilities at the site. More challenging, perhaps, is gaining the consent of communities living near the plant in south-western Kagoshima prefecture, who must sign off on the restarts before they can happen. Much of the job of convincing a sceptical public will fall on the shoulders of new industry minister Yuko Obuchi. &quot;If people say they are worried, I think it is only natural. If you are a mother, I think it is a kind of feeling that everyone has,&quot; Obuchi said soon after being appointed as Japan&apos;s first female industry minister. &quot;The central government must offer a full explanation to these sentiments.&quot; Obuchi has highlighted the importance of earning the &quot;understanding of hosting communities&quot; who may be hostile to the prospect of firing up nearby reactors, despite beefed up safety rules. The minister has reportedly dispatched five central government officials to help local bodies in Kagoshima draw up evacuation plans in case of an accident. Communities living right next door to nuclear plants, who often enjoy grants from utility companies and depend on the power stations for employment, are frequently sympathetic to restarts. However, there is often hostility from those living further afield who enjoy no direct benefits but see themselves as in the firing line in the event of another accident like Fukushima. Greenpeace Japan, which is campaigning for Tokyo to abandon nuclear power completely, said the government of the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, appeared to be glossing over the last year, in which Japan has survived without nuclear power. &quot;The government\u00a0\u2026 is ignoring the lessons of Fukushima and attempting to prevent the renewable energy revolution, trying to take the nation back to its dependence on dangerous and unreliable nuclear power,&quot; said Kazue Suzuki for the organisation. Abe has been trying to persuade a wary public that the world&apos;s third largest economy must return to an energy source that once supplied more than a quarter of its power. Obuchi visited Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant on Sunday, wearing a protective jacket and face mask to observe work at the crippled facility."}, {"sentences": ["The records cite a 2006 newspaper article in which a palace official is quoted in a memo as saying that Hirohito had been displeased by the earlier decision to enshrine class-A war criminals at Yasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo that honours Japan&apos;s war dead."], "tags": ["Japan", "Second world war", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US news", "Biography", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-10T14:52:00Z", "title": "Japan: Hirohito warned attack on Pearl Harbor would be 'self-destructive'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/japan-emperor-hirohito-pearl-harbor-attack-biography", "article": "Japan&apos;s wartime emperor, Hirohito, congratulated his forces on victories as the country made a brutal sweep across mainland Asia but warned that an attack on the US would be &quot;self-destructive&quot;, according to a new biography. The first official record of Hirohito&apos;s thinking during a tumultuous period in Japan&apos;s history, released by the imperial household agency this week, offers a largely sympathetic view of the monarch, whose 62-year reign spanned his country&apos;s descent into militarism, its wartime defeat and its dramatic postwar economic development. Hirohito was alarmed by political leaders&apos; intentions in the runup to the December 1941 surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, according to the biography, describing the prospect of conflict with the US as a &quot;reckless war&quot; that would make him &quot;deeply sorry for my imperial ancestors&quot;. He had expressed similar doubts about the &quot;predisposition&quot; of army leaders who waged war in China in the 1930s, but he celebrated victories by troops who fought in his name. After Japanese troops invaded the Chinese city of Nanking (now Nanjing) in 1937, slaughtering tens of thousands of civilians, Hirohito said he was &quot;deeply satisfied&quot; by the troops&apos; courage in quickly seizing the city. The annals contain details of how the city was besieged, but make no mention of the atrocities, Japanese media said. The 12,000-page biography of Hirohito, posthumously known as the Showa Emperor (&quot;enlightened peace&quot;), took 24 years to compile at a cost of 230m yen (\u00a31.34m). But the records, released to selected members of the Japanese media before general publication, failed to settle the longrunning debate over the extent of Hirohito&apos;s involvement in the decisions that ultimately led to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Japan&apos;s surrender in August 1945. Some historians insist that as a revered demi-god and commander in chief of the imperial forces, he bore responsibility for Japan&apos;s actions in the 1930s and 40s. Others insist that, despite his status, key decisions were taken by military leaders. The Mainichi Shimbun, a liberal newspaper, said the records simply confirmed the established narrative of Hirohito&apos;s reign. It &quot;hardly contained anything new that reverses conventional wisdom and history&quot;, the paper said in an editorial. &quot;We must keep asking ourselves why that catastrophic war could not be avoided. That question is hardly resolved.&quot; Other commentators speculated that the biography was still incomplete and wondered how much material had been omitted by the imperial household agency. Hirohito&apos;s subjects had never heard him speak until he announced Japan&apos;s defeat in a four-minute radio address on 15 August 1945. According to the records, the leader of the US occupation, Gen Douglas MacArthur, is quoted as saying that Hirohito had told him during their first meeting on 27 September that year that he accepted &quot;sole responsibility&quot; for Japan&apos;s wartime conduct. Hirohito was informed of the bombing of Hiroshima almost 12 hours after the city was flattened. Two days later, the records say, he was convinced that it had &quot;become impossible to continue the war&quot; and hoped the conflict would end &quot;as swiftly as possible&quot;. Despite calls for Hirohito to be tried as a war criminal, the US occupation authorities allowed him to remain on the Chrysanthemum throne to ensure political stability amid fears of communist influence. He renounced his divinity, but remained a potent national symbol until his death in 1989. The records cite a 2006 newspaper article in which a palace official is quoted in a memo as saying that Hirohito had been displeased by the earlier decision to enshrine class-A war criminals at Yasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo that honours Japan&apos;s war dead. The memo, however, is not included in the newly published material, and no mention is made of Hirohito&apos;s own comments on the Yasukuni issue.

Japan&apos;s nuclear watchdog on Wednesday gave the green light for two nuclear reactors at Kyushu Electric Power&apos;s Sendai plant in south-west Japan to restart, but communities are anxious over the safety aspects. The nuclear industry in Japan has been mothballed since the meltdown. At a temporary housing complex in Fukushima prefecture one resident, Iiko Kanno, said she now spends her days reading, growing vegetables and counting the days until she is reunited with her grandchildren. As with many of her neighbours, Kanno&apos;s family has been torn apart by the nuclear meltdown, which happened in March 2011. &quot;It wasn&apos;t until about a month after the nuclear disaster that we got the order to evacuate,&quot; Kanno said of her contaminated former home, Iitate, a picturesque, but now abandoned, village 24 miles north-west of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. &quot;Our family&apos;s vegetable farm was worthless, and we were told it was no longer safe to stay in Iitate.&quot; Most of Iitate&apos;s 6,000 residents stayed in the village after the disaster, convinced they were safe since their homes were outside the 12-mile (20km) evacuation zone imposed by the government. The local authorities did not order an evacuation until several weeks later, after a radiation expert discovered multiple radioactive hotspots at levels higher than those considered safe for human habitation. About 150 residents ended up in the temporary complex on the outskirts of Fukushima city, living in cramped wooden lodges surrounded by cherry, peach and apple trees. Three and a half years after the disaster, Iitate remains uninhabited, apart from decontamination workers and residents desperate to save their irradiated farms. In spending her twilight years in imposed isolation, and with little prospect of returning to her hometown, Kanno, 78, is far from alone among the estimated 120,000 people from the Fukushima area who continue to live in nuclear limbo. A survey conducted this year by the prefectural government found that almost half of the households forced to evacuate were living apart, while almost 70% had relatives suffering from physical and mental health problems. Of the total, 48.9% of households said family members were living in two or more locations. Of that number, 58.6% said relatives who had once lived together had been scattered across three or more sites. In the same survey, 67.5% of households said they had relatives who were showing signs of physical or psychological distress. More than half of those afflicted said they had lost interest in activities they once enjoyed or that they had trouble sleeping. Kanno&apos;s plight is typical of many Fukushima families who lived together in large rural homes before the disaster. Her husband and mother died in the 12 months before north-east Japan was struck by the magnitude 9.0 earthquake, which triggered a tsunami that killed almost 19,000 people and caused the world&apos;s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. Her 43-year-old son, Futoshi, moved to Saitama, near Tokyo, with his wife and their young son. &quot;In Iitate it was normal for three generations of the same family to live under one roof,&quot; she said. &quot;My son initially found work in Fukushima city, but he and his wife didn&apos;t want to bring up their children in an area with high radiation. They won&apos;t bring him here to see me, so I only get to see them at the new year and on other special occasions.&quot; Her daughter and three other grandchildren, who lived in a nearby town in Fukushima, are now some distance away, in Niigata prefecture. Her daughter&apos;s husband, a teacher, still works in Fukushima and commutes to his family&apos;s new home every weekend. For people of Kanno&apos;s generation, the prospect of playing next to no part in her grandchildren&apos;s upbringing is almost unimaginable. &quot;If we had been able to stay in Iitate we would all be living together now,&quot; she says. &quot;I was practically brought up by my grandparents, and my parents helped raise my children. But radiation has made that impossible now.&quot; Kanno was depressed for months after the accident, and is still unable to sleep without medication. &quot;If I don&apos;t take it, I lie awake gazing at my grandson&apos;s photo, wondering how much I&apos;ll get to see of him before he&apos;s an adult.&quot;     Workers constructing an ice wall at the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011. Photograph: Kimimasa Mayama/AFP/Getty    Iitate&apos;s mayor, Norio Kanno, has vowed that decontamination work will make the village inhabitable again, possibly by 2016. But residents say the problem of cleaning the village&apos;s mountainous terrain, which sends radioactive particles into residential areas below after rainfall, makes that unlikely. So far only a few hundred people from two districts on the eastern edge of the evacuation zone have been given permission to return permanently. &quot;It could be years before we can return, so families had to make a tough choice,&quot; says Hanako Hasegawa, an Iitate resident who helps at a drop-in centre for evacuees. Her husband makes brief returns to clean the home they once shared with their children and grandchildren, while other residents have seen their abandoned homes become overrun with mould and vermin. &quot;People who go back return saying it&apos;s a sad place to be now,&quot; says Hasegawa. &quot;Yet they still go back to weed the garden and tidy homes they will probably never live in.&quot; The once close-knit residents are now part of Japan&apos;s nuclear diaspora. Most stay in parts of Fukushima prefecture not affected by the evacuation order; the remainder are scattered among all but two of Japan&apos;s 46 other prefectures, according to village records. Four have made new lives overseas. Hasegawa, whose family ran a dairy farm, are dispersed across four locations. Typically, fathers leave in search of work and children move out of Fukushima with their mothers, while grandparents stay put, reluctant to venture far from their hometowns near the end of their lives. The average age of the residents of this temporary housing complex is 66; of those in their 70s and 80s, about 20 are living alone. &quot;If my son didn&apos;t bring my granddaughter here, I would never get to see her,&quot; Hasegawa says. &quot;There are lots of older people here in the same situation. Younger members of the family come for special occasions, like festivals and sports days, then leave straight after.&quot; Kanno and her neighbours keep fit with morning calisthenics, and try to maintain community ties fractured by the events at Fukushima Daiichi, a two-hour drive away, with tea afternoons, craft workshops and coach trips. &quot;The nuclear accident turned everything upside down,&quot; she said. &quot;Even if the evacuation order is lifted, no young people or children will go back. We have asked everyone \u2013 the village office, decontamination workers, environment ministry bureaucrats \u2013 when it will be safe to return. But no one can give us an answer.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["I offer profound apologies to our readers and people at Tokyo Electric Power.&quot; Yoshida died of throat cancer last year, aged 58."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Newspapers", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "Fukushima", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment", "Second world war"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-12T13:51:41Z", "title": "Japanese newspaper apologises over Fukushima and sex slave errors", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/12/japanese-newspaper-apologises-fukushima-sex-slave-errors-asahi-shimbun", "article": "One of Japan&apos;s leading newspapers has been forced into a climbdown over serious errors in articles about two of the most contentious issues in the country: the Fukushima nuclear disaster and the use of wartime sex slaves. Executives at the Asahi Shimbun, a left-leaning daily whose morning edition has a circulation of 7.6m, said the newspaper&apos;s executive editor, Nobuyuki Sugiura, would be dismissed and other staff severely punished. The newspaper retracted a 20 May article in which it claimed that about 650 Tepco workers at Fukushima Daiichi, 90% of staff, had defied an order by the plant&apos;s then manager, Masao Yoshida, to stay and make a last-ditch effort to regain control of the reactors in the days after the earthquake and tsunami hit in 2011. The article, citing leaked testimony from Yoshida, claimed that the workers fled to the nearby Fukushima Daini nuclear facility three days into the crisis, as the pressure and temperature inside one of the damaged reactors reached dangerous levels. But Yoshida&apos;s testimony before the government panel, which was released this week, contradicts the paper&apos;s claim. He said that although he had not asked workers to evacuate to Fukushima Daini, he thought it had been &quot;perfectly reasonable&quot; for them to go to the site, 6 miles (10km) away. The Asahi&apos;s president, Tadakazu Kimura, told a packed press conference that an internal investigation had found the article to be incorrect. &quot;We have caused significant damage to the trust our readers place in us,&quot; he said. Kimura, who said he would decide on his own future at the paper at a later date, attributed the error to the reporters&apos; &quot;mistaken assumptions and insufficient checking. I offer profound apologies to our readers and people at Tokyo Electric Power.&quot; Yoshida died of throat cancer last year, aged 58. Doctors said his illness had not been caused by exposure to radiation. In his testimony, given over several months from July 2011 and running to 400 pages, Yoshida said that although non-essential workers were encouraged to go home, he and other Tepco officials at the plant had always intended to retain a skeleton staff to tackle the crisis. That version appeared to be challenged in testimony given by the government&apos;s spokesman at the time, Yukio Edano, who told the same panel that Tepco&apos;s then president, Masataka Shimizu, had called him and mentioned a possible withdrawal. &quot;I don&apos;t clearly remember [his] exact words \u2026 but I&apos;m sure it was about a complete withdrawal,&quot; Edano said, according to a translation by Kyodo. Yoshida was scathing about senior Tepco executives and politicians, whom he accused of failing to grasp the gravity of the situation and of causing confusion. The Asahi&apos;s claims about fleeing Tepco workers were repeated by the international media. Other Japanese newspapers claimed their interpretation of Yoshida&apos;s leaked comments on the evacuation differed significantly from those of the Asahi. The Asahi recently admitted that articles it ran in the 1980s and 90s on the diplomatically explosive subject of Japan&apos;s use of sex slaves before and during the second world war were also false. The articles were based on the testimony of Seiji Yoshida, a former soldier who claimed he had witnessed women from the South Korean island of Jeju being abducted to work as sex slaves in military brothels. Seiji Yoshida, who died in 2000, has been discredited by independent investigations by academics and other newspapers. Despite issuing a retraction earlier this summer, the Asahi came under pressure to issue a public apology. &quot;I apologise to readers for publishing the erroneous articles and being too late in making the correction,&quot; Kimura said on Friday. While Seiji Yoshida&apos;s false testimony does not in itself disprove the existence of tens of thousands of mainly Korean wartime sex slaves, the Asahi&apos;s errors have encouraged historical revisionists who insist the women were not forced to work in frontline brothels. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who has voiced doubts that the women were coerced, said erroneous reporting of the issue had &quot;caused agony to many people and damaged Japan&apos;s international reputation&quot;. Speaking on a radio programme, Abe added: &quot;Generally speaking, media reports have significant influence inside and outside the country and sometimes dishonour our country.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The arrogance of space By photographing and analysing road junctions in Paris, Calais and Tokyo, Copenhagenize has produced illuminating graphics on exactly how much space of our cities is dominated by cars \u2013 and what relatively little infrastructure is dedicated to pedestrians and cyclists.", "Only in Tokyo, where larger road crossings are prevalent, do we see the humble pedestrian rebalancing the ratio.", "As Fast Co Exist explains, one researcher claims to have done just this: by tracking mobile data in Tokyo on the day of the devastating 2011 earthquake, Xuan Song has mapped the movements of people after the disaster struck."], "tags": ["City transport", "City apps", "Cities", "Brazil", "Society", "Communities", "Apps", "Technology", "Photography", "Heritage", "Japan", "Road safety", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-12T16:34:45Z", "title": "Brazilians are writing their own bus stop signs \u2013 and it's working", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/12/crowdsourcing-better-bus-stops-in-brazil", "article": "The week\u2019s best city stories explore \u201czombie\u201d streetcars in San Francisco, bus-stop stickers in Porto Alegre and the restoration of deserted Rust Belt train station terminals.

Better Brazilian bus stops Maddeningly, Porto Alegre\u2019s bus stops tend to lack proper signage and information. Now a group of frustrated residents have responded creatively to the problem: they have started an initiative called Que \u00d4nibus Passa Aqui? (\u201cWhich Bus Stops Here?\u201d), in which they put stickers on the bus stops on which users can write information about which buses stop there \u2013 for the benefit of everyone.  As Pop-Up City describes, the collaborative idea has now spread beyond Porto Alegre to 20 other cities, as well as attracting the participation of a graphic design company to mass-produce stickers. It may not be a permanent solution, but it shows how citizens can come together to improve their cities in a fun and creative way. \u2018Zombie\u2019 streetcars  On San Francisco\u2019s southern waterfront lies a yard for derelict streetcars awaiting their fate: deconstruction, or restoration. Dating from the 1940s and 1950s, some of the carriages are still covered in original signs about how to buy tickets or admonishments about good behaviour; others are completely taken over by graffiti. This photo gallery of the streetcars is a visual treat, and reveals the history of this well-loved form of public transport in San Francisco. Many of the streetcars do find use again, and instead of being reimagined or reappropriated, actually return to their former glory as functional transit on the city streets. Terminal condition In most capital cities, you\u2019d be hard pressed to imagine the bustling main train stations as vacant, ghostly structures. But in Rust Belt cities like Buffalo, Detroit and Cincinnati, grand urban train stations have been deserted for decades, attracting dust and vandalism as the cities have emptied of people or changed their transport patterns. Nevertheless, as Belt Mag discusses, there is new momentum to revive these stations, with projects pushed forward by non-profit organisations such as Buffalo\u2019s Central Terminal Restoration Corporation. A team of volunteers clean and look after Buffalo\u2019s station; the concourse is being used as a temporary events space; and funding is slowly being gathered to repair the building. The project demonstrates the grassroots commitment to protect local heritage. The final use of the restored building, however, remains unsure. Though it could in theory still function as a train station, no trains will actually be arriving, so lots of other ideas are on the cards: from a casino or housing complex to an unusual football stadium. The arrogance of space By photographing and analysing road junctions in Paris, Calais and Tokyo, Copenhagenize has produced illuminating graphics on exactly how much space of our cities is dominated by cars \u2013 and what relatively little infrastructure is dedicated to pedestrians and cyclists. Only in Tokyo, where larger road crossings are prevalent, do we see the humble pedestrian rebalancing the ratio. Mobility in an earthquake Disaster relief in cities could be more effective if it could predict where exactly people will go in the event of an earthquake. As Fast Co Exist explains, one researcher claims to have done just this: by tracking mobile data in Tokyo on the day of the devastating 2011 earthquake, Xuan Song has mapped the movements of people after the disaster struck. The result is a pulsing, glowing visualisation that certainly looks pretty \u2013 but to what extent can a reliable model for prediction be formed from one event? Crashes? There\u2019s an app for that A new app called Bikeshield promises to alert drivers to nearby or approaching cyclists and motorcyclists before they can even be seen. The idea is to avoid crashes and collisions and improve road safety. What could be better? Unfortunately, as CityMetric reports, there is a drawback: for the alerts to work, both car driver and cyclist need to have it installed. Perhaps one day this sort of system will be widespread, but for now, drivers will just have to rely on that age-old trick: driving carefully.

If, as seems increasingly likely, political and industry leaders in Tokyo and Canberra can agree on terms, the Japanese submarines would be Australia\u2019s first major strategic defence procurement from an Asian power and would significantly boost the country\u2019s regional maritime power. The purchase stands squarely at the crossroads of government foreign policy and naval defence strategy, defence budget management, naval shipbuilding and maintenance policy, defence industry investment and employment policy, national economic management, domestic electoral considerations and residual hostilities over Japanese actions during the second world war. Moreover, the issue coincides with the preparation of the Abbott government\u2019s first defence white paper, its first defence industry policy statement and its so-called first principles review, which is looking at the future of defence procurement by the Defence Materiel Organisation. Indications are that the submarine purchase may be announced before these are released, raising questions about their policy relevance. A Japanese submarine purchase by Australia would further cement increasingly close defence ties between Australia and Japan, but would outrage the Chinese government, which the Australian government is reluctant to offend for fear of economic retaliation. Chinese leaders cling to and exploit memories of China\u2019s suffering at Japanese hands and reflexively accuse Japan and its western allies of wanting to \u201ccontain\u201d China. Depending on where the Japanese submarines were built, assembled and maintained, the project could be the death-knell for the Australian naval shipbuilding industry, which has pinned its hopes on government support for mainly Australian design, construction and maintenance of the submarines at the government-owned ASC yard near Adelaide.     Opposition Leader Bill Shorten addresses a workers rally at the ASC naval shipbuilding headquarters in Adelaide. Photograph: Michael Ramsey/AAPImage    Large numbers of defence industry jobs could be at stake in marginal electorates, especially in South Australia; further jobs would not be created and naval shipbuilding skills would suffer. The electoral consequences could threaten the Abbott government\u2019s parliamentary majority \u2013 especially since the purchase would be seen as another broken promise. The government\u2019s official (but fast-shifting) position is that it will announce no decision until the second half of next year when it releases the defence white paper. The defence minister, David Johnston, says the government is still talking to Swedish, German, French and Spanish submarine builders also interested in a share of Australia\u2019s program. The plans to replace the current fleet of six Collins-class submarines from the mid-2020s with up to 12 new submarines is often and accurately described as the nation\u2019s costliest military acquisition, with an estimated price tag of up to $40bn. For Australia, the Soryu has obvious attractions. It is a new and successful design, having entered service in Japan in 2009, and it promises the risk-minimisation benefits of a military off-the-shelf (MOTS) procurement. Moreover, for a government obsessed with what it calls \u201cbudget repair\u201d, the price of some $25bn represents a massive saving.     The Collins class submarines, which have proved troublingly unreliable, are smaller than the Soryus, but their range is almost twice as large. Photograph: Torsten Blackwood/AFP/Getty Images    Japan now operates five Soryus and has three under construction with two more planned. Powered by a super-quiet Swedish air-independent propulsion system, the Soryu can stay submerged for up to two weeks \u2013 longer than most other current diesel electric submarines \u2013 and has a range of 6,100 nautical miles. Anechoic coating technology reduces its radar detection profile. The Collins class submarines, which have proved troublingly unreliable, are smaller than the Soryus, but their range is almost twice as large. The submarine project has added more evidence that Tony Abbott leads an unsentimental free-trade government, which has shown through its car industry decisions a reluctance to subsidise Australian manufacturing jobs if suitable products can be imported more cheaply. Johnston has demonstrated his limited faith in the ability of the Australian naval shipbuilding industry to deliver projects competitively on time and on budget. He has previously announced that two 20,000-tonne navy supply ships will be built in either Spain or Korea, and he has placed the troubled Australian assembly of three air warfare destroyers onto the \u201cprojects of concern\u201d list following a critical report by the auditor general on costs and delays. It\u2019s also clear that the government regards the estimated $36-40bn price tag for 12 Australian-built submarines as prohibitive, when foreign prices are significantly lower. It accepts the huge long-term financial commitment could starve other important defence programs of funds. And Abbott and Johnston appear genuinely enthusiastic admirers of the Japanese submarine (more so than some defence and foreign affairs officials and former submariners). Johnston recently became the first foreign politician to go on board and inspect a Soryu. He declared it \u201cvery impressive\u201d.     Defence minister David Johnston described the Soryu as \u2018the design that comes nearest to what our requirements are\u2019. Photograph: Greg Wood/AFP/Getty Images    Later, at an Australian Strategic Policy Institute conference he described the Soryu as \u201cthe design that comes nearest to what our requirements are\u201d.  \u201cThere\u2019s no other diesel-electric sub of that size and dimension \u2026 we must be talking to them, and we are,\u201d he said. For their part, the Japanese have taken two critical decisions that clear the way to possible cooperation with Australia on the project. In April, the Japanese government discarded a 50-year ban on the export of weapons and military hardware and \u201creinterpreted\u201d its postwar peace constitution to allow its military greater scope to help defend allies. These decisions were not directly related to the Australian submarine project, but they were necessary preliminaries to cooperation if a deal is to be reached. Since then there have been high-level meetings of extraordinary diplomatic intensity. Abbott visited Japan in April, followed by Johnston and the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, in June, with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, reciprocating the following month.  Abe\u2019s visit to Canberra was especially significant. Free trade and defence cooperation agreements were finally signed, and apparently centred partly around plans to jointly develop stealth technology at the heart of the submarine program.  Moreover, both Abe and Abbott sought to finally walk out of the shadow of the second world war: Abe addressed the federal parliament in English and apologised for atrocities committed by Japanese troops 70 years ago; Abbott praised Japanese soldiers in terms that were widely deemed too generous by older Australians. There is still resistance in Australia to intimate defence relations with Japan, reinforced by China\u2019s hostility to Japan. Much, of course, remains unknown and undecided. There will doubtless be attractive proposals from European submarine makers. There will have to be detailed agreements on the structure and role of any commercial entity created to build the submarines. What will be built where? And by whom? How will costs, risks and responsibilities be apportioned and shared? What arrangements will be made for sensitive technology transfer and for complex systems integration? What will be the reactions of powerful players and competitors such as China and the US? But preparations are now clearly moving ahead for an Australia-Japan submarine alliance that enjoys high-level political and economic support in both countries. Some industry players say Japan is deeply interested in accessing military technologies in which Australia has a regional edge \u2013 notably Awacs (airborne early warning and control) aircraft systems. The key question for the Australian government is whether it will allow the naval shipbuilding industry to go the way of the car industry and, before it, the white goods industry. As one industry player says: \u201cResidency is no commercial advantage in a globalised market economy.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["These days he lives near Tokyo, having spent periods in Greece, at Princeton and Tufts universities \u2013 where he wrote his masterpiece, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle \u2013 and recently in Hawaii.)", "Yeah,\u00a0it\u00a0might be a new category.&quot; Such musical comparisons come naturally to Murakami, who along with his wife, Yoko Takahashi, ran a jazz bar\u00a0called Peter Cat in Tokyo in his twenties, which he opened while still a\u00a0drama student at Waseda University.", "It dates back to his\u00a0early 20s, when he was looking for a\u00a0good location in Tokyo to open his jazz bar."], "tags": ["Haruki Murakami", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-13T06:00:00Z", "title": "Haruki Murakami: 'I'm an outcast of the Japanese literary world'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/13/haruki-murakami-interview-colorless-tsukur-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage", "article": "&apos;Strange things happen in\u00a0this world,&quot; Haruki Murakami says. &quot;You don&apos;t know why, but they happen.&quot; It could be\u00a0a\u00a0guiding motto for all of his fiction, but he\u00a0is\u00a0talking specifically about a minor character in his new novel, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His\u00a0Years of Pilgrimage. The character is\u00a0a jazz pianist who seems to have made a pact with death, and is able to\u00a0see people&apos;s auras. &quot;Why that pianist can see the colours of people, I don&apos;t know,&quot; Murakami muses. &quot;It just happens.&quot; Novels in\u00a0general, he thinks, benefit from a\u00a0certain mystery. &quot;If the very important secret is not solved, then readers will be frustrated. That is not what I want. But if a\u00a0certain kind of secret stays secret, it&apos;s\u00a0a very sound curiosity. I think readers need it.&quot; The world&apos;s most popular cult novelist is sipping coffee in the sunny library of an Edinburgh hotel, which \u2013 perhaps disappointingly for admirers of his more fantastical yarns \u2013 is not reached through a labyrinthine network of subterranean tunnels. Murakami is\u00a0relaxed and affable, rather than forbiddingly gnomic. &quot;I&apos;m not mysterious!&quot; he says, laughing. Tsukuru Tazaki, as the author calls his own novel for short, sold a million copies in two weeks when it came out last summer in Japan. (Murakami was born in Kyoto to two literature teachers, and grew up in the port city of Kobe. These days he lives near Tokyo, having spent periods in Greece, at Princeton and Tufts universities \u2013 where he wrote his masterpiece, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle \u2013 and recently in Hawaii.) It\u00a0contains passing mysteries like the pianist who sees auras, but it\u00a0is\u00a0also a\u00a0mystery novel in a larger sense. Tsukuru, its 36-year-old protagonist, is\u00a0still in mourning for the years before he went to university, when he was part of an inseparable group of five friends \u2013 until one day they told him, without explanation, that they never wanted to see him again. &quot;In the first place I had the intention to write a short story,&quot; Murakami says. &quot;I just wanted to describe that guy, 36\u00a0years old, very solitary \u2026 I wanted to describe his life. So his secret was not to be dissolved; the mystery was going to stay a mystery.&quot; But he hadn&apos;t reckoned on the inciting power of a woman to move the story forward, as Murakami&apos;s female characters so often do. &quot;When I\u00a0wrote that short-story part,&quot; he continues, &quot;Sara, [Tsukuru&apos;s] girlfriend, came to him and she said, &apos;You should find out what happened then&apos;, so he went to Nagoya to see his old friends. And the same thing happened to me. Sara came to me and said, &apos;You should go back to Nagoya and find out what happened.&apos; When I was writing the book, my own character came to me and told me what to do \u2026 The fiction and my experience happened at the same time, in parallel. So it became a\u00a0novel.&quot; Murakami has often spoken of the theme of two dimensions, or realities, in his work: a normal, beautifully evoked everyday world, and a weirder supernatural realm, which may be accessed by sitting at the bottom of a\u00a0well (as does the hero of The Wind-Up\u00a0Bird Chronicle), or by taking the wrong emergency staircase off a city expressway (as in 1Q84). Sometimes dreams act as portals between these realities. In Tsukuru Tazaki there is a\u00a0striking sex\u00a0dream, at the climax of which the reader is not sure whether Tsukuru is still asleep or awake. Yet Murakami hardly ever remembers his own dreams. &quot;Once I talked to a very famous therapist in Japan,&quot; he says, &quot;and I\u00a0said\u00a0to him that I don&apos;t dream much, almost nothing, and he said: &apos;That makes sense.&apos; So I wanted to ask him: &apos;Why? Why does it make sense?&apos; But there was no time. And I was waiting to see him again, but he died three or four years ago.&quot; He smiles sadly. &quot;Too bad.&quot; His novels thus far have generally divided into two types. There are the\u00a0overtly magical-realist romances (A\u00a0Wild Sheep Chase, The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, 1Q84), and the works on a\u00a0smaller canvas, in which hints of the supernatural remain mostly beneath the mournful, mundane surface (South\u00a0of the Border, West of the Sun; Sputnik Sweetheart). With its unresolved mysteries, tales-within-tales and maybe-dreams, Tsukuru Tazaki seems almost a hybrid of both styles. &quot;I had been thinking my novels are divided into two categories, as you said,&quot; he agrees. &quot;So it&apos;s just like Beethoven&apos;s symphonies, you know, odd numbers and even numbers. Three, five, seven, nine is kind of a big symphony, and two, four, six, eight is\u00a0a\u00a0kind of intimate work. I think my novels do the same thing. What do I\u00a0think about this Tsukuru Tazaki? Yeah,\u00a0it\u00a0might be a new category.&quot; Such musical comparisons come naturally to Murakami, who along with his wife, Yoko Takahashi, ran a jazz bar\u00a0called Peter Cat in Tokyo in his twenties, which he opened while still a\u00a0drama student at Waseda University. Murakami sold the bar and concentrated on writing full-time after the publication of his second novel, Pinball. Since then, his life has been one of writing and long-distance running \u2013 as\u00a0chronicled in his memoir What I\u00a0Talk\u00a0About When I Talk About Running \u2013 and\u00a0also collecting records. His novels almost always feature a\u00a0thematic piece of music (his\u00a0breakout Japanese bestseller, Norwegian Wood, was named after the Beatles song). The\u00a0unusual harmonies of Thelonious Monk&apos;s &quot;&apos;Round Midnight&quot; were perfect for this novel&apos;s haunted pianist, he thought: &quot;Thelonious Monk&apos;s tune is full of mysteries. Monk plays some very strange sounds during the chords. Very\u00a0strange. But to him it&apos;s\u00a0a very logical chord. But when we are listening to his music it doesn&apos;t sound\u00a0logical.&quot;     A still from the film version of Murakami's Norwegian Wood (2011).    Meanwhile, Tsukuru and his former friends listen to &quot;Le Mal du Pays&quot;, a\u00a0piece from Liszt&apos;s set of piano suites Years of Pilgrimage (hence the novel&apos;s subtitle). It was the soundtrack to the novel&apos;s composition. &quot;I wake up early in the morning and I play a record, a\u00a0vinyl record, when I&apos;m writing. Not so loud. After 10 or 15 minutes I forget about the music, I just concentrate on my writing. But still I need some kind of music, good music. When I was writing Tsukuru Tazaki I\u00a0was listening to Liszt, the Years of Pilgrimage, and that song, &apos;Le mal du pays&apos;, remained in my mind somehow, so I just wanted to write something about that song. That&apos;s a beautiful record.&quot; Listening to it, Tsukuru feels as if &quot;he&apos;d swallowed a hard lump of\u00a0cloud&quot;. The solitary adult Tsukuru works as a designer of railway stations. &quot;There is\u00a0a reason I&apos;m interested in railway stations,&quot; Murakami begins to explain, not unmysteriously. It dates back to his\u00a0early 20s, when he was looking for a\u00a0good location in Tokyo to open his jazz bar. &quot;I heard a certain railway company was rebuilding a station,&quot; he\u00a0says. He wanted to know where the\u00a0new entrance would be, so his bar would be near it. &quot;But that&apos;s a secret, you know, because people are speculating.&quot; At the time Murakami was studying drama, but he went to the railway company and pretended to be\u00a0a\u00a0student of railways, befriending the man who was\u00a0in charge of the rebuilding project. &quot;He didn&apos;t tell me the new location of the entrance to the station. But he was a nice guy. We had a\u00a0good time together. So when I\u00a0wrote this book I remembered that episode. &quot;I have collected so many memories, in my chest, the chest of my mind,&quot; he\u00a0says with satisfaction. &quot;I think everybody has a lot of memories of his\u00a0or her own, but it&apos;s a special gift to\u00a0find the right drawer. I can do that. If\u00a0I\u00a0need something, I can point to\u00a0the right drawer.&quot; Tsukuru considers himself uninteresting, an &quot;empty vessel&quot;, but Murakami almost can&apos;t help giving his hero an aesthetic sensibility. At one point, Tsukuru sees a chair in an office: &quot;The\u00a0chair was a simple Scandinavian design of chrome and white leather. Beautiful, clean, and silent, with not an\u00a0ounce of warmth, like a fine rain falling under the midnight sun.&quot; So is Tsukuru really more interesting than he thinks he is? With the novelist&apos;s humane affection focused on them, might anyone be? &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; Murakami says. &quot;I\u00a0have many similarities to [Tsukuru]. I see myself as a kind of ordinary guy. I\u00a0don&apos;t think of myself as an artist, mostly. I guess I&apos;m just engineering something.&quot; A builder, like Tsukuru? &quot;Yeah, right!&quot; He chuckles. &quot;I like to write. I like to\u00a0choose the right word, I\u00a0like to write the right sentence. It&apos;s just like gardening or something. You put the seed into\u00a0the soil at the right time, in the right place.&quot; That kind of engineering is exhausting, though: a daily trip to the &quot;basement of the mind&quot; and back up again. &quot;You can say that it&apos;s a kind of unconscious, subconscious \u2026\u00a0you have to go\u00a0down there and come back to the surface. You have to dedicate yourself to that work. You have no extra space to do something else.&quot; Murakami&apos;s style is\u00a0simple, even apparently casual, on the surface, and Tsukuru Tazaki, like many of his previous novels, has divided critics into those who find it banal and those who perceive greater depth in its vividness and precision of imagery. Like most simple styles, of course, his is the result of lots of hard work. &quot;I\u00a0take time to rewrite,&quot; he explains. &quot;Rewriting is my favourite part of\u00a0writing. The first time is a kind of torture, sometimes. Raymond Carver [whose work Murakami has translated into Japanese] said\u00a0the same thing. I\u00a0met him and I\u00a0talked with him in 1983\u00a0or 84, and he said:\u00a0&apos;The first draft is kind of torture, but when you rewrite it&apos;s getting better, so\u00a0you are happy, it&apos;s getting better and\u00a0better and better.&apos;&quot; There is\u00a0never a\u00a0deadline for a Murakami novel \u2013\u00a0&quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t like deadlines \u2026when\u00a0it&apos;s finished, it&apos;s finished. But\u00a0before then, it is not finished.&quot; Sometimes he\u00a0can&apos;t tell when he should stop rewriting, but &quot;my wife knows. Yes. Sometimes she decides: &apos;You should be\u00a0finished here.&apos;&quot; He smiles and imitates his own obedient response: &quot;&apos;OK!&apos;&quot; Right now, Murakami is not writing anything. &quot;After 1Q84,&quot; he says, &quot;I was so exhausted \u2026 Usually when I&apos;m exhausted by writing a big novel, I\u00a0write a set of short stories. But not that time \u2026 I didn&apos;t have any strong energy to descend&quot; \u2013 he mimes going down into the basement. &quot;You have to be strong to descend into the darkness of your mind.&quot; But after finishing Tsukuru Tazaki, Murakami wrote six short stories in three months; they were published this summer in Japan, under a title meaning &quot;Men Without Women&quot;. He might, he thinks, begin another novel next year. A long one, like an odd-numbered Beethoven symphony? &quot;I\u00a0think maybe a big book,\u00a0yes.&quot;     One of Murakami's favourite writers \u2026 Kazuo Ishiguro. Photograph: Matt Carr/Getty Images    Asked to name some of his favourite writers working today, Murakami enthuses about Kazuo Ishiguro (&quot;I\u00a0think he dedicates himself to the writing \u2026 When he&apos;s not writing he goes around the world, but when he&apos;s writing he goes nowhere&quot;), Cormac McCarthy (&quot;always riveting&quot;), and the\u00a0Norwegian novelist Dag Solstad, whom he is currently translating into Japanese from English (&quot;He&apos;s a kind of\u00a0surrealistic writer, very\u00a0strange novels. I think that&apos;s serious literature&quot;). As he has translated Raymond Chandler, I\u00a0ask him about modern crime writers too.\u00a0&quot;I\u00a0like Lee Child,&quot; he\u00a0announces decisively, and laughs. So do I, I say. &quot;Oh you like him? That&apos;s good! So far I\u00a0have read 10 of them.&quot; What do you like about them? He moves his hands in the air as though running his fingers over an invisible piano keyboard, and grins. &quot;Everything&apos;s the same!&quot; Murakami doesn&apos;t read many of his\u00a0Japanese contemporaries. Does he\u00a0feel\u00a0detached from his home scene? &quot;It&apos;s\u00a0a\u00a0touchy topic,&quot; he says, chuckling. &quot;I&apos;m a kind of outcast of the Japanese literary world. I have my own\u00a0readers \u2026 But critics, writers, many of them don&apos;t like me.&quot; Why is\u00a0that? &quot;I\u00a0have no idea! I have been writing for 35 years and from the beginning up to now the situation&apos;s almost the same. I&apos;m kind of an ugly duckling. Always the duckling, never the swan. &quot;But I think, in a sense, we are playing different games,&quot; he continues. &quot;I\u00a0began to think that way. It&apos;s very similar, but the rules are different. The\u00a0equipment&apos;s different, and the fields are different. Like tennis and squash. &quot; Does he think he&apos;d be accepted if he won the\u00a0Nobel prize, as\u00a0many people now expect will happen? &quot;Uh, I don&apos;t want to speculate,&quot; he says, and laughs. &quot;That&apos;s a very risky topic. Maybe I\u00a0would be hanged from a lamppost, I\u00a0don&apos;t know!&quot; How long does Murakami think the game of literature can last? &quot;I think serious readers of books are 5% of the population,&quot; he says. &quot;If there are good TV shows or a World Cup or anything, that 5% will keep on reading books very seriously, enthusiastically. And if a society banned books, they would go into the forest and remember all the books. So I trust in their existence. I\u00a0have confidence.&quot; What would he still like to achieve for himself, as a writer? &quot;Honestly, I\u00a0don&apos;t have any idea,&quot; he replies. &quot;Scott Fitzgerald was my idol when I\u00a0was young. But he died when he was 40-something. I love Truman Capote, but he died at 50-something. And Dostoyevsky is my ideal writer, but he\u00a0died at 59. I&apos;m\u00a065\u00a0right now. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen! So I have no role model. I\u00a0have no idea \u2013 when I\u00a0am 80 years old, what will I write? I\u00a0don&apos;t know. Maybe I&apos;m running and writing \u2026&quot; &quot;That would be\u00a0great. But nobody knows.&quot; He says he tries to think of himself as a kind of craftsman, a tinker. &quot;I&apos;d\u00a0like to be a perfect tinker. So I have to write good sentences \u2013 honest and beautiful and elegant and strong sentences.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["He said on taking the job that he wanted to develop a style of play that would give the Cherry Blossoms a chance of beating the likes of Scotland and Wales, the latter losing in Tokyo last year during the Lions tour."], "tags": ["Rugby World Cup 2015", "Rugby union", "Rugby World Cup", "Sport", "New Zealand rugby union team", "Tonga rugby union team", "Wales rugby union team", "Fiji rugby union team", "South Africa rugby team", "Japan rugby union team", "Ireland rugby union team", "Italy rugby union team", "Canada rugby union team", "Romania rugby union team", "Argentina rugby union team", "Namibia rugby union team"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-13T21:30:08Z", "title": "Rugby World Cup 2015: the pick of intriguing and affordable match-ups", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2015-tickets-new-zealand-france-ireland-italy-wales-scotland", "article": "France v Romania Olympic Stadium, 23 Sept 2015 A fixture rich in history, with ticket prices virtually half that of the New Zealand-Namibia clash at the same venue 24 hours later. France won rugby silver at the 1924 Olympic Games, with Romania claiming the bronze and that year Les Bleus started regular fixtures against the Oaks with the aim of setting up a rival to the then Five Nations. The attempt failed and it was not until the 1980s that Romania became a force, with France twice among their victims. Romania are among 12 countries to have taken part in every World Cup. Wales v Fiji Millennium Stadium, 1 Oct Wales have reason to be grateful to Fiji after the islanders knocked them out of the 2007 World Cup in sunny Nantes, arguably the best game of that tournament. Failing to make the last eight was hardly a novel experience for the men in red, who made early exits in 1991 and 1995, but taking a flight back to Cardiff rather than going on to Marseille was enough of an indignity to persuade the Welsh Rugby Union\u2019s top brass to make a detour to New Zealand and plead with Warren Gatland to take charge of the national side. Two grand slams, a Six Nations title and a World Cup semi-final later, and the pain of Nantes has been forgotten, although one of Gatland\u2019s low points with Wales came in 2010 when they drew at home to the Flying Fijians. The two sides met in the 2011 tournament in Gatland\u2019s native Hamilton and Wales won easily. New Zealand v Tonga St James\u2019 Park, 9 Oct  After the hosts New Zealand, Tonga were the best-supported team at the 2011 World Cup. Wellington Airport was a sea of red when the islanders arrived for their pool match upset of the French. It will be the fourth time they have faced the All Blacks in the tournament: the two teams opened the event three years ago and the 41-10 defeat was the closest Tonga had come to New Zealand after losing 91-7 in 2003 and 45-9 at Ashton Gate in 1999. The latter match caused a little confusion with some fans turning up at the city\u2019s Memorial Stadium. Anyone turning up at St James Park in Exeter in 13 months will have a rather longer dash to make the kick-off. South Africa v Samoa Villa Park, 26 Sept There were few more gripping matches at the 2011 World Cup than the one between the Springboks and the Samoans at Albany. The holders emerged 13-5 victors in a game that had everything: big hits, moments of high skill and a scattering of cards. The Samoa full-back Paul Williams was sent off 12 minutes from time for foul play, with the islanders aggrieved the South Africa prop Jannie du Plessis had not been shown a red earlier for what they claimed was a punch. They were critical afterwards of the referee Nigel Owens, feeling the big decisions had gone against them, and their serial tweeter Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu was given a six-month suspended ban for observations he made about the Welshman. The two sides met in 2007 in Paris: it was close at the start, with Samoa again feeling refereeing decisions went against them, but they lost 59-7 to the eventual winners. Another spiky contest beckons. Scotland v Japan Kingsholm, 23 Sept When they met at Murrayfield last autumn, Japan were twice trailing by one point in the second half before succumbing 42-17. Japan are among the ever-presents in the World Cup, but the 2019 tournament hosts will need to finish in the top three of their pool to automatically qualify for the event, a not inconsiderable task given the last World Cup match they won came back in 1991. They are coached by Eddie Jones, who led Australia to the 2003 World Cup final and was part of South Africa\u2019s management team four years later. He said on taking the job that he wanted to develop a style of play that would give the Cherry Blossoms a chance of beating the likes of Scotland and Wales, the latter losing in Tokyo last year during the Lions tour. Japan did defeat Scotland in an uncapped match in 1989 and it will be the first of two matches they play in Gloucester: they complete the pool stage against the USA there on 11 October. Ireland v Italy Olympic Stadium, 4 Oct Much has been made of the pool of death involving England, Wales and Australia, but Ireland, who have yet to get beyond the quarter-final stage, have to contend with France and Italy in a Six Nations-lite that also involves Canada and Romania. This fixture ended the pool stage three years ago and Ireland\u2019s victory ensured they topped the group, having previously defeated Australia, to ensure a north-south divide through to the final. The Azzurri have yet to make it to the knockout stage, missing out in their final group games in the last three tournaments, when they lost to Wales, Scotland and Ireland. They end this time with Romania and have beaten Ireland and France in recent years. Canada v Romania Leicester City Stadium, 6 Oct  Drawn together in 1995 \u2013 buried in a pool that contained the hosts, South Africa, and the holders, Australia \u2013 Canada did not play the role of easybeats, thumping Romania 34-3 in their opener before pushing the Wallabies. They left their best to last, although a 20-0 defeat to the Springboks does not suggest that. The Canucks dominated play in what came to be known as the Battle of Boet Erasmus after a power failure delayed the start in Port Elizabeth. Three players were sent off after a mass brawl, Gareth Rees and Rod Snow for Canada and the home hooker James Dalton, while the wing Pieter Hendriks was cited and banned for the rest of the tournament. Even a man short, Canada did everything but score. They have made little impact since. Argentina v Namibia Leicester City Stadium, 11 Oct The final match in this group may see Argentina needing to win to make the last eight, but Namibia are likely to be thinking about the flight home having been ranked 20th out of 20 in the past three tournaments. The two countries faced each other in 2003 and 2007, the Pumas winning 67-14 and 63-3 respectively. New Zealand should win the group, but second place will be open with Argentina, Tonga and Georgia all relishing the physical side of the game.

Whatever the vibe of my music is, that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to look. At the moment it\u2019s more retro so I\u2019m wearing vintage dresses. For my Somerset House gig I wore a beautiful silk piece that had a cape and blue cranes handpainted on it, and I love the pink dress I wore for Glastonbury this year. I feel like I\u2019ve grown up \u2013 I\u2019ve figured it out and my 30s are rocking. I feel like the wisest, smartest and sexiest I\u2019ve ever been. But all the time, I\u2019m going through phases. I can go wild! Stripper shoes, latex, leather, piercings. There\u2019s a joke between me and my friends that I always make US Weekly\u2019s worst-dressed list. I\u2019m offended now if I\u2019m not on it. I can be inspired by anything, but always Dynasty and Star Trek. I love Joan Collins. The important thing is that whatever you wear, you\u2019ve got to own it. It\u2019s got to represent something. There are a lot of pretty girls in magazines, but they all wear the same dress and it\u2019s a case of: \u201cWho wore the dress best?\u201d So boring. People like Grace Jones, Cher, Tina Turner\u2026 we knew who they were before they sang a word. And when they sang, we believed them. That\u2019s how musicians end up defining an era of fashion. We\u2019re interested in what the person behind the song looks like because they make us feel something. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a time when I didn\u2019t enjoy dressing up. My mum was a fashion designer so she taught me good taste young. She used to be totally cute \u2013 her hair was down to her ankles and she was this tiny little woman with a nose piercing and red lipstick \u2013 we would totally have been friends if we were the same age. She taught me what to wear for my body. When I was 17 I worked in an expensive clothes store in New York and I would say to all these rich women: \u201cHow can you not see that it doesn\u2019t suit your body?\u201d I\u2019ve always known what makes my legs look like sausages. I know I absolutely cannot wear track pants, like, ever. With my performance clothes I tend to wear everything twice and then put it in the closet I\u2019ve had built in my garage in LA. There are hundreds of shoes because I\u2019m a complete addict \u2013 if I love a pair, I\u2019ll buy them no matter what the size. I\u2019ve got some Louis Vuittons that almost killed me as they\u2019re a size 7 and I\u2019m a size 9. I\u2019ll wear anything for an hour then take if off, no matter the size, no matter what. Kelis\u2019s latest album, Food, is out now on Ninja Tune Brett Anderson     \u2018If I could go back and give myself style advice, I\u2019d say: \u201cTone it down or it\u2019ll come back to bite you in the arse\u201d\u2019: Suede\u2019s Brett Anderson, 1993. Kevin Cummins/Getty Images Photograph: Kevin Cummins/Getty Images    There\u2019s no such thing as non-image in music. Even bands who say they don\u2019t have an image, well, that\u2019s their image. A look is part of the magic and mystique of why fans get into particular bands. People assumed Suede were strutting peacocks, but it wasn\u2019t really like that. We were all on the dole so we went to charity shops \u2013 we were styled accidentally by Oxfam. In the early 90s those shops weren\u2019t full of Gap T-shirts, they sold clothes from 10-15 years earlier. It looked like we\u2019d adopted retro chic, but in truth it was financial necessity. At the time I was watching classic 60s and 70s films \u2013 The Servant, a lot of Alan Bates \u2013 so I looked for similar suits and shirts in the charity shops, there was a certain Englishness to it and it became our look. But it wasn\u2019t as self-conscious as people thought. Bands are like families, they spend a lot of time together. When you get very close, you start borrowing each other\u2019s clothes. That\u2019s why bands that are any good have an identity. It\u2019s part of the tribalism of the band, and you\u2019re proud of it. Your music sounds a certain way and you look a certain way. I don\u2019t think any good band is obsessed by style. It\u2019s just an extension of your identity. You won\u2019t be any good if you\u2019re style over content, it simply can\u2019t happen. I regret I allowed the look to become cartoonish by going on stage wearing more feminine clothes, blouses. But I honestly started doing it because my clothes always got ripped off me by the audience. I had to go out every day when we were on tour and buy some flimsy old bit of nonsense from a junk shop because I knew it would get torn to pieces. If I could go back and give myself style advice, I\u2019d say: \u201cTone it down or it\u2019ll come back to bite you in the arse.\u201d But we were young and it was exciting \u2013 part of the thrill of being in a band when you\u2019re young is making mistakes. I\u2019m 47 now and I\u2019m lucky enough to be able afford nice clothes. As you get older, you dress better. Though I\u2019m quite conscious of not overdressing, particularly when the band is on stage. I don\u2019t like it when we all turn up in suits, as if we\u2019ve walked out of a Savile Row tailor. I still go into charity shops, though, I love them. I\u2019m nosy. I like looking through other people\u2019s junk. I\u2019m like one of those people who doesn\u2019t want to buy a house but still books appointments with estate agents just to have a look around. Suede will release a limited-edition box set of Dog Man Star on 20 October to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the album\u2019s release Flying Lotus     \u2018It\u2019s fun to dress up and do your own thing: take an old sweatshirt, cut it up and match it with a weird chain\u2019: Flying Lotus Photograph: Suki Dhanda/Observer    My music is rooted in hip-hop. That was the starting point for me, the love of rap. At first I was listening to guys like Dr Dre and then I expanded from there. Now I rip from everything, sample from everywhere \u2013 jazz, classical, video games, films. I guess it\u2019s similar with my clothes. When I was coming up in Los Angeles I didn\u2019t have a lot of money, or a wild fashion sense, but I still tried to keep up, to fit in with the homies. There was an era when all hip-hop kids were wearing white T-shirts and baggy pants, so I was like: \u201cGreat! I can do the basic shit \u2013 white tees, no problem!\u201d Then everyone got into football jerseys and I was like: \u201cEasy, got ya.\u201d More recently guys like Kanye have come along and raised the bar. I love all that far-out stuff. Hip-hop has become more interesting because artists are taking more risks and trying to tell different stories, and that\u2019s related to fashion. A$AP Rocky has been able to go further because of his fashion sense: he\u2019s able to be in magazines in a different light as he dresses expensive and crazily. Then there is Thundercat \u2013 he\u2019s low key but really influential in fashion. Whenever I\u2019m out with him someone\u2019s always trying to take his picture. He was wearing those big hats before Pharrell [Williams] and Erykah [Badu] \u2013 always a step ahead. When I was starting out, other people in the industry asked me quite early on what my look was going to be, but I\u2019ve only started paying more attention to it recently. At heart I liked to keep things simple: black tees, black trousers, black socks, Nikes and Supras. Sometimes rather than washing my stuff I\u2019ll just go into American Apparel and buy 20 of the same black T-shirts. But I\u2019m equally interested in visual arts and music, and I recognise that clothes can be an important part of the performance. Being onstage has made me more appreciative of fashion as an art form, but I\u2019m suspicious of people who pay for the brand rather than the design \u2013 like, hundreds of dollars just to have \u201cSupreme\u201d written on something. That\u2019s not tight. Anime and sci-fi are big influences: The Fifth Element, Blade Runner, video games like Final Fantasy. When I go to Tokyo I\u2019m amazed by the little rich kids who look like straight-up anime characters \u2013 everyone should be doing that stuff. It\u2019s fun to dress up and do your own thing: take an old sweatshirt and cut it up and match it up with some $600 trousers and a weird chain. Mixing shit up \u2013 that\u2019s the fun part. You\u2019re Dead! by Flying Lotus is out on 6 October on Warp Anna Calvi     \u2018I had a big flamenco skirt made but then when I tried the male outfit it felt much more exciting\u2019: Anna Calvi Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Observer    It was David Bowie who I noticed first. I got into him when I was quite young and I had a photo book of him. I remember flipping through pictures of his outfits and thinking: \u201cHow is it that you can make such ridiculous clothes look so good?\u201d When I try to think of male musicians like that now, who are peacocks and enhance their femininity in a way that people find sexy, I can\u2019t think of anyone. In a fashion sense, I\u2019m usually inspired by men. When I was 10 or so, I found a black velvet jacket with a Chinese dragon on the back. I thought it was so cool and made me look like the Fonz. I like the way Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds dress, too \u2013 gentlemanly but sleazy. It\u2019s not like they put on these clothes just for their shows either \u2013 it\u2019s how they live. The masculinity in what I wear, for me, is about combining both sides of who I am. It makes me feel feminine to slick my hair back and to wear severe clothes; it brings out the woman in me somehow, because it makes me feel elegant and it also shows me where I am more feminine. You can use the shapes of your body to express your music. When I was in my early 20s I loved all the iconic women of the 50s, like Marilyn Monroe, because that period accentuated the hourglass shape. I experimented with wearing dresses and pencil skirts. But then I had the idea of the male flamenco dancer. I was trying to find a way to explore the passion and romance in my music, and flamenco dancers dress in a strong and sensual way. I had a big flamenco skirt made, but then when I tried the male outfit it felt much more exciting. I play with what I\u2019m wearing, too, and how that affects the way I sing. If I wear my hair down it changes my performance \u2013 I feel wilder. When it\u2019s slicked back, it\u2019s more of a stern performance. While recording my first record I experimented with dressing up and putting on lipstick to channel that passion. I tried doing a vocal take topless once when no one could see me. It was an intimate song and it changed the vocals \u2013 they felt very vulnerable. One Breath, Anna Calvi\u2019s Mercury-nominated album, is available now Lily Allen     \u2018I think clothes are an armour. They tell a lot about how you\u2019re feeling\u2019: Lily Allen Photograph: Steve Meddle/ITV/Rex    My style\u2019s kind of indefinable: it\u2019s a bit weird. Going through the ages, you associate style with different types of music. In the 70s you had the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll thing going on with the Rolling Stones and in the 80s it was punk and the Sex Pistols \u2013 very much a defence mechanism, dressing in that way. It was like a warning: \u201cBack off.\u201d People were angry. I don\u2019t think we have that right now. Now we have Instagram, so people are constantly putting out images of themselves and trying to control how people perceive them. They don\u2019t have to shout so much. I don\u2019t really get up in the morning and say: \u201cWhich style shall I wear?\u201d I would hope people didn\u2019t make a judgment on my music from looking at a picture of me. I think clothes are an armour. They tell a lot about how you\u2019re feeling. At the moment I\u2019m on tour travelling around like a maniac, so sometimes I want to be comfortable, sometimes I want to dress up. When I\u2019m tired, fun clothes or nails can give me an energy boost. If I\u2019m going out for dinner with my husband I obviously want to wear something slightly chicer than what I\u2019d wear to Notting Hill carnival. I\u2019ve accumulated a lot of stuff. When I first started I had one look and stuck to it: the prom dress and trainers. It was my look as a teenager because I hated high heels. And then as I got better known I had access to more. I\u2019ve been really lucky to carry on working with amazing fashion houses, such as Chanel, and I guess that\u2019s why my style has grown \u2013 no one would be able to afford to roll around in the amount of Chanel stuff that I do. The things I wear always seem like a good idea at the time, so I don\u2019t really have any fashion regrets. One of my favourite looks ever is a Giles Deacon dress that I wore to an awards do the first time I had pink hair. It was a pink dress with an old  Andy Warhol print on it, and from afar it looked like a really posh party dress. When you got up close, you saw it was a decapitated Bambi.

I remember my first time in Jamaica when I saw the kids wearing hats and shirts with the label still on. Creative fashion often comes from people who don\u2019t always have the money to buy expensive high-fashion items, who take an idea from magazines or TV and make it their own, using whatever they can lay their hands on. I remember watching an interview with LL Cool J back in the day. The interviewer was trying to smart-arse him, asking him about his tracksuits and his medallions, and he was like: \u201cYo, this is just what\u2019s for sale in my neighbourhood \u2013 I just take it and own it.\u201d That\u2019s what we were trying to do with Buffalo Stance and Raw Like Sushi in the late 80s. Ray Petri [founder of the Buffalo fashion label] was influenced by African and reggae music, and by the urban scene. We took a New York hip-hop style and mixed it in with bomber jackets and leggings. Somehow it made visual sense of what we felt \u2013 it became a kind of language. Before, there was always this idea that if you had a Chanel suit you had to have the shoes and handbag to match. We\u2019d put on a Jean Paul Gaultier jacket and wear it with trainers, because that was who we were. That dialogue about fashion has affected my music. The designer Christopher Shannon has been a support, giving me pieces to use. I can be sitting backstage with my head in my hands, wondering what I\u2019m going to do, and I\u2019ll pull something out of a suitcase and it becomes almost medicinal. I\u2019m at a stage in my career where it\u2019s not easy, where you don\u2019t make much money, so I\u2019m very grateful for those collaborations. I really hope that through my style I might have contributed something to the feminist debate, but there is still so much shit left to do. When I performed while pregnant, there was this idea that pregnant women ought to wear some kind of weird cloak. But I felt great and I wanted to get out there and celebrate it. I had my second child growing inside me, and my children are a huge part of my identity. I felt strong out there, and I sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to disappear.

While Okinawa&apos;s movement is tiny compared with its counterpart in Scotland, activists say they stand to benefit from mounting public anger over Tokyo&apos;s plans to push through the construction of a controversial US military base in defiance of local opposition. &quot;We&apos;re really interested in seeing how the rest of the UK and the international community react if Scotland does vote for independence,&quot; said Masaki Tomochi, a professor of economics at Okinawa International University and a leading figure in the independence movement. &quot;Scotland has every right to be independent and to take decisions about its own future. That&apos;s what people all over the world want, including the people of Okinawa.&quot; Tomochi and his colleagues, along with a reporter from the Ryukyu Shimpo newspaper, will tour Scotland meeting voters, academics and Scottish National party officials. Their group has posted a condensed Japanese version of the SNP&apos;s Scotland&apos;s Future manifesto on its website. The history of Okinawa, Tomochi argues, is one of bloody sacrifice at mainland Japan&apos;s behest, and collusion between Tokyo and Washington, beginning with a secret postwar agreement to allow the US to bring nuclear weapons to the island and maintain military bases there indefinitely. The 2012 deployment of MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft on the island, and the relocation of a military base have added to popular resentment towards Tokyo. &quot;The only way we can fix this is to declare our independence from Japan and go back to the way we were before Japan used force to take the islands,&quot; he said. Okinawa covers about 0.6% of Japan&apos;s land area, but is home to more than half the 47,000 US troops in the country and three-quarters of US bases. Some residents depend on the US military for employment, but campaigners say the bases emasculate the local economy, the poorest of Japan&apos;s 47 prefectures. Opposition to the US military presence now centres on the relocation of Futenma, a sprawling US marine base located in the centre of a densely populated area, to an offshore site on the island&apos;s north-east coast. Opinion polls show that 74% of Okinawans oppose the move, and there are fears the new offshore runway would endanger residents&apos; safety and damage the marine environment. Tokyo and Washington, however, are determined to push ahead with the plan, which would cement Okinawa&apos;s critical role in the event of a conflict with China over the sovereignty of the nearby Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. As a sweetener, the US has agreed to move 8,000 marines and their families off the island to Guam and Hawaii. &quot;The politicians in Tokyo have been ignoring our wishes for decades,&quot; said Kenzo Nagamine, a restaurateur. &quot;As far as they are concerned, Okinawa counts for nothing.&quot; The Okinawa island chain once formed an independent kingdom, known as the Ryukyus, until it was forcibly annexed by Japan in 1879. The island was the scene one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific war, claiming the lives of 240,000 people, including US troops and about a quarter of the civilian population. US occupation authorities did not return the territory to Japanese control until 1972. The Okinawan activists hope to discover how the yes campaign in Scotland increased support to levels that make Thursday&apos;s vote too close to call. A 2011 poll found only 4.7% of Okinawans were pro-independence, although more than 15% wanted more devolution. Just over 60% preferred the political status quo. Tomochi says support for independence has risen over the past two years. Like their allies in Scotland, activists here have been accused of endangering security and the economy. In an independent Okinawa, there would be no US bases and an end to subsidies from Tokyo. Fears the island would fall into Chinese hands were unfounded, said Tomochi, who regards Okinawans as ethnically different from mainland Japanese, with their own language and culture. &quot;We would be far more likely to be invaded by Japan. China never invaded us for centuries when this was an independent kingdom,&quot; he said. The pro-independence movement envisages an Okinawa relieved of its heavy military burden, with a thriving economy based on trade with China and south-east Asia. Not all islanders are convinced, however. &quot;I worry that an independent Okinawa wouldn&apos;t be able to survive economically or have the military strength to defend itself,&quot; said Okinawa resident Sayaka Zacharski, who opposes the base relocation. &quot;Being part of Japan is the best way for Okinawa to survive in today&apos;s world.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Dressed in white T-shirts, blue shorts and plimsolls, the pupils at this school in Chiba, on the edge of Tokyo&apos;s vast commuter belt, look like any others in Japan.", "The same year, the pressure on Korean schools intensified when Tokyo became the first of nine prefectural governments \u2013 a third of those with Korean schools \u2013 to withdraw subsidies.", "The start of North Korean nuclear weapons tests in 2006 and the test-firing of long-range missiles have added to tensions, with Korean residents claiming that hardline rhetoric in Tokyo has made them targets for routine abuse."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "North Korea", "South Korea", "Second world war", "Cold war"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-15T11:46:05Z", "title": "Japan's Korean schools being squeezed by rising tensions with Pyongyang", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/15/japan-korean-schools-tensions-pyongyang", "article": "With gentle encouragement, a group of primary school pupils fill the classroom with the cheerful tones of a children&apos;s folk song. Along the corridor, their peers make brush strokes in the air as they learn their first Japanese characters. Dressed in white T-shirts, blue shorts and plimsolls, the pupils at this school in Chiba, on the edge of Tokyo&apos;s vast commuter belt, look like any others in Japan. The language of instruction, however, is Korean, not Japanese. The notices on the wall are written in Hangul. And as the children listen to their teachers, their attention may be drawn to paintings showing a kind-looking man and his wife, surrounded by smiling children. The man is a young Kim Jong-il, the former leader of North Korea. By the time they are young adults, these children will be proficient in the language of Kim&apos;s country, versed in its music and dance and convinced \u2013 in defiance of historical consensus \u2013 that the 1950-53 war that divided the Korean peninsula into North and South Korea was started by US-led imperialists. Just two days into the autumn term, historical debate is furthest from the thoughts of teachers at Chiba Korean primary and junior high school, one of dozens of schools that educate the youngest among the 600,000 residents of Japan with ties to the Korean peninsula. Tensions between North Korea and Japan are threatening the survival of this and dozens of other Korean schools. Pyongyang&apos;s nuclear programme elicited a strong international response in the form of UN sanctions. But it is the regime&apos;s abduction of Japanese nationals during the cold war that resonates most in Japan, where the clamour for information about the missing has reached its peak.     The school's headmaster says his teachers are more interested in nurturing a love of Korean culture than in producing citizens conversant with Pyongyang's policies. Photograph: Justin McCurry for the Guardian    After rare high-level talks in Beijing, North Korean investigators are poised to release new information about the fate of the abductees, in return for Japan relaxing bilateral sanctions. The deal raises the prospect of a rare detente between the two countries, but for the Chiba school&apos;s headmaster, Kim Yu-sop, any warming of relations will come too late. &quot;Schools like this are being punished because of anger over nuclear weapons and the abductions,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;We&apos;re being discriminated against in a way that&apos;s unforgivable. Korean schools have been effectively excluded from Japan&apos;s education system for political reasons. &quot;When we opened this school almost 70 years ago, life was tough, but we managed to pay our way and compile our own textbooks,&quot; Kim said. &quot;In those days we were not seen by the rest of Japanese society as some sort of cult, as we are today. People were willing to help.&quot; That goodwill has all but evaporated. Over the past four years, prefectural and city governments have withheld subsidies from Korean schools, set up by the hundreds of thousands of men and women forcibly brought to Japan as labourers before and during the second word war. The majority of Japan&apos;s ethnic Korean community trace their roots back to what is now South Korea and, in most cases, send their children to Japanese schools. But the estimated 150,000 who remain loyal to the North regard schools like this as the only way to preserve their cultural and national heritage, amid an increasingly hostile atmosphere in their ancestors&apos; adopted home. The Chiba school teaches 86 pupils between the ages of five and 12. In happier days, 20% of its budget came in the form of local subsidies, with the remainder donated by Chongryon \u2013 an association of Korean residents sympathetic to North Korea and the North&apos;s de facto embassy in Japan. The school even received modest funding from the regime in Pyongyang, but the supply ran dry with the advent of UN sanctions. The curriculum mixes the Japanese state syllabus with classes in history, language and geography devised by Chongryon, although pupils here won&apos;t begin tuition in the ideology of North Korea&apos;s founder, Kim Il-sung, until they attend senior high school. Chongryon&apos;s insistence on operating a separate education system has long been a source of tension with Japanese conservatives. Why, they ask, should a group that blatantly proclaims its loyalty to an unfriendly regime be treated in the same way as Japanese schools?     The school's curriculum mixes the Japanese state syllabus with classes in history, language and geography devised by a Korean residents' association. Photograph: Justin McCurry for the Guardian    Critics have now found allies among senior politicians. In 2010, the government excluded Korean high schools from a tuition fee waiver program following the introduction of free education up to the age of 15. The ban was made official in early 2013, two months after Japan&apos;s conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, took office. At the time his education minister, Hakubun Shimomura, claimed the schools were subject to &quot;improper control&quot; by political groups. The same year, the pressure on Korean schools intensified when Tokyo became the first of nine prefectural governments \u2013 a third of those with Korean schools \u2013 to withdraw subsidies. The moves have plunged many schools into severe financial difficulty. Teachers at the Chiba school receive a fraction of their salaries of three years ago, and some have quit. There are occasional water and power cuts, prompting frantic requests to parents for donations. &quot;Whenever there&apos;s a problem between Japan and North Korea we also receive threatening phone calls,&quot; Kim said. &quot;People tell us to die, or threaten to kidnap our pupils in retaliation for the abductions.&quot; Kim says his teachers are more interested in nurturing a love of Korean culture than in producing citizens conversant with the policies of juche (self-reliance) and songun (military-first). &quot;Of course, we don&apos;t criticise the Kim family, but we don&apos;t go over the top, either,&quot; he said. &quot;Our approach is that they are our leaders, so we should respect them.&quot; He laughs when asked why he doesn&apos;t adopt Japanese citizenship, send his children to a Japanese school and encourage them to learn Korean language and culture at home or at night school. &quot;People always ask us: &apos;Why not become Japanese and all will be well?&apos; I try to explain that to do that would be to deny our past and our ethnicity. When children here study Korean, it&apos;s not like they&apos;re learning a foreign language. It&apos;s their mother tongue.&quot; Attitudes towards North Korea hardened more than a decade ago when Pyongyang confirmed suspicions that its spies had abducted at least a dozen Japanese nationals during the cold war. Despite the release in 2002 of five abductees and their families, Japan refused to believe Pyongyang&apos;s claims that the remainder had died. The start of North Korean nuclear weapons tests in 2006 and the test-firing of long-range missiles have added to tensions, with Korean residents claiming that hardline rhetoric in Tokyo has made them targets for routine abuse. The past couple of years have seen a dramatic rise in anti-Korean demonstrations organised by far-right groups such as Zaitokukai. In response, the UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination in Geneva last month called on Japan to &quot;firmly address manifestations of hate and racism, as well as incitement to racist violence and hatred during rallies&quot;, and to &quot;pursue appropriate sanctions&quot; against public officials and politicians who disseminate hate speech. &quot;I don&apos;t feel like we&apos;ve made any progress at all on the rights of ethnic Koreans,&quot; said Kim Wooki, a campaigner with the Human Rights Association for Korean residents in Japan. &quot;The government tried to close Korean schools down in the 1960s but failed because of public opposition. Decades later, it is still trying.&quot; Kim, who was part of a delegation that testified in Geneva, blames the new atmosphere of intolerance on the growing acceptance of historical revisionism at the highest levels of Japanese politics. Prime Minister Abe is among those who believes there is no evidence that tens of thousands of mainly Korean women were forced to work in frontline brothels run by the Japanese military before and during the war. &quot;Mention of the sex slaves was removed from Japanese school textbooks in 2006,&quot; said Kim. &quot;Japanese children don&apos;t learn the truth about history, so when I tell people that if I had children I would never send them to Japanese schools, I use that example to explain that this is Japan&apos;s problem, not mine. &quot;The way things are going, I don&apos;t know if Korean schools will be around in 20 to 30 years&apos; time. All we are asking is for Japan to respect international norms as far as providing education is concerned.&quot; The rightwing demonstrations in Korean neighbourhoods are reminiscent of incidents in the 1990s \u2013 when the abductions came to light \u2013 in which girls wearing traditional chima jeogori uniforms had their clothes slashed while commuting to and from school. As an ethnic Korean growing up in Japan, Kang Chi-na said fear of verbal abuse, or worse, meant she had to wear an ordinary Japanese-style uniform outside and change into traditional dress once she was at school, before changing again for the journey home. Yet Kang, whonow teaches Korean language at the Chiba school, held out hope that, while their governments attempt to resolve the abductions, Japanese citizens and their ethnic Korean neighbours would overcome their differences. &quot;People like me were born and brought up in Japan, but we are still Korean,&quot; Kang, 23, said. &quot;That&apos;s why these schools are so important to us. &quot;We dance and sing with Japanese neighbours at our school festival and have exchange programmes with local Japanese schools. If we can learn to understand each other through grassroots exchanges, I can see the overall situation improving.&quot; Kim, the headmaster, doesn&apos;t share her optimism. Official intolerance of ethnic Koreans, evident in the row over fees and subsidies, has given Japan&apos;s increasingly vocal far-right carte blanche to identify ethnic Koreans as the &quot;enemy within&quot;, he said. &quot;You have to remember that our ancestors didn&apos;t come here because they loved Japan. They were forced to come here. I&apos;ve always said that if Japan wants to prove it is a truly modern and international country, then the way it treats its ethnic Korean citizens is its true litmus test.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["London has five in QS&apos;s top 100, compared with three for Boston and Hong Kong, and two for New York, Paris and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "University of Cambridge", "Imperial College London", "University of Oxford", "UCL (University College London)", "Harvard University", "MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-15T23:19:00Z", "title": "Four British institutions ranked in top six of world's universities", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/16/cambridge-imperial-oxford-ucl-in-top-five-worlds-universities", "article": "Improvements in research have seen Cambridge University and Imperial College London surpass Harvard University in the latest authoritative annual ranking of the world&apos;s top universities, published on Tuesday, with four British institutions in the top six. The QS ranking of world universities, regarded as the most rigorous of its type, places Imperial and Cambridge as second equal, behind only the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the international stage in 2014, thanks to a year of impressive citations measured by QS&apos;s survey of academic output. Harvard dropped from second to fourth overall. It was followed by Oxford and University College London in joint fifth place, with Stanford, Caltech, Princeton and Yale of the US filling out the rest of the top 10. &quot;These rankings support what our students, alumni, staff, friends and collaborators know, that Imperial is one of the world&apos;s great universities,&quot; said Professor Alice Gast, Imperial&apos;s new president of Imperial College and a leading chemical engineer. &quot;Imperial has a rare ability to turn outstanding research into discoveries that have a real impact on the world.&quot; Kings College London, Edinburgh, Bristol and Manchester universities are all in the top 30, capping the best performance by British institutions in the 10 years the QS rankings have been published. Glasgow, Warwick, Birmingham and Sheffield universities make the top 70. The 2014 rankings will also help British universities&apos; efforts to attract research funding and recruit top-rate researchers and students. Imperial College&apos;s jump from fifth to second place in a year was the result of recent world-leading output being more widely cited in academic journals and published research. Imperial pointed to research by theoretical physicist Professor Sir John Pendry, who this year won the Kavli prize in nanoscience for contributions to nano-optics, exploring how light behaves on a scale of one billionth of a metre, and work on manmade materials with unusual properties known as metamaterials. &quot;Rarely a day goes by when there isn&apos;t a new discovery or innovation from Imperial&apos;s talented staff, students and alumni,&quot; Gast said, paying tribute to the college&apos;s &quot;entrepreneurial culture&quot; and cooperation with academic and industry partners. Ben Sowter, head of research at QS, said the top 10 had excellent academic reputations, graduate recruitment, staff-student ratios and international reach for faculty and students. &quot;The performance of Imperial in citations per faculty has helped it become the biggest climber in the top 10, leapfrogging Harvard, UCL and Oxford to rank second equal in the world, tied with Cambridge,&quot; said Sowter. Of the top 200 higher education institutions ranked by QS, the UK is represented by 29 and the US by 51, while Germany is the next best performer with 13. London has five in QS&apos;s top 100, compared with three for Boston and Hong Kong, and two for New York, Paris and Tokyo. Graduates of Oxford and Cambridge were rated as the world&apos;s most employable, with LSE graduates also highly regarded. Cambridge was the best performing British institution for total research citations, an area heavily dominated by the more wealthy US universities. &quot;This ranking, like all the others, reflects the fact that the University of Cambridge is among a small group of the most respected and influential higher education institutions in the world,&quot; a university spokesperson said. MIT in Boston retained top spot as the world&apos;s best university for the third year in a row, helped by another impressive rise in research citations. \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 16 September 2014.

In recent days, however, the struggle has been to cool down a standoff on the ill-defined and disputed border with China. More than 200 soldiers of the People&apos;s Liberation Army entered what India considers its territory last week and used cranes and bulldozers to build a 1.2-mile road, the Hindustan Times reported. Indian soldiers challenged the Chinese troops and asked them to withdraw, before demolishing a temporary track they had built, said the report, which has not been denied by Indian authorities. News of the confrontation broke a day before the arrival of Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, in India, and has undermined official statements vaunting the goodwill between the two nations. Though similar incidents occur regularly along the 2,200-mile border, this new faceoff underlines the persistent tensions between the two emerging powers \u2013 even if both currently appear eager to improve a patchy relationship. China and India are keen to put a positive spin on Xi&apos;s first summit meeting with Narendra Modi, who won a landslide election victory to take power in Delhi in May. Xi will start his visit in Gujarat, the western state that Modi ran for 12 years and which is seen as a showcase for his policies for the nation. The two men are due to dine together with a handful of interpreters and selected aides in a specially constructed marquee erected on the newly refurbished riverfront in Gujarat&apos;s largest city, Ahmedabad. Wang Dehua, director of South and Central Asian studies at the Shanghai Municipal Centre for International Studies, said the visit \u2013 the first by a Chinese head of state to India in eight years \u2013 was likely to focus on economic cooperation, including investments in transport infrastructure and the creation of industrial zones. &quot;Japan offered their express [bullet] trains to India. But I think Chinese express trains are more competitive,&quot; he said. India&apos;s economic growth has flagged in recent years, and few commentators now talk of catching up with their regional rivals. This week several have noted that from economic parity in 1980, China&apos;s growth has outstripped India&apos;s fourfold. Others pointed out that since gaining independence from Britain in 1947 India has constructed 6,800 miles of railway track, while China added 8,700 miles in the five years to 2011. Modi is an admirer of China. The 64-year-old Hindu nationalist politician has talked of turning Gujarat into &quot;India&apos;s Guangdong&quot;. The state and the Chinese industrial powerhouse province are reportedly to be twinned formally this week. &quot;People have asked whether Modi is India&apos;s Deng Xiaoping,&quot; said Wang, referring to the Chinese leader who used Guangdong to pilot and power his country&apos;s economic transformation. China is now India&apos;s largest trading partner and bilateral trade currently stands at $65bn (\u00a340bn); the countries have set a target of $100bn by 2015. But Wang noted that India needed to close the rising deficit, which stood at $31bn last year. He said Beijing was also interested in maritime and &quot;southern Silk Road&quot; connections, especially an economic corridor across China, Burma, India and Bangladesh. Xi, who took power in 2012, arrives after touring the Maldives and Sri Lanka, two countries where growing Chinese influence has worried India. Delhi also has concerns about China&apos;s relationship with its hostile neighbour Pakistan and its growing role in Nepal. Beijing has been unsettled by Indian-US cooperation in the Asia Pacific region and Indian&apos;s stance on territorial disputes involving China and other nations in the South and East China Seas. Modi&apos;s apparent rapport with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, during a heavily publicised recent visit to Tokyo and his plans to meet Barack Obama later this month point to a carefully balanced approach to India&apos;s relations with world powers. Diplomats in Delhi say Modi is likely to balance his interest in other bigger players who can help with the transformation of India that he envisages with security concerns and a sharp sense of popular sentiment. &quot;It&apos;s complicated. On the one hand China is a great opportunity for investment and trade but any Indian will tell you that the big existential threat to their country is not Pakistan but China. That&apos;s the only superpower in the neighbourhood and one with which they have already fought a war,&quot; one diplomat said. That conflict, in 1962, ended in humiliating defeat for India. &quot;Let me assure you that our brave sentinels on the border will address any issue that happens on the border,&quot; said the foreign ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin. &quot;We are confident that our borders are in safe hands.&quot; He said Modi and Xi would discuss the ongoing border dispute this week. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 September 2014 because an earlier version said Ahmedabad was Gujarat&apos;s capital.

A narrow majority of delegates have lined up behind a proposal from New Zealand to curb Japan&apos;s &quot;scientific whaling&quot; ambitions by enforcing strict oversight on the number of whales that it may cull, and the scientific justifications for this, particularly the availability of non-lethal means for conducting research. As a voluntary body, the IWC cannot compel Japan to stop whaling, but stepping outside its aegis would be undesirable for Tokyo and frantic last-minute attempts are being made to find a consensus deal that could pass without a divisive vote. &quot;There may be a way of threading the needle,&quot; a key diplomatic source said, &quot;but it will require some give on both sides and we have to find out whether people are prepared to do that. The trade-off is on the one hand, Japan accepting that the commission has a role to play, and on the other hand, a recognition that this isn&apos;t just a one-year deal. It is not all about 2015, but looking at the longer term.&quot; No proposal, if it materialises at all, is expected until Thursday though. Earlier this year, Japan suspended its &quot;scientific whaling&quot; programme for a year after the International Court of Justice ruled that it violated Article VIII of the IWC&apos;s whaling convention. Japan has since declared an intent to resume scientific whaling in 2015 but the New Zealand resolution, if passed, would require that first the IWC&apos;s scientific committee and then the commission itself sign off on any new programme. Within the IWC&apos;s framework, this could normally only take place at the next summit in 2016, creating a de facto moratorium on the scientific whaling programme in the interim. A retreat from this position would risk a backlash from the &quot;Buenos Aires&quot; group of Latin American nations, which favour a more robust environmental regime, particularly in the south Atlantic. It would also be unpopular with environmental NGOs, who are tenaciously clinging to the conservationist gains made at the IWC. &quot;We are totally against [weakening the original resolution],&quot; said Aimee Leslie, WWF&apos;s global cetacean and marine turtle manager. &quot;As a minimum we want the resolution to be accepted as is, and hopefully strengthened.&quot; However, Gerard van Bohemen, the head of the New Zealand delegation, said a technical solution was possible, with goodwill from the two parties. &quot;Both sides would have to step back from their positions and come together around what should be a straightforward issue but has really become mixed up in the politics of scientific whaling,&quot; he said. &quot;It is about how you assess the scientific purpose of a scientific whaling programme, the size of a sample and whether that&apos;s reasonable in terms of the objectives you&apos;re trying to achieve, whether you&apos;ve considered non-lethal options and whether they are a feasible way of achieving the same objectives.&quot; Japan says that its past &quot;scientific whaling&quot; programmes have revealed that the age of sexual maturation for minke whales fell in the 1960s, but began to reverse in the 1990s, and that the thickness of blubber can serve as an indication of nutritional condition. Some marine scientists question the relevance of cetacean&apos;s sexual maturation for their conservation and management, and whether the nutritional condition of whales could have been established without killing them. Whale meat consumption is falling in Japan \u2013 as is the trade&apos;s profitability \u2013 but the issue remains a point of principle in Tokyo, according to van Bohemen, &quot;Japan is heavily reliant on marine resources for its food and I think that&apos;s why they&apos;ve attached such high importance to it,&quot; he said. &quot;Frankly, for the world&apos;s third-largest economy with so many other options, it seems like a unnecessary luxury and a burden.&quot; One Japanese negotiator said that there were still wide differences between the two sides on the whaling question. &quot;But I believe that we can try to find some common ground,&quot; he added. Asked whether Japan would unilaterally resume scientific whaling if it lost the vote, he replied: &quot;I do not reply to &apos;what if?&apos; questions.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["There\u2019s no word on whether Williams will compete at this Tokyo-based tournament, though the player she defeated at the US Open, Caroline Wozniacki, will be in attendance."], "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-17T05:00:04Z", "title": "TV highlights 17/09/2014", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/17/tv-highlights-our-zoo-scott-and-bailey", "article": "Our Zoo9pm, BBC1 Third episode of the soothing period drama about the founding of Chester zoo, or Call The Zookeeper.

Ma Jisheng left Reykjavik for China in January this year but did not return in March as expected. A New York-based Chinese language site reported on Tuesday that he and his wife had been seized by state security on suspicion of espionage. Ma served in China&apos;s embassy in Tokyo twice, finishing his last posting in 2008. The allegations are particularly sensitive given the marked deterioration in relations between China and Japan in recent years, and especially since the election of prime minister Shinz\u014d Abe. The two countries are locked in a long-running territorial dispute over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, known as the Diaoyu to the Chinese and Senkakus to the Japanese, and China complains Japan has failed to fully atone for its brutality in the second world war. Ma&apos;s lengthy absence from Reykjavik was first highlighted by an Icelandic newspaper this month. He has been ambassador only since December 2012 \u2013 meaning that if he is not returning his posting has been cut unusually short. Mingjing News then reported the espionage claims, with Hong Kong&apos;s Ming Pao newspaper picking up the story. Some mainland Chinese news sites carried the reports but subsequently deleted them. Asked whether the reports were true, Hong Lei, spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said: &quot;I have no information on this.&quot; He gave the same answer when asked for Ma&apos;s current whereabouts and to clarify who was the Chinese ambassador to Iceland. A spokeswoman for Iceland&apos;s foreign ministry, Urdur Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir, confirmed that Ma was to have returned in March. She said the Chinese embassy in Reykjavik had stated in May that he would not return to his post for personal reasons. There has been a caretaker ambassador since then, Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir said. Ma&apos;s CV has been deleted from the website of the Chinese embassy in Iceland and it has a blank where his name would normally appear in a welcoming address. The last reference to him in the news section dates from September last year. Older articles about him were still visible there and on the foreign ministry website. Ma was a secretary at the Chinese embassy in Japan between 1991 and 1995, and a minister counsellor between 2004 and 2008. Prior to becoming ambassador to Iceland, he worked as deputy director of information in the foreign ministry. A Japanese government official told Reuters: &quot;We are aware of the media report. But it&apos;s basically China&apos;s domestic issue and therefore the Japanese government would like to refrain from commenting.&quot; In 2012 there were reports that a Chinese state security official, working as an aide to a vice-minister, had been arrested on suspicion of spying for the US. The best-known spying scandal involved Yu Qiangsheng, a senior intelligence official who defected to the US in 1985 and told the Americans that a retired CIA analyst had been spying for China. The man he named killed himself days before he was due to be sentenced by a US court.

It is made from wood recycled out of the broken homes of Christchurch\u2019s earthquake. \u201cYou can feel this has history,\u201d the conservator says. \u201cYou can feel that time has imprinted on it. You cannot manufacture that.\u201d A short walk away sits the Christ Church Cathedral where time has imprinted a different feel. The front of the structure, completed 110 years ago, hangs open and loose like a broken jawed boxer. Steel support structures, raised in the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake, seem to support nothing. The building, once the epicentre of the city and its namesake, has sat unused and embroiled in legal battles. It is cordoned off, much of it hidden by large containers stacked up to protect the public in case of another shake. But still it is a tourist attraction and still, for a different reason, likely Christchurch\u2019s most photographed building. Once it housed concerts and meetings and, of course, religious ceremonies. Now it houses pigeons. \u201cIt was part of the city. It is even the symbol of the city council,\u201d Izzo says. \u201cWhat is Christchurch without its church?\u201d Izzo is charged with restoring the dome of the historic Isaac Royal Theatre \u2013 one of the few heritage buildings in in the city that is close to completion. Many others have been lost \u2013 either deemed too unsafe or too expensive to repair. She was surprised to find that after the earthquake the Anglican Diocese wanted to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d the cathedral rather than repair it. In its place the church envisages a modern building. But that decision has been met with legal challenges from those who see the cathedral\u2019s place in Christchurch as representing more than just stone and mortar. The Anglican diocese has already spent \u00a32m on a new Transitional Cathedral which has been hailed by some as the most important building to be built in New Zealand for many years. \u201cInternationally it is the most recognised building in the country,\u201d says Andrew Barrie, professor of architecture at Auckland University. Due to its building materials the structure has become known as the \u201ccardboard cathedral\u201d. It was created by Shigeru Ban who this year won architecture\u2019s grandest award \u2013 the Pritzker Prize. Part of the importance of the Transitional Cathedral, Barrie says, was that it is the first non commercial structure to be built in the city centre after the earthquakes. The rebuild of Christchurch is slow with the dominant feature being piles of rubble and empty lots rather than gleaming new buildings. Barrie believes the Transitional Cathedral shows that amid all the bureaucracy associated with recreating a city, progress is being made. He says the ruined cathedral has come to represent the earthquake itself: \u201cThe cardboard cathedral is a symbol of moving on.\u201d So while a fully intact stone cathedral still remains on the city council\u2019s letter head and the top image in a Google search, there are signs of a city doing just that. When visitors to Christchurch get a tourist map, for example, the cover of it features a newer vision \u2013 a cathedral made of cardboard.

It is designed to last for 50 years \u2013 it was never meant to be permanent. Barrie says it also shows how such structures can be a model of what is possible in post-disaster environments. \u201cIt was one of the first things that Christchurch could point to and say \u2018we are rebuilding\u2019.\u201d However, some would rather see the original Christ Church Cathedral restored, not only to honour its architectural significance but also its place in the founding of the city. The provincial council in the 1850s gifted the land to the church to build a city around. British architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, who later built St Pancras railway station in London, was enlisted to design it. It remains his only cathedral in Australasia. Others see the building as a vision of the past and representative of the trauma of the earthquakes. Even the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has weighed in on the restoration debate, saying Christchurch should not cling to history. He urged the city to not \u201cbe boring\u201d and suggested instead following Coventry Cathedral\u2019s example of incorporating historic ruins into a new building. Most simply want a decision to be made, because more than three and a half years later nothing seems to have been done. That responsibility remains with the Anglican diocese who own the building. Its bishop in Christchurch appears to have her eyes set on the future. The main purpose of the building is not for civic or heritage purposes, the church has said, it is to reveal and tell of God. \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d says New Zealand\u2019s former deputy prime minister, Jim Anderton. \u201cThis is not just a religious building. It is a civic building in every sense of the word.\u201d Anderton was lured out of retirement by the Great Christchurch Building Trust on the promise that he could help save a key part of the city\u2019s heritage. \u201cI have seen what happens when you don\u2019t look after heritage. You lose more than just buildings, you lose a city\u2019s soul.\u201d     The front of Christ Church Cathedral \u2018hangs open and loose like a broken jawed boxer\u2019. Restoration costs are estimated at \u00a334m-\u00a3112m. Photograph: Charles Anderson    A few months ago Anderton and a photographer flew over the cathedral in a helicopter, capturing the more intact \u2013 and seldom seen \u2013 parts of the building. Those photos have become the forefront of a campaign to try and reinvigorate public opinion and convince the diocese to change its mind.  Key to the argument is money. The Anglican diocese has estimated the restoration would cost between \u00a353m and \u00a3112m, while the Great Christchurch Building Trust puts the figure at about \u00a334m. Anderton says the diocese received about \u00a320m in an insurance payout for the cathedral so the shortfall is not much. \u201cWe could raise that in a weekend,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are people out there with the means who want to see it rebuilt.\u201d Among those to lend support are British billionaire Hamish Ogston, who pledged \u00a32m, and London-based New Zealander Euan Harkness. Harkness, the vice-chairman of Barclays Capital, put up the money to commission architects and designers to create an alternate idea \u2013 a \u201cliving cathedral\u201d that would rival bold visions like the Sydney Opera House or the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. The wreckage of the cathedral would be housed under a floating timber canopy that all residents could enjoy. The Anglican Diocese rejected the idea. In the aftermath of the quakes the cathedral was issued with a notice by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority that meant, because of safety issues, the building could be deconstructed without having to go through the usual consent processes. After a challenge from the Great Christchurch Building Trust, referring to an act of parliament protecting church buildings, a judge ordered a stay on deconstruction until the church committed to build a cathedral, of any design. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that if we had not done that, the cathedral would be gone,\u201d says Anderton.

The landscape is unpeopled. There\u2019s just us in the car with the camera at the start of Pierre Huyghe\u2019s film Human Mask, driving among broken wooden buildings unmoored from their foundations. Now we are inside, where a girl in a blue dress sits in the gloom, her face an expressionless mask surrounded by lustrous black hair. The face is an artificial, impassive blank, giving nothing away. Is she a marionette or a masked child actor? Her arms and hands are furry and not quite human. Nor are her movements as she pads from light to dark, all alone in a filthy restaurant kitchen and in rooms hung with drapes decorated with a bamboo motif. A cockroach darts across the floor. Did I see maggots? In close up, lively black pupils look through the eye-slits. She sits and peers about, toying with her hair, examining the hem of her dress, examining herself in a mirror. Is she afraid, bored, lonely? Somehow we project a fantasy of her feelings on the mask\u2019s immobile planes. She could be an actor in a Noh play or a performer in a lost Greek tragedy, except there is no script and there are no directions, just a sense of loneliness and the approaching storm.

Monkey magic \u2026 video still by Pierre Huyghe. Photograph: Pierre Huyghe/Courtesy the artist, Hauser &amp; Wirth, London and Anna Lena Films, Paris    This beautifully paced 19-minute film is but one of several fascinating and disconcerting new works that make up the exhibition In. Border. Deep. This is the first UK show since the French artist\u2019s 2006 Tate Modern retrospective, yet it feels somehow overdue. In. Border. Deep is a strange show \u2013 even those full stops in the title give you pause. Huyghe\u2019s art often catches you out. The garden he created in a huge park in Kassel at the last Documenta, with its live, wandering dogs and an entire manipulated ecosystem \u2013 including tadpoles, ant nests and an astonishing reclining nude sculpture with a living beehive for a head \u2013 was a marvellous place to linger in. More an interrupted dream or an unfinishable story, Huyghe\u2019s Untilled was an uncertain place. For all the effort he put into it, it is difficult to describe as a work. I felt as unsure of my surroundings and how to be as that monkey left to its own devices in that restaurant. Last winter, I visited Huyghe\u2019s exhibition at the Centre Pompidou in Paris on three occasions, trying to grapple with its complexities. The crowds \u2013 the show was always packed \u2013 made looking almost impossible, and I kept hearing about various interventions, both human and canine, that I had missed. Everyone I spoke to almost seemed to have seen different exhibitions. I arrived at Hauser &amp; Wirth to find the artist sprinkling live spiders from a jar on to a large, headless stone figure originally commissioned in the 1930s for some official tableaux. Huyghe\u2019s recast version, with its pools of water and patches of moss growing here and there, looks as if it had just been dragged in from years in the rain. Most disconcerting of all, the body is warm to the touch, as though it were alive.     Historical curiosity \u2026 an insect in amber, from a film by Pierre Huyghe. Photograph: Pierre Huyghe/Courtesy the artist, Hauser &amp; Wirth, London and Anna Lena Films, Paris    Beyond the warm stone body stand three large aquaria, lit by orange overhead lamps. The lights go on and off. The aquarium glass is also switchable, sometimes letting us see in, at other times reducing visibility to a yellowish murk. Carp foraging on the bottom of one tank are hidden in a cloud of stirred-up silt. A water boatman oars by. And look \u2013 there\u2019s an axolotl! The little Mexican amphibian, almost extinct in the wild and unique with its external gills like tiny branches, sits in a patch of weed. The light goes off again. Lilies are growing in the tanks too. They have been taken by Huyghe from the artificial ponds dug by Claude Monet at his garden in Giverny, which provided Monet with the subject of the enormous cycle of Nymph\u00e9as paintings that occupied the last decades of his life. Still growing, still constantly changing, Monet\u2019s meticulously planned water garden can be considered as much a part of his art as the paintings themselves. You could even say the paintings are as much a product of the garden as they are of Monet\u2019s hand and eye and the trails of his brush. It is all of a piece, the real and the image, the garden and the paintings, the then and the now. So it is with Huyghe, I think. Even the lights in these tanks are programmed to reproduce, in quick-time, the weather recorded at Giverny when Monet was painting the Nymph\u00e9as that now hang in the Musee de l\u2019Orangerie. At the Pompidou, Huyghe left visible traces of the Mike Kelley installation that had occupied the galleries previously, and scraped through the paint on the walls to reveal previous colour schemes. On one gallery wall at Hauser &amp; Wirth he has scraped through the white emulsion to reveal red. A prehistoric stone scraping tool sits on the floor beneath. In a second film, a hi-tech motion-control camera focuses and refocuses on a glutinous mass of 30m-year-old amber, finding fragments of insects caught in the globs of fossilised sap, including what is apparently the oldest known example of copulating mosquitos, all to an amplified soundtrack of whirrs and jolts from the camera\u2019s servos. Back in the tanks, live mosquito larvae dance among the fish and the lily roots, before emerging as adults to fly off in search of blood. Yours or mine would do. The cycle continues, whatever stories we might tell. \u2022 In. Border.

The Global Times said several of the cases had gone unreported, adding: \u201cIf it is confirmed that Ma [Jisheng] has been caught, we hope that his story will one day appear on media to serve as a warning for others.\u201d Ma had been due to return from China to Reykjavik this March but did not do so. The foreign ministry refused to comment on reports by a US-based Chinese-language news site that he and his wife had been arrested for passing intelligence to Japan, with spokesman Hong Lei saying he had no information on the matter. Hong, speaking on Wednesday, also refused to comment on Ma\u2019s whereabouts and would not say who is China\u2019s current ambassador to Iceland. Ma, who began his posting to Reykjavik in December 2012, has twice served in China\u2019s embassy in Tokyo. Citing foreign media reports of Ma\u2019s detention, the Chinese editorial said: \u201cIn recent years we have frequently witnessed vicious incidents where top Chinese diplomats, military officers and senior research fellows of thinktanks have been involved in espionage and selling intelligence. If Ma is confirmed to be involved in this case, that will be startling news. \u201cA number of major cases that startled the Chinese elite were not released to the public through the media. In actuality, reporting such incidents will educate many people by letting them know how close those manipulators of overseas intelligence agencies are to us.\u201d The editorial said perpetrators had \u201cdeveloped distorted values and indulged themselves, hankering after cash and a life of luxury, so they were easily targeted by foreign intelligence services\u201d. It added that China had suffered more losses of intelligence in recent years, but that those responsible were increasingly likely to be caught given advances in technology. The piece appeared on both the English and Chinese language websites of the Global Times newspaper, which is state-run but does not represent the official voice of the party. In a separate development a former US military contractor in Hawaii was sentenced to more than seven years in prison on Wednesday for passing on national defence secrets to a Chinese national and illegally keeping classified documents at his home, Reuters reported. Benjamin Pierce Bishop, a retired army lieutenant colonel assigned to the US Pacific Command on Oahu, had top security clearance. In a plea deal he admitted passing national defence secrets to his Chinese girlfriend. He had not disclosed the relationship to superiors. Neither prosecutors nor the FBI indicated whether they believed the woman was working for Beijing. Many countries have focused on cyber-crime and hacking in their public discussions of espionage in recent years. On Thursday a report by the US Senate armed services committee found that hackers associated with the Chinese government had repeatedly infiltrated the computer systems of US airlines, technology companies and other contractors involved in the movement of US troops and military equipment. \u201cThese peacetime intrusions into the networks of key defence contractors are more evidence of China\u2019s aggressive actions in cyberspace,\u201d said the committee\u2019s chairman, Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately comment. In May the US justice department indicted five Chinese military officials for cyber-spying. China said the charges were \u201cextremely ridiculous\u201d, with foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang adding: \u201cFor a long time American authorities have conducted large-scale, organised cyber-theft and cyber-espionage activities against foreign dignitaries, companies and individuals.

Christopher Nolan\u2019s Batman movies are far too terrifying for the average 12-year-old, while Marvel fare deals in death and destruction on an epic scale. All of which means that superhero movies will soon be incapable of addressing the youthful target audience these films, and their comic-book counterparts, were once aimed at. In Big Hero 6, Disney Animation Studios appears to have found the solution. It takes a quirky, ferociously detailed and stylised approach, reminiscent of the best work by sister studio Pixar, to create a film that is aimed at kids but which grownups \u2013 and the all-important 30-something fanboy blogger demographic \u2013 will also adore. Loosely based on a little-known Japanophile Marvel Comics title from the late 90s, Chris Williams and Don Hall\u2019s movie \u2013 previewed for press and bloggers in London on Wednesday \u2013 is the happy result of partnership between the rights owners of Iron Man, The Avengers et al and Disney. Yet Marvel Studios had very little to do with the actual making of Big Hero 6. If I\u2019m right, this marks the beginning of a new way forward for comic-book movies. The story centres on a 14-year-old boy, Hiro, and his relationship with a warm-hearted robot in the futuristic metropolis of Sanfransokyo (try getting your mouth around that portmanteau). Through a series of unexpected events, the young genius finds himself inspiring a team of Iron Man-style robo-suited heroes, whose aim is to take revenge on a mysterious masked villain for the death of a loved one. If it sounds suspiciously formulaic, the gaps between the action where Big Hero 6 prove its mettle, and Hiro\u2019s relationship with the inflatable Baymax provides some splendid comic moments. The matronly robot had been designed to take care of humans, but Hiro quickly retools it as a martial-arts expert and programmes it to take down the bad guys in scenes that will be familiar to anyone who remembers the \u201cI know kung fu\u201d phrase from The Matrix. If the Wachowskis had cast a walking, talking robo-teddy bear as Neo instead of Keanu Reeves, they might have produced a similar dynamic.     Big Hero 6 film still    This balance of warmth and Hiro\u2019s video game-style tinkerings sits at the heart of the movie. Our hero and his older brother, Tadashi, attend a fictional higher-education institute dedicated to advancing robot technology. And while I\u2019m sure Bunsen burners and experiments with rotten-egg smells aren\u2019t much of an introduction to building robo-suited superhero teams, the message of film-makers is so sincere that any cynicism quickly evaporates. \u201cWe wanted to make [the characters] aspirational,\u201d producer Roy Conli told me. \u201cThe structure of the story led into that, and there\u2019s this whole kind of maker culture happening right now. The idea is that Hiro and his friends are really smart, really active, and they use their intelligence to create.\u201d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3biFxZIJOQ Conli said the film-makers deliberately picked an obscure comic book to adapt to film. \u201cThis was always going to be a Disney movie, and we certainly couldn\u2019t grab any of the Marvel properties that are being filmed now,\u201d he said. \u201cFinding something off to the side gave us complete freedom. The original comic book was set in Tokyo, and we\u2019ve made it San Fransokyo; Baymax originally was not a healthcare companion. Having that freedom allowed us to create a different world and characters.\u201d It\u2019s been a long time since the hokey kid-sidekick trope, ubiquitous in the 1940s and 50s, was allowed on the big screen. Iron Man 3 even referenced its unpopularity among fanboys with a great put-down by Robert Downey Jr. But Big Hero 6 looks like it has found a way to bring that stalwart of golden age back to multiplexes without any corniness. It is a comic-book movie for kids, but people of any age will love it \u2013 whether they\u2019re six or 66. \u2022 Big Hero 6 marks Disney\u2019s first proper step into comic-book adaptation"}, {"sentences": ["Had Japan respected the vote, it would have extended until 2016 a one year moratorium that Tokyo declared after the International Court of Justice judged it in breach of IWC rules on scientific whaling.", "Tokyo should now present details of its planned whale cull project later this year, ahead of a meeting of the IWC\u2019s scientific committee which should take place in early 2015."], "tags": ["Whaling", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Marine life", "Whales", "Environment", "Oceans", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-18T11:39:17Z", "title": "Japan defies IWC ruling on \u2018scientific whaling\u2019", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/18/japan-whaling-southern-ocean-iwc-ruling", "article": "Japan has responded to a non-binding International Whaling Commission (IWC) vote to impose strict limits on its \u2018scientific whaling\u2019 programme, by announcing that it will proceed with a new round of culls in the Southern Ocean next year regardless.

That figure contrasts wildly with the number cited by the International Court of Justice [ICJ] when it halted the Antarctic hunt in March. In its ruling, the ICJ judges upheld Australia\u2019s claim that Japan, having published just two peer-reviewed papers since 2005, had failed to fulfil its scientific brief. Those papers, Australia added, had been based on data obtained from the slaughter of just nine whales. The presiding judge, Peter Tomka, said at the time that Jarpa II \u2013 the name given to Japan\u2019s research programme in the Antarctic since 2005 \u2013 had produced little of scientific value. \u201cIn light of the fact the Jarpa II has been going on since 2005, and has involved the killing of about 3,600 minke whales, the scientific output to date appears limited. \u201cJapan shall revoke any existent authorisation, permit or licence granted in relation to Jarpa II and refrain from granting any further permits in pursuance to the program.\u201d The Institute of Cetacean Research, the semi-governmental body in Tokyo that overseas the hunts, did not respond to queries on Thursday, but states that Japan submitted 130 peer-reviewed papers based on Jarpa and Jarpa II between 1988 and 2013. A list of the papers, their authors, the subject matter and date of publication appear on the institute\u2019s website. The vast majority are either unpublished or appeared in reports for the IWC, not journals that peer review papers before publishing them. But Patrick Ramage, director of the global whale programme at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said the ICJ figure of two is the only internationally recognised assessment of Japan\u2019s scientific contribution. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of dead whales per paper and a lot of tax subsidies from the people of Japan in return for some poor science,\u201d Ramage told the Guardian from Slovenia, where the members of the IWC are holding their biennial meeting. \u201cJapan is talking about the quantity of paperwork rather than the quality of peer-reviewed papers. There has been a blizzard of working papers submitted by Japan to the IWC scientific committee, but these are not the same as scientific papers for peer-reviewed quality scientific journals. \u201cMorishita was making a conscious effort to confuse the committee on this point, but the world court was very clear on this. He was advancing a specious cultural argument, suggesting that Japanese scientists should not be held to recognised international standards.\u201d According to the cetacean research institute, the aims of the scientific research include improving the management of minke whale stocks in the southern hemisphere, as well as studying the role of whales in the marine ecosystem and the effect of environmental change on whale populations. An official in the international affairs division of Japan\u2019s fisheries agency said the vast majority of the papers mentioned by Morishita had been submitted to, and closely scrutinised by, the IWC\u2019s scientific committee. \u201cEven if those papers are not peer-reviewed, committee members can ask questions about their contents and criticise them,\u201d the official said. Masayuki Komatsu, formerly Japan\u2019s chief negotiator at the IWC, said Japan had submitted a large number of papers to the scientific committee ranging from data on stocks and age structure to pregnancy rates in whale populations. \u201cBoth the ICJ and Morishita are correct,\u201d said Komatsu, now a visiting research professor at the International Centre for the Study of East Asian Development. \u201cThe ICJ is talking about papers that are available to the outside world because they appear in prestigious scientific journals. The papers Japan\u2019s submits to the IWC are not necessarily peer reviewed, but members of the scientific committee all get to see them. \u201cJapan is not to blame here. Its papers are rejected by scientific journals simply because they are based on data acquired through the killing of whales.

Arcade conversions made or broke a new home console, and the Tokyo Game Show was where we\u2019d first glimpse them.

The intriguing work of studios like Platinum, From Software and Grasshopper Manufacture is drawing worldwide interest again.

It\u2019s being co-produced by Yoshinori Ono, who looked after Street Fighter for many years, so expect gorgeous combat. It\u2019s out sometime in 2015. Yakuza Zero (Sega, PS3/PS4)            Sega\u2019s Yakuza series of cinematic crime adventures has only ever gained cult fandom in the West, but it is huge in Japan, shifting almost 10m units. The latest instalment is a prequel, taking place in 1988, and judging by the trailer it\u2019s a familiar mix of narrative intrigue, clubbing and ultraviolence. Its coming to PS3 and PS4, but there are no release details yet and no word on Western localisation, which has been missing for the last couple of titles. Silent Hills (Konami, PS4)            The latest title in Konami\u2019s psychological horror series drew huge amounts of attention at Gamescom, thanks to its terrifying \u201cP.T\u201d interactive teaser. Taking control are Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima and Pan\u2019s Labyrinth director Guillermo Del Toro, and they\u2019re not messing about, as this hair-raising new trailer attests. There are few story details as yet, and we won\u2019t see it (probably from behind the sofa) until 2016.  Bloodborne (Sony, PS4)            The new goth punk adventure from Hidetaka Miyazaki, the director of Demon\u2019s Souls and Dark Souls, is set in a mythical city beset with plague \u2013 and giant terrifying monsters. Expect intense unforgiving combat and gore hitting the paving stones like torrential rain. Also, the protagonist looks like a cross between Red Dead Redemption\u2019s John Marston and the Witchfinder General. It\u2019s due out next February. Scalebound (Xbox One)            The latest from Bayonetta and Vanquish developer Platinum Games has players slaying monsters on a forest world \u2013 with the help of a dragon. Apparently, the working relationship you form with this fire-breathing beast is the mechanic at the heart of the game. It all sounds... familiar, but director Hideki Kamiya says the studio has never made anything like it before. There\u2019s no release date for this Xbox One exclusive just yet. Evil Within (Bethesda, PC/PS3/PS4/Xbox 360/Xbox One)            An ornate yet terrifying building, a disillusioned cop, a whole host of hideous deadly creatures \u2013 it seems Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami hasn\u2019t strayed too far from the viscera-smeared track for this latest project. Eurogamer said it may turn out to be the best survival horror title for a decade, taking the genre back to its roots \u2013 i.e. constantly sense of impending death, jump shocks and creatures with just way too many razor sharp murder tentacles. Final Fantasy XV            With its open-world setting, real-time combat and decidedly darker atmosphere, the long-awaited 15th title in the epic role-playing adventure series has a new trailer for TGS. Fans have sunk into skepticism thanks to the game\u2019s nearly eight-year development cycle, but this may just lift the gloom. It\u2019s due out... oh don\u2019t even ask, literally no one knows \u2013 including legendary Final Fantasy (and Kingdom Hearts) director Tetsuya Nomura, who left the project earlier this year.

Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, said on a visit to Delhi that China would invest billions of dollars over the next five years in railways, industrial parks and, potentially, nuclear power in India. &quot;We can bring prosperity to Asia, and we can create opportunities for the world,&quot; Xi said during a ceremonial welcome at the presidential palace in the Indian capital before a meeting with Narendra Modi, India&apos;s newly elected prime minister. Modi claimed a landslide victory in May&apos;s elections after campaigning with a development agenda. The 64-year-old Hindu nationalist has often spoken of his admiration for the economic development achieved by China in recent decades and knows that his own country desperately needs a massive infusion of investment to improve its collapsing infrastructure. Experts said the amount pledged by Xi \u2013 $20bn (\u00a312bn) initially \u2013 was less than had been expected. &quot;It&apos;s disappointing. It did not match the hype created before the visit. There was even some rumours of $100bn being invested. This is $4bn a year, if it comes,&quot; said Srikant Kondapalli, an expert in India and China at Delhi&apos;s Jawaharlal Nehru University. Xi&apos;s visit to India started in the western state of Gujarat, which Modi ran for 12 years. The two men had dinner on Wednesday night in a tent set up on a redeveloped riverfront in the city of Ahmedabad. Trade between the two developing nations has increased rapidly in the last decade, reaching around $70bn last year, with China now India&apos;s largest trading partner. But India&apos;s trade deficit with China is already at about $40bn and there are fears that it could grow if China uses India as a dumping ground for cheap manufactured goods in the future. Despite the statements of goodwill, the visit has been overshadowed by a tense standoff in the Himalayas. Indian officials claim that hundreds of Chinese troops crossed the unmarked 2,200-mile mountain frontier between the two states last week. Modi told a press conference after the meeting with Xi: &quot;We need to ensure that there is peace along the border, and if there is, we can work together in mutual cooperation. If this happens we can realise true potential of our relations.&quot; Border incidents are common, though the timing of this confrontation has troubled observers. &quot;If some of the reports about the number of Chinese troops involved are true then it is the biggest mobilisation for a long time. It&apos;s not clear why. Perhaps there is some difference in the civil-military relationship and this is a message to Xi Jingping [from the military],&quot; Kondapalli said. Xi, who is only the third Chinese premier to visit India, described the border issue as a long-term problem. &quot;As the area is yet to be demarcated, there may be some incidents,&quot; he told reporters. Xi also said China would support India becoming a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a regional security body whose largest members are China and Russia. The relationship between the two regional powers is complex, with both looking for commercial advantages while mindful of core security concerns. One long-term irritation for Beijing is the presence of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader, in India. Despite tight security, dozens of Tibetan protesters held a noisy demonstration outside the building where the two leaders met on Thursday morning in central Delhi. Dorjee Tseten, of Students for a Free Tibet International, said: &quot;Xi Jinping is leading one of the most oppressive military offensives that Tibetans have faced in the past 50 years of China&apos;s occupation of our country.&quot; New Delhi had earlier asked the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet for India in 1959 and is considered a &quot;separatist&quot; by Beijing, to reschedule a conclave of religious leaders scheduled for this week in the capital so that it would not clash with the Chinese president&apos;s visit. The Tibetan leader says he seeks only greater autonomy for his homeland, and on Thursday he urged Xi to learn from India&apos;s democracy. &quot;I think the Chinese president should learn some of India&apos;s experience. Look, east India, south India, west India, north India, different language, different script. But no danger of separation,&quot; he said. &quot;Democratic rule, rule of law and free media \u2026&quot; In a column published in a local newspaper prior to his arrival, Xi said the &quot;Chinese dragon&quot; and the &quot;Indian elephant&quot; both cherished peace and shared one of the most dynamic and promising bilateral relations of the 21st century. Xi, who took power in 2012, arrives after touring the Maldives and Sri Lanka, two countries where growing Chinese influence has worried India. Delhi also has concerns about China&apos;s relationship with its hostile neighbour Pakistan and its growing role in Nepal. Beijing has been unsettled by Indian-US cooperation in the Asia Pacific region and Indian&apos;s stance on territorial disputes involving China and other nations in the South and East China Seas. Modi&apos;s efforts to build a rapport with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, during a heavily publicised recent visit to Tokyo and his plans to meet Barack Obama later this month point to a carefully balanced approach to India&apos;s relations with world powers. China and India fought a war in 1962 which ended in a crushing defeat for Delhi&apos;s forces."}, {"sentences": ["Seishin Joshi Gakuin (Sacred Heart) school, Tokyo, Japan, photographed 7 September 2011.", "Photograph: James Mollison    Seishin Joshi Gakuin (Sacred Heart) schoolTokyo, Japan, photographed 7 September 2011 This is one of the most prestigious schools in Tokyo; the empress of Japan is an ex-student."], "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Culture", "Education", "World news", "Schools"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-19T15:54:43Z", "title": "State of play: school playgrounds from Kenya to Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/19/-sp-tate-of-play-school-playgrounds-from-kenya-to-japan", "article": "Paso Payita schoolAramasi, Chuquisaca, Bolivia, photographed 9 August 2011 Situated in a remote area on rough terrain 3,000m above sea level, the school has two teachers and 31 students aged from six to 12 years. Many students have to walk several miles to school. A road to the village was built only 15 years ago and there are no cars or buses. Most people are indigenous Quechua peasant farmers. Half of the students go on to secondary school, of whom half again go to university in Santa Cruz. A few years ago, an ecological toilet was installed; the children are now teaching their parents and grandparents about the advantages of using such toilets. The school building was small and dishevelled compared with the smart ecological toilets (built by Unicef). There was a big football field and the grass is kept short by goats. I had just missed the afternoon break, but the headteacher said it would be fine to give the kids another 10 minutes outside. The entire school came out; the boys played football while the girls played tug of war.     Likoni school for the blind. Likoni, Mombasa, Kenya, photographed 25 March 2011. Photograph: James Mollison Photograph: James Mollison    Likoni school for the blindLikoni, Mombasa, Kenya, photographed 25 March 2011 This school has 166 students. Many of them were born with albinism, a condition that often leads to visual impairments. Some sighted students who also have albinism are sent to the school to protect them from kidnapping by agents of witch doctors in Tanzania, where it is believed that body parts of people with the condition can bring wealth.  The students go home to their villages for a visit every three months. The school tries to allow students to move at their own pace and not force them to leave when they get to a certain age. Blind people receive no support once they leave school. A friendly head teacher welcomed us in. Hearing about the trade in body parts, I felt shocked and sad as we sat with the intrigued pupils, who wanted to touch our faces and camera. It was a particularly bright, hot day and the kids had only hats for protection. The boys played boisterous games, spinning the merry-go-round as fast as they could, trying to fling people off it, and feeling their way around the climbing frames.     Nativity School. South Central Los Angeles, US, photographed 10 November 2011. Photograph: James Mollison    Nativity SchoolSouth Central Los Angeles, US, photographed 10 November 2011 Founded by the Sisters of Loretto in 1924, this Catholic school has 330 students and is in a low-income area with a high crime rate. There have been several drive-by shootings nearby and once a stray bullet went through a wall. The school is private and charges $210 a month, but 65% of the students are unable to pay the full amount. It is a struggle to get enough money to pay the teachers.  When I was 16, living in tranquil north Oxford in the UK, NWA released Straight Outta Compton. LA sounded like a pretty scary place. I wondered what Ice Cube\u2019s school would have been like. So we set out to find schools in South Central Los Angeles; Nativity was the only one that said yes. The area has seen an influx of Latinos, who seemed to be the majority at the school. In the break, a group played dodgeball, a game I loved at school. Next to me some kids sold nachos to other students, raising money for the school.      Bhakta Vidyashram school. Kathmandu, Nepal, photographed 5 December 2011. Photograph: James Mollison    Bhakta Vidyashram schoolKathmandu, Nepal, photographed 5 December 2011 The school\u2019s two classrooms are on the ground floor of the building on the right. There are about 100 pupils, many from outside Kathmandu. The classroom amenities are basic and the children often can\u2019t afford books and pencils. Education in Nepal was traditionally based on home schooling for the elites. In 1950, only 5% of the population was literate; now it is over 60%, but barriers to education for lower castes remain. Most of the schools we found in Kathmandu had no playgrounds. We stumbled on this school by chance. The kids were unsupervised at break time. Their playground was actually a public square with a temple; an elderly man whose job seemed to be to look after it seemed oblivious to the noise as the kids screamed around him. They had no toys, but a lot of fun pulling each other around on cardboard.      Aida boys\u2019 school. Aida refugee camp, Bethlehem, photographed 8 September 2013. Photograph: James Mollison    Aida boys\u2019 schoolAida refugee camp, Bethlehem, photographed 8 September 2013  This camp was set up in 1950 for Palestinians who had been displaced from their villages, and the school was built shortly after. There are 395 students. During the first intifada, the school was close to the confrontation line between the Israelis and Palestinians, and the classroom walls were thickened to protect against bullets. In 2004, the Israelis built a wall right outside the entrance. As I entered Bethlehem, the road ran next to the wall, which was often covered in graffiti and art, including a Banksy dove.  The third and fourth graders watch the towers to see if the soldiers are looking and, if not, they throw stones at them. When hostilities flare up, the smell of teargas can be so strong that the headteacher has to send the students home. The boys in the playground were pretty rowdy; the headteacher later told me that the school used to be next to a convent, but the nuns complained that the boys made so much noise at break, they couldn\u2019t concentrate on their prayers. I asked him what he thought the boys made of the wall. He described it as \u201ca humiliation in front of them every day, a restriction on their future\u201d. Outside his office was a pin board of photos of the school riddled with bullet holes, from the first intifada.      Seishin Joshi Gakuin (Sacred Heart) school, Tokyo, Japan, photographed 7 September 2011. Photograph: James Mollison    Seishin Joshi Gakuin (Sacred Heart) schoolTokyo, Japan, photographed 7 September 2011 This is one of the most prestigious schools in Tokyo; the empress of Japan is an ex-student. The school was founded in 1908 by four nuns from Australia; students have daily prayer and philosophy studies. Discipline is important and student responsibilities include organising committees, voluntary services and working in the library. Twice a week all students have to clean the classrooms and the toilets. You enter the school through a wooded area. It has two main playgrounds, an athletics track and tennis courts. When we first went to the school, it was closed for the holidays, but we had a formal meeting with the deputy head in his office. After several minutes I began to feel itchy. I looked at the deputy head and could make out fleas walking on his shirt and fleas climbing on our translator\u2019s face. It didn\u2019t seem appropriate to say anything as the Japanese are so polite. As soon as we said goodbye, I rushed to the bathroom and took off my trousers to try to get rid of them.  We returned the next week and found the school spotlessly clean.      St Augustine school Montserrat, photographed 18 May 2012. Photograph: James Mollison    St Augustine schoolMontserrat, photographed 18 May 2012 Since its foundation in 1875, St Augustine school has faced several natural disasters. The building was twice destroyed by hurricanes. After hurricane Hugo, a major fundraising effort resulted in a modern multistorey building , consecrated in 1991. The 1995 volcanic eruption forced the school to evacuate and eventually engulfed that new building. The school moved to a private house in a safe zone, to which new buildings and playgrounds have been added. There are 135 pupils, from families ranging from affluent to poor.  Most of the boys spent the break playing cricket, while the girls chatted enthusiastically. The picture is centred around a moment when a girl who was running tripped over, making her classmates laugh. There were only two white kids, and the boy spent the break wandering around on his own.      Holtz high school Tel Aviv, Israel, photographed 12 September 2013. Photograph: James Mollison    Holtz high schoolTel Aviv, Israel, photographed 12 September 2013 The high school and technical college is affiliated to the Israeli air force; it has 850 pupils. Conscription exists for all Israeli citizens over 18 (Arab-Israelis are exempted) and nearly all the pupils will be drafted into the air force, as computer or electronics engineers and mechanics. They come from all over the country, either because they want a military career, or because their parents want their kids to have discipline. We arrived on a parade day, welcomed by the jovial headteacher. I watched students practise military drills. The photograph was taken just afterwards. As well as chess and ping-pong tables, the playground had a few old military aircraft; I wasn\u2019t sure if they were a kind of museum or for lessons. The school couldn\u2019t have been more different from the arts school I visited in Jerusalem the day before, where girls had dyed hair and there was even the occasional goth.      The Royal Ballet school Richmond Park, London, photographed 13 May 2010. Photograph: James Mollison    The Royal Ballet school Richmond Park, London, photographed 13 May 2010  The school is split between Richmond Park and Covent Garden; its mission is to train outstanding classical ballet dancers. Every year there are 3,000 applications for just 25 places, and students come from mixed backgrounds: 89% currently rely on state scholarships. The students often have to run to their next class to allow time to change into the right kit. Boys and girls keep to their separate groups. Getting access to the school took months of negotiation. When we finally did, arriving there was quite magical, entering Richmond Park with all its deer, and then the beautiful grounds of the White Lodge, originally a hunting lodge for George II. The school doesn\u2019t have break times, but they do have a bit of time after lunch. The school had suggested bringing a choreographer for the photo, but I wanted it to be as natural as possible. \u2022 James Mollison\u2019s photographs will be published next year by Aperture in a new book, Playground.

For me, it sums up our annual mass family Easter holidays. We started this tradition when Sarah was one and have carried on ever since. The original idea was so that the different generations of the family could get together for a walking holiday. Some days, while we did more challenging walks, the older ones could look after the children, as in this\u00a0photograph. In 1983, we started off with a basic cottage in Boot, Cumbria where water came through the bathroom light. Over the years, houses have become more luxurious with dishwashers as standard and one year a hot tub. Generally, we spend the holiday in the north of England but for two years we ventured to the north of Mallorca, with its high limestone ridges and good coastal walks. Easter Sunday morning is traditionally a chocolate fest, large eggs for the younger ones and enough small eggs to last the rest of us all week. There is always a \u201cbig walk\u201d where as many as possible do around eight miles and climb a hill or two. For the rest of the week we do other walks and trips out but not necessarily all together. However, the main delight is spending time with extended family coming from all parts of England. Now, sadly, my father and most of the older generation are no longer with us. The children grew into keen walkers, then as teenagers were not\u00a0so\u00a0keen. These days, they are the stronger, fitter ones and we are slowing down. We have now come full circle. This year, Sarah\u2019s daughter, Rosa, came on holiday with us \u2013 the first of the next generation \u2013 and it was my turn to carry a grandchild in the papoose, bringing back all those memories of Dad carrying Sarah on his back. Margaret Manning Playlist: Heartbreak at my first\u00a0disco Turning Japanese by the Vapors \u201cYou\u2019ve got me turning up and turning down / and turning in and turning \u2018round / I\u2019m turning Japanese / I think I\u2019m turning Japanese / I really think so\u201d         Turning Japanese by the Vapors.    I\u2019m waiting for my children in the reception area at their junior school a few years ago. I can hear the hum of pop music coming from the school hall where the disco is being held. I peer through the heavy curtain and spot my son Sean, bag of Monster Munch in one hand and white plastic cup in the other, chatting to his mates. On the other side of the dance floor, my daughter, Moe, is happily bopping with a posse of girls in a circle. I notice a little boy steal a quick peck on her cheek. Well, it was a Valentine\u2019s disco, I suppose. Watching this pre-teen drama in front of me floods me with nostalgia for my own school disco days in the early 80s and the first time I ever got up and danced to music in public. At my first school disco, all I wanted was to smooch with the girl of my dreams, Frances Taylor. However, she happened to sit down next to my best friend, Sean Casey \u2013 and that would lead to my dreams of romance being shattered because they got on far too well. I remember sitting there, hopes dashed, trying desperately not to let my emotional discomfort at missing my chance with Frances get me down. The DJ had played Blondie, Squeeze, Madness, Depeche Mode, Duran Duran \u2026 I was still glued to my chair. My furtive glances at Frances and Sean, who were clearly enraptured, were destroying my confidence. I must get up and dance after the next song, I told myself. I had never boogied at a disco before, by the way. My heart was racing at the prospect. Then, that oriental riff of Turning Japanese began and I was up on the floor, carried away by the beat, lost in the jamboree of 80s dungarees, Bowie baggies, rah-rah skirts, leg warmers, berets, headbands, quiffs and myriad mullets. I moved to Tokyo in the late 90s so you could say I\u2019ve been Turning Japanese for the past 14 years. I got married to Maki in 2001 and our first child, Sean \u2013 a coincidence that he shares a name with my old boyhood friend \u2013 was born later that year.

Photograph: Image Source/REX    Mix everything well, bottle and cool before drinking. The food in 1980s north-east Scotland wasn\u2019t that exciting. Rice was for pudding. Curry had raisins and slices of banana in it. I ate my first pizza \u2013 and first lasagne \u2013 after leaving for university. But our mum, a housewife who\u2019d left school at 14, was a magnificent cook. She got the Cordon Bleu course in weekly instalments. She made prawn cocktail, mingling her own mayonnaise and concocting Marie Rose sauce from scratch. (This led to an\u00a0unfortunate incident in which I took\u00a0a swig from the Tabasco sauce bottle to see what it tasted like. It tasted like something I had to follow\u00a0up immediately with the entire\u00a0contents of the milk jug.)\u00a0 Mum threw magnificent parties too. I can remember guests stacked up the stairs of our wee council house, plates of food on their laps, while my dad\u2019s musical friends played fiddle and accordion music in the hall. After he built himself Scotland\u2019s finest shed \u2013 cat-flap, double-glazing, cornice and all \u2013 she laid on a shed-warming party, with pumpkin soup served from the carved-out shell. At some point in the early 1980s, when such exotica had begun to appear in the shops, she began making her own Irish cream. I\u2019m not sure where the recipe came from, but in her blue hard-backed notebook it seems to be in my handwriting. I spent my first two years at university going out with the teetotal son of a minister, so I didn\u2019t drink then. In my third year, single again, I copied out the recipe once more, this time for my own use. I still remember the thrill of naughtiness I felt at buying a quarter bottle of whisky to make it with, then carrying it up the street to a friend\u2019s flat, my hands wrapped round the Pyrex measuring jug.

Rather, it was Riley, a playable dog character with a knack for charming jaded gamers, and who quickly became a star of the online realm.

A light RPG set in the rolling hills of Albion, the game in its opening chapters introduced a wandering nameless dog, with which the player could build a symbiotic relationship. It was, as much as any of the best fictional relationships in videogames, meaningful, rewarding, and strangely touching. And if you stuck by your four-legged companion, you could eventually even name the creature. The Fable series famously let the player develop as either a being of good or evil, and in the second release in the main canon in particular, the dog\u2019s behaviour was one of the most apparent indicators of the protagonist\u2019s position on that spectrum. Good dogs, it turns out, are playful retrievers.     The laughing dog in Duck Hunt.

FUTURE TECH Game Jams The idea of a game jam is simple. Make a game, typically within 24 hours to one week, competing with other teams while recognising a brief revealed at the moment of the starting whistle. The largest, such as Global Game Jam, welcome tens of thousands of entrants. The smallest might be a creative exercise within a game studio. They let developers flex creative muscle, welcome newcomers to the world of making games, and even spawn hit releases such as Surgeon Simulator. As September and October roll on, there are jams for NES development and building your own controllers. And if you want to play some jam creations, late August saw Ludum Dare spawn 2,539 games around the theme \u201cconnected worlds\u201d. Try them for free. PIXEL PERFECT Retro rebooted Arcade classic Crazy Taxi was always a game with mass appeal in its sights. So perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that the 1999 release has now been reworked for smartphone and tablet, rebranded as Crazy Taxi: City Rush. Kenji Kanno, the man behind the original, is on hand as executive producer, and his effort for touchscreen devices is undeniably fun. It\u2019s effectively an on-rails \u201cendless driver\u201d \u2013 think Temple Run on wheels \u2013 and is a free-to-play affair. Like many \u201cfree\u201d mobile games, City Rush favours those that spend money on extras, and sometimes its appetite for cash can feel irksome. But the spirit and energy of the original is firmly in place, and, the endless running gameplay is surprisingly evocative of the pace of the arcade original."}, {"sentences": ["Top eight stories on MediaGuardian     Queues formed in London and Tokyo for the launch of the iPhone 6 on 19 September."], "tags": ["Media"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-22T07:54:45Z", "title": "Today's media stories from the papers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/22/media-briefing-monday-22-september", "article": "Top eight stories on MediaGuardian     Queues formed in London and Tokyo for the launch of the iPhone 6 on 19 September.

Having depicted on screen Chinese women falling for members of the Japanese occupation forces, she read in the newspapers that she was to be publicly executed at Shanghai&apos;s horse track. Then, as if in the plot of a baroque opera \u2013 a genre that would have suited her vocally \u2013 her family register was smuggled in, within the head of a doll. The document proved that Li had been born Yamaguchi Yoshiko, the daughter of Japanese parents in Manchuria, a colony of Japan before the second world war. Yamaguchi became one of millions to be repatriated to the main Japanese islands. But her singing talent, fame, and ability with languages was to propel her through careers in journalism and politics. When their daughter was born, Yamaguchi&apos;s parents had befriended two influential Chinese men; the girl became their goddaughter and so also acquired the Chinese name Li Xianglan. Her musical talent was developed by lessons with professional singers, often Russian. From the age of 13 and using another Chinese name bestowed upon her, Pan Shuhua, she attended high school in Beijing. Here she added to her proficiency in Mandarin \u2013 unusual enough among Japanese settlers \u2013 by acquiring all the mannerisms of Chinese girls. In 1934, recruited by a radio station to sing Chinese tunes, she used her adopted name of Li Xianglan, which she retained as her career developed. By the age of 18, she had been recruited by Manchuria Film Productions, or Man&apos;ei, the rapidly expanding film studio in Harbin, Manchuria. The initial idea had been for her to sing, but Man&apos;ei rapidly realised that it could develop her acting and personality to further its transnational aims. The problem for the commercially minded propagandists at Man&apos;ei was that its early films had little success in China, with films such as China Nights (1940) faring much better in Japan. The three Chinese characters of her stage name rendered into Japanese as Ri Koran, the performer always appeared in a Chinese qipao dress, and her recordings launched a craze for &quot;continental&quot; songs and films. Back in China, the film, where it was not boycotted entirely, caused particular offence by showing the star taking a violent slap from her Japanese admirer as a proof of affection, resulting in marriage in short order. It was films such as this that were produced as evidence for the prosecution in Shanghai. In reality, virtually no one had seen them, even after the considerable Chinese success of her later film Eternity (1942), from which came her hit song Stop Smoking, about opium. Up to the end of the war, Shanghai periodicals doted on the persona of Li Xianglan. Li&apos;s Japanese origin was never entirely obscured, even though the star continued to represent China&apos;s young women. Taking daily English and Russian lessons in Shanghai, Li was better equipped than most to deal with the defeat of her native Japan, but being put on trial for her roles seems to have come as a genuine shock. Back in Tokyo, her fame still lay in her persona as Ri Koran. The script of Desertion at Dawn (1950), initially an adaptation by Akira Kurosawa, went through six major rewrites under occupation censorship. Strongly condemning militarism, it depicted the love of a Japanese soldier for a Chinese &quot;comfort woman&quot;. Its success at the box office prompted further nostalgic musical memories of the empire that were less nuanced as the moral crusade of the occupation had dissolved. But Yamaguchi went on to star in a Kurosawa film, Scandal (1950), which dealt with the media-hounding of an actress. Yamaguchi travelled to the US that year, taking the first name Shirley. She starred in two Hollywood films, and befriended figures such as Charlie Chaplin, working on the musical soundtrack of Limelight (1952). Her marriage to the American sculptor Noguchi Isamu in 1952 lasted only a few years, and she was later denied entry to the US because of her association with names such as Chaplin. Her final acting appearances came in some Hong Kong films, apparently lost in a fire. By this time, she had married a Japanese diplomat, Otaka Hiroshi; formally, she kept her married name Otaka Yoshiko after his death in 2001. To later generations in the 1960s and 70s she was known as a television journalist on Asian subjects, often focusing on Palestine and women&apos;s issues. She pursued these concerns as a representative of the upper house of the Japanese legislative body, the Diet, for 18 years. A musical of her career ran in Tokyo for more than 20 years. Her voice may yet be her most enduring legacy. Recordings from Russia, seemingly acquired and treasured by postwar Red Army soldiers, can be heard on YouTube, and testify to a voice that hits every note in the middle, without a hint of vibrato. \u2022 Yoshiko Yamaguchi (Li Xianglan), actor, journalist and politician, born 12 February 1920; died 7 September 2014"}, {"sentences": ["You\u2019re not thinking of Birds of Tokyo giving a tinny run-through of a single that sold 2,500 copies as a crowd of startled baby boomers cover their ears in nearby seats."], "tags": ["AFL", "Australian rules football", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-22T21:38:20Z", "title": "The Joy of Six: AFL grand final entertainment", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/sep/23/the-joy-of-six-afl-grand-final-entertainment", "article": "1) Meatloaf, 2011 It probably pays to start by pointing out that the phrase \u201cAFL grand final entertainment\u201d is something of an oxymoron. Not only do we need to expect that it will be rubbish, it should actually be rubbish. As the whole thing becomes more and more out of hand by the year, it\u2019s heartening to know that while the league is still throwing six figure cheques at Meatloaf and Tom Jones, maybe they\u2019re even in on the whole joke themselves. People who want a tasteful grand final entertainment show are the same people who go to Sizzler and ask what the soup of the day is. Pleading for the AFL to book Arcade Fire is like lamenting that Sharknado wasn\u2019t directed by Wim Wenders or hoping that Usain Bolt turns up for the Stawell Gift. You\u2019re missing the point entirely. The bigger the shambles it is, the better Think back to the grand final entertainment moments that you most remember. You\u2019re not thinking of Birds of Tokyo giving a tinny run-through of a single that sold 2,500 copies as a crowd of startled baby boomers cover their ears in nearby seats. What you\u2019ll more likely think of is Meatloaf\u2019s high-speed train-wreck or Angry Anderson bursting out the Batmobile at Waverley Park. Grand final day is a time for a sausage sizzle and some karaoke, not pulled pork sliders and The Temper Trap. Meatloaf is now the benchmark for crappy international acts, obviously, but he left us with so many lasting memories, as well as the greatest ever photo of Andrew Demetriou (yes, even better than the one where he\u2019s pretending that he doesn\u2019t want to burn Gillon McLachlan\u2019s mustard jacket).  Meatloaf was not a cautionary tale though, he was a template for the greatest form of unintentional comedy that sport can offer. It\u2019s also worth pointing out (as Craig Willis does in his intro) that three million Australians bought Bat out of Hell, making it the highest selling international album in the country. Ever. We can hardly turn our noses up at the vocal stylings of an aging, superannuated \u2018Loaf. We\u2019re massive bogans and we got what we deserved.              2) Daryl Somers goes a bit Don Johnson, 1987 There\u2019s always been something gloriously unselfconscious about Daryl Somers. Very early on in his career he must have internalised his self-doubt and just gone for it. He was basically a proto David Brent. Luckily for him, that\u2019s also the best approach to singing on grand final day, though the thought process behind the league hiring Somers to sing Waltzing Matilda and the national anthem before the 1987 decider is a little harder to understand.  As usual the Somers performance approach lacked any subtly whatsoever, though the levels of cheese were at least appropriate for the era. His Miami Vice style white suit (a move later replicated with far less appeal by Ricky Martin and Jessica Mauboy at the 2013 NRL grand final) with the sleeves turned up deserves particular attention. The whole aesthetic couldn\u2019t have been any more American Psycho if Somers had pulled out a giant mobile phone and tried to get a reservation at Dorsia over the PA system.  Somers wasn\u2019t alone in his gaudy aesthetic, to be entirely fair. The 1987 grand final featured more mullets than a Bon Jovi video, as did the 1989 edition starring John Farnham (during that extravaganza, other attractions included Melbourne\u2019s craptastic and ill-fated audition to host the 1996 Olympics, where it was clearly decreed that 1996 would look a lot like 1982). The Voice also sang his own absurdly pompous and self-indulgent a capella rendition of Waltzing Matlida. If you can get through it, reward yourself with a can of Mello Yello.            3) Maroochy Barambah\u2019s misfire, 1993 Even if the grand final itself was a blow-out ill-befitting the excitement and glorious footballing aesthetic of the season, 1993 was a great year for the AFL. In the International Year of the World\u2019s Indigenous People, the league was given an awful reminder of the lack of national progress in race relations when Collingwood fans infamously abused Nicky Winmar and Gilbert McAdam at Victoria Park. Soon though the season turned into fitting celebration of the contribution of its Indigenous players when Gavin Wanganeen won the Brownlow Medal and his team-mate Michael Long the Norm Smith in a scintillating grand final performance. Indigenous artist Bronwyn Bancroft designed an eye-catching cover for the Football Record and it was natural enough that the league should look to a host of Indigenous performers for their grand final entertainment show. Mostly this went brilliantly, with traditional and contemporary elements of Indigenous cultures including dance and music from 800 schoolchildren, who were joined by Archie Roach and Yothu Yindi.  It all went off without a hitch until opera singer Maroochy Barambah stepped forward and gave the most heartbreakingly nervous renditions of the both the national anthem and Waltzing Matilda that you could ever imagine. Failing to find her vocal range, Barambah also lost time with the band by the second line of the first verse and thus endured the worst nightmare imaginable for any vocalist, stranded on her own with no choice but to soldier on.             4) The Seekers, 1994 Having established my thesis that grand final entertainment is at its best when it\u2019s unmitigated bollocks, it is also worth noting that on the odd occasion, perhaps entirely by accident, the league has actually pulled off something tasteful and enjoyable. At the risk of being stoned to death by the cool police, the 1994 finale performance (well, finale in the same sense that Kiss have been on a farewell tour for the last 25 years) of Judith Durham and the Seekers was actually quite touching. Something that 10-year-old me probably didn\u2019t realise was that I Am Australian was not only performed with rare and distinct beauty in that Seekers grand final set, but was actually written by the band member Bruce Woodley (with the help of Dobe Newton of The Bushwackers, all you trivia nerds). For anyone who was primary school age when I am Australian was on high rotation, it seemed mawkish and it kind of is, but it\u2019s also a far greater history lesson and plainly a better song that any others we\u2019ve adopted as anthems.  In their understated way The Seekers smashed it out of the park in \u201994, proving that harmony and melody can fill a stadium just as well if not better than the more bombastic pop acts who\u2019ve followed. I think if I was a Geelong supporter there probably would have been a good decade or so where hearing any of these songs would have tipped me into an alcoholic spiral (see 1 min 47 in the clip below for a nice pre-game shot of Michael Mansfield looking like he wants to be literally anywhere else on Earth bar the MCG, and 2 mins 52 for Leigh Colbert doing the same), but for mostly everyone else it was a joyous and innocent sing-along. It gives a little shiver even now.            5) Angry Anderson - Bound for Glory, 1991 We all know that Angry Anderson\u2019s performance of Bound for Glory at the 1991 grand final stands imperiously at the summit of the steep mountain that is pre-game entertainment. It laughs maniacally at all other contenders to be honest, so rather than waste time deciding its exact position in the pantheon of 1990s Australian pop culture, let\u2019s skip straight to a breakdown of the best moments from the performance. 0:03 \u2013 Most references to this moment will talk about the Batmobile that Anderson rode in on. Putting aside Chris O\u2019Donnell\u2019s performance in 1996\u2019s Batman and Robin, was there ever a greater indignity for the franchise than the construction of this vehicle? The answer you are looking for is \u201cno\u201d. 0:16 \u2013 Deek looks to be channeling David Byrne with both his suit and his facial expression. \u201cHow did I get here?\u201d he must have been asking himself. I also love that the driver is trying to hide his private shame with a huge pair of sunglasses. Look how overcast it is. Those things are a mask. 1:10 \u2013 To whom is Angry giving a fist pump and oh gosh, is that leather jacket a remnant from Rose Tattoo\u2019s 1983 national tour because it looks a little snug? Brownlow medalist Jim Stynes is currently feeling the culture divide worse than at any point in his time in the country \u2013 who is this loon? 2:08 \u2013 Woah! First celeb spot of the clip \u2013 Lionel Rose and Fighting Harada coming at you like a shot out of a cannon. Why are they there? Neither of them looks like they know. 2:14 \u2013 The slightly humiliated look on Deek\u2019s face as he reads out the Bound for Glory line that the producer has clearly scribbled onto his cue card at the last minute. Ooh look, members of the Oarsome Foursome. How prescient. But what are Kathy Watt and Gary Niewand? Chopped liver? 2:33 \u2013 Stop wondering, this is the point at which we turn it up to eleven. \u201cMelbourne, let\u2019s show the world what we\u2019re made of.\u201d Namely, paunchy middle-aged pub rockers is skintight leather jackets. 2:52 \u2013 \u2018Who is this man laughing?\u2019 Like any well-adjusted adult, I\u2019ve often asked myself that question as I\u2019ve sat watching this clip on a loop in the dark. I\u2019m skipping ahead slightly and noting that Jeff Fenech in the house and that this grand final took place in between two of his most famous fights so my conclusion is that the laughing man is Azumah Nelson. Am I right? Please hit the comments section with your theories. 3:04 \u2013 Again, the look on Deek\u2019s face is just so gloriously uncomfortable that it screams to be screen grabbed, blown up and and pasted onto every billboard in Australia. Couldn\u2019t they have just let him out of the car as Angry started singing? He looks like the world\u2019s most polite hostage. 3:18 \u2013 Fenech and \u2018Zoom Zoom\u2019 in the same shot. It is him, isn\u2019t it? Fenech is appropriately confused and Lionel Rose looks like he\u2019s watching a madman light himself on fire. In some ways he is. 3:35 \u2013 As Jim Stynes is tries to avoid being belted in the face by the national flag and endures Angry\u2019s performance, he\u2019s just become more Australian than he ever thought he could be. Someone could have thrown a Four n Twenty pie at him in that instant and he couldn\u2019t have become more Aussie. 3:45 \u2013 West Coast supporter mock-enthusiastically dances to get on TV but is too embarrassed when he does so returns to his previous business of attempting to light a dart, which I\u2019m assuming he then legally smoked at his seat. 4:11 \u2013 I know I\u2019m referencing David Brent for the second time in one blog post, but that little twist Angry does to change direction wouldn\u2019t look out of place in the Office episode where Brent becomes a motivational speaker. The outfit is pretty much spot-on too. 5:40 \u2013 Angry reaches his undisputed peak as a human being when to the sound of absolutely zero fan response, he raises his arms triumphantly. Most people wouldn\u2019t have the gall to do that in front of the mirror let alone standing in front of 75,000 people. Why? Because most people are not Angry Anderson. 6:30 \u2013 Appropriately, Angry leaves possibly my favourite part of the entire show for the finale. Just like in Talladega Nights when Ricky Bobby doesn\u2019t know what to do with his hands, Angry has absolutely no clue about an appropriate way to sign off his performance so he just awkwardly leans against the Batmobile like he\u2019s filling it up with petrol at the servo. What a moment in rock \u2018n roll history.            \u00a0 6) Ricky May SANFL grand final, 1987 OK, it\u2019s cheating to include a performance from an SANFL grand final but we\u2019re a broad church here and Australian football is a national game after all. This one is also just too incredible to neglect. Like Maroochy Barambah six years later, Ricky May had an absolute shocker, only when he lost his way he fell back on an entirely different strategy, not only skipping lines of the national anthem but repeating them and even make up entirely new ones. Playing devil\u2019s advocate again, it\u2019s possible that May arrived at the ground without any means to rehearse and so didn\u2019t realise how fast the band was going to whip through the anthem. He fell badly behind the tempo in the first line and never really recovered so it was basically a minute-long horror show. He was also a Kiwi so given the amount of Aussies who can\u2019t remember the words to the Australian national anthem, there was always a chance he\u2019d struggle.  There are so many individual moments to\u00a0 love in this performance; at 0:21 when he adopts the method of car-singers everywhere and just mumbles \u201cdoop \u2018n doop\u201d once he\u2019s realised he started the line in the wrong order; at 0:31 when he can\u2019t even think up an alternative to \u201cnature\u2019s gifts\u201d so just remains silent; the inactivity at 0:37 when it appears a possibility that someone has yanked out his microphone cord; at 0:48 when he\u2019s more or less given up entirely and resigns himself to the fact that people will be laughing at his performance for decades; then finally his crestfallen look at 1:09 when it dawns on him that his pay cheque is about to be incinerated.  Adding a layer of intrigue at the end is the muffled summary of May\u2019s performance from the commentary box. It\u2019s hard to tell whether the appraisal is, \u201che was struggling\u201d or \u201che was drugged then\u201d. After viewing this right through a few times, the second option should not be ruled out entirely.            \u00a0 \u00a0"}, {"sentences": ["He thoroughly deserved to be the man who hit the winning runs for everything he\u2019s done for Durham.\u201d Tokyo triumph for Ivanovic In Tokyo, Ana Ivanovic maintained her improving form this season after beating Caroline Wozniacki 6-2, 7-6 to win the Pan Pacific Open."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2014-09-23T13:00:03Z", "title": "Five-star Leicester City bypass Manchester United\u2019s glittering attack", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/23/weekly-sports-diary-manchester-united-defeat", "article": "With $260m of new attacking talent at their disposal, it was no surprise that Manchester United scored three goals at Premier League new boys Leicester City.

But now the precocious five-year-old has met his match in the form of Indonesian regulators, who have declared his antics as \u201cborderline pornography\u201d and warned broadcasters to censor images of his bare buttocks, scantily clad women and other indecorous scenes. The Indonesian broadcasting commission has told RCTI, the private television network that airs the Crayon Shin-chan series, to either cut \u201cindecent\u201d parts of the programme or show it at a later time, when it will be missed by many in its target audience: young children. A member of the commission insisted the cartoon, which has also been shown in Spain, Malaysia and several other countries, was not intended for young audiences. \u201cThe character fools around with his bare bottom exposed,\u201d Agatha Lily told Japan\u2019s Asahi Shimbun newspaper. \u201cHe also noses around people [when they are] on dates. The show features a lot of female characters in seductive garments that emphasise their cleavage. \u201cIt is essentially pornography.\u201d RCTI said it would resist official pressure to censor the wildly popular cartoon, which first aired in Indonesia in 2000. \u201cI don\u2019t see what the problem is,\u201d a spokesman told the newspaper. \u201cWe will continue to air the show as we have.\u201d It is not the first time Shin-chan \u2013 aka Shinnosuke Nohara \u2013 who lives in the Tokyo commuter belt with his parents, younger sister and their dog, has challenged cultural sensibilities outside Japan, where he appears in manga, on TV and in cinemas. The show was taken off the air in India in 2008 after the broadcasting ministry objected to its nudity and profanity, although a sanitised version appeared the following year. The show has also fallen foul of the censors in South Korea and Vietnam. The TV show, which is based on the original manga series created by Yoshito Usui, has been dubbed into more than a dozen languages, including English, Chinese and Hindi. The programme continued to run in Japan after Usui\u2019s sudden death in 2009. The character is a hit among children and adults in Japan for his irreverent behaviour and his use of inappropriate language, much of which exploits the common use of onomatopoeia in Japanese. His mooning aside, Shin-chan has spawned several catchphrases familiar to millions of Japanese children, although many parents would probably prefer to have never witnessed his \u201cMr Elephant\u201d routine, performed during primetime viewing hours. His insolence towards his elders has done little to dent his popularity in Japan, where more than a quarter of the population is aged over 64. His stock greeting whenever he encounters a senior citizen is: \u201cWhen are you going to die?\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Yet the behaviour of gentlemen in the Tokyo Assembly in Japan gives Arinc great competition."], "tags": ["Australia news", "Australian politics", "Feminism", "Women", "Women in politics", "Gender"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-25T06:31:33Z", "title": "Sure, Australia is a sexist place.

What can one expect, of course, from a modern, western nation which at present has fewer female cabinet members than Afghanistan? We have a single one, by the way. In Afghanistan, they have three. More enlightened minds than those above once observed that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Australia\u2019s fun-loving feminist community has provided that reaction for the past 22 years in the form of the annual Ernie awards, bestowed on those (male or female) who have made the most sexist public remarks of the year.  Named after Ernie Ecob, a trade unionist who once declared that women only wanted jobs in the shearing industry in order to get laid, the awards receive nominations across categories from the judicial to industrial, and are voted on by a chorus of volume-measured public booing.  The federal education minister, Christopher Pyne, was a stand out top-prize \u201cGolden Ernie\u201d winner amongst some stiff competition.  This included the industrial winner, the campervan company that adorned vehicles with the slogan \u201cFat girls are harder to kidnap\u201d, and a media commentator who decried the broadcasting of Peppa Pig for her \u201cweirdly feminist line\u201d. A special award for repeat offenders is called \u201cThe Clinton\u201d \u2013 it went to the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott. Australia is, of course, not the only country on earth where those in public life demean the reputation of their culture by uttering sexist remarks. So here, let me propose both a globalisation of the Ernies and a few international candidates for a 2014 Global Ernies \u2013 or \u201cGernies\u201d, if you will. Media sexism award  A hot contender in the media section would have to be the editorial team of the Times of India, whose services to journalism this week included publishing the piece \u201chot babes with ugly legs\u201d. A list of female celebrities so deemed included Britney Spears whose \u201cmuscular legs would look more at home at the wrestling ring!\u201d and Oscar-winning, UN spokesperson and activist Angela Jolie. Wrote the ToI: \u201cHer knees, in particular, could surely use some meat.\u201d In the media category, though, it\u2019s hard to go past a gentleman like America\u2019s Rush Limbaugh, who has built an impressively global media reputation for saying pig things. Limbaugh\u2019s response to released footage of Baltimore Raven Ray Rice bashing Janay Palmer earlier this month was to declare:   What this illustrates is what I\u2019ve always said about feminism: it\u2019s artificial, it isn\u2019t real, because men and women aren\u2019t equal. If feminism was actually what they are portraying it to be, there wouldn\u2019t be this kind of outrage and shock.   He\u2019s had a big year, our Rush: in March, he attacked the support of his conservative brethren in the Republican party for a National Women\u2019s History Museum. \u201cWe already have museums for women,\u201d japed the funster, \u201cthey\u2019re called malls.\u201d Industrial sexism award  In the industrial category, there\u2019s still some competition from Team Australia on the global stage. Software company Atlassian was recently forced to apologise for the local engineer who in June decided to tell a developer conference in Berlin that Atlassian plugin Maven was \u201clike his girlfriend\u201d. She may have been beautiful, he conceded, but \u201ccomplains a lot, demands my attention, interrupts me when I\u2019m working\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t play well with my other friends\u201d. Judicial sexism award An excellent judicial nominee comes from Malaysia. Datuk Mohd Hafarizam Harun, the party lawyer of the ruling Umno party, argued that a female candidate, Datuk Sei Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, should not be allowed to contest a local government position in Selangor because ... she menstruates. His argument ran that a menstruating woman may not be able to accompany the Sultan of Selangor at religious functions: \u201cThere could be problems because of the said circumstances\u201d, he told the New Straits Times in July. Celebrity sexism award The celebrity Gernie has a real contender from Palash Sen, singer of Euphoria, one of India\u2019s biggest bands. Performing at a festival on a university campus last December, Sen experienced some confusion when he asked whether there were any \u201cgood looking girls\u201d on the campus and a male crowd reportedly raised their hands to signal \u201cno\u201d. Sen\u2019s response \u201cDon\u2019t say that, guys \u2013 God\u2019s most beautiful creation is a woman. And if a woman is the most beautiful creation, then man is the most intelligent one\u201d did not go far to ameliorate the gender tensions there. Culture sexism award A special group award for cultural piggery is deserved by the gang of UK critics who decided to collectively body shame the 27-year-old opera singer Tara Erraught after her performance in Strauss\u2019s Der Rosenkavalier in May. Comments from Andrew Clark, Rupert Christiansen, Andrew Clements, Richard Morrison and Michael Church in turn described the singer as \u201ca chubby bundle of puppy-fat\u201d, \u201cdumpy of stature\u201d, \u201chard to imagine this stocky Octavian as [a] plausible lover\u201d, \u201cunbelievable, unsightly and unappealing\u201d and as having the \u201cdemeanour of a scullery maid\u201d. Their concession that Erraught\u2019s role was \u201cgloriously sung\u201d, by the \u201ctalented\u201d and \u201chugely promising\u201d singer was somewhat lost under the deluge of body-bullying.  Sport sexism award To sport, and it\u2019s cricketer and former West Indies Test skipper Chris Gayle from Jamaica who has earned a Gernie nod. Interviewed by a female journalist before a match between his team, the Jamaica Tallawahs, with the Antigua Hawksbills in July, Gayle was asked: \u201cHow does the pitch feel so far in terms of the training [and] the weather?\u201d. He thought it appropriate to respond: \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t touched yours yet so I don\u2019t know how it feels,\u201d then added \u201cI like your smile; that\u2019s nice.\u201d Politics sexism award An obvious nominee in the political section is Turkey\u2019s deputy prime minister, B\u00fclent Arin\u00e7, who in June made a celebrity of himself by claiming: \u201cA woman should be chaste. She should know the difference between public and private. She should not laugh in public.\u201d Arinc became the literal laughing stock of the internet when Turkish women took to social media with portraits of themselves very publicly laughing \u2013 at him.  Yet the behaviour of gentlemen in the Tokyo Assembly in Japan gives Arinc great competition. Akihiro Suzuki, a member of that country\u2019s ruling party, the LDP, was caught on tape heckling female Your Party MP Ayaka Shiomura during a parliamentary speech with taunts along the lines of \u201cyou should get married!\u201d, while other colleagues chimed in with \u201ccan\u2019t you even bear a child?\u201d Forced to apologise by prime minister and party colleague Shinzo Abe, Suzuki proved himself another double-winner by adding to his official retraction that he \u201creally hoped [Shiomura] could marry soon, bearing in mind this ongoing trend where women are delaying marriage and having fewer children.\u201d Originally considered for the Celebrity prize, I\u2019m inclined to make scientist Richard Dawkins my nomination for consistent awfulness award. With an established record of telling western women to shut up about sexism because things were worse in other countries, recent evidence briefly suggested that atheism\u2019s poster-boy seemed to have evolved upwards: only this August, he publicly claimed himself to be a feminist. Last week, alas, a thorough process of peer review established something of a regression in the man. Recent tweets denouncing his feminist critics as \u201cfeedingfrenzy thoughtpolice bullies\u201d accompanied a declaration that rape victims weren\u2019t trustworthy if they were drinking. The fossil recorded: \u201cIf you want to drive, don\u2019t get drunk. If you want to be in a position to testify &amp; jail a man, don\u2019t get drunk.\u201d  It\u2019s the kind of gift that just keeps on pig-giving."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo is home to the abandoned Hakubusukan-Dobutsen station, which, like New York\u2019s City Hall station, was abandoned because it was incompatible with newer trains."], "tags": ["Cities", "Transport policy", "London", "Tube Lines", "Transport", "US news", "London Underground", "Rail transport", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-25T11:43:42Z", "title": "The weird afterlife of the world's subterranean 'ghost stations'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/25/-sp-world-subterranean-ghost-stations-tube-abandoned-underground", "article": "In 1920, construction began on what was to become an important new transportation system for Cincinnati, Ohio. Local voters had given near-unanimous support to a $6m (\u00a33.7m) municipal bond, and despite wartime restrictions and shortages, the project began. Little did the city\u2019s officials know that the system they were building would never carry a single passenger.  Five years later, the money had run out, the federal government refused to help and construction was halted. Today, there is an entire six-mile subway system abandoned underneath the Cincinnati streets.  Though Cincinnati\u2019s empty subway is an extreme example, it\u2019s part of a global phenomenon that\u2019s actually quite common. Underground travel has become a familiar routine for millions of urban dwellers, but most commuters are unaware that lurking on the other side of the walls are the remains of abandoned stations, slowly deteriorating. Known as \u201cghost stations\u201d, they are silent but powerful reminders of forgotten history.  Tom Moran, editor of the website Urban Ghosts and an expert on abandoned stations, says: \u201cFor me, what makes abandoned subways more compelling than other subterranean infrastructure is the fact that they were built to cater for large crowds of people \u2013 unlike sewers and utility tunnels \u2013 and thus contain all the necessary features of a public space, from fire escapes to ornate signage and advertising on the walls. It\u2019s that missing human element that makes them more eerie.\u201d In the west, many stations were abandoned due to the boom and bust cycles of capitalist markets; in former or current communist countries, ghost stations are symbols of the excesses of authoritarianism. But their histories remain local. Though no longer part of the daily lives of people, each abandoned station is firmly rooted in its city\u2019s past \u2013 and may yet become part of their city\u2019s future.      Cincinnati\u2019s subway system under construction in the 1920s. The entire six-mile system remains in place but has never been used for public transportation.  Photograph: Cincinnati Museum Centre/Getty Images    If there is a global capital of ghost stations, it would have to be London, which boasts more than 40. These include North End Station on the Northern Line, which was never used following its completion in 1906, and also many other stations that were closed due to poor user numbers, notably Aldwych on the disused Piccadilly branch line. Urban explorer Bradley Garrett made headlines in 2012 when he was arrested by London transport police for exploring the station. He received a conditional discharge. London\u2019s transport authority is now planning to sell off some of the disused stations to companies who have plans to turn them into tourist attractions, hotels, shops and museums, according to a report. One estimate places the abandoned network\u2019s value at \u00a33.6bn. Tom Moran\u2019s favourite London ghost station is in fact an abandoned lift passageway at the much-used Notting Hill Gate tube station. \u201cWhen it was discovered during construction work several years ago, workers found vintage posters that had effectively been cocooned there since the lift shafts were sealed off in the 1950s,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could argue that it\u2019s not the most compelling find ever, but for me it symbolises the very essence of the tube\u2019s forgotten corners, where relics from other eras live on.\u201d Apart from London, perhaps the best-known city in western Europe for ghost stations is Paris. Several were closed during the second world war, while others, such as Haxo and Porte Molitor, were built during the rapid expansion of the Paris M\u00e9tro in the 1920s but never opened. Another concentration of ghost stations can be found in Barcelona, whose Banco station is reputed to have been designed, not for the public, but as a secret delivery system to the Bank of Spain. Gaudi station, named after Spain\u2019s celebrated architect and intended to serve the Sagrada Familia cathedral, was similarly never opened. Today it is known for numerous reports of ghost sightings. Across the Atlantic, the subways of the US faced a formidable foe: the freeway. As car use skyrocketed after the war, subway systems became less popular, and underground stations began to close down. In denser eastern US cities, most rapid transit systems survived, but individual stations were closed, such as Franklin Square in Philadelphia. Yet, not all eastern systems survived: Rochester\u2019s subway was completely closed, like Cincinnati\u2019s. In Chicago, parts of the elevated train network were abandoned due to lack of maintenance funds. But the biggest casualties were on the west coast. San Francisco\u2019s underground Eureka station was closed permanently, as was the underground hub of Los Angeles\u2019s Red Car system.     North End underground station near Hampstead Heath in London has never been used. Photograph: Nick Catford/Subterranea Britannica    New York, not surprisingly, has quite a few ghost stations; the most famous one, City Hall on the Lexington Avenue line, was closed in 1945 because retrofitting it to serve newer trains was considered too expensive. Another station, South 4th Street in Brooklyn, never saw service after funding for the rest of its line was cut. Unlike their European counterparts, American ghost stations stand out for their unassuming pragmatism. The abandoned stations in Rochester, for example, have a distinctly utilitarian feel.  Although other countries on the American continent may not have embraced the automobile as enthusiastically as the US, they\u2019re still home to a number of ghost stations. Toronto\u2019s Lower Bay station was closed in 1966, allegedly due to an overly complicated track arrangement. There is also a small concentration of ghost stations in Latin America: Buenos Aires\u2019s San Jose station was abandoned when one of the city\u2019s subway lines was rerouted to the city centre in an effort to attract more users. And in Santiago, several metro stations were closed as a result of a massive earthquake in 1985. In these capitalist countries, where one generation\u2019s crisis is the next generation\u2019s tourist trap, many of the stations have been repurposed. London\u2019s Aldwych station has become a favourite for movie shoots, while Toronto\u2019s Lower Bay has become a location for parties during the city\u2019s huge film festival. Cincinnati\u2019s abandoned subway line is occasionally opened for visits, and South 4th Street became a kind of gallery for Brooklyn street artists. Crisis also spawned the ghost stations of the former Soviet bloc \u2013 created not by market fluctuations but overbearing authoritarian rulers. Berlin\u2019s U-Bahn was a particularly noteworthy example. Though all the city\u2019s stations are open today, during the Cold War a number of stations on lines that crossed through east Berlin were closed, sealed, and monitored by armed guards \u2013 who occasionally tried to escape to the west by jumping onto moving trains. These stations were poorly maintained yet seen by passengers daily, an eerie phenomenon that, in fact, gave rise to the term \u201cghost station\u201d. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, all 16 Berlin ghost stations resumed service. In Moscow, construction of Spartak station was completed in 1975, but when the housing complex it was supposed to serve was abruptly cancelled, the station sat unused. It has reopened this year to serve the new Spartak Moscow football stadium.  Perhaps the most famous disused subway in Moscow is the Metro 2, a top-secret, parallel subway system reported to have been constructed in the 1940s for the emergency transportation of Communist party top brass. Many doubt it exists, and there are no photos of its lines or stations, but many top Russian officials, as well as a US intelligence report from 1991, have attested to its existence.      Lower Bay, a ghost station on Toronto\u2019s subway system, was closed in 1966. Now it is a popular location for parties during the city\u2019s film festival.  Photograph: Carlos Osorio/Toronto Star/Getty Images    In other communist countries, stations have been abandoned for similar reasons. In the Beijing metro, Fushouling station appears to have been built for strategic military use, but was only used to transport rural children to school, running only two trains per day until its closure in 2007. North Korea, though, has Kwangmyong station, which was closed in 1995 because it is connected to the palace that was turned into a massive mausoleum for deceased supreme leader Kim Il-Sung. Naturally, few photos exist. But further to the east, abandoned stations begin to look more like the west again. Tokyo is home to the abandoned Hakubusukan-Dobutsen station, which, like New York\u2019s City Hall station, was abandoned because it was incompatible with newer trains. Other stations have suffered the same fate as the Santiago metro: earthquake damage. Manseibashi was eventually closed after the connecting train station was levelled in the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake.  Ghost stations around the world make for haunting photographs \u2013 Bradley Garrett\u2019s photos are remarkable \u2013 not to mention great party venues. But do they have, um, a deeper meaning? With the rise of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and the prohibitive expense of new subway construction (with the exception, it seems, of China), you could interpret ghost stations as a sign of the inherent inflexibility of subway systems. Or you could say they\u2019re a product of the boom and bust cycles to which all cities are prone, especially in the American rust belt: cities like Cleveland and Rochester simply aren\u2019t as robust today as they were a century ago. But ghost stations have something to say that isn\u2019t just about transportation and the economy. Subways are important ways for citizens to get around, but they\u2019re also important as public spaces. Indeed, by providing an identifiable shared experience, subway systems are often important parts of the distinctive identities of cities like Paris, London and New York. Rob the stations of their healthy bloodflow of regular commuters and they will eventually haunt the city. Maybe that\u2019s why a recent proposal to repurpose Paris\u2019s abandoned stations as public pools and auditoriums has gained traction. These stations are crying out to be used, not just as pop-up hipster hangouts, but important parts of the city\u2019s public sphere. Garrett, incidentally, generally opposes the repurposing of abandoned spaces. In an interview, he said: \u201cMost urban explorers don\u2019t push for preservation because obviously when you \u2018preserve\u2019 something under a heritage regime, you lose a lot as well,\u201d and cited the example of the High Line in New York as a piece of abandoned infrastructure that was \u201cruined\u201d by being transformed into public space. Perhaps they are better off left to urban explorers. \u201cOther than filling them in, you can\u2019t really demolish an underground ghost station,\u201d Tom Moran says. \u201cSo, while many surface buildings often meet the wrecking ball, ghost stations live on in a sort of weird afterlife, out of sight and out of mind (of most people, at least) but very much in existence. \u201cCliched as it sounds,\u201d he goes on, \u201cthe fact that they generally don\u2019t go through the normal periodic upgrades that active stations experience makes them like time capsules.\u201d And the best way to ruin a time capsule is probably to open it. \u2022 Ride Beijing\u2019s subway, end to end \u2013 a special Guardian Cities interactive report"}, {"sentences": ["One such title was Tokyo Tribe, Sian Sono\u2019s relentless rap-battle martial arts epic set in fantasy land of violent, warring crews.", "Some of the raps had key phrases in English, so hundreds of giddy cinema-goers exited the screening chanting \u201cTokyo Tribe, never ever die!\u201d as they made their way back to the bar.", "Tokyo Tribe."], "tags": ["Film", "Festivals", "Culture", "Keanu Reeves", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-25T15:35:57Z", "title": "Machismo and hedonism at Fantastic Fest: America's wildest film festival", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/fantastic-fest-austin-texas-hedonism", "article": "\u201cYou wanna fire a shotgun?\u201dIt\u2019s a strange enough question on its own, but it was even stranger considering that just a few hours earlier the speaker sold me a cream and Froot Loops-based Mexican popsicle of his own creation called the Saturday Morning Cartoon.  This mix of machismo, nostalgia and high-fructose hedonism is endemic to Austin, Texas, a town with a large college campus and tech industry jobs for the young and playful and their disposable incomes. Many local businesses may claim to be the \u201cheart\u201d of the city, but for film lovers it is undoubtedly the Alamo Drafthouse, which just celebrated the 10th anniversary of its in-house film festival, Fantastic Fest.Fantastic Fest specializes in extremes \u2013 this year the programming ranged from far-out Mexican science fiction to Norwegian psychological horror to a British documentary about slime molds to a lewd parody of the Italian \u201cgiallo\u201d to a gangland hip-hop opera from Japan. There are always a handful of movies that are already en route to a release in mainstream cinemas, but for many these are the afterthoughts.  The pride a Fantastic Fest-goer feels comes from seeing something so twisted and deranged the Chinese government won\u2019t let it out of the country without strings attached. (A Fantastic Fest programmer told a tale of recruiting his girlfriend for translation duties to acquire one such film.) The extra-cinematic activities, frequently based in The Highball, a restaurant/bar/arcade/karaoke facility attached to the theater, similarly run the gamut. The same stage that hosted \u201cNerd Rap\u201d featured an hourlong Q&amp;A with the charming elder statesman of cinephilia, Leonard Maltin. While the organized trip to go off and fire shotguns may have just been pure Texas, most of the zany tie-ins have a thematic connection. An organized pie-fight after the repertory screening of Alan Parker\u2019s Bugsy Malone makes perfect sense in context, as the 1976 film, which cast kid actors like Scott Baio and Jodie Foster as 1920s gangsters, swapped bullets for pie cream for the shootouts.Catching an archival print of Bugsy Malone on a big screen with a top notch sound system was a personal highlight, and made for an amusing counterpoint to the debut of Keanu Reeves\u2019 new action picture John Wick.      Reeves doesn\u2019t act too much, but looks cool in his upcoming film John Wick. Photograph: Fantastic Fest    Directed by former stuntmen David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, John Wick is a perfect vehicle for Reeves as he glides into the next phase of his career. Bluntly, he doesn\u2019t have to act much, but he has to look cool wearing a suit while shooting people at close range with automatic weapons. As the titular character (the full name is repeated so many times that the drinking game is surely around the corner) Reeves is a former hit-man who just wants a quiet life. But when the bratty son of the Russian Mob (played by Game of Thrones\u2019 Theon Greyjoy!) steals his car and kills his dog, the spirit of vengeance is unleashed.  So far pretty standard, but when John Wick goes \u201cback on the job\u201d the movie takes a creative leap into satire and surrealism. We enter an underworld of contract killers and the service industry that caters to their trade. As such, John Wick has some of the best hotelier jokes in a movie since Neil Simon\u2019s Plaza Suite. This tweak at realism gives the movie a little extra wiggle room, and as such the extreme violence comes off as strangely charming. John Wick is not the direct-to-DVD feature you\u2019d suspect from the poster.Another debuting film that made a splash was Isaac Ezban\u2019s The Incident (El Incidente). I know this doesn\u2019t sound like an endorsement, but it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve witnessed the uncomfortable confusion and frustration that accompany nightmares put to film in such a way.      \u2018The Incident isn\u2019t a graphic or violent movie, but a gripping psychological torture session.\u2019  Photograph: Fantastic Fest    The Incident isn\u2019t a graphic or violent movie, but a gripping psychological torture session. Until its revelatory ending it seems like two not-very-connected Twilight Zone stories. In one, a cop and two thuggish brothers (one shot in the leg) are trapped in a stairwell. In the other, a family with a sick child is on a road trip that offers no exits. The simple \u201cwhat if?\u201d scenarios play out in ways that seem ludicrous at first, but jibe with the film\u2019s peculiar internal logic. The production design and world building are extraordinary, especially considering that the movie was most likely made on a minuscule budget. This is Mexican director Isaac Ezban\u2019s first feature film, and I can\u2019t wait to see what he\u2019s got in store next. Additional highlights include films that may have made their debut elsewhere, like the just-wrapped Toronto film festival, but perhaps needed a more likeminded venue to cut above the chatter. One such title was Tokyo Tribe, Sian Sono\u2019s relentless rap-battle martial arts epic set in fantasy land of violent, warring crews. If The Warriors were rebooted as an absurdist live-action anime musical with lots of foulmouth humor and nudity, you\u2019d have the soil ready to grow such a film.  I\u2019m not going to lie and say this movie is good, but considering the Drafthouse brings beer directly to the table and encourages hootin\u2019 and hollerin\u2019 when diminutive and adorably clad women suddenly reveal themselves to be furious henchmen-destroying ass-kickers, it\u2019s fair to say everyone had a really good time. Some of the raps had key phrases in English, so hundreds of giddy cinema-goers exited the screening chanting \u201cTokyo Tribe, never ever die!\u201d as they made their way back to the bar.     Tokyo Tribe. Photograph: Fantastic Fest    Another Toronto premiere that popped up was Spring, a bizarre romantic drama that takes a left turn into monster mythology. \u201cHP Lovecraft\u2019s Before Sunrise\u201d is how some were summarizing. The sweet, sincere and scary picture (from film-making team Benson &amp; Moorehead) had the good fortune to announce an acquisition deal at the fest \u2013 from the Alamo Drafthouse\u2019s distribution arm Drafthouse Films. Those not in the know may think that a theater chain specializing in bringing queso dip and suds directly to your seat has no business in distributing films, but in just four years they\u2019ve had two pictures nominated for Academy Awards (Belgian crime tale Bullhead and the Indonesian documentary The Act of Killing.)From elsewhere in the fest, I was quite taken with the The Creeping Garden, a look at the mysterious world of slime molds (really) from both a scientific and artistic point of view. The movie hums as if it was shot by aliens visiting Earth for the first time, and that\u2019s a high compliment. I also enjoyed watching hardcore cinephiles react to Peter Strickland\u2019s The Duke of Burgundy and Miroslav Slaboshpytskiy\u2019s The Tribe. The first is a stylized but ultimately tender tale of a May-December lesbian BDSM romance set in a world without men, and the second is a Ukrainian film set at a school for the deaf that doubles as a prostitution headquarters. The Tribe, shot in long, wide takes, is entirely in sign language without subtitles. It will be distributed by Drafthouse Films and I think the strangeness of its description works as a good indicator for what Fantastic Fest and Drafthouse is all about."}, {"sentences": ["Frozen characters at Tokyo Disneyland in Urayasu on 8 September, 2014."], "tags": ["Frozen", "Film", "Culture", "Animation", "Walt Disney Company"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-26T09:14:34Z", "title": "Frozen is based on my life story, claims writer seeking $250m from Disney", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/26/frozen-is-based-on-my-life-story-claims-writer-seeking-250m-from-disney", "article": "A Peruvian writer who claims the $1.2bn blockbuster animation Frozen is based on her own life has launched an ambitious claim against studio Disney for $250m in damages.New Jersey-based Isabella Tanikumi says the story of princesses Elsa and Anna, which has taken the global box office by storm since debuting before Christmas, is plagiarised from her memoirs Living My Truth and Yearnings of the Heart. Her complaint, filed in the US federal district court in New Jersey, cites 18 separate instances where Disney is alleged to have stolen from the stories, which detail her young experiences growing up in the shadow of the Peruvian Andes.The suit has been ridiculed in some sections of the media because Frozen is widely thought to be based on the classic 1844 Hans Christian Andersen fairytale The Snow Queen. However, there are a number of similarities between Tanikumi\u2019s books and the Frozen screenplay, if the writer\u2019s suit is to be believed.              Both the memoirs and Frozen feature loving sisters, one of whom causes the other to be injured and then hides herself away from public life through shame. Both live in a village or town at the foot of snow-covered mountains, claims the suit. They are brought closer together by a terrible accident - an earthquake in the memoirs, a storm in Frozen - resulting in the death of loved ones. One of the sisters has suitors named Hans and Cristoff in the memoirs; in Frozen Anna develops romantic attachments to men named Hans and Kristoff. Even one of the Frozen DVD\u2019s covers, in which Elsa appears with her hands to the sky and surrounded by snowflakes, is allegedly based on the cover of one of the memoirs.Disney will no doubt point out that there are also considerable differences between the stories. Tanikumi\u2019s memoirs do not feature princesses, talking snowmen or terrifying cryokinetic powers, all of which are pretty central to Frozen.      Frozen characters at Tokyo Disneyland in Urayasu on 8 September, 2014. Photograph: YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP/Getty Images    However, Frozen producer Peter Del Vecho has previously admitted the film is a very loose adaptation of its source fairytale. \u201cHans Christian Andersen\u2019s original version of The Snow Queen is a pretty dark tale and it doesn\u2019t translate easily into a film,\u201d he told Bleeding Cool last year. \u201cFor us the breakthrough came when we tried to give really human qualities to the Snow Queen. When we decided to make the Snow Queen Elsa and our protagonist Anna sisters, that gave a way to relate to the characters in a way that conveyed what each was going through and that would relate for today\u2019s audiences.\u201dOn the other hand, Hollywood studios are used to being hit by a torrent of lawsuits whenever a particularly popular property emerges. James Cameron has faced a half dozen copyright claims since the release of 2009\u2019s Avatar, the highest-grossing movie of all time with $2.7bn in receipts. None ultimately proved successful.Yearnings of the Heart is available to purchase via Amazon, but Living My Truth appears to be more obscure. Disney has so far made no public comment on the lawsuit.

Madrid goes car-free Londoners may complain about the congestion charge, but drivers entering the city centre in Madrid may soon be fined 90 euros as part of a plan to rid the core city streets of cars. As CityLab explains, while part of the car-free zone is already in place, it is due to expand in 2015 to comprise most of Madrid\u2019s central area. There are also aspirations to fully pedestrianise more streets and increase bus lanes, which adds to the city\u2019s existing commitment to sustainable transport, including their new electric bike share system. Earlier this year we asked if cars should be banned from city centres; now that cities like Madrid and Helsinki have taken a step in this direction, do you think others will follow suit?  The vacant city of tomorrow On the outskirts of Abu Dhabi, Masdar City was planned to be a model of urban sustainability as the world\u2019s first carbon neutral, zero-waste city and the home to an alternative energies research centre. It ultimately aims to attract over 50,000 residents and a similar number of commuters \u2013 but as this video on Fast Co Exist shows us, the emerging city is a long way from that goal. Despite several businesses moving in \u2013 and around a hundred students \u2013 Masdar is revealed in the film to be an eerily vacant city in a perpetual state of \u201copening soon\u201d.  The future is crowded According to Bloomberg (as reported by CityMetric), the world\u2019s most crowded city in 2025 will be Hong Kong, with a population density of almost 77,000 people per square mile. Latin American centres make up 7 of the 10 most crowded cities of the future: Mexico City\u2019s population is estimated to rise beyond 24 million by 2025. This is exceeded only by the metropolitan region of Tokyo-Yokohama, which may swell to accommodate over 38 million people. Meanwhile, the rapidly expanding city of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia is predicted to have the highest urban population growth in one generation, of a whopping 166%.

This overpass is over Brussels, one of the most congested cities in Europe, has made the decision to demolish the Reyers overpass, part of the \u201cGreater Ring\u201d of the city\u2019s road network. As explained on the Sustainable Cities Collective site, Brussels\u2019 minister of public works announced that the removal of the overpass would enhance the liveability of the local area, transforming Reyers into \u201can urban boulevard where space will be given to cyclists and pedestrians next to the space reserved for cars.\u201d Athens goes green Athens may not be known for its luscious green spaces, but that could change with its plans to create the world\u2019s largest city park.

Having agreed to pass on their findings by the end of this month, North Korean authorities have said that the probe could last up to a year, sparking anger in Tokyo. Establishing the whereabouts of a dozen Japanese citizens snatched in the 1970s and 80s and taken to North Korea to teach their language and customs to communist agents is an emotive topic in Japan, where it is considered more important than Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. Five of 17 people on Tokyo\u2019s official missing list were allowed to return home with their families in 2002, but Japan has refused to believe North Korean claims that it had abducted only 13 people, and that the remaining eight had died. Japan will demand an explanation for the delay when officials from both sides meet in Shenyang, China, on Monday. \u201cWhat will result from the meeting? I\u2019m not in a position to say\u2026 I can\u2019t speak in detail about Japan\u2019s expectations at this time,\u201d Eriko Yamatani, Japan\u2019s state minister in charge of the abduction issue, told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThe way North Korea deals with this will affect not just the abductions\u2026 it is an important test of how serious it is about addressing its human rights abuses.\u201d The cause of the delay isn\u2019t clear, but there have been suggestions that Pyongyang is unhappy with the way Japanese media have portrayed the abductions as a human rights issue, and that it hopes to win further concessions with each new piece of information. Despite the delay, Professor Hajime Izumi, director of the Center for Korean Studies at Shizuoka University, said he was confident North Korea would present an initial report on its investigation, possibly by the end of next month.     Kaoru Hasuike and his wife Yukiko were kidnapped and taken to North Korea in 1970s. They were returned to Japan in October 2002.

The Mangyongbong-92, which once sailed regularly between Wonsan and Niigata, has not made the journey since sanctions were imposed in 2006.  By delaying the process, North Korea may try to use it as a diplomatic card to get further concessions from Tokyo  \u201cNorth Korea would probably want that to be first to happen, but in Japan the Mangyongbong has great symbolic value. It may have been involved in the abductions, so here it is still seen a something evil.\u201d In light of the breakdown of multiparty talks on North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme and the introduction of tough UN sanctions following its nuclear and missile tests, Abe appeared to be taking a gamble with the offer to ease Tokyo\u2019s punitive measures against the regime. Some analysts, however, say the current impasse probably won\u2019t damage Japan\u2019s leader, who has made resolving the abductions a priority of his political career. \u201cBy delaying the process, North Korea may try to use it as a diplomatic card to get further concessions from Tokyo,\u201d said Tetsuo Kotani, a fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs in Tokyo. \u201cOr North Korea needed to delay it because it knows it cannot meet Tokyo\u2019s high expectations.  \u201cBy lifting the economic sanctions, Abe showed his pragmatic side. Because he had always been tough on the abduction issue, he could show some flexibility. Even if North Korea does not meet his expectations this time, it won\u2019t harm Abe\u2019s political foundations, because North Korea will be to blame.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Mount Ontake, which straddles Nagano and Gifu prefectures about 130 miles west of Tokyo, erupted shortly before noon on Saturday, sending thick plumes of smoke and rocks into the air.", "Flights at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport were delayed as planes changed routes to avoid the peak, but were mostly back to normal by Sunday, an airport spokeswoman said."], "tags": ["Japan", "Volcanoes", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-28T09:47:38Z", "title": "Japan volcano: at least 30 victims found near Mount Ontake peak", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/28/japan-volcano-victims-mount-ontake", "article": "At least 30 people are believed to have died near the peak of a volcano in central Japan that erupted without warning on Saturday, trapping scores of amateur climbers and covering a wide area with thick ash.

Mount Ontake, which straddles Nagano and Gifu prefectures about 130 miles west of Tokyo, erupted shortly before noon on Saturday, sending thick plumes of smoke and rocks into the air. About 250 people were near the 3,067-metre peak when the eruption occurred. Most were able to make their way down the mountain to safety on Saturday, reports said.

Photograph: Kyodo/Reuters    Before the bodies were discovered on Sunday, the fire and disaster management agency had said 45 people were unaccounted for. After calling off their search overnight on Saturday amid fears of fresh eruptions and the buildup of toxic gas, rescue workers were continuing to reach people on Sunday, including several who were injured, who had taken refuge overnight in mountain lodges. Seven people were taken off the mountain on Sunday morning in a rescue operation involving helicopters and more than 500 troops, police officers and firefighters.       Twenty-six climbers who had stayed in a lodge on the Gifu side made their way down early on Sunday and reached the foot of the mountain before noon. Two were seriously hurt and six had minor injuries, Kyodo news agency said. Witnesses said they initially mistook the eruption for thunder. \u201cFor a while I heard thunder pounding a number of times,\u201d said Shinichi Shimohara, who works at a shrine at the foot of the mountain. \u201cSoon after, some climbers started descending. They were all covered with ash, completely white. I thought to myself, this must be really serious.\u201d The mountain, which last had a major eruption in 1979, is popular with weekend hikers, particularly in September and October when the autumn leaves are at their best.

Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images    Officials said the volcano had shown no indication that it was about to erupt with such force. An official at the volcano division of the meteorological agency said that although there had been a rising number of small earthquakes detected at Ontake since 10 September, the eruption could not have been predicted easily. \u201cThere were no other signs of an imminent eruption, such as earth movements or changes on the mountain\u2019s surface,\u201d the official said. \u201cWith only the earthquakes, we couldn\u2019t really say this would lead to an eruption.\u201d But David Rothery, a professor of planetary sciences at the Open University, said he was surprised that Ontake had erupted without warning. \u201cThis eruption of Ontake was not especially powerful, but distributed several centimetres of ash across areas close to the summit. It seems similar to its 1979 eruption, which is the only other eruption of this volcano in historic times,\u201d Rothery said. \u201cI am surprised that it erupted without warning because so far as I know there are seismometers on Ontake that are supposed to detect signs of internal magma movement. \u2018Sneak\u2019 eruptions lacking in precursor signs are not unknown, but analysis of the records may reveal data that, with hindsight, should have been read as a warning sign. This is how we learn how to do it better next time.\u201d Video footage taken with mobile phones showed huge grey clouds engulfing climbers, who were forced to halt their ascent as the area was plunged into darkness. \u201cAll of a sudden ash piled up so quickly that we couldn\u2019t even open the door,\u201d said Shuichi Mukai, who works in a mountain hut just below the peak. The hut quickly filled with hikers taking refuge. \u201cWe were really packed in here, maybe 150 people. There were some children crying, but most people were calm. We waited there in hard hats until they told us it was safe to come down,\u201d Mukai added. Flights at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport were delayed as planes changed routes to avoid the peak, but were mostly back to normal by Sunday, an airport spokeswoman said. Volcanoes erupt periodically in Japan, one of the most seismically active countries in the world, but there have been no deaths since 1991, when 43 people died in a pyroclastic flow \u2013 a superheated current of gas and rock \u2013 at Mount Unzen in south-west Japan. The meteorological agency advised climbers to stay away from Ontake and forecast further eruptions, warning that volcanic debris may settle within 2.5 miles of the peak. The agency called on local residents to remain alert, as the force of the eruptions could shatter windows miles away."}, {"sentences": ["In 2012, the Paris Palais de Tokyo held an exhibition, Chlo\u00e9 Attitudes, to celebrate 60 years of the label; in 2013, Aghion collected her L\u00e9gion d&apos;Honneur, dressed as simply as ever."], "tags": ["Fashion", "France", "Paris", "Egypt", "Karl Lagerfeld", "Lawrence Durrell", "Stella McCartney"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-28T16:20:51Z", "title": "Gaby Aghion obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/sep/28/gaby-aghion", "article": "The great &quot;what if?&quot; photographs of fashion are those taken in Paris between liberation in August 1944 and Christian Dior&apos;s New Look in February 1947. There was very little fabric available, and the clothes are functional \u2013 a white blouse, simple dress, gallant coat \u2013 yet the style is intelligent and feminine (dressmaker- or home-made, by women for women). Gaby Aghion, founder of the Chlo\u00e9 label, settled in Paris in 1945, and adopted that soft blouse, worn with a dark tunic, as uniform until her death at the age of 93. Chlo\u00e9 clothes still keep faith with those free, Left Bank-spirited styles. She was born Gabrielle Hanoka in Alexandria, the most fashionable Middle Eastern city (where her father managed a cigarette factory), had a French-style education and first saw Paris at the age of 18 as a student, the year before her marriage to Raymond Aghion, whom she had met when they were both at school. He had family wealth, leftwing convictions, and went into political exile from Egypt at the end of the war: the couple were Jewish. Their Paris was bohemian and artistic. They knew Picasso, the surrealist poet Paul \u00c9luard and Lawrence Durrell (though Gaby denied she was the model for Justine in the first of his Alexandria Quartet novels). Raymond later opened a modern art gallery; she collected it. French textile manufacturers&apos; financial backing for the restoration of haute couture, which began with the firm of Boussac subsidising that Dior show, replaced democratic postwar fashion with elaborately undersupported, sculpturally shaped, ensembles. Aghion and her clever friends occasionally wore couture (who had the time for the many fittings, even if they had the money?), but more often bad dressmaker copies, plus grubby white gloves. Ready to wear barely existed.     The Chlo\u00e9 look from 1972. Photograph: David Thorpe/Associated News/Rex    So in 1952 Aghion told her husband &quot;I&apos;ve got to work \u2026 it&apos;s not enough to eat lunch,&quot; and had six sample summer dresses sewn by seamstresses, in the maid&apos;s room of her apartment, in the plain but quality cotton used for making patterns in couture. Aghion did not designate herself as a &quot;house&quot;, but as a manufacturing label \u2013 Chlo\u00e9, after a friend, because her own name sounded &quot;like a fortune teller&quot; \u2013 and motored around the boutiques of Paris selling the samples from a suitcase. She had designed the dresses, with their relaxed styling, to be easily altered to fit. They were a great success. Backed by her business partner Jacques Lenoir, she showed a pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter collection at breakfast in the Caf\u00e9 de Flore on the Boulevard Saint Germain in 1956, and twice-yearly thereafter. Everything about Chlo\u00e9 felt at least 20 years younger than the maisons de couture, more cerebral, with a sense of humour. Fashion fresh as a salad was Aghion&apos;s main philosophy. Keep it crisp. She was also 20 years ahead of her time, as not until the 1970s did other cr\u00e9ateurs such as Sonia Rykiel and Doroth\u00e9e Bis produce similar Paris-but-not-couture lines.     Chlo\u00e9's ready-to-wear collection, 1985.  Photograph: Daniel Simon/Gamma- Rapho via Getty Images    Aghion chose superlative, not necessarily showy, fabrics, including prints on soft crepe and chiffon. She also began to choose designers. She was a synthesiser of fashion \u2013 responding to what was already in the air rather than creating a complete personal vision; she had, and Chlo\u00e9 has kept, a sympathy for retro, art-deco-based, cuts and details, sans fuss. Aghion bought work from G\u00e9rard Pipart in 1959, and thereafter her brand became couture&apos;s fame academy \u2013 Madame never picked a dud new designer: among those who created for Chlo\u00e9 were Graziella Fontana, Maxime de la Falaise, Martine Sitbon, Stella McCartney, Phoebe Philo, all of whom shared that liberated attitude. Many of her choices were women, and Chlo\u00e9 has around 80% female employees. Her most perfect find, though, was the young Karl Lagerfeld, who began by selling her freelance designs, then became the mainstay of the label \u2013 having chased the other stylistes from their cramped communal workroom \u2013 from 1964 to 1983. (He returned from 1992 to 1997.) His creativity was unstoppable: Aghion edited his piled sketches, reserving for the future ideas with delayed potential.     Aghion and Karl Lagerfeld at Chlo\u00e9's 60th anniversary celebration in 2012. Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images    As Lagerfeld&apos;s biographer Alicia Drake wrote, Aghion encouraged him to escape from his formal couture training into a lighter, faster world. They worked together, then, as she gave him a lift home, they talked cloth and clothes, and he watched Parisian students, generating yet more ideas. By the early 70s their collaboration had widened Chlo\u00e9 from a French intelligentsia preference into an international business, attracting as much attention as couture. In the industry&apos;s financial restructurings in the 80s, Aghion sold her share of the company to Dunhill (Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemont SA) in 1985, and retired. Though her advice about Chlo\u00e9 was always heeded \u2013 she saw clearly that McCartney, then Philo, were the cool, calm, yet pzazzy talents the label needed by the late 90s, when the merely feminine seemed too soft in a body-con, hard-sex, fashion scene. She seldom missed a show, and was on the phone forthwith to the CEO if the goods were not good enough; among her last requests was that her death shouldn&apos;t delay the spring 2015 show. In 2012, the Paris Palais de Tokyo held an exhibition, Chlo\u00e9 Attitudes, to celebrate 60 years of the label; in 2013, Aghion collected her L\u00e9gion d&apos;Honneur, dressed as simply as ever. &quot;I had a lot of conviction and courage,&quot; she said. &quot;I always said what I thought.&quot; Raymond died in 2009.

The studio recently revealed a write-down of $87m (\u00a354m) on 2013\u2019s Rise of the Guardians, a $57m (\u00a335.1m) loss on this year\u2019s Mr Peabody &amp; Sherman and a smaller hit of $13.5m (\u00a38.3m) on 2013\u2019s Turbo. Katzenberg disclosed last year it was laying off 350 employees following the failure of Rise of the Guardians. On the other hand, How to Train Your Dragon 2 took $611m (\u00a3376.4m) on a budget of just $145m (\u00a389.3m) this summer, and the Kung Fu Panda films have taken more than $1.2bn (\u00a3739m) worldwide, so the studio\u2019s key properties are in rude health.           Kit Harington on How to Train Your Dragon 2: video interview    DreamWorks Animation was originally part of the DreamWorks Studio, founded by Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and music mogul David Geffen in 1994, but was spun off into a separate company a decade later. Representatives from the studio, based in Glendale, California, have refused to comment on the reports about a sale. A spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on rumours and speculation.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["At the height of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, Japanese prime minister Nato Kan was faced with a decision: would he have to order the evacuation of Tokyo.", "&quot;If this situation had exacerbated any further we would have been faced with the situation of having to evacuate Tokyo.&quot; Kan wrote two years later on the Huffington Post that a worsened situation at Fukushima would &quot;mean the realization of the worst-case scenario: a situation where 50 million people within a 250-kilometer radius of Fukushima, including Tokyo and its greater metropolitan area, would have to be evacuated.&quot; The Japanese government was nearly paralysed by the panic over the possibility of large radiation releases, and the government went to significant lengths to hide the true extend of the meltdown from the public, and from their ally the United States, according to a report in the New York Times.", "Although Tokyo was not evacuated, over 300,000 people from the Fukushima area were; those who remain, as well as emergency workers, are facing extremely high risks of cancer."], "tags": ["Environment", "Nuclear power", "Fukushima", "India", "Australian politics", "Energy"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-29T12:10:55Z", "title": "After Fukushima, is it moral for Australia to sell uranium to India? | Alexander White", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/southern-crossroads/2014/sep/29/australian-uranium-india-fukushima", "article": "At the height of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, Japanese prime minister Nato Kan was faced with a decision: would he have to order the evacuation of Tokyo. &quot;Three of the reactors also experienced hydrogen explosions,\u00a0he said. &quot;If this situation had exacerbated any further we would have been faced with the situation of having to evacuate Tokyo.&quot; Kan wrote two years later on the Huffington Post that a worsened situation at Fukushima would &quot;mean the realization of the worst-case scenario: a situation where 50 million people within a 250-kilometer radius of Fukushima, including Tokyo and its greater metropolitan area, would have to be evacuated.&quot; The Japanese government was nearly paralysed by the panic over the possibility of large radiation releases, and the government went to significant lengths to hide the true extend of the meltdown from the public, and from their ally the United States, according to a report in the New York Times. Although Tokyo was not evacuated, over 300,000 people from the Fukushima area were; those who remain, as well as emergency workers, are facing extremely high risks of cancer. Kan wrote:  Before the Fukushima accident, with the belief that no nuclear accident would happen as long as the safety measures were followed properly, I had pushed the policy of utilizing nuclear power. Having faced the real accident as Prime Minister, and having experienced the situation which came so close to requiring me to order the evacuation of 50 million people, my view is now changed 180 degrees. Although some airplane crashes may claim hundreds of casualties, there are no other events except for wars that would require the evacuation of tens of millions of people.  Although the Fukushima disaster seems confined to Japan, the story of this particular nuclear disaster\u00a0started in a big yellow truck in an Australian uranium mine. One hundred percent of Australian uranium is exported, and our export industry is one of the largest in the world, supplying between 12-20 percent of the global market. We have around 30 percent of the world&apos;s reserves of uranium. Prior to the Fukushima disaster, Japan bought around 2,400 tonnes of uranium from Australia, our second largest market next to the European Union. A 2003 Senate inquiry into the Ranger uranium mine found that &quot;a pattern of \u00a0under-performance and non-compliance&quot;, with a &quot;large number of incidents attributable to\u00a0unsatisfactory management practices and, many have argued, the inadequate monitoring and oversight by regulating authorities.&quot; This 2003 inquiry was the last significant examination of the Australian uranium industry. More recently in February\u00a02014, Australia faced a uranium contamination scare in New South Wales, after a Santos coal-seam gas well in the Pillaga Forest spilled water contaminated with uranium and arsenic into an aquifer. The details of the spill were not made public until after The Wilderness Society uncovered the spill through freedom of information applications to the Environmental Protection Authority. Santos was fined $1,500 for this spill\u00a0and has paid $55,000 in fines for at least &quot;20 toxic coal seam gas waste-water spills&quot;, according to The Wilderness Society&apos;s national director Lyndon Schneiders Australia\u00a0has a moral obligation and a humanitarian responsibility for the hazards posed by the uranium we sell. Even once it leaves our shores, there are many risks that Australians should care about: proliferation, nuclear waste and nuclear disasters could all have catastrophic impacts on Australia and our neighbours. After Fukushima, we cannot return to business-as-usual when it comes to uranium exports. Yet the Australian government not only plans to expand our uranium exports, but has substantially lowered the standards that we once required through the recent deal that was signed with India. For decades, Australia&apos;s policy was to only sell uranium to nations which were signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. While this treaty exists primarily to defend the &quot;nuclear club&quot; dominated by the USA, Russia and Britain, it is an important treaty to restrict and reduce the number of nuclear weapons. India is not a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty, but pressure from the US was\u00a0brought to bear on Australia to sell our uranium to India. It has at least two large reactors that are\u00a0&quot;apparently run as military plutonium producers&quot;. There is no doubt that Australian uranium would free up local Indian reserves to be used for weapons. In 2005, former head of India&apos;s global strategic development\u00a0task force K. Subramaniam wrote in the Times of India:  Given India&apos;s uranium ore crunch and the need to build up our minimum credible deterrent as fast as possible, it is to India&apos;s advantage to categorise as many power reactors as possible as civilian ones to be refuelled by imported uranium and conserve our native uranium fuel for weapon-grade plutonium production.  This sale deal is irresponsible and violates Australia&apos;s long-standing position of adhering to international treaties. We should be wary of selling uranium to a nation that will not sign the non-proliferation treaty and refuses to decommission its nuclear weapons. It may not be our uranium in those bombs, but by exporting our uranium to India we are facilitating\u00a0their military nuclear program and are more generally\u00a0increasing the risk of proliferation and disaster. David Sweeney is the long-standing\u00a0nuclear free campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation. He visited Fukushima after the meltdown in 2012. His account is heartbreaking and poignant.  A farmer accepts that his current rice crop will be destroyed after harvest because it will be too contaminated. But he hopes next year&apos;s might be better. I sit by a pond in his rice paddy as he explains his hope that if the ducks eat enough worms and grubs they might remove the radiation. No one has the heart to contradict him. Beside his house is a cedar tree that is 1,200 years old and his ancestors had the honour of supplying rice to the Shogun feudal lords. The rice from those same fields is now radioactive.  He said to me that the Indian uranium deal is &quot;a retreat from reason and responsibility&quot;. Sweeney\u00a0sees uranium as the asbestos of the twenty-first century: &quot;there&apos;s no doubt it works \u2013 but there&apos;s also no doubt its environmental, human and economic cost is high and there are safer and cleaner alternatives.&quot;  Australia did not stop extracting and exporting asbestos because we ran out of the resource, we stopped because the resource ran out of social license and the companies involved in this toxic trade ran out of excuses. The same will happen with the uranium sector.  Sweeney and the Australian Conservation Foundation are deeply critical of the Indian uranium deal, arguing that the &quot;so-called safeguards referred to by the Prime Minister are meaningless&quot;. &quot;In the shadow of Fukushima \u2013 a continuing nuclear crisis directly fuelled by Australian uranium \u2013 Mr Abbott has no excuse or mandate to undermine renewable energy at home while pushing long term radioactive risk abroad,&quot; Sweeney said. The questionable morality of uranium mining is well-known in the USA, where uranium &quot;booms&quot; and &quot;busts&quot; created an &quot;epidemic of abandoned mines&quot; riddled with toxins, radiation and pollution. Freelance writer Tara Lohan explains:  Poor or non-existent regulations, including allowing radioactive waste to be dumped into unlined pits, has left a legacy of toxic pollution and poisoned communities in the West, many on tribal and federal lands. (There are 520 abandoned uranium mines on Navajo land alone.) American taxpayers have been stuck with cleanup bills in the billions of dollars.  Globally, nuclear energy is facing a structural decline. The Fukushima disaster has added a 10 year delay to the &quot;anticipated growth&quot; before the accident, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, and has ended talk of a &quot;nuclear renaissance&quot;.  &quot;There are 388 operating reactors around the world, 50 fewer than in 2002.&quot; http://t.co/xbPGsTjV1Q \u2014 Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) September 29, 2014  Robin Bromby, a columnist with The Australian wrote recently:  In all, there are 67 &quot;current&quot;\u00a0\u00adnuclear reactor projects, which sounds impressive until the report explains that eight of those reactors have been listed as &quot;under construction&quot; for more than 20 years; at least 49 have encountered construction delays, some for several years, and for the first time Chinese projects have also been delayed; for the remaining 18 reactors, either construction began within the past five years or the reactors have not yet reached projected start-up dates.  Meanwhile, pro-nuclear energy advocates continue to promote the so-called merits of constructing nuclear power stations in Australia, despite the fact that it is &quot;not a remarkably cheap option, nor a simple one; 10 or 15 years could be needed before a decision to go nuclear leads to an operating plant&quot;, according to\u00a0Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox. Nuclear energy is a risky and high cost source of electricity that produces intractable challenges of militarisation, waste and proliferation. With the horror of Fukushima still clearly visible,\u00a0the morality of exporting Australian\u00a0uranium to India is on shaky ground indeed."}, {"sentences": ["\u201cI think visitors should play it by ear, and if you find you engage with something emotionally \u2013 watch it all.\u201d James Richard\u2019s Rosebud incorporates black and white film from the 1960s of a budgie with a chained leg pecking indignantly at a barely visible hand, and the artist\u2019s own films of roadside flowers lit by car headlamps, more flowers being trailed over bare flesh, and erotic images from books in a Tokyo library with the sexy bits carefully sandpapered out by local censors."], "tags": ["Turner prize", "Video art", "Art", "Awards and prizes", "Art and design", "Tate Britain", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-29T15:46:13Z", "title": "Turner prize 2014 shuns painters and sculptors for art of film and video\r\n", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/29/turner-prize-2014-film-video-printing", "article": "There isn\u2019t a painting or a sculpture to be seen, but visitors to the 30th annual Turner prize exhibition will be greeted by some reassuringly traditional sounds.

Vince is unable to turn a blind eye and, in trying to put things right, becomes more involved in this violent, chaotic world.

This chilling tale of betrayal and supernatural revenge (no doubt an indirect influence on the Ring and Grudge movies) was Mikami\u2019s first experience of horror. He never forgot it.  Twenty years later, as a rising star at the Osaka-based game development studio Capcom, he was asked to design a spooky adventure game for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles. It would update a previous hit title, Sweet Home, about treasure hunters exploring a haunted mansion. Mikami retained the setting, but swapped the loot seekers for a Swat team, and the ghosts and monsters for zombies. Inspired by the movies of George A Romero, he concocted a story about a devastating virus, created by the sinister Umbrella corporation, and capable of turning humans into undead murderers \u2013 the ultimate bio-weapon. The result was the multimillion selling Resident Evil series, and a whole new sub-genre of game: survival horror. Revenge of horror Although out of favour for the past few years, thanks to the arrival of more accessible fare like Assassin\u2019s Creed, Grand Theft Auto and Uncharted, the gaming style that Mikami invented is creeping back from the grave. Cult Japanese studio From Software has prepared the way, reigniting interest in esoteric and difficult games with its Demon\u2019s Souls and Dark Souls titles. Now, after leaving Capcom to work on a series of interesting projects with idiosyncratic studios like Grasshopper Manufacture and Platinum Games, Mikami has his own team, and a new horror project. It is called Evil Within. It is pure survival horror, updated for modern tastes certainly, but pure nonetheless.  \u201cVideo game design has changed quite significantly since Resident Evil,\u201d says Mikami, sitting in the pristine conference room in his new Tokyo office. He\u2019s in his late 40s but doesn\u2019t look it. Relaxed in his trademark baseball cap and polo shirt, he has a boyish, but thoughtful demeanor. I\u2019d been warned that he is not exactly garrulous in interviews, but with the game almost complete, he seems open and affable.  \u201cBack in the 1990s, games rarely provided free camera movement,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut now players are used to being able to move both the character and the camera; we need to cater to what they have become accustomed to. Also, the pace, the locomotion speed of player characters, is faster now \u2013 and the cut-scenes need to be seamlessly integrated, both in terms of graphical style and continuity of action. I had to bear all of this in mind with Evil Within.\u201d Certainly the game\u2019s set up is classic survival horror. Downbeat detective Sebastian Castellanos is called to an abandoned mental hospital, where dozens of police officers have been slaughtered by an unknown force. Gradually, a sordid tale of human experimentation unravels, leading Castellanos to the gothic mansion of a disturbed young scientist named Ruvik, and eventually inside his twisted mind.             I ask Mikami about his approach to horror game design. His characters, for example, are always strong but also vulnerable. They\u2019re not gung-ho meatheads, packing enough heat to take down a whole army of the dead, they are confused, afraid \u2013 and usually very low on ammo.  \u201cI\u2019m interested in vulnerable characters, in normal human beings,\u201d says Mikami. \u201cThe horror experience is most scary when the player really isn\u2019t sure whether their character is going to live or die \u2013 death and survival need to be on a constant see-saw. If there\u2019s a situation where you\u2019re not 100% sure that you can avoid or defeat the enemies, if you feel maybe there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll make it \u2013 that\u2019s where horror lies. Creating that situation is vital. Also, I don\u2019t want to just stand there shooting dozens of enemies. Die! Die! Die! I don\u2019t have the energy for that.\u201d Instead, Mikami has an understanding of horror imagery and symbolism: the use of relaxing classical music in extremely tense moments; the way enemies seem to reflect our deep-seated fears of death and transmogrification. Is he a student of psychology? \u201cBack in the early days, when I was making the first Resident Evil, I spent three months studying the psychology of horror,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what I\u2019ve learned is, horror is instinctive - the things that scare me take precedence over any theory of horror. With Resident Evil, we went with human and human-shaped enemies because people are generally more interested in and scared by other people, rather than some obscure creature that we don\u2019t recognise. Evil Within is the same.\u201d Women, horror and video games Aside from gothic architecture, lumbering monsters, sparse resources and jump shock, Mikami\u2019s games have always been known for something else: strong female characters. The likes of Jill Valentine and Claire Redfield fought alongside their male counterparts in the Resident Evil games, dressed in similar combat fatigues, rarely succumbing to the usual overtly sexualised stereotypes.  It\u2019s something Mikami is clearly passionate about. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve put more emphasis on women characters, but when I do introduce them, it is never as objects,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some games, they will be peripheral characters with ridiculous breast physics. I avoid that sort of obvious eroticism. I also don\u2019t like female characters who are submissive to male characters, or to the situation they\u2019re in. I won\u2019t portray women in that way. I write women characters who discover their independence as the game progresses, or who already know they are independent but have that tested against a series of challenges.\u201d I think he\u2019s done with this, but as I\u2019m about to ask another question, he interrupts. \u201cIf I had to name the woman character I most disliked in my games it would be Rebecca Chambers,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s submissive, she\u2019s not independent. I didn\u2019t want to include her but the staff wanted that kind of character in the game, for whatever reason. I\u2019m sure it made sense to them. And in Japan, that character is pretty popular.\u201d He shrugs despondently.  Evil Within will be out within a few weeks; who knows what is next for Mikami and his studio, Tango Gameworks. If things go well, it\u2019s likely this will be a series \u2013 this is no doubt what Zenimax had in mind when it bought the studio four years ago. But then Mikami has been successful in every genre he\u2019s tried. Since Resident Evil he has been a director or executive producer on critical hits like Devil May Cry, Vanquish, Killer 7 and Viewtiful Joe. It\u2019s a fascinatingly disparate and offbeat back catalogue. Despite all that, he seems much more grounded than other well-regarded game directors. When we arrive in the studio to meet Mikami, he is standing with junior members of staff in the vast open working area, watching one of them play the game. He converses quietly with the other spectators, exchanging observations and ideas. This is, apparently, how he works.

They both laugh. \u201cMikami has added that if he were to start the production of Evil Within again, he would probably accept less ideas,\u201d he says. Looking at Mikami again, it\u2019s obvious \u2013 he isn\u2019t relaxed, he\u2019s exhausted. The game has been in development for over three years.  And yet, he has talked enthusiastically about the process of development, and about horror. He chats about the influence that the Hellraiser films have had on both him and his lead concept artist, Ikumi Nakamura. When he talks, the spark is obvious; whatever it was that the ghostly tale of Yotsuya Kaidan ignited in him all those years ago is still alight. While Mikami is making games, there will always be horror and survival, and all that creeps up on us in between. Evil Within is released on PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One on 14 October.

They were precisely on time. Hundreds of people had waited overnight in each terminal to witness this historic event, which, like the Olympics, heralded not just Japan\u2019s recovery from the destruction of the second world war, but the beginning of what would be Japan\u2019s stratospheric rise as an economic superpower. The journey between Japan\u2019s two biggest cities by train had previously taken close to seven hours. The Shinkansen had made the trip in four.  The world\u2019s first high-speed commercial train line, which celebrates its 50th anniversary on Wednesday, was built along the Tokaido, one of the five routes that connected the Japanese hinterland to Edo, the city that in the mid-1800s became Tokyo. Though train lines crisscrossed the country, they were inadequate to postwar Japan\u2019s newborn ambitions. The term \u201cshinkansen\u201d literally means \u201cnew trunk line\u201d: symbolically, it lay at the very centre of the huge reconstruction effort. All previous railways were designed to serve regions. The purpose of the Tokaido Shinkansen, true to its name, was to bring people to the capital.      A couple say goodbye as he leaves on the Tohoku Shinkansen bullet train from Tokyo. Photograph: Kimimasa Mayama/EPA     After the war Tokyo was in ruins, but its rebuilding progressed without any master plan. As industries gravitated to the city, young people flocked to Tokyo to work; and as they started families they were encouraged to buy homes. The only land they could afford, however, was outside the already densely populated city. Property prices skyrocketed in the 1970s, and even more during the \u201cbubble era\u201d of the 1980s, forcing newer families even further from the city centre. Tokyo swelled to elephantine proportions. The Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area, composed of four prefectures, became the world\u2019s pre-eminent megalopolis \u2013 some 35 million people by 2010, or 27% of Japan\u2019s total population. It isn\u2019t unusual for commuters to spend two hours getting to work every day on trains that exceed 150% of capacity.   This \u201crush hour hell\u201d has been made famous worldwide by images of station employees stuffing stragglers into packed train cars \u2013 potent symbols of the superhuman forbearance of the Japanese worker, but also the dogged efficiency of Japan\u2019s railways. All foreign visitors to Japan invariably ride the trains and come away with the same impression: Japan\u2019s public transportation is the cleanest, most courteous in the world, run by uniformed, be-gloved men and women who still epitomise a hallowed Japanese work ethic that most companies struggle to maintain in an economy that has remained sluggish for two decades.      Crown prince Naruhito on board a Shinkansen bullet train in 1968. Photograph: Asahi Shimbun/Getty Images    But the most vital aspect of this efficiency is that trains run on time, all the time. This is not just a point of pride. It is a necessity, given the huge number of people that have to be moved. Transfers are timed to the split second, and the slightest delay has the butterfly effect of delaying connections. The Shinkansen is no exception, as exemplified by the \u201cangels\u201d: teams of pink-attired women who descend on a train as soon as it arrives at its terminal and in five minutes leave it spotless for the return trip.   The first Shinkansen skirted the Pacific coast through the huge industrial corridor that links the capital with Osaka. This is a nearly unbroken stretch of urbanisation: it has few parallels on the planet. By the early 1950s the conventional train that ran on this route was crammed. Taking a hint from the private Odakyu Electric Railway, which launched a train that could reach speeds of 145km/hr, Japan National Railways (JNR) decided to develop an even faster train, and in April 1959 construction of the Tokaido Shinkansen commenced with an initial budget of \u00a5200bn (\u00a31.1bn), though the eventual cost would be double that.  The high-speed network now reaches all the way west to the island of Kyushu and north to Akita, at the northern tip of the main island, Honshu. Next March, the Hokuriku Shinkansen will be extended to Kanazawa near the Japan Sea; there are plans to build a new line connecting Honshu to the northernmost island of Hokkaido. Each line is under the authority of one of four JR (Japan Railways) companies that formed when JNR was privatised in 1987. But the central government has overseen the construction of all new Shinkansen lines, usually covering 35% of the cost (JR companies pay 50% and local governments 15%). That means the construction ministry makes the relevant decisions about where lines go, or which cities get stations.        In an interview in the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper last week, Takashi Hara, a political scholar and expert on Japanese railroads, said the policy of extending the Shinkansen was promulgated by Kakuei Tanaka, Japan\u2019s prime minister from 1972 to 1974. \u201cThe purpose was to connect regional areas to Tokyo,\u201d Hara said. \u201cAnd that led to the current situation of a national Shinkansen network, which completely changed the face of Japan. Travel times were shortened and vibration was alleviated, making it possible for more convenient business and pleasure trips, but I have to say that the project just made all the [connecting] cities part of Tokyo.\u201d And where the Shinkansen\u2019s long tentacles go, other services shrivel. Local governments in Japan rely heavily on the central government for funds and public works \u2013 it\u2019s how the central government keeps them in line. Politicians actively court high-speed railways since they believe they attract money, jobs and tourists. In the early 1990s, a new Shinkansen was built to connect Tokyo to Nagano, host of the 1998 Winter Olympics. The train ran along a similar route as the Shinetsu Honsen, one of the most romanticised railroads in Japan, beloved of train buffs the world over for its amazing scenery \u2013 but also considered redundant by operators JR East because, as with almost all rural train lines in Japan, it lost money. There were only two profitable stations on the line \u2013 Nagano and the resort community of Karuizawa \u2013 and both would be served by the new Shinkansen. A large portion of the Shinetsu Honsen closed down; local residents who relied on it had to use cars or buses.  Meanwhile, the bullet train has sucked the country\u2019s workforce into Tokyo, rendering an increasingly huge part of the country little more than a bedroom community for the capital. One reason for this is a quirk of Japan\u2019s famously paternalistic corporations: namely, employers pay their workers\u2019 commuting costs. Tax authorities don\u2019t consider it income if it\u2019s less than \u00a5100,000 a month \u2013 so Shinkansen commutes of up to two hours don\u2019t sound so bad. New housing subdivisions filled with Tokyo salarymen subsequently sprang up along the Nagano Shinkansen route and established Shinkansen lines, bringing more people from further away into the capital.      A Shinkansen bullet train passes through central Tokyo. Photograph: Prisma Bildagentur/Alamy     The Shinkansen\u2019s focus on Tokyo, and the subsequent emphasis on profitability over service, has also accelerated flight from the countryside. It\u2019s often easier to get from a regional capital to Tokyo than to the nearest neighbouring city. Except for sections of the Tohoku Shinkansen, which serves northeastern Japan, local train lines don\u2019t always accommodate Shinkansen rolling stock, so there are often no direct transfer points between local lines and Shinkansen lines. The Tokaido Shinkansen alone now operates 323 trains a day, taking 140 million fares a year, dwarfing local lines. This has had a crucial effect on the physical shape of the city. As a result of this funnelling, Tokyo is becoming even denser and more vertical \u2013 not just upward, but downward. With more Shinkansen passengers coming into the capital, JR East has to dig ever deeper under Tokyo Station to create more platforms. Deepest of all is the new Tokyo terminal for the latest incarnation of the bullet train \u2013 the maglev, or Chuo (\u201ccentral\u201d) Shinkansen, which is supposed to connect Tokyo to Nagoya by 2027 and is being built 40m underground. The maglev is the next technological stage in the evolution of high-speed rail travel. It is meant to be a morale booster for Japan\u2019s railway industry, which no longer boasts the fastest trains or the biggest ridership in the world, distinctions that now belong to Japan\u2019s huge neighbour to the west.      A passenger in traditional dress on board a Japanese Hikari Shinkansen bullet train in 1965. Photograph: Three Lions/Getty Images    It is being built by JR Tokai, the company that runs the original super-profitable Tokaido Shinkansen, though experts assume the central government will eventually have to contribute money due to snowballing costs. The Chuo Shinkansen will cut the time it takes to get to Nagoya to 40 minutes, theoretically putting the central Japanese capital within commuting distance of Tokyo \u2013 in much the same way that the proposed HS2 will make Birmingham a bedroom community of London. \u201cThe Chuo Shinkansen will make Nagoya feel like a suburb of Tokyo,\u201d said Hara. If you have any doubt about that, consider that the maglev \u2013 short for \u201cmagnetic-levitation\u201d, and known in Japanese as \u201clinear motor car\u201d \u2013 has to move in as straight and as level a line as possible in order to reach the speeds that will make it the fastest train on Earth. But since Japan\u2019s topography is mostly mountainous, 86% of the journey will be underground. (The technology probably makes more sense on a flat, open terrain, and JR Tokai is trying to sell it abroad.) In other words, the maglev will essentially be a very long subway ride. Certainly few tourists will find it appealing. Plans are to extend the maglev to Osaka by 2045, by which time potential ridership will have declined by a third, due to Japan\u2019s shrinking population and more efficient air travel due to new regional airports. The Shinkansen is expensive; with the rise of low-cost carriers, any train trip that takes more than two hours from Tokyo is less cost-effective than flying. The development of the Shinkansen can\u2019t be separated from geography. China\u2019s faster, vaster high-speed rail service isn\u2019t all focused on Beijing, because the country itself is huge; in Japan, however, until recently the Shinkansen was the best way to get to Tokyo from almost anywhere. Like the first Shinkansen, the maglev is a national project, even if the central government hasn\u2019t spent any money on it (yet), but national priorities aren\u2019t as clear as they were in the 1950s. Tokyo can\u2019t get any bigger. Other areas of Japan are barely hanging on. Japan\u2019s high-speed rail system may end up being the victim of its own success."}, {"sentences": ["It\u2019s been fifty years since the inaugural Hikari Super Express Shinkansen made their way between Tokyo and Osaka, heralding the beginning of the bullet train age.", "An Ekiben on the shinaksen from Tokyo to Kyoto Photograph: Euan Brown    Click on the blue button below to share your stories via GuardianWitness."], "tags": ["Cities", "Rail transport", "Travel", "Japan", "World news", "Environment", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-30T13:33:48Z", "title": "Riding the Shinkansen: share your bullet train photos and memories", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/30/riding-the-shinkansen-share-your-bullet-train-photos-and-memories", "article": "It\u2019s been fifty years since the inaugural Hikari Super Express Shinkansen made their way between Tokyo and Osaka, heralding the beginning of the bullet train age.

The announcement comes a day after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the five-member panel that oversees natural gas infrastructure in the US, gave the green light to Dominion Energy\u2019s Cove Point export terminal, which could export tens of millions of dekatherms of natural gas each year. Cove Point is now slated to become the first gas export facility on the east coast of the US, and the fourth approved by FERC in the continental US. The only terminal currently in operation in the country is in Alaska. The facilities have run into opposition from environmentalists who say transporting gas thousands of miles away will increase greenhouse gas emissions. They also say the LNG facilities undermine the oil and gas industry\u2019s argument that increased hydraulic fracturing in the US will lead to energy independence. \u201cHow in the world do you enhance energy independence by exporting energy to other countries,\u201d said Mike Tidwell, the director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, a local environmental group. \u201cThat\u2019s just illogical on its face. Period.\u201d  Until recently, the idea of freezing and exporting gas from the US was economically impractical. But the hydraulic fracturing boom in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas and elsewhere has created a glut of natural gas. That\u2019s pushed gas prices in the US so low that energy companies now see the multi-billion dollar export facilities as a key to profitability. There are currently 14 more LNG export projects awaiting FERC review. The $3.4bn Cove Point facility will help Dominion reach the natural gas market in India and Japan, where natural gas prices are up to five times higher than in the US.  \u201cIt will allow the US to provide clean natural energy to two of our overseas allies who desperately need it,\u201d said Cove Point spokesman Karl Neddenien. Other LNG export facilities are aiming for the European market, where prices are also higher. But those higher prices may come with higher environmental costs. According to an Department of Energy analysis, gas export facilities are better for the environment than burning coal if methane leaks along the route are minimized. But some studies, including one by Cornell ecology professor Robert Howarth, suggest that methane leaks are several times higher than the DOE estimates. If that\u2019s the case, LNG facilities could be worse for global warming than coal. \u201cThere\u2019s methane leakage on the pipelines, leakage in the compressor station, liquefaction is really energy-intensive, then it goes on tanker ships running on fossil fuels all the way to Asia, where they re-vaporize it, and then it\u2019s lit of fire from downtown Tokyo to New Delhi,\u201d said Tidwell. \u201cObviously it\u2019s bad for the air, bad for water, and bad for the climate.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Rather than the frenetic neon of present-day Tokyo, it was the traditional arts and crafts in the frame here."], "tags": ["Paris fashion week", "Life and style", "Fashion weeks", "Fashion", "Alexander McQueen"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-30T22:59:59Z", "title": "Alexander McQueen enters a new age of saleable geometry", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/sep/30/alexander-mcqueen-geometry-paris", "article": "Two huge casts of white orchids made by British artist Marc Quinn \u2013 one male, the other female \u2013 filled the space for Alexander McQueen\u2019s spring/summer 2015 show at Paris fashion week on Tuesday evening. They were contrasted against the black shiny parquet flooring to give something of the Japanese lacquered box feel to the space. It was a neat backdrop for a collection that put Japan back on the McQueen map. Rather than the frenetic neon of present-day Tokyo, it was the traditional arts and crafts in the frame here. The first look was a black cape appliqu\u00e9d with bold pink chrysanthemums, and a frieze\u2013like geometric pattern across the centre. Others that followed included extraordinary python dresses with the leather handcut into red and black patterns like the lacquer boxes, and looser dresses with wide sleeves like kimonos. The shiny black masks worn around the models\u2019 faces hinted at the look of kabuki, also an inspiration and the overall effect had the crisp colour contrasts of the traditional Japanese aesthetic, but given a McQueen spin. See kinky boots laced up the knee, with a backless perspex heel, and armour\u2013like detailing across the bust of chiffon gowns. The final few dresses, with full skirts of palest pink and white organza cut into tiny feather shapes, were feats of craftsmanship.

If his shows were dramatic pieces of theatre, rather than a showcase of clothes to wear, Burton is walking the line between the two. His point of view always looms large in collections that bear his name, though. Burton knows it by heart \u2013 working side by side with him for so long means it\u2019s arguably hers too. This collection could be seen as a sequel to spring/summer 2001 \u2013 also inspired by Japan \u2013 and the McQueen-designed dress worn by singer Bj\u00f6rk on the cover of Homogenic in 1997. Four years after McQueen\u2019s death and now more accustomed to the limelight \u2013 designing the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s wedding gown in 2011 must have been a baptism of fire \u2013 a new era for the brand is slowly emerging, with the Duchess something of a figurehead. A mother of twins who today was dressed in ballet flats and loose combat pants, Burton\u2019s clothes have the drama but are more female-friendly. Her take on those Quinn sculptures spoke volumes. \u201cI loved the scale and the size but also their fragility \u2013 particularly the female one,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething so huge but fragile as well.\u201d A distinction between the past and present comes at a good time for the brand. Spring 2015 will see McQueen\u2019s work in the spotlight when the Victoria &amp; Albert museum hosts Savage Beauty, the retrospective first shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2010. The exhibition was a huge success and had queues around the block. The same is likely to happen here \u2013 especially with a new generation of twentysomethings keen to discover the designer behind that global name. Alexander McQueen the brand is robust under Burton. It is majority owned by Kering, the luxury conglomerate that also owns Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent. While Hedi Slimane\u2019s Saint Laurent is likely to remain the commercial star after Monday night\u2019s show wisely continued on the rockn\u2019roll track that has seen the label\u2019s sales grow by 27% in the second quarter of 2014, McQueen is consistently a success. Grouped with other smaller brands, along with Stella McCartney, revenue across these brands was up 8% in the same period. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 October 2014.

Among those reinforcements was S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s old foe Alo\u00edsio, who made his debut for S\u00e3o Paulo in the semi-finals of the 2005 Club World Cup in Tokyo against Al-Ittihad Football Club of Saudi Arabia. S\u00e3o Paulo went on the beat Liverpool F.C. in the final of that competition, and Alo\u00edsio appeared in another 60 games for S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201d LONGEST UNBEATEN DUOS \u201cGoing into this weekend\u2019s matches after five (or more) matches played, there are two Premier League teams still undefeated, three Bundesliga teams undefeated, a whopping five La Liga teams undefeated, and two Serie A teams undefeated,\u201d notes Bob Zoellner. \u201cWhat is the furthest/most matches played into a season in a league with more than one team still undefeated?\u201d The best we can do, Bob, is the 1998-99 Yugoslavian season. The campaign was abandoned after 24 games due to the war in the country and at that stage both Partizan Belgrade (P24 W21 D3 L0) and Obilic Belgrade (P24 W20 D4 L0) were unbeaten. ONE-SIDED DERBIES \u201cWhile watching a pre-match report on Portuguese TV recently, I learned that Lisbon\u2019s third club Belenenses had not won away to local rivals Sporting in over 60 years (a 1-1 draw at the Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade ensured this record continued),\u201d Oliver Farry reported last week. \u201cSuch unsuccessful streaks are not uncommon (I recall Spurs went more than 70 years without winning at Anfield before a 1-0 win in 1985 broke that duck) but are there worse instances in derby fixtures?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d suggest the Brugge derby has be one of the most one sided city derby in the world,\u201d writes Jamie McGrady. \u201cClub Brugge have won 95 fixtures compared to Cercle Brugge\u2019s 31 wins with 34 games ending as draws. Going from your supremacy rating that\u2019s a humiliating 64. Since becoming a major force in Belgium and in Europe in the early 70\u2019s, Club have won 54 league fixtures and lost only eight to their rivals. They didn\u2019t lose a single game from 1972-81 (17 wins, 2 draws). Worst still for Cercle it includes a couple of 5-0\u2019s, a 6-1, an 8-1 and a 10-0 loss. Club Brugge also won both cup finals in which they appeared together.\u201d Last week we also looked at the closest derby records. \u201cYou missed the Wool City derby off the list of finely-balanced derbies - Bradford City against Bradford Park Avenue,\u201d writes Paul Cook. \u201cTheir league record reads 21-20 to Avenue, but add in the FA Cup and it\u2019s 22 wins apiece with 11 draws and a goal record of 81-77 to Avenue, on par with the closest derbies in the world.\u201d FOODIES COMBOS \u201cMy team in the League of Ireland, Longford Town, played last week and Stephen Rice and Mark Salmon both scored,\u201d writes Padraig Stapleton. \u201cJust wondering if any similar food combos have ever scored in the same game? Or even played in the same team?\u201d \u201cHow about Norway v Morocco in World Cup \u201898?\u201d writes Joe Rivers. \u201cNorway scored twice courtesy of a Youssef Chippo own goal and a Dan Eggen strike. Therefore, their goals were scores by Eggen Chippo. I\u2019ve held this in my head for 16 years. It feels good to finally tell someone else about it.\u201d PIZZA, GOLD DISCS AND SEXY CAR WASHES (2) Last week we looked at the unusual bonuses awarded to players and teams for their on-field performances \u2013 featuring a lifetime supply of pizza, green Volkswagens and \u201ca sexy car wash\u201d. Colin McNicholas has been in touch with a doozy. \u201cIt brought me back to the story of when 1994 World Cup winner Marcio Santos signed for Fiorentina. Wasn\u2019t it true that they were owned at the time by a movie magnate of some description? Didn\u2019t he promise his Brazilian signing a date with Sharon Stone if he managed to notch a certain amount of goals? Or maybe it was all just a magical dream I had?\u201d Well, we turned to our Italian football guru Paolo Bandini for the truth:  The Santos story is an intriguing one. I have heard this tale many times before but never really known if it\u2019s just one of those things that got made up and repeated. Haven\u2019t got time at the moment for a really thorough dig, but I had a quick ping on the search engines of the major papers and came up with this article from La Repubblica on 4 August 1994.  It\u2019s written in an off-hand kind of way, using reported speech rather than an actual quote, but basically suggests that when Santos touched down in Florence, and was met by Italian reporters, he was talking about passions outside football and mentioned that he had a weakness for Sharon Stone. Vittorio Cecchi Gori, then in charge of Fiorentina, was standing nearby and said something along the lines of \u2018What\u2019s the problem? If you score me seven goals, I\u2019ll introduce you to her.\u2019 To which, Santos apparently replied that he reckoned he could get to seven (despite being a defender). Then, per this report, everyone laughs, slaps each other on the back, and the conversation moves on.  This report, for what it\u2019s worth, is actually from a week after his arrival, and is carrying the news that Stone has apparently told someone at Eurosport that she\u2019d be happy to meet Santos. I find it a bit odd that this was the earliest reference of the story I could find (if she\u2019s responding then surely it was a story beforehand?), but there you go.  Anyway, it seems that a few days later, the Sunday Mirror ran a report stating that the Stone meeting/seven goals had been a contractual stipulation. La Repubblica made a note of this version in their news-in-briefs, saying that \u201caccording to the English\u201d, this had all been written down in black and white. They didn\u2019t actually refute the Mirror\u2019s story (presumably because they had no way of knowing what the paper\u2019s sources were) but the writer seems to me as though he\u2019s writing with one eyebrow raised, opening by suggesting that Santos\u2019s decision to snub Tottenham for Fiorentina had put English noses out of joint. Or at least that\u2019s my reading of it ...\u201d    TRABZON VILLA? Somebody recently told me that Turkish premier league team Trabzonspor often play in a natty claret and blue combination virtually indistiguishable from the equally natty outfit displayed by Aston Villa,\u201d writes Dave Baxter. \u201cSupposedly the former adopted these colours in tribute to the latter. Is this true and, if so, why?\u201d Kind of, is the short answer. The president of Trabzonspor, Abraham Haciosmanoglu, has a slightly different take. His theory is that when the club were formed in 1967 they were so strapped for cash that they contacted a variety of other European clubs to ask if anyone would be able to donate a kit. Villa were thje only team to respond. \u201cI have seen theories on why Trabzonspor wear claret and blue but I\u2019d near heard this, even when we played them in the Uefa Cup in 1994\u201d said Steve Stride, the former Villa secretary who heard Haciosmanoglu\u2019s story in his role as a Uefa delegate at a Trabzonspor v Apollon Limassol Europa League match last year. \u201cBut the president assured me it\u2019s a fact.\u201d KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \u201cNottingham Forest\u2019s woeful 4-0 home defeat to Scunthorpe made me think: what\u2019s the worst defeat suffered by a team leading its league?\u201d asked Jonathan Wood in 2006. \u201cAnd the biggest win by a team at the bottom of the table?\u201d We had lots of great responses to both parts of this question, but they were all blown emphatically out of the water by Simon Lindberg, who recalled his team Eker\u00f6 IK thumping IFK Vaxholm 24-0 on the last day of the season, despite having already finished last in Sweden\u2019s fourth division. \u201cVaxholm were also near the bottom, but could no longer get relegated,\u201d recalls Simon. \u201cTheir B team needed a win to secure promotion in the reserves league, so they sent their A team to that game and their B team and youth players to play Eker\u00f6. We didn\u2019t even realise until we were 3-0 up after five minutes. For the first time that I know of, both the big Stockholm newspapers had articles about Eker\u00f6.\u201d But there have been a few impressive showings by rock-bottom teams domestically too, with Iain McCluskey pointing out that Newcastle brought up the rear of the Premiership when Bobby Robson took over in September 1999. Having previously failed to register a win in an admittedly young season, the Toon promptly thrashed Sheffield Wednesday 8-0 at St James\u2019s Park. Possibly more impressive was Sunderland\u2019s run of wins in early 1977, as Darren Beach points out. After finding themselves adrift at the foot of the first-division table with just two league wins by late February, they suddenly exploded with three successive big home wins - beating Middlesbrough 4-0, West Brom 6-1 and West Ham 6-0. They eventually finished the season with 11 wins, but still fell one point short of survival. As for top-placed sides taking a tonking, Norwich\u2019s 7-1 defeat at Blackburn in October 1992 was pretty bad, but not the worst. Back in 1939, league leaders Everton capitulated 7-0 to Wolves. \u201cIt was the only game legendary keeper Ted Sagar missed that season,\u201d beams Gavin Buckland. \u201cHis replacement Harry Morton later reflected: \u2018Ted must have known something getting out of that one.\u2019\u201d For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.

I tap my nails against the bartop in Gallery Conceal, Shibuya. I\u2019m jostled by a thick jam of game developers, all clutching laptops and chatting loudly.  The gallery is a tiny minimalist studio with a quaint bar and a vintage shaved-ice machine nestled in the back. The eternally attentive server grins and hands over my beer.  \u201cArigatou gozaimasu.\u201d Game makers of every nationality and background intermingle. The diversity of the community here is heartening: Japanese developers and gaikokujin or \u201cforeigners\u201d are exchanging ideas and business cards. This is the fourth meeting of Tokyo Indies, an informal event set up for small budget game developers in the region. It\u2019s busy tonight; the Tokyo Game Show, Japan\u2019s largest video game expo, finished the day before, and many of the developers in attendance here were in town to show their game to the 270,000 attendees. The creators of intriguing games like Band Saga, Vane, and Barkley 2 are present, showing trailers and giving introductions. I strain to look over heads at the projected images. The responses from the gathered crowd are lively and interested. But this feels like something new.             In the west, small-budget games have become increasingly visible thanks to Youtube, social media platforms and digital stores such as Xbox Live and Steam. Game makers have started developing more idiosyncratic, open-ended experiences, often without the help of a publisher. Minecraft is the famous example, but offbeat titles including Thomas Was Alone, The Stanley Parable and Fez have flourished in the new digital economy.  The Tokyo Game Show is centred upon serving Japanese gamers and their commercial tastes. This has traditionally meant that giant publishers such as Capcom, Sony and Konami have dominated the show floor. But indie studios are now big draws at western video game expos like PAX, Eurogamer Expo, and Gamescom. Specialist events like Wild Rumpus, Rezzed and IndieCade are also flourishing.  So what about Japan? Does \u201cindie\u201d really exist in the same way here? 2013 was the first year that small-budget game makers were provided a space at the Tokyo Game Show. However, the indie section was inside the kid\u2019s area, which was outside the main halls. This year, the indie presence was much more noticeable. The large Sony-sponsored indie booth was right in the middle of the floor between Konami and Capcom, indicating that the PlayStation manufacturer is serious about supporting independent design in Japan \u2013 just as it has been in the west. But the signs of a new indie developer community in Japan are strong outside of TGS too. Originally from Boston, USA, and now living and working in Tokyo, Alvin Phu started Tokyo Indies four months ago, and the meet-up has been growing in popularity. The games are interesting. I\u2019m particularly impressed with Ojiro Fumoto\u2019s Downwell, a 2D-platforming game for mobile platforms that takes its inspiration from Spelunky. It\u2019s very literal: your character goes down a well and has guns for shoes. You press one button to jump, and whilst jumping you can press again to shoot. It\u2019s funny and has a feeling of the labyrinthine lo-fi dungeon games of my childhood. Ojiro-san is developing it by himself whilst he studies here in Tokyo. He\u2019s the young hope. Phu is excited about Ojiro\u2019s game too. \u201cYeah, there are a lot of younger people like him with the talent,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been two years to develop to this state. You know, in the beginning [small-scale games development] wasn\u2019t that big in the US either \u2013 it\u2019s taken 10 years. It\u2019ll happen in Japan; there\u2019s probably going to be a lot of big games coming out soon. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m still here. Everyone\u2019s like, why are you in Japan? Why don\u2019t you just go back to the States? I know a lot of discouraged foreigners who went back. But maybe I can contribute something.\u201d The Canadian developer Sagar Patel, who lives and works in Kyoto, is here too. He just celebrated the first anniversary of Kyoto Indies, a similar event that he runs in, you guessed it, Kyoto. He explains that the catalyst for the indie community starting to form here was the success of Bitsummit in Kyoto, the first indie game festival in Japan. The event was started last year by James Mielke of Q Games, the veteran Japanese studio behind the revered Pixel Junk game series. It encouraged collaboration, feedback and support for small budget or solo developers working throughout the country. \u201cThat started the chain,\u201d Sagar says. \u201cWhen Bitsummit happened, the people who run TGS were like, \u2018Heeey, what\u2019s this indie thing about?\u2019\u201d      Sagar Patel, organiser of the Kyoto Indies event with Alvin Phu, who set up the Tokyo equivalent  Photograph: Cara Ellison    But the spirit \u2013 and financial realities \u2013 of \u201csmall budget\u201d developers wasn\u2019t immediately understood by the organisers of the Tokyo Game Show. \u201cThey were about to charge a thousand dollars for a booth until Sony swooped in and said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll cover it\u2019,\u201d Patel explains. \u201cBut it\u2019s getting better. The fact that Bitsummit was so popular with press and foreign press is making them realise it\u2019s something. The second Bitsummit was huge. The Kyoto government got involved as well because they liked it and they wanted more local businesses to partake. Then the TGS people came over and had some meetings.\u201d Bitsummit, Tokyo Indies and Kyoto Indies all have one thing in common: the main instigators of these events are westerners interested in creating a community around games in Japan. But indie games as a cultural movement in the west encompasses many problems still being struggled through, including the idea that developers who strike out on their own are only legitimised by commercial success. There are huge risks in going indie, too, particularly in the US where healthcare can be very expensive, and good healthcare is often attached to jobs within large corporations. Artistic experimentation is ostensibly encouraged, but largely, the community is predicated upon salable aesthetics. In the west, indie game making is still largely seen as product development, rather than creating something purely to express yourself. But Japan has already addressed this gap in expression in a way that the west hasn\u2019t. Japanese d\u014djin or \u201chobby\u201d game makers have already been developing small- to no-budget games from their homes for years, and a huge community has risen up around their distribution. Making a d\u014djin game often involves taking another established creative work, like a comic, and creating a small-scale fan tribute to it. Games in this genre can vary in quality from little experiments to fully fledged, polished game experiences, depending on how dedicated the developers are \u2013 and the scene predates any imported western indie game culture. D\u014djin has an extremely active and established community that is celebrated over a number of events such as Comiket, the word\u2019s largest d\u014djinshi fair. Patel says d\u014djin games have a very different sensibility to the indie scene in America. \u201cI feel like there are cultural things holding [a larger Japanese indie game community] back,\u201d he says. \u201cThe shyness, the unwillingness to show things \u2026 but slowly it is changing. Some things, such as Madoka-inspired games are not really pushing the boundaries, whereas Downwell \u2013 the game with the guns for shoes \u2013 that\u2019s really pushing the boundaries. It gives me hope.\u201d It\u2019s possible, however, that this \u201cboundary pushing\u201d is being observed by Patel and I from a very western perspective. Downwell is explicitly inspired by Derek Yu\u2019s hit \u201croguelike\u201d game, Spelunky (Ojiro displays Spelunky proudly on his laptop desktop), and because it comfortably sits in this pedigree, I can feel myself immediately warming to it.  Is what we perceive as boundary pushing in this game just extending our own western tropes, prejudices and genres? How is that different from the way that d\u014djin riff on previous work? Are we all just riffing all the time? Is \u201cindie game\u201d really an aesthetic in itself? In Part two tomorrow: what is the difference between d\u014djin and indie games in the Japanese development scene \u2013 and how optimistic are small studios about the future?

The Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport has oversight of both bodies and Grant said: \u201cI am keen to explore what more we can do to support basketball. I believe that the sport has great potential to reach more young people and grow in this country and we are in early discussions with Sport England and UK Sport about how we can help do that.\u201d The minutes of a recent Sport England board meeting show that the agency, funded by the National Lottery and the exchequer, is now prepared to put up a further \u00a3500,000 a year to help support elite level athletes and development programmes if the sum can be matched from elsewhere. While the proposal referred to all the sports that lost funding (which also include table tennis, synchronised swimming, handball, volleyball and wrestling) under UK Sport\u2019s \u201cno compromise\u201d criteria, it is understood that the majority of the money would be concentrated on basketball. The minutes said: \u201cThe board members discussed the issue and were broadly supportive of providing support. Any solution should be on a partnership basis with UK Sport and be consistent with Sport England\u2019s aims and objectives. It was agreed that Sport England should enter discussions with DCMS and UK Sport on this basis, with a budget of up to \u00a3500k per annum on a matched funding basis until 2018.\u201d The issue goes to the heart of the debate about whether the funding criteria for elite sport are too prescriptive and whether a \u201cspecial case\u201d should be made for those that have a proportionally greater impact on grassroots participation. Basketball \u2013 with its popularity in urban areas and potential widespread appeal \u2013 has ended up at the centre of that debate. UK Sport, which invests \u00a3125m a year in Olympic sport, took the decision to withdraw the sport\u2019s \u00a37m elite funding because there was no evidence that medals could be won at Rio 2016 or Tokyo 2020. Basketball still receives \u00a39m over four years from Sport England to fund grassroots programmes but argues that without an elite team there is nothing for young players to aspire to. British basketball\u2019s biggest name, Luol Deng, warned two months ago that the sport was \u201cvery close\u201d to collapsing in the UK due to the funding black hole. Grant is understood to have told UK Sport and Sport England to find a solution following talks with the British former NBA player John Amaechi. An all-party parliamentary group called for an urgent rethink in March. \u201cThe APPG notes the critical value of relevant role models to inspire young people in UK inner cities, and the strong evidence it has received about the unique role of basketball in meeting the needs of these communities,\u201d the report said. \u201cTherefore, the APPG urges an immediate rethink by the Minister of Sport regarding the funding of elite team sports, which is currently effectively shared by UK Sport and Sport England.\u201d The British Basketball chairman, Roger Moreland, keen for a quick decision so the sport can send a women\u2019s team to next summer\u2019s European Championship, is due to meet Grant this month. However any decision to make basketball a \u201cspecial case\u201d is likely to be greeted with dismay by other sports that suffered under the UK Sport\u2019s \u201cno compromise\u201d funding criteria that have underpinned Britain\u2019s recent Olympic medal successes."}, {"sentences": ["Orders for shares in 42 companies worth 67.78 trillion yen (\u00a3380bn) were cancelled in Tokyo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.", "Ayako Sera, a market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust in Tokyo, told Bloomberg: \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of orders this big being cancelled before."], "tags": ["Financial sector", "Investing", "Business", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-01T16:52:00Z", "title": "Japanese broker makes \u00a3380bn \u2018fat finger\u2019 trade", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/01/japanese-trader-380bn-pounds-fat-finger", "article": "Japan avoided the biggest of all \u201cfat finger\u201d meltdowns on Wednesday when an unidentified large stockbroker managed to cancel rogue trades worth more than the size of Sweden\u2019s economy.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said that though markets self-correct after aberrant trades, the Japanese orders would have caused blind panic as automated trades tracked the market downwards. \u201cWhen you get an order of that size it\u2019s human nature and with a large move the robots, the algorithms, will jump on the back of it.\u201d The unidentified broker who made the Toyota order was able to cancel the trades because they were carried out on the over-the-counter (OTC) market, which gives traders time to cancel before completion. OTC transactions are carried out directly between the buyer and the seller and not through an exchange. The biggest stock market fall ever, 2010\u2019s flash crash in New York, was initially blamed on a fat finger sell order for Procter &amp; Gamble shares. The investigation into the $1 trillion collapse concluded that a large but intended single trade in a fragile market had set off a spiral of selling."}, {"sentences": ["Aum Shinrikyo, the apocalyptic cult that attacked the Tokyo underground in 1995, fuses the Sanskrit mantra aum with a word meaning \u201cteaching of the supreme truth\u201d."], "tags": ["Islamic State", "Language", "Science", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-01T17:27:52Z", "title": "Why there\u2019s no such thing as Islamic State | David Shariatmadari", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/01/islamic-state-language-isis", "article": "\u201cThe whole language is a machine for making falsehoods,\u201d says the main character in Iris Murdoch\u2019s first novel, Under the Net. His view is that the words we use trap us into seeing the world in a certain way. Orwell believed the same: if there\u2019s no name for it, you can\u2019t really think about it. Conversely, a name can be created for something that doesn\u2019t really exist. Linguists have argued for decades about the strength of this effect: the consensus is that language guides, rather than determines, thought. It can set up habits, no more. But habits can be tenacious. Politicians have long known this. Advertisers know it. And so do terrorists. And with the evolution of Islamic State (Isis) we have a neat case study in the power of proper nouns. This faction of Sunni fighters first called itself Jama\u2019at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, clearly a name for local consumption. It means The Group for Monotheism (tawhid) and Struggle (the literal meaning of jihad, a word as multivalent in English as it is in Arabic). There haven\u2019t been polytheistic religions in the region for centuries, but in Muhammad\u2019s time Arabs worshipped many gods. So what\u2019s being brought to mind are Islam\u2019s earliest years \u2013 a time of pure faith when the effort to displace paganism was at its height. Soon the name changed again, to locate the group geographically, first in bilad al-rafidayn (land of the two rivers: Mesopotamia) and later in Iraq and al-Sham (the Levant \u2013 the \u201cl\u201d in the British government\u2019s preferred term, Isil). Both these names are romantically archaic. In particular, al-Sham was a province in the earliest Muslim empire, presided over by the \u201crightly guided caliphs\u201d \u2013 the direct successors of Muhammad. So far, so much fundamentalist dogwhistling. But for an English-speaking audience, the message is lost: until you arrive at Islamic State, a title that recasts the idea of the caliphate \u2013 a pre-modern community of believers \u2013 for westerners used to a 19th-century model of nationhood. The shift is important because it suggests something substantial, a country with borders, laws and institutions. Look at the map of what it controls, however, and you\u2019ll see anything but a state in the modern sense. Its territory snakes along riverbanks, grabbing towns here and there, extending its fingers into patches of desert. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, has rightly suggested we reject Isis\u2019s self-designation. \u201cThis is a terrorist group and not a state,\u201d he said. \u201cThe term Islamic State ... blurs the lines between Islam, Muslims and Islamists.\u201d He recommends \u201cDaesh\u201d, the acronym of the Arabic phrase al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi Iraq wal-Sham. Although that too means The Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham, to non-Arabic speakers it is just a noise. Free of associations at the moment, it will become infused with our ideas about Isis \u2013 just as al-Qaida, rather than bringing to mind its translation, \u201cthe base\u201d, has become irrevocably linked with death and destruction. The names given to cults, militant factions or revolutionaries tend to be propaganda or insult. The various groups styled Hezbollah think of themselves as the \u201cparty of God\u201d. Hizb ut-Tahrir is the \u201cparty of liberation\u201d. The clowns of al-Muhajiroun, which means \u201cthe emigrants\u201d, sacrilegiously compare themselves to the helpers who accompanied Muhammed as he left Mecca in 622, the year that marks the beginning of the Islamic era. Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, believed itself the only movement in the world to offer a route to untainted communism. Aum Shinrikyo, the apocalyptic cult that attacked the Tokyo underground in 1995, fuses the Sanskrit mantra aum with a word meaning \u201cteaching of the supreme truth\u201d. Sometimes the branding fails. Hassan-i Sabbah, a charismatic dissident in 11th century Iran, founded a sect based on what he called ad-Dawa al-Jadida, \u201cthe new doctrine\u201d. It included a branch he named the fedayeen, or \u201cself-sacrificers\u201d, whose duty was to destroy political opponents. Their enemies had another term for them: the hashashins, or pot-smokers. They were portrayed as drugged lunatics, and it stuck \u2013 it\u2019s where we get the word \u201cassassin\u201d. In a very different context, the wing of the Russian Social Democratic party led by Julius Martov found itself labelled \u201cMenshevik\u201d \u2013 those of the minority \u2013 after losing an internal struggle for which they actually had majority backing. The Bolsheviks, \u201cthose of the majority\u201d, won the day and went on the form the Soviet Union. Try marshalling support under a banner that conveys your essential weakness. One of the great hazards of language is how words for abstract ideas and concrete nouns can occupy the same slots. I can say \u201cI want to change the tyre\u201d and \u201cI want to change politics for ever\u201d; the latter sounds as if it makes sense, but could mean almost anything. Likewise, there is a world of difference between demolishing a building and, as one commentator had it, with reference to Isis, demolishing a diverse group of people, their aims and their ideas. Neither can anyone \u201ccrush\u201d terror, or wage war on it. Those who use this kind of language to describe their actions \u2013 just as those who tell us they\u2019re creating an \u201cIslamic State\u201d \u2013 will in fact be doing something very different. It\u2019s our task to peer out from under the net of language and work out what."}, {"sentences": ["Their unlikely structures \u2013 which now dot the globe from Oslo to Tokyo \u2013 are often initiated by equally fantastical questions: What if pig farms were housed in high-rise towers?"], "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Culture", "Netherlands", "Rotterdam holidays", "Europe holidays", "Cities", "Europe", "Shopping trips", "Housing"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-02T12:47:45Z", "title": "Rotterdam's Markthal: Superdutch goes supersized in psychedelic marketplace", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/oct/02/-sp-rotterdam-markthal-superdutch-market-mvrdv", "article": "A four-storey high raspberry tumbles past a tree-sized floret of broccoli, while gigantic prawns plummet towards a pile of mega-mange tout.

The new Rotterdam Markthal from MVRDV.

Driven by poppy polemic, their projects are characterised by improbable structural feats, executed with cartoonish glee. These are \u201clook, no hands!\u201d buildings, where slabs appear to float and towers teeter on the brink of toppling; architectural circus acts that are often dressed up in accordingly garish garb. Their unlikely structures \u2013 which now dot the globe from Oslo to Tokyo \u2013 are often initiated by equally fantastical questions: What if pig farms were housed in high-rise towers? What if a comic museum was shaped like a cluster of enormous concrete speech bubbles? At their worst, the answers to these daydreams prioritise wit and wow factor over functional reality; at their best, the jaw-drop is so powerful that all else can be forgiven. So does their latest project manage to tread this fine line? Galumphing into the middle of the city\u2019s sprawling Blaak market square, the great behemoth of the Markthal is certainly hard to miss. It squats like a chubby elephantine creature, lined with windows and balconies along its 120 metre-long flanks, terminating in a gaping portal towards the square like Milan\u2019s galleria, opening up to suck you into its psychedelic tunnel.     An aerial view of the market. Photograph: Ossip Van Duivenbode/PR    But rather than trumpeting the heroic form of a triumphal archway, its proportions seem squashed and deflated, presenting a facade that is almost wilfully clumsy. It\u2019s like a once-elegant arcade that has been deformed by the practical needs of incorporating straight, vertical lift shafts, naturally lit apartments and larger floor areas for shops in the lower levels, causing the silhouette to flare out at the base, as though it\u2019s wearing bell-bottom trousers. Like the podgy ligatures of the Comic Sans typeface, it feels like it\u2019s trying a bit too hard to be fun. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be glassy and stylie, like your Foster and Rogers,\u201d says Winy Maas, the energetic principal of MVRDV. \u201cRotterdam has a big working class population, so the building needs to be pop. We didn\u2019t want that contemporary poshness, or for it to feel like Harrods food court.\u201d The grey cladding, he says, is the same Chinese granite that Rotterdam is paved with, \u201cto extend the street up over the building,\u201d while the outlandish form is designed to join in with the surrounding \u201cmish mash\u201d of novelty shapes that have congregated in this part of the city. Flattened during the second world war, Rotterdam has served as a fertile architectural playground for the last 50 years, partly egged on by Hans Mentink, the politician in charge of planning in the 1970s, who called for \u201carchitecture with some life in it\u201d. Across the market square stands the startling sight of Piet Blom\u2019s 1970s Kubuswoningen, a forest of tilted yellow cubes hoisted aloft on pillars above the busy main road, forming a bizarre treehouse village \u2013 the pinnacle of his manifesto for \u201cliving as an urban roof\u201d. Next door stands his hexagonal tower block in the shape of a sharpened pencil, while further along is the central library, a stepped ziggurat sprouting a tangle of bright yellow pipes, like a mini Pompidou Centre.

Photograph: Daria Scagliola &amp; Stijn Brakkee/PR    \u201cIt\u2019s all so cute,\u201d coos Maas, looking down from the window of one of the new Markthal apartments, which enjoy a view of this strange architectural menagerie. \u201cWe thought this collection had a sentimental beauty that could be monumentalised in our building\u201d \u2013 indeed the elfin whimsy of the pencil tower is nicely framed by the market\u2019s archway. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuation, in the best Rotterdam tradition.\u201d The other side of the apartments look down into the food hall below, an arrangement originally intended to allow residents to haul up their shopping in a basket, but environmental regulations mean the windows are sadly now fixed shut. The odd form has also led to some awkward interiors; the 14 metre-deep flats feel a bit gloomy, with angled walls and windows recalling Blom\u2019s cube houses.  The \u20ac1.2m upper level penthouses, meanwhile, have open courtyard terraces with vertiginous views down through windows in the floor. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how you feel when your child is playing Lego above a 40-metre drop,\u201d beams Maas, a maniacal glint in his eye. The traders down below couldn\u2019t be happier with their new home, although those running stalls in the heaving market outside have mixed feelings about their new neighbour. The original plan was for the Markthal to be made up of a third traders from the market, a third new stalls, and a third brand-name shops, but only a few existing traders have taken up the offer of going indoors, given the hike in rent. While Blaak accommodates a broad church, from fine fishmongers to bric-a-brac junk, the Markthal is strictly a foodie utopia of artisan bakers and biological butchers, aimed at a more upmarket clientele. As one shopper puts it candidly: \u201cIt\u2019s a great place. You can wander around inside and get inspired by the amazing displays, then go outside and buy the same stuff for a quarter of the price.\u201d     Queen M\u00e1xima of the Netherlands attends the opening of the Rotterdam Market Hall. Photograph: Barcroft Media    The building\u2019s ethos is one of celebrating local, organic produce, with a centre to promote healthy cooking, and there plans for mini urban farms on the market stall rooftops \u2013 although that hasn\u2019t prevented the commercial imperative of including a gigantic chain supermarket in the basement below. And, like many of Rotterdam\u2019s recent inner-city developments, despite it being a beacon of downtown urban life, it has a strangely suburban approach to planning: deep within its bowels is the city\u2019s biggest car park, with 1,200 spaces, despite the metro and bus station being right opposite.

It is a suitable climax for this most surreal of spaces which is, after all, the star of the show. It is an urban interior conceived on a heroic Roman scale, which almost forgives the external clumsiness \u2013 and another large apartment block will soon rise next door, helping to screen its immense bulk. \u201cI\u2019m secretly hoping that houses will grow up all around it, like a medieval cathedral,\u201d says Maas. \u201cThat would be the dream.\u201d Oliver Wainwright\u2019s trip to Rotterdam was provided by Rotterdam Partners."}, {"sentences": ["In part one, she visited Tokyo Indies, a get-together where lone developers and small studios can show off their latest projects.", "An interesting preview video of this year\u2019s Comiket, a hobbyist manga and game development event held annually in Tokyo.", "\u201cNow why is that?\u201d asks Alvin Phu, game developer and organiser of the regular Tokyo Indies gatherings.", "\u201cThey are different in that manner.\u201d Goto thinks that the Tokyo Game Show didn\u2019t really care about indie game makers until this year when the media became interested in them."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Indie games", "PC", "Tokyo holidays", "Xbox", "PlayStation", "Game culture", "Events"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-02T14:22:37Z", "title": "D\u014djin nation: inside Japan's indie gaming scene, part two", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/dojin-japan-indie-gaming-scene-part-two", "article": "This is the second part of Cara Ellison\u2019s look at the Japanese indie games scene. In part one, she visited Tokyo Indies, a get-together where lone developers and small studios can show off their latest projects. What is \u201cindie\u201d? What do we mean, when we talk about indie game development? It\u2019s something developers and writers in the west have pondered on a lot lately, as the nature and business of game development evolves.  In Japan, too, the demarcations between development types and identifying labels have become arbitrary and unclear. For example, The Touhou Project, a series of \u201cbullet hell\u201d scrolling shoot-\u2019em-ups by one-man outfit, Team Shanghai Alice, is considered a successful d\u014djin game series \u2013 in other words, a hobbyist development project. However, people refer to the Japanese-developed Cave Story \u2013 a clear homage to Nintendo\u2019s Metroid titles by lone developer Daisuke Amaya \u2013 as indie.         An interesting preview video of this year\u2019s Comiket, a hobbyist manga and game development event held annually in Tokyo. It\u2019s a key showcase for d\u014djin games.    \u201cNow why is that?\u201d asks Alvin Phu, game developer and organiser of the regular Tokyo Indies gatherings. \u201cI can\u2019t really answer these questions. I am not Japanese.\u201d Instead, I ask independent developers Makoto Goto and Mika Maruyama what they think. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to give an explanation because the perspective is different,\u201d Goto says. \u201cAlmost always, the d\u014djin creator has a daytime job and their hobby is making d\u014djin games. But with indie games, the importance is on making money.\u201d Maruyama expands a little on what she thinks the indie philosophy is: she tells me that d\u014djin creators take their inspiration from manga and anime that they admire, but indie games are more often a reflection of something more centred inside the creator.  Maruyama\u2019s website, for example, is a showcase of her original artwork and enchanting music, the sort that excites me about her forthcoming first game, as yet unnamed, which I hope will be the crossroads of all her many talents. \u201cIndie games are based on the self,\u201d Goto says. \u201cThey are different in that manner.\u201d Goto thinks that the Tokyo Game Show didn\u2019t really care about indie game makers until this year when the media became interested in them. There has also been a change of environment surrounding developers Goto says, with Valve\u2019s Steam platform and start ups making a big difference.     An illustration by artist and game designer, Mika Maruyama Photograph: public domain    In 2009, heavyweight Japanese developer Keiji Inafune, the \u201cfather\u201d of Capcom\u2019s legendary platform gaming series Megaman, made a famous remark. \u201cPersonally when I looked around [at] all the different games at the TGS floor I said \u2018Man, Japan is over. We\u2019re done. Our game industry is finished.\u2019\u201d Though he teaches game design and speaks regularly on games in Japan, Inafune has reinforced this opinion of the Japanese games industry since, saying there are too many sequels on the TGS floor. But I wonder if he might have been excited this year by the number of original Japanese indie games at TGS, including the intriguing Vane, developed by ex-members of Team Ico, the creators of Ico, Shadow of the Colossus and the long-awaited, Last Guardian. Onion Games\u2019 Million Onion Hotel, a brilliantly funny puzzle game studded with Yoshiro Kimura\u2019s poetry, was also a highlight of the indie booths. I think Inafune would love Downwell too. \u201cIt\u2019s such an exciting inspiration,\u201d Goto says on the rise of the Japanese indies. He thinks all kinds of game makers in Japan will take full advantage of the opportunities provided by the rise of the indie community, and that it\u2019s possible the d\u014djin community will also benefit from this new emphasis on small budget developers. Patel hopes that Japanese student game makers will take over running Kyoto Indies and invite new people into the fold. There\u2019s a sense here that Japanese developers are taking ownership of their future; they are becoming less afraid of the risks of going it alone. \u201cThe spirit of indie game makers and d\u014djin game makers is the same,\u201d Goto says. \u201cWe can make our own games.\u201d Six interesting Japanese indie games to try today     Cherry Tree High Comedy Club \u2013 a super cute school adventure from Nyu Media Photograph: public domain    1.

Oslo, the clear favourite, withdrew on cost grounds after the Norwegian government voted against providing the necessary guarantees. More than 50% of the population were against the hosting of the Games, and the minority partner in the ruling coalition voted four months ago against bidding. \u201cWe feel sorry for sport in Norway and the athletes,\u201d said the IOC president, Thomas Bach. \u201cIt\u2019s really a missed huge opportunity for sports and the people of Norway.\u201d He insisted the IOC had not been damaged by Oslo becoming the fourth city to pull out of the race. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even got a black eye. We should not forget we have two candidates who are offering two very interesting approaches,\u201d he said. Norway\u2019s move provoked an unusually angry response from the IOC, which had offered $880m (\u00a3550m) towards the hosting of the event. The director of sport Christophe Dubi said the decision had been based on \u201chalf-truths and factual inaccuracies\u201d, and rounded on government officials for not turning up to key meetings. In a round of interviews to try to repair the damage on Thursday, Bach said the IOC would not reopen the bidding process. The two remaining bidders, neither of which are established winter sport nations, are likely to be targeted by human rights campaigners. Last week it emerged that the IOC had written an explicit \u201canti-discrimination\u201d clause into the host city contract. Stockholm in Sweden, Krakow in Poland and Lviv in Ukraine had all withdrawn bids in recent months. Before that, potentially strong bids from St Moritz, Switzerland, and Munich, Germany, were dropped after being rejected by voters in referendums. The $51bn cost of hosting the Sochi Winter Olympics, the most expensive in history, has made governments and their citizens wary of hosting the Games. Bach has repeatedly stressed that the majority of Russia\u2019s investment was in infrastructure projects and regeneration that was separate from the $2bn operational budget. But given the increased tendency to award major sporting events to nations keen to use them as the impetus for major infrastructure projects, it is increasingly hard to differentiate between the two budgets. The shortlist for the 2020 summer Games, which will be held in Tokyo, was only three-strong after Rome pulled out for economic reasons. Bach accepted that financial concerns had hindered its search for a host for the 2022 Games but said proposed changes to the bidding process, which would reduce costs and increase transparency, would help. \u201cWe have to communicate, communicate, communicate about the two different budgets,\u201d said Bach, who was elected president last year. \u201cWe have to see how we can reduce the costs of the management of the games and the cost of bidding for the Games.\u201d His Olympic Agenda 2020 proposals, which include ideas to reduce the cost of bidding for and hosting the Games, will be voted on in Monaco in December. \u201cThe proposal is to change the philosophy of bidding,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cIn the past we have asked the cities in which way they would fulfil the conditions set. So in the future we would prefer to ask the cities how they see an Olympic Games best fitting into their long-term social, sports, ecological and economic development.\u201d Public sentiment in Norway, which has a proud winter sports tradition and is always well represented by travelling fans at the Winter Olympics, was clouded not only by the huge costs of the Sochi Games but newspaper reports outlining the IOC\u2019s demands. Beijing is now the favourite to win the vote next year and become the first city to host both the winter and summer Games.

He said the latest Chinese route to the growing city of Chengdu, launched in late 2013, had disappointed and was slower to develop than hoped. \u201cIn terms of passenger demand, we are struggling as a result of Chinese visas. That\u2019s a perfect example of where UK government policy is working against the UK interests of developing more business with China.\u201d Walsh also claimed that Sir Richard Branson has handed over control of his Virgin Atlantic airline to its \u201cmore rational\u201d American minority partner Delta Air Lines. A 49% stake in Virgin owned by Singapore Airlines was sold last year to Delta. Virgin and Delta have since confirmed a transatlantic partnership and codeshare on routes from Heathrow to the US. Branson\u2019s carrier has meanwhile rowed back from a range of destinations around the world, announcing withdrawals from Mumbai, Tokyo and Nairobi. Walsh said: \u201cVirgin is controlled by Delta. Decisions are taken in Atlanta by the Delta management team who are one of the best in the business. They are much more rational in terms of their behaviour.\u201d He added: \u201cVirgin has almost disappeared... Delta control Virgin, without any doubt, without any question. We just call it Delta now. \u201c Walsh said that he believed foreign ownership rules, which prevent non-European companies from running EU airlines, should be scrapped, but said he expected them to be applied to Delta. He said: \u201cYou could argue that if the rules are there they should be applied. The US is stronger on this... Europe is weak. Europe has lots of rules that they don\u2019t necessarily abide by.\u201d A spokesman for Virgin said: \u201cWe agree Delta are the best airline partner in the marketplace and are glad Willie Walsh feels the same. We\u2019ve clearly rattled his cage by how strong a competitor we now are on the US route.\u201d Walsh took a further swipe at his rival, whose domestic service to Scotland and Manchester from Heathrow, Little Red, has been operating with a large proportion of empty seats. Its Heathrow slots, owned by BA, were awarded to Virgin by competition authorities after BA bought BMI from Lufthansa. Walsh said: \u201cIt\u2019s looking terrible. The fact is that they are struggling \u2013 you cannot make money flying planes that are less than half-full. I said it would be a mistake and am delighted to be proven correct.\u201d Walsh was speaking on the first flight from London to Washington of BA\u2019s A380 aircraft, the first time the two nations\u2019 capitals have been connected by the two superjumbos. BA has now received 7 of the 12 doubledecker Airbus aircraft, which can carry up to 469 passengers. Walsh said the plane was a \u201cbeautiful machine\u201d for Heathrow. \u201cThe business case for the A380 was based on high-volume routes when frequency was not in a critical issue in a slot constrained airport like Heathrow, and it\u2019s absolutely perfect in that environment.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["The FIA had offered an earlier start time of 11am to the race promoters, Honda, who had reportedly rejected it because fans would not be able to make it to the circuit, which is around three hours from Tokyo."], "tags": ["Jules Bianchi", "Formula One 2014", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-05T22:32:50Z", "title": "Jules Bianchi crash sends F1 into another period of self-examination | Giles Richards", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/oct/05/jules-bianchi-crash-f1", "article": "The accident that befell Jules Bianchi during Sunday\u2019s Japanese Grand Prix was the most serious in Formula One since Felipe Massa was hit by a suspension spring which left him in a life-threatening situation after qualifying at the Hungarian GP in 2009. He recovered, and it is the sincerest wish of everyone involved in Formula One that Bianchi will too. The driver was undergoing surgery for a severe head injury on Sunday night. Formula One has not suffered a death on track at a race weekend since Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger were killed at Imola in the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994. It is to the sport\u2019s credit that changes to circuit and car design and improved safety procedures have produced such a remarkable record in an inherently dangerous occupation. But, here, after Bianchi\u2019s crash, F1 knows it will now have to undergo a bout of serious self-examination. Bianchi went off at the very quick Dunlop curve in heavy rain and hit the tractor crane recovery vehicle that was removing Adrian Sutil\u2019s car from the track after he had exited at the same corner on the previous lap. It was a big accident and it soon became clear that Bianchi was badly injured. The ramifications are immediate and raise questions that strike across central aspects of the sport. That the typhoon Phanfone was heading for Suzuka was well known in advance, indeed, until Sebastian Vettel announced he was leaving Red Bull, its potential effect on the race had largely been the topic of discussion in the paddock. Heavy rain had been predicted for both race day and the race window of 3pm to 4.30pm, while from the Friday an early start was also being discussed. The race starts at 3pm local time largely to make it as attractive as possible to the European TV market, where it is then 7am. At Suzuka, where darkness falls exceptionally quickly at 5.30pm, rain and any associated delay would mean potentially a wet race finishing on difficult conditions in poor visibility at dusk. The typhoon did not arrive on Sunday but this perfect storm was exactly what transpired.           Former champion John Watson reacts to the crash    Heavy rain had caused the race to be red-flagged just two laps in and 20 minutes were lost before it restarted. When the downpour returned with intensity in the latter stages, spray, low cloud cover and deteriorating light made for extremely difficult conditions. Williams\u2019s Massa was vocal in his criticism of both the start and finish. \u201cIn my opinion they started the race too early because it was undriveable at the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they finished it too late. I was already screaming on the radio five laps before the safety car that there was too much water on the track. But then they took a little bit too long, we saw it was dangerous and we saw a crash.\u201d Given the widespread knowledge of the expected poor conditions and the speed with which darkness would descend, why had it not been started earlier? The FIA had offered an earlier start time of 11am to the race promoters, Honda, who had reportedly rejected it because fans would not be able to make it to the circuit, which is around three hours from Tokyo. They have since made no statement on the matter and it is also impossible to ignore the part that the complex financial and scheduling implications of shifting the time for TV companies may have played. Yet safety would seem an overriding imperative to insist there was a change of start time. The drivers, however, had not been consulted. \u201cWe weren\u2019t asked about our opinion,\u201d said Sutil who witnessed Bianchi\u2019s crash. \u201cIt got more wet the whole day through and it would have been quite easy to make the race a bit earlier but it\u2019s not in my hands.\u201d In the statement on Sunday evening confirming that Bianchi was undergoing surgery, the FIA pointed out that marshals in the area around Dunlop had been waving double yellow flags, warning of great danger ahead and that drivers must slow down and be prepared to stop. But the safety car had not at that point been deployed for Sutil\u2019s accident. Bianchi may have lifted off but coming out of the high-speed turns would still have been travelling at great speed and flags in those conditions may not have been enough. \u201cYou are going into the barrier if you go off there,\u201d said the former driver and television analyst Martin Brundle. \u201cThere\u2019s no way of recovering, you are going too fast. Some will say there are yellow or double yellows flags but that doesn\u2019t stop you spinning off.\u201d The race director, Charlie Whiting in this instance, makes the call on deploying the safety car. The race had started and then restarted behind it but questions will remain why, given the circumstances, it was not immediately called out when Sutil went off. Then there is the crash itself. Bianchi hit a recovery vehicle, which has large wheels and a high ground clearance that will allow an F1 car to go in underneath it. Much as the safety aspects of modern cars have improved, they are designed to cope with impacts on other cars or barriers, not a tractor. Brundle has first-hand experience of this and has long-questioned their deployment. In the rain-soaked 1994 Japanese Grand Prix here at Suzuka he narrowly missed a tractor removing Gianni Morbidelli\u2019s car. \u201cI really thought that was it,\u201d he has said of the incident. \u201cI hit a patch of standing water and closed my eyes \u2013 I really thought this is the end.\u201d He recalled the incident immediately after this race as well. \u201cI spun off under yellows [flags], there was so much spray I couldn\u2019t even see my own steering wheel let alone the yellow flags that day. If one car goes off there\u2019s so much greater chance of another going off in the same place.\u201d There is a clear need for safety purposes to remove damaged cars from the track. The race winner, Lewis Hamilton, who drove superbly and now leads his title rival Nico Rosberg by 10 points, said it was \u201cnormal protocol. They have to get the cars off the track for safety. If a car was sitting there and someone had gone off they would have hit the car\u201d. But again, how and under what circumstances will be in the spotlight. Brundle was forthright in his view that recovery vehicles are a problem. \u201cMy concern is those things on track. I nearly lost my life against one of them, just missed it and hit a marshal,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are just too high and you are sitting down low.\u201d Their use at race weekends in removing cars swiftly has become ubiquitous but may now require more regulated control, particularly in heavy rain. \u201cProcedures have to be looked at,\u201d said the former F1 and current Toyota World Endurance Championship driver Anthony Davidson. \u201cPerhaps, no diggers or vehicles on the track in extreme conditions? It\u2019s inevitable cars will collect in points like that. You shouldn\u2019t have recovery vehicles on the track.\u201d Sadly but perhaps more understandably there was also confusion. Shortly after the incident the FIA stated that: \u201cThe driver is not conscious and has been sent to the hospital by ambulance because the helicopter cannot fly in these conditions.\u201d However the helicopter was seen taking off only minutes later prompting many to ask why it had not been used. With a direct land route to the hospital within 20 minutes and Bianchi having suffered a head wound it is probable the FIA medical delegate decided this was the safer option but there remains no further explanation. Clarity over the circumstances and what the procedures are in such emergencies would be welcome. Twelve months ago, while the Japanese Grand Prix weekend was proceeding, the former Marussia test driver Mar\u00eda de Villota was found dead at a hotel in Seville. De Villota lost her right eye in her first test for the team in July 2012, when she ran into a stationary lorry during testing. She made a remarkable recovery but her death was attributed to neurological injuries sustained in the accident. The team will understandably have few fond memories of Suzuka, then, but as Niki Lauda, who withdrew from the championship-deciding Japanese Grand Prix in Fuji in 1976 because he considered the weather conditions too bad, reminded everyone present: \u201cMotor racing is dangerous. We get used to it if nothing happens and then suddenly we\u2019re all surprised.\u201d Which is blunt yet possibly acceptably so, from a driver who came back from a terrible accident at the N\u00fcrburgring that year. Perhaps this incident is one that will further galvanise the sport to even greater efforts to avoid any further unwanted surprises."}, {"sentences": ["The short-haul carrier\u2019s demise came after a major review of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s wider network, which saw a number of destinations including Mumbai, Cape Town and Tokyo axed as it focuses on profitable transatlantic routes."], "tags": ["Virgin Atlantic", "Airline industry", "Business", "UK news", "Travel", "Travel & leisure", "Flights"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-06T13:25:00Z", "title": "Virgin Atlantic scraps Little Red domestic services", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/06/virgin-atlantic-scraps-little-red-service", "article": "Virgin Atlantic has announced plans to scrap its domestic airline, Little Red, after just 18 months. The carrier has struggled to fill seats on its flights linking London Heathrow with Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Manchester, and finally admitted defeat after weeks of speculation that the operation would be axed. Little Red\u2019s daily services to Manchester will end in March; its Scottish services will cease in September. Sir Richard Branson, the Virgin Atlantic president, claimed the venture had benefited consumers but \u201cthe odds were stacked against us\u201d. Little Red launched in March 2013 after European competition authorities made British Airways relinquish Heathrow slots for domestic flying after its takeover of bmi. While more than a million passengers have flown on its domestic routes, Virgin Atlantic admitted that demand had been predominantly from point-to-point customers rather than the connecting traffic it had hoped for, feeding more passengers on to its more profitable long-haul routes. The Virgin Atlantic chief executive, Craig Kreeger, said: \u201cLittle Red came about through an enduring passion at Virgin Atlantic to make a difference for our customers. We really wanted it to be a success and everyone involved worked extremely hard and has given it their best efforts. \u201cIt was always a huge challenge on behalf of the consumer, as the totally inadequate number of slots made available by the European commission did not deliver close to BA\u2019s network position, even when supplemented by our own slots to fly between Heathrow and Manchester. The time lag between the takeover of bmi and our entering the market also meant Little Red initially faced an uphill battle to win recognition and convert customers to its services.\u201d Virgin Atlantic \u2013 which is 51% owned by Branson, with the remainder controlled by Delta Air Lines of the US \u2013 said Little Red bookings had been rising over the course of the year. But data from the Civil Aviation Authority released in June showed that Little Red\u2019s load factor, or percentage of occupied seats, was as little as 37.6%, far adrift of competitors easyJet and BA. Little Red was operated for Virgin Atlantic by Ireland\u2019s Aer Lingus on a wet lease basis, meaning that the Dublin-based carrier supplied the crew and the aircraft, albeit in Virgin colours. Virgin Atlantic expected the venture to struggle for profitability, but hoped the increased network and connections would prove to be sufficiently valuable to make the routes worthwhile, despite the losses bmi had incurred in providing similar services. Landing in Edinburgh at the launch of Little Red, Branson lifted his kilt to reveal underpants emblazoned \u201cstiff competition\u201d. But on Monday, he conceded that it had been an unequal battle: \u201cWhen the competition authorities allowed British Airways to take over British Midland and all of its slots, we feared there was little we could do to challenge BA\u2019s huge domestic and European network built through decades of dominance. \u201cTo remedy this, we were offered a meagre package of slots with a number of constraints on how to use them and we decided to lease a few planes on a short-term basis to give it our best shot. The odds were stacked against us and sadly we just couldn\u2019t attract enough corporate business on these routes.\u201d British Airways\u2019 chief executive, Willie Walsh, recently predicted the demise of Little Red, saying he was \u201cdelighted\u201d. Last week, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s looking terrible. The fact is that they are struggling \u2013 you cannot make money flying planes that are less than half full. I said it would be a mistake and am delighted to be proven correct.\u201d The slots at Heathrow that were granted to Virgin Atlantic will revert to BA unless another carrier applies to take over the short-haul routes from Little Red. Virgin Atlantic said it remained committed to its long-haul operations in Manchester and Scotland, from where it flies seasonal routes to US holiday destinations. The short-haul carrier\u2019s demise came after a major review of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s wider network, which saw a number of destinations including Mumbai, Cape Town and Tokyo axed as it focuses on profitable transatlantic routes. Virgin Atlantic is planning a \u00a3300m investment to improve its planes and lounges over the next four years as it attempts to return firmly to the black. The airline\u2019s first Boeing 787 Dreamliner will enter into service this month. Kreeger said the airline would be back in profit by the end of 2014, after making substantial losses in recent years, totalling more than \u00a3300m from 2009-13. Virgin Atlantic stressed that passengers could continue to book with Little Red until the service ends, and it would be increasing its air-miles incentives to entice more customers aboard its half-empty planes."}, {"sentences": ["\u201cIf you drew a 40-mile circle around Manchester, there would be more people in there than in London or Tokyo."], "tags": ["The Big Ideas", "Public Leaders Network", "Transport", "Transport policy", "Manchester", "London", "HS2", "Public finance", "Local government", "Devolution", "Liberal Democrat conference"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-07T10:42:33Z", "title": "Devolution of transport is the only way to spread economic growth, MP warns", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/big-ideas/2014/oct/07/devolution-transport-spread-economic-growth", "article": "The only way the whole of the UK will thrive economically is if there is devolution of transport to all parts of the country, a senior Liberal Democrat MP warned this week. John Pugh, MP for Southport and a member of the communities and local government select committee, said that true devolution \u2013 both of funding and of decision making \u2013 was the Rubicon that the Department of Transport dared not cross. But he argued the step would have to be taken if cities across UK were to benefit from economic growth and cope with a rising population. Pugh was speaking at a Guardian fringe meeting at the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow, joined by key transport figures from around the country. There was universal agreement that London had benefited from significant investment in transport in recent years, but the UK remained unbalanced with London\u2019s sheer weight and size skewing the country\u2019s economy towards the southeast. \u201cThe key task is to see how transport development is related to the task of rebalancing the economy,\u201d Pugh said. The Liberal Democrat MP said he believed London had received a \u201cvery enviable deal\u201d in recent years and, having sat on the committee for the Crossrail project, said he was aware of how much even the legal fees for that initiative had cost the taxpayer. \u201cSmall change on the tea money from the Crossrail scheme would probably satisfy a lot of people in my neck of the woods,\u201d he said. Pugh stressed that a new high-speed rail line north of the London, High Speed 2, was not the answer to the country\u2019s transport problems; it was wrong to declare that the North\u2019s transport problems could be solved with better access to London. \u201cThe bad way of doing it is the old way of doing it, where we all go cap in hand individually to the Department of Transport and they say, what is your business case? And they look at it and say it\u2019s not nearly as good as the business case for something similar around London, and they don\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe right way to do it \u2013 and the way it has to be done \u2013 is proper devolution: proper devolution to the north as a whole, not just to Manchester. That is the Rubicon that the Department of Transport has not, so far, crossed but they must do that if they are to succeed in the task of rebalancing the economy. Yes, we need to be better funded but we need a degree of autonomy similar to what they have in Scotland and Wales.\u201d Jon Lamonte, chief executive of Transport for Greater Manchester, said devolution could make a vast difference to the north of England. \u201cIf you drew a 40-mile circle around Manchester, there would be more people in there than in London or Tokyo. The economic potential is amazing, but the transport is awful,\u201d he said. Lamonte said that the northern transport authorities had the vision, they had the financial clout and they knew where the money needed to be invested \u2013 all they need is the autonomy to make their vision happen. Two of the transport experts on the panel were more focused on the needs of London: Michele Dix, managing director of planning for Transport for London, and Stewart Wingate, chief executive of London Gatwick Airport. Yet even Wingate said that, although his primary purpose was to get a new runway for Gatwick, he believed his airport could act as a force to serve an area much bigger than London and employ people from all over the southeast. And Dix agreed that it was important to invest in cities across the country, not just London. She said she backed devolution of decision making and funding from Whitehall out, in the same way as London had benefited from being able to take transport decisions on its own. Neil Ridley, chief business development officer of the Transport Systems Catapult, stressed the need to harness new technology, to make journey times more efficient and to coordinate different forms of transport. He said all decision makers had to realise the mounting problems the country would face with limited space, an ageing population and a transport infrastructure under pressure. Ridley urged all in transport to get used to the idea of \u201cintelligent mobility\u201d, moving people and goods in the most effective way possible.

A globetrotting couple of freelance journalists, Nathan and Naomi, are forever thinking about and fiddling with their cameras, and lusting after ones they don&apos;t yet own. (&quot;The new D4, the one he didn&apos;t have, could shoot at a surreal ISO 204,800.&quot;) Not immune to such hardware fetishism myself, I was especially taken with several loving descriptions of a &quot;Swiss Nagra Kudelski SD audio recorder&quot;, and then I looked up the price, which it is not excessive to call eye-watering. These guys, I\u00a0thought, are doing pretty well for\u00a0freelancers. The protagonists&apos; acquisitive desire for the latest gadgets is, it turns out, part of the novel&apos;s pungent stew of themes punning on the book&apos;s title: consumerism, in the ordinary sense of wanting to shop, but also cannibalism, and &quot;consumption&quot; as a very odd new disease, rather than its historical meaning of tuberculosis. Aficionados of Cronenberg&apos;s cinematic work will not be surprised to find a lot of exquisitely detailed, voyeuristic body-horror: people&apos;s physical parts are\u00a0exposed, wired up, or cut off in carefully lit scenes, always being filmed or photographed by the\u00a0characters. At the centre of the plot is a French\u00a0celebrity-philosopher couple in\u00a0their sixties, Aristide and C\u00e9lestine Arosteguy. They are like a po-mo Sartre and de Beauvoir, known for seducing (and sharing) their students and writing neo-Marxian denunciations of\u00a0commodity culture.

Nathan has sex with Moln\u00e1r&apos;s doomed patient Dunja, who\u00a0says things like: &quot;While I&apos;m still alive, I&apos;ll have nothing special left to seduce with except the scent of dying. That will be my lethal perfume.&quot; She gives Nathan a dose of a sexually transmitted disease long thought extinct, so he travels to the US to meet the disease&apos;s discoverer, Dr Roiphe, whose daughter has picked up some very strange habits from a sojourn in \u2013 where else? \u2013 Paris. Roiphe wants to collaborate on a book with Nathan. It will, of course, be called Consumed. Cronenberg handles his material with the same ironic, observant affect with which the Arosteguys interpret the modern world. The novel is driven by a fascination for the interplay between technology and sex: there is\u00a0an extended episode of close-up iPhone cock photography, an artwork using 3D-printed body parts, and a set of hi-tech hearing aids specially tuned so that a man can hear the insects allegedly living inside his wife&apos;s breast. (Fans of Cronenberg&apos;s The Fly will enjoy the entomological interludes.) A\u00a0man says to a woman: &quot;Let me unbox\u00a0you&quot; \u2013 alluding to the video genre in which geeks delicately open the packaging of new gadgets. A\u00a0woman muses playfully about &quot;the\u00a0sexuality of camera apertures&quot;, deciding that &quot;stopping down the fixed\u00a035mmm lens&apos;s diaphragm \u2026 to\u00a0a\u00a0tight f/16 would be the equivalent of\u00a0executing a Kegel pelvic floor exercise&quot;. It reads somewhat like a mashup of William Gibson, the king of\u00a0near-future SF cool, and 1970s horror maestro James Herbert. The 21st century&apos;s version of the hall\u00a0of mirrors is the infinite regress of embedded recording devices. Naomi and Nathan are always stealthily recording their conversations with other characters by means of some hidden app on a MacBook Air or iPhone, when they are not overtly putting obscenely expensive Swiss voice recorders on glass coffee tables. Cronenberg&apos;s fiction is one of omnipresent multimedia surveillance and retention, though we never witness the heroes performing the subsquent grunt work of transcription and editing. Perhaps deliberately, because a major plot question becomes what one can trust of electronic recording, and what was only cleverly fabricated using Photoshop or its video\u00a0equivalents. Eventually even the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un becomes an offstage character, and everything coalesces into a pleasingly suggestive global conspiracy. But it is Cronenberg&apos;s forcefully imagined tableaux of\u00a0decadent and weirdly romantic depravity that seem to constitute the novel&apos;s raison d&apos;\u00eatre.

When the Fiver was but a young slip of a tea-time football pamphlet, it spent the best part of a summer holed up in a garden shed making \u201cfruit juice\u201d by dissolving Skittles in water and trying to purvey the resulting product to other children in the street. It proved commercially unsound, as do most ventures that end in tears, withdrawn party invites and rivers of projectile vomit, but no matter. We learned. We wouldn\u2019t have a bad idea ever again. And nor will we, from now until we retire from all this to helm up our sideline in chocolate-coated health hazards. We\u2019ll bring that bacon home, of course, much in the manner that Richard $cudamore and the Pr\u00a3mier L\u20acague intends to do through its latest good idea. The way to make a good idea is to change a bad idea very slightly, so it goes, and dropping a few ice cubes into the Skittles cordial that was Game 39 appears to have created the very palatable Kool-Aid that is \u2026 Game 38. The genius here is that Game 38 is not an extra game. Structural integrity is maintained; everyone gets their glug from the bottle. Groundbreaking stuff, you\u2019ll agree, particularly if your intelligence is not easily insulted by the merest of tweaks to a plan that was run out of town when it was first mooted. While there is a 50% chance that somebody gets their cold footballing experience in Stoke spirited somewhere south, west or east, little other good can come of a scheme that would laugh in the face of old notions of home and away, of partisanship, of having the same opportunity as your opponents to use surroundings to your advantage. Would Burnley like to play their crunch fixture with QPR at a rabid Turf Moor or to a rapt \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t they be rapt? \u2013 audience in Tokyo? Liverpool v Chelsea, that sounds tasty \u2026 but even if the nominal hosts were able to walk out in an artfully-chosen venue like, say, Boston, it\u2019s not exactly Anfield. No, whichever way you cut this, it\u2019s an egregious distortion of competition and one that, to dilute and present it as the better of two evils as one may, is fundamentally unfair. And 0.01% unfair is as bad as 100% unfair. Perhaps the executives who mull these ideas over, and the head honchos at smaller clubs who flail at the coat-tails of their entirely uncaring wealthier peers, forget that the Premier League\u2019s global appeal \u2013 while very far from illusory \u2013 has its limits. You take Crystal Palace on the road, you presuppose that your intended audience has any intention of admiring the merits of Dwight Gayle ahead of players from the Big Four/Five/OK, Six. But pitch two of the top teams against one another in the name of global gluttony and what should be some high-stakes poker becomes horribly skewed. The genie is out though and the answer, of course, is to take the Community Shield \u2013 which clearly means enough given the vigour with which Arsenal fans celebrated their win in August \u2013 on the road each year, perhaps adding to it with another Big Cup contender or two if need be and creating some kind of pre-season Super Cup of distilled superstardom. Hang on \u2026 If it doesn\u2019t have the Premier League\u2019s competitive edge, that is because much of that edge lies in the very environment the league is contested in. Remove the \u201cproduct\u201d from that environment, and who can guarantee anything? That, in the end, is just the way it is. So if that is progress, then the Fiver is out. But maybe you shouldn\u2019t listen to us too closely. If we could just add a few M&amp;Ms to this potion, perhaps the other children would start playing with us again after all.

Its major innovation is the incorporation of a pair of \u201comniwheels\u201d at the front, which consist of normal wheels surrounded by 24 separate tyres that can rotate perpendicularly to the direction of travel. They give the chair an incredibly tight turning radius for indoor use (71cm to be precise), while four-wheel drive allows the chair to travel with ease across rough terrain, from snow and grass to sand and gravel. It is controlled by a unique mouse-like device on the arm, while the level of acceleration and steering responsiveness can be adjusted on an accompanying smartphone app. In sum, it has all the futuristic styling and precision controls that Professor X could ever dream of.

Photograph: Mountain Trike    The Bear Grylls of the wheelchair world, the Mountain Trike has already been used to scale Snowdon and Ben Nevis, and been taken on safari across Africa. Designed by Tim Morgan while in his final year of design engineering at the University of Bath, the chair is intended to be the equivalent of a mountain bike for wheelchair users. Developed in partnership with injured soldiers at the British Army Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court in Surrey, it features pump-action levers that amplify arm power and prevent muddy hands, while also allowing single-handed steering. A single wheel at the back provides stability when travelling uphill, removing the fear of tipping over, while a pair of anti-tip wheels at the front provide the same reassurance when going downhill. Independent suspension on each wheel gives a smooth and comfortable ride when dropping off curbs or riding over cobbles, cracked pavements and tree roots; it also means you can turn or travel across slopes with confidence.

Image: Andrew Mitchell    The brainchild of industrial designer Andrew Mitchell, this stealthy arrow of a wheelchair is based on the low-slung, aerodynamic form of a racing chair, but it has been cleverly optimised for long-distance use. Employing technology developed for racing bike frames, its streamlined two-part chassis is made from a thin carbon fibre shell over an expanded foam core, the two arms pivoted with adjustable suspension to suit the road surface. The rider sits in an adjustable hammock, suspended from the frame, while the seating position has been designed to keep the shoulders over the front edge of the driving wheels, in order to engage the whole body and provide maximum power. If it looks too good to be true then, well, that\u2019s because it is \u2013 sadly it\u2019s just a concept design, with no plans for manufacture. Chair 4 Life     The chair that grows. Photograph: Chair 4 Life    Developed by design consultancy the Renfrew Group, for the NHS National Innovation Centre, the Chair 4 Life is the wheelchair that grows with you. Designed to be easily adaptable for growing children, it consists of a standard chassis that can be adapted with a catalogue of attachments and bespoke components. It incorporates a vertical lift to allow kids to see eye-to-eye with their peers, while an automatically adjustable wheelbase allows the user to adapt the chair to suit indoor or outdoor conditions. A wider, longer track provides stability when it is needed and compactness for manoeuvrability in smaller spaces, enabling greater freedom and independence. \u201cSee the child, not the chair\u201d was the motivating idea behind the design \u2013 although the lurid colour scheme and chunky styling means it\u2019s quite obvious, like some intriguing mutant insect. The Department of Health is currently reviewing the design for possible procurement. Tankchair     The Tankchair has all-terrain caterpillar tracks. Photograph: Tankchair    What happens when a combat veteran turns his hand to designing a wheelchair? The answer can be found in the form of the Tankchair, the most heavy-duty mobility aid of them all. It was invented by ex-army Arizonan Brad Soden for his wife, Liz, after she broke her back in a truck accident. The inspiration for the design came from his father-in-law, who turned up as Soden was taking apart a conventional wheelchair in his garage one day and said: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool if you could put tracks on that like a tank?\u201d The result is a hefty steel chassis supported by two gigantic caterpillar tracks, \u201ccapable of conquering sand, snow, gravel, rocks and mud\u201d with their 12-inch wide rubber treads, and able to climb a gradient as steep as 10%. Soden has since produced a souped-up Speedster version, and is working on the Mongo, the mother of all power-chairs, which is capable of towing an 800kg trailer.

The robotic cat from the future has attracted legions of fans at home in Japan and other countries \u2013 including China \u2013 with his teleportation powers, addiction to sweet bean pancakes and array of ingenious gadgets he uses to help his hapless schoolboy friend, Nobita. But a Chinese newspaper has accused the character of political subversion, claiming that his presence at a recent exhibition in the southern Chinese city of Chengdu was part of a plot to portray Japan in a kinder light as the two east Asian rivals vie over wartime history and territories in the East China Sea. \u201cDoraemon is a part of Japan\u2019s efforts of exporting its national values and achieving its cultural strategy; this is an undisputed fact,\u201d the local communist party newspaper Chengdu Daily said in an editorial. \u201cTaking this to heart, we should be less blind and keep a cool head while kissing the cheeks of the chubby blue guy.\u201d Two other Chengdu-based newspapers repeated the claim, while Global Times columnist Wang Dehua warned: \u201cDoraemon is cute but he also represents Japan\u2019s soft power. We must never let a little robotic cat take control of our minds.\u201d Doraemon, the star of a vast catalogue of manga and animated films, and the face behind a hugely successful merchandising empire, certainly has cultural clout. The manga, created by Fujiko F Fujio, has sold over 100m copies, making it one of the best-selling in the world, while the TV series has won over audiences in more than 30 countries. Earlier this year, Disney said it had acquired the English-language rights to broadcast the series on its satellite channel. In 2002, Time magazine named Doraemon one of its Asian heroes. In 2008, the Japanese government appointed Doraemon as an \u201cambassador\u201d with special responsibility for promoting Japanese culture overseas. He was sworn in at a ceremony in Tokyo attended by the then foreign minister, Masahiko K\u014dmura. The cat has been given a similar role in the runup to the 2020 summer Olympics in Tokyo. The Chinese claims prompted a largely good-natured response from Japan\u2019s online community. According to English translations on the Japan Crush website, one netizen joked on 2ch.net: \u201cDamn, we got found out already, huh?\u201d Another said: \u201cYeah, see, if you expand Doraemon\u2019s nose it becomes the Japanese flag. The Chinese Communist party is pretty sharp.\u201d One of the Chengdu editorials said the recent Doraemon exhibition, which has also been held in several other Chinese cities, represented a form of Japanese \u201ccultural intervention\u201d and an \u201cattempt to weaken the Chinese people\u2019s firm stance on historical issues\u201d. Other commentators in China were more forgiving. Writing in the Global Times , Liu Zhun, accused those who saw a malign influence on Chinese youth of \u201coverreacting\u201d. \u201cChinese culture needs to go global, but the first step is to tune up its mind and embrace the influence of other cultures,\u201d Liu wrote. \u201cDoraemon cannot find an exact prototype from traditional Japanese culture, but it can still serve as a representative of Japanese culture. China should think about it.\u201d Many Chinese who grew up watching the cartoon refused to believe his portrayal as a deceptively cuddly counter-revolutionary, although there was criticism of the timing of the exhibition, which opened on 16 August, a day after the 69th anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender in the second world war. \u201cThe exhibition, even though it was a commercial one, should have been more sensible with its timing, especially since Japanese rightist politicians headed by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe persist with words and actions that strain Japan\u2019s ties with its Asian neighbours,\u201d Zhu Ping wrote in the China Daily. \u201cYet it goes too far to politicise the exhibition by linking the robotic cat with Japan\u2019s worrying politics.\u201d While Chinese netizens divided into pro- and anti-Doraemon camps, Japanese citizens continued to demonstrate their devotion to one of their most successful cultural exports. Last month a museum dedicated to Doraemon welcomed its 1.5-millionth visitor since opening three years ago. Strained relations between China and Japan may be about to make a small, but highly symbolic breakthrough amid reports that arrangements are being made for Abe and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to meet for the first time, on the sidelines of next month\u2019s Apec summit in Beijing."}, {"sentences": ["Naturally, Arthur found that a toot or two of \u201cTokyo\u201d (cocaine) was a good way of dulling the demons squalling through his brain.", "\u2022 Interesting that there\u2019s apparently no problem with young Finn\u2019s use of \u201cTokyo\u201d but any sniff of a whiskey and he\u2019s in trouble."], "tags": ["Peaky Blinders", "Drama", "Crime drama", "Television & radio", "Period drama", "Cillian Murphy", "Television", "Culture", "Episode recaps"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-09T21:00:12Z", "title": "Peaky Blinders recap: series two, episode two \u2013 it's not easy being Tommy Shelby", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/oct/09/peaky-blinders-recap-series-two-episode-two-tommy-shelby", "article": "Let no one say that it\u2019s easy being Tommy Shelby. This week alone our man in the long black coat was shouted at, threatened, prodded with a wolf-handled silver cane, forced to treat his (considerable) injuries with horse oil and a long trip on a slow barge, dealt with guns being waved in his face twice, listened to a convoluted story about a cabinet, put up with numerous insults about his origins, tried a bit of shock therapy on his older brother, attempted a little light intimidation, faced down his demons in the form of a surprise letter from upstate New York and still found time to spend the morning after the raucous night before trying to balance the books. Major Campbell might be correct in his assessment of our Tommy as \u201ca murdering, cutthroat, mongrel gangster\u201d but, as Winston Churchill, the devious, determined product of an American mother and an English father, was surely itching to add: at least he\u2019s diligent. Our heroes     Polly (Helen McCrory) learned the truth about her children. Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Mandabach/Tiger Aspect/Robert Viglasky    Despite all the action, and a narrative that swung between Birmingham and London, this was a less frenetic episode than last week, with the emotional focus shifting to Polly and Arthur\u2019s ongoing woes. Both Helen McCrory and Paul Anderson were on fine form as Pol learned the truth about her children and Arthur continued to struggle with war trauma and battle rage. Yes, there were times when it came across as little more than a glorified soap opera, but part of the enjoyment of this show is the way Steven Knight ramps every scene up to 10 as though asking the audience: \u201cCan you believe we just did that?\u201d Thus, of course, a thwarted Polly fired her gun at the ceiling in impotent rage before heading out on a bender of epic proportions, culminating in some very sorrowful sex. Naturally, Arthur found that a toot or two of \u201cTokyo\u201d (cocaine) was a good way of dulling the demons squalling through his brain. And, yes, there were times during the Garrison\u2019s grand reopening when you couldn\u2019t help thinking that it was twinned through time with the good old Queen Vic. But no one watches Peaky Blinders for its authenticity \u2013 we\u2019re here for the glorious, gaudy trip, and this week there were just enough hints to suggest it\u2019s only going to get wilder from here on in.              The bad guys Enter Tom Hardy sporting a north London accent that came unnervingly close to Toby Kebbell\u2019s turn as Johnny Quid in Guy Ritchie\u2019s RocknRolla, a film that coincidentally saw a younger Hardy playing the (aptly named) Handsome Bob. Ritchie\u2019s films are often used as a stick with which to beat Knight and the scene between Hardy\u2019s Alfie Solomons and Tommy certainly shared a similar love of baroque dialogue and flamboyant swearing (the moment when Noah Taylor\u2019s Sabini operatically lost it with his paid policeman would also not have been out of place in a Ritchie opus). How you feel about this will depend on your tolerance for cockernee gangsters and the use of rambling metaphor as a method of getting your point across. Personally, I enjoyed the meeting between Solomons and Shelby for two reasons: the nose bleed that suggested that for all Tommy\u2019s hard-won fa\u00e7ade, he\u2019s not entirely impervious to threats, and the hints that Alfie would be wrong to underestimate Tommy as nothing more than a track rat who got lucky.  Additional notes \u2022 So Grace has married a rich banker and is living in Poughkeepsie. No word on whether she\u2019s picking her feet there but I have nothing but admiration for Tommy\u2019s ability to burn her letter unopened. I would have cracked and read it the instant I was alone. \u2022 Top marks to the poster who suggested last week that the Ada plotline would see her returning to the fold. Property might be theft (or, in Tommy\u2019s case, the proceeds of theft) but our Ada seemed rather taken with a place of her own. Who knows, maybe Karl Marx might even have agreed. \u2022 It transpires that in Esme\u2019s case, \u2018\u201dit\u2019s a matter of honour\u201d actually means \u201cit\u2019s a matter that I will tell to your nephew the minute he returns\u201d. Polly seemed surprisingly unbothered by that, presumably because Tommy was promising to help her uncover the truth. I still wouldn\u2019t be engineering any one-on-one chats with her if I were Esme \u2026 \u2022 I laughed out loud at Tommy\u2019s (temporary) stalemating of Campbell\u2019s plot. I love the way he\u2019s utterly shameless about using his war record and enjoyed the parallels between him and Churchill \u2013 I suspect that while Tommy can run rings round the good Major, he might find Winston more problematic. \u2022 Talking of which I am developing a theory about the proposed assassination: I think Churchill and Campbell are going to ask Tommy to assassinate Sir Henry Wilson. Wilson was a British army field marshal turned MP and security advisor to the Northern Ireland government who was assassinated in June 1922. Two IRA men were subsequently arrested but no one has ever taken official responsibility for the shooting, which has been attributed to various Irish leaders including Michael Collins, himself assassinated two months later. It\u2019s not implausible to see a plotline suggesting probable British government involvement. Drinks on me in the newly golden Garrison if I\u2019m right. \u2022 Interesting that there\u2019s apparently no problem with young Finn\u2019s use of \u201cTokyo\u201d but any sniff of a whiskey and he\u2019s in trouble. Going by Alfie Solomons\u2019 first law of drinking, are we to presume this is because he\u2019s too young to do business? \u2022 In addition to coveting her bedroom and most of her clothes, I\u2019m also interested in Polly\u2019s two names \u2013 why was she once known as Elizabeth Gray? \u2022 Somewhere in his lonely room, beside his barren bedside table, next to his much-thumbed copy of the Bible, Major Campbell keeps a big book of threatening cliches, and adds to it every week. Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week Arctic Monkeys\u2019 If You Were There Beware \u2013 as rueful Garrison regulars might say: \u201cWell, quite.\u201d  Quote of the week \u201cI\u2019m not family. I\u2019m saying nothing\u201d \u2013 smart boy, Isaiah. That would be my policy regarding all things Shelby-related as well. So what did you think? Can Tommy possibly keep all sides happy? Will Polly speak to him now her son has returned to the fold? And did he really tell her that Anna died of spring fever? Because I find that unlikely to say the least ...

It showed how the fall of the Socialist regime in Hungary in the 1980s had brought with it a lack of funding for public infrastructure and a weak third sector. In 1996, the Hungarian personal income tax scheme was introduced, which aimed at providing funding for non-profit organisations and promote co-operation between the voluntary sector and the community. The mayor decided to adapt it to meet the needs of Ichikawa \u2013 which was how the 1% support scheme came into being. It gives local citizens the right to vote on the allocation of 1% of local taxes to charities of their choice. During his period in office, Chiba actively promoted a robust civic society and sought out opportunities to strengthen the local community, particularly through partnerships with non-profit organisations. In 1999, he created a concept referred to in Japanese as\u00a0kyo-do\u00a0(literally, \u201cwork done in co-operation\u201d). However, kyo-do requires a financially stable non-profit sector, something which Ichikawa could only partly help to secure, as it was itself experiencing financial difficulties and had limited powers to switch funding to non-profit organisations. The 1% scheme offered a clever solution to this dilemma. 1% of local taxes is allocated to charities chosen by citizens. In turn, this means these charities can provide important services which the city council could not otherwise fund. Moreover, funding these services through non-profit organisations means priority is given to improving the welfare of groups at risk of being marginalised and isolated. Two main groups of citizens can vote in the scheme \u2013 resident taxpayers and local people who are active in non-profit organisations. These voters can choose up to three local non-profit organisations to become potential recipients of their 1% tax donation. In 2013, 15m yen (\u00a384,000) was shared among 117 non-profit organisations, including those supporting elderly and disabled people, environmental, sports and culture organisations, as well as a kids\u2019 cultural station working with parents to help make Ichikawa a more child-friendly city. Applications for funding are lodged in the first months of the year and scrutinised by an assessment committee consisting of four academic experts and three members of the public with experience of volunteering with non-profit organisations. Qualifying charities must meet certain criteria, such as having an active office in the city and not taking part in any political or religious activities. The funding they receive is subject to a limit of 50% of their operating costs. A shortlist of qualifying organisations is published in June and the public can vote for their preferred candidates. Between 2005 and 2013, public participation in the scheme increased significantly along with the number of non-profit organisations involved, enabling the voluntary sector to provide a wider range of services and support to local citizens. Other local authorities, including the cities of Oita and Ichinomiya, and Aichi county, have taken inspiration from the Ichikawa 1% scheme and adopted a similar approach.

His alienation is a\u00a0kind of pathology. Or maybe a congenital disease. Loneliness inheres in his\u00a0hobbies, his love affairs, his every exchange. Even social media, that great banisher of loneliness, just makes matters worse. He was born to no grand tradition, no\u00a0family custom beyond a baseball game. His inheritance was poverty and suicide. He escaped the first; the second still beckons. He looks envyingly at people who belong, by birth, to religions that he scorns intellectually. God? He won&apos;t have anything to do with God. But God&apos;s people are another story. He longs to commune with them, to indulge in their rituals and share in their reassurances. He just can&apos;t have any respect for them because they believe in God. What to do with a guy like this \u2013 a guy with a grudge against the universe, a guy who never makes anything easy? My answer was to have his identity stolen.     Joshua Ferris Photograph: Elisabetta A Villa/Getty Images    As I see it, there are two sources of fear on the internet. The first is that someone steals your identity and empties your bank account. You spend years trying to settle the matter, your credit in ruins and your name on no-fly lists. Then there&apos;s a far more pervasive fear: that everyone else on the internet is\u00a0having a better time than you are. The fear of missing out. The relentless reminder of your lack of sparkle and daring. Or, put a slightly different way: &quot;Why won&apos;t somebody more interesting come along and steal my identity?&quot; O&apos;Rourke refuses to have anything to do with the internet \u2013 until somebody makes a website for his dental practice. A\u00a0Facebook page appears in his name. Then a Twitter account. He&apos;s mad as blazes. Who&apos;s doing this to him? What\u00a0right do they have? What is their objective? He goes down a wormhole. Never before has anyone become more obsessed with the internet than this self-professed luddite. Then the real terror sinks in. The possibility that the man impersonating him might be living a better life than he is. It\u00a0occurs to him to say, I want to be that version of me. That version is connected. That version enjoys community and a\u00a0brotherhood. He&apos;s a man with a secret inheritance. An ancient religion so suppressed by the antagonistic forces of\u00a0history that it&apos;s invisible, even on the internet. O&apos;Rourke learns that he might belong to this strange tradition. But it&apos;s not clear that he can make such a leap of\u00a0faith. He&apos;s never done it before \u2013 unless you count his lifelong support for the losing Boston Red Sox. Take away the group, the community, the elected or inherited connection, and we are just human vectors pointed at death. But gather the comprehending and the likeminded together, and for an hour or two, the worst existential fears retreat into the shadows. In the end, that&apos;s\u00a0what O&apos;Rourke wants. It&apos;s not a lot to ask for. And yet\u00a0it&apos;s everything.\u2022 Q&amp;A: Joshua Ferris answers your questions Richard Flanagan     Richard Flanagan. Photograph: Ulf Andersen/Chatto & Windus/PA    The Narrow Road to the Deep North is one of the most famous books of all Japanese literature, written by the great\u00a0poet Basho in 1689. My father was a Japanese prisoner of war, a survivor of\u00a0the Thai-Burma Death Railway, built by\u00a0a quarter of a million slave labourers in 1943. Between 100,000 and 200,000 died. More than died at Hiroshima. More\u00a0corpses than there are words in my\u00a0novel. If The Narrow Road to the Deep North is one of the high points of Japanese culture, the Death Railway is one of its lowest. For 12 years I tried to write a novel about these things, increasingly feeling that if I couldn&apos;t write it, I would\u00a0never write another novel. And for 12 years I failed. Then I realised my father, now in his 90s, was growing frail. Though it made no sense, I felt I had to somehow finish this novel before he died, or I never would. The novel, I came to see, had to be a love story. Love stories seek to demonstrate the great truth of love: that we discover eternity in a moment that dies immediately after. War stories deal in death. War illuminates love; while love\u00a0is the greatest expression of hope, without which any story rings untrue to life. And to deny hope in a story about such darkness is to create false art. It is not eschewing sentimentality. It is to lie. I went to Japan. There I searched and found several guards who had worked on the Death Railway. Five minutes before meeting with one guard I realised he was the man who had been the Ivan the Terrible of my father&apos;s camp, the man the Australians called the Lizard. Sentenced to death for war crimes after the war, the Lizard later had his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment, and then was released in a general amnesty in 1956. He is the only man I\u00a0ever heard my father \u2013 a gentle, peaceful man \u2013 talk of with\u00a0violent intent. The meeting was in the offices of a taxi company in suburban Tokyo. Lee Hak Rae, as he is now, was a gracious old man. Near the end of our meeting, I asked him to slap me. Violent face slapping \u2013 known as binta \u2013 was the immediate form of punishment in the camps, doled out frequently and viciously. On the third blow, the taxi office began to shake and toss violently, like a dinghy in a wild sea. In one of those coincidences in which reality delights but fiction, for fear of being unrealistic, never permits, a 7.3 Richter scale earthquake had hit Tokyo. For half a minute I\u00a0saw the Lizard frightened. I saw too that wherever evil is, it\u00a0wasn&apos;t in that shuddering room with that old man and me. Within hours of returning home, my father rang. He wanted to know what had happened. He was 98, but his mind was still good, his recall phenomenal. I told him I had met with some guards who had been at his camps, including the Lizard. I said how each one had expressed sorrow and asked me to pass on their apologies to my father. Later that day, my father lost all memory of his time as a\u00a0PoW. And yet his prewar memory remained strong. It was, my sister said, as though he were finally free. For the next half year I lived alone on an island off Tasmania. I rewrote the novel. I felt I had written all my books in order to write this one book. My father grew ill. One morning as I sat at his bedside he asked how the novel was going. I told him I had emailed it to the publisher before coming to see him. It was finished. That night my father died. I dedicated my book &apos;To prisoner san byaku san ju\u0304 go&apos;. It was my father&apos;s Japanese prison number, 335. He had taught it to me as I was growing up as his son, a child of the narrow road to the deep north. \u2022 Q&amp;A: Richard Flanagan answers your questions Karen Joy Fowler     Karen Joy Fowler. Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images    I&apos;m old enough to remember when man was the tool-using animal. Now a brisk stroll through YouTube will take you past a great many animals using tools. Chimps have a theory of mind. Scrub jays evidence episodic memory. Elephants mourn the dead. So far, every time we&apos;ve determined the crucial difference between humans and other animals, we&apos;ve turned out to be wrong again. As children we&apos;re strongly encouraged to identify with the other animals. We are taught to bark like dogs, quack like ducks around the same time we are learning the words for mummy and daddy. Our cots are full of cuddly predators. Our books are full of animals who wear clothes, have tender feelings, and hope not to be eaten. Our plates are full of chicken, lamb and cow. It is very confusing. For me, perhaps even more confusing than the usual. My father was a psychologist at Indiana University, who studied learning by training rats to run through mazes. We had rats at home, treated as pets; rats in the lab, treated as research subjects; and occasional wild rats, treated as vermin. I learned early the lesson that where you are born is a key data point, arguably the key data point, in how your life will go. The idea for this book was a gift from my daughter. For the millennial New Year, she and her boyfriend took me to visit my childhood home in Indiana. My husband had to stay behind in California. He worked at the Sacramento energy company (SMUD) and had to be at his post at midnight in case the world ended. Y2K. You remember. So while he was there, keeping us safe, we were off in Indianapolis, celebrating Hoosier-style \u2013 a Pacers game, a\u00a0John Mellencamp concert, dancing until dawn at the Slippery Noodle blues club. The next day we drove to Bloomington. My father died two years before my daughter was born, so he&apos;s always been a mythical figure to her. I took her to the university campus to show her where his office had been, and to the old rat lab, now something else entirely. Afterwards I told her about an experiment once done by a different Indiana University psychologist, and she told me I should I write my next book based on that experiment. I don&apos;t have good ideas myself, but I know them when I\u00a0hear them. I worked on We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves on and off for the next 10 years. But I could also say that the book started much longer ago than that. I began arguing with my father over the question of whether animals could think when I was about six years old. His conclusions were based on a career of cautious, scientifically collected, peer-reviewed data. Mine were based on six years of personal observations of the family dogs, cats, birds, hamsters, turtles, snakes and rats. You might have thought I&apos;d have shown some humility at some point, bowed to his greater expertise. But that just shows how little you know me. In many ways, this book represents my latest salvo in that long-running argument. It is my attempt to work through what it means to be a human animal. I conceived of it as a book about language \u2013 who talks and who doesn&apos;t, who is heard and who isn&apos;t, what can be said and by whom, and what can&apos;t be. As I wrote, it became a book about memory and also about family in both the small and the largest possible sense of that word.\u2022 Q&amp;A: Karen Joy Fowler answers your questions Howard Jacobson     Howard Jacobson. Photograph: Richard Saker for the Guardian    To say that J is a love story isn&apos;t to say very much. Most novels are, in one way or\u00a0another, the affection a writer feels for his characters \u2013 even the least attractive \u2013 being the greatest love story of them all. Love can seem to matter in novels even more than in life, the necessary compression of fictional time, where we see ends almost before we see beginnings, making love especially precarious. But over and above their being important to\u00a0each other, the lovers in this novel \u2013 Ailinn and Kevern \u2013 matter because they are repositories for eager curiosity, tenderness and memory in a society that no longer practises gentleness or curiosity, or values remembering, and because they bear a burden, largely unknown to themselves, which might be redemptive, or might be the opposite. Something has happened before J starts, and what that something is I can best describe as an annihilation of a people and an idea. Who the people are and how and why the annihilation of them took place \u2013 an atrocity officially and popularly denied \u2013 is the story the novel tells over its 300 pages. But the idea that&apos;s annihilated is spelled out on page one. It is that you must not devour everything in sight, that you must never act so ruthlessly against those whose existence challenges you that the only thing left to sink your teeth into is yourself. &quot;Naught&apos;s had, all&apos;s Spent,&quot; laments Lady Macbeth, in the desolation that succeeds the bloody accomplishment of Duncan&apos;s murder. &quot;&apos;Tis safer to be that which we destroy/ Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy&quot;. There is a communal equivalent of this moral vacuum. It is the lesson of Cambodia and Rwanda and Bosnia, as it was the lesson of Nazi Germany \u2013 and the Jewish genocide reverberates fearfully throughout J \u2013 that when a society bonds in destruction, its own loss, never mind that of the victim people, is immeasurable. This can be understood practically, as a loss of the contributions previously made by the victims, and morally, as\u00a0a loss of probity and even sanity. But it is no less a philosophical loss \u2013 an abandonment of the idea that difference is\u00a0necessary, that we lose definition once those we have long defined ourselves against are gone, that argument is necessary to the spiritual and intellectual wellbeing of any society. J is set in such a world of forgetting and loss. Here, an anodyne conformity reigns, wiping out whatever is quick and unsuspected \u2013 jazz, wit, improvisation \u2013 and breeding a dull violence below the surface of domestic life. Quite what constitutes comedy as opposed to tragedy is a vexatious question, but if this novel is different in tone from anything I&apos;ve written before, that is because the qualities that might roughly be said to have defined my voice in the past \u2013 disputatiousness and irony, a love of the sardonic, the ambivalent and the contradictory \u2013 are precisely what are missing from the world of J. It was either satirise it or enter it, and in order to enter it I needed a more fraught and hazardous voice altogether. This doesn&apos;t mean there is no comedy in J but it is comedy suffused with the dark invigoration of dread. J is not a novel of prophecy or warning. Though a novel of the future, it is no less a novel of the past and present. The things that happen have happened before, and whether or not\u00a0they will happen again is not the issue since they are, in a\u00a0sense, still happening \u2013 in that we remain marked by them, troubled by memories that are not always our own, assuming guilt and trying to get rid of it all at once, still denying, disowning and repeating, still seeking simplicity and conviction, though it was simplicity and conviction that did\u00a0for us the last time.\u2022 Q&amp;A: Howard Jacobson answers your questions Neel Mukherjee     Neel Mukherjee. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    It began, of course, with questions, the first of which must be the most fundamental one in any theoretical thinking about form: what social work does the novel do? Others, concatenated, followed. Does the politics of the realist novel, seen lucidly in the origins of the form, and in its heydays in the 19th century and the early 20th, still obtain nearly a century after modernism? What has happened to\u00a0the political novel in the Anglo-American world? (By &quot;political&quot;, I mean &quot;the way we live in the world&quot;, in the way\u00a0a pioneering generation of feminists viewed the personal as the political; what other kind of personal is there?) To be an Indian writer is to write, necessarily and inevitably, about politics, so it was a given that the story of the Ghoshes, the family at the centre of The\u00a0Lives of Others, should have a political soul. Work defines our lives and our place in the world. I\u00a0wanted to depict this base, the triangulation of labour, capital and output/income, if you will, over which the structures of our lives, as individuals, families and social classes, are constructed. The book cuts through several such classes, or worlds, at a given point in Indian history, the late 1960s \u2013 a time of immense political ferment, of unrest and idealism, of hope for change and the end of that hope. The Ghoshes&apos; well-heeled lives rest on the foundation of their ownership of paper-manufacturing factories; the lives of landlords in the Bengal countryside on ownership of arable land in which rice is cultivated; the lives of rice-farmers and\u00a0labourers on selling their labour. The Lives of Others concentrates on the disequilibria and contradictions inherent in these worlds, but I wanted to take it one step further: what would happen if these worlds were all to collide? History offered a ready-made template for this collision. One strand of the Naxalite movement of the late 1960s, a Maoist revolution that attempted to end India&apos;s appalling inequalities and iniquities by &quot;armed struggle&quot;, involved the\u00a0participation of members of the &quot;urban intelligentsia&apos;, city-bred, university-attending women and men who spread out to the countryside \u2013 they also did a fair amount of city &quot;activism&quot; \u2013 to help bring about the change they desired. In the novel, Supratik is the perfect amphibian: he is a scion of the Ghosh family, the eldest grandson of the patriarch and matriarch, but also a Naxalite revolutionary who wants to change the world. Let&apos;s return to the politics of the realist novel. What should the novel do: be a mirror to the reader&apos;s world, reflecting it back at her, or be a clear pane of glass, not reflecting but offering something away from the self, a vista of a bigger, wider, different world outside? The moral energy of the novel form derives from its capacity to imagine the lives of others. This empathy can be seen as the beginning of\u00a0the moral sense. I wanted to explore the limits of this in The Lives of Others. By conceiving a densely imagined world &quot;with that distinctness&quot;, as George Eliot says, &quot;which is no longer reflection but feeling \u2013 an idea wrought back to the directness of sense, like the solidity of objects&quot;, and by constantly shifting points of view across a large cast of characters, could the novel have its moral imperative returned to it? Now that we have been bludgeoned into quiescence in these late-capitalist times by that most amoral of all entities, the free-market, that imperative seems more urgent, more political than ever.Booker shortlist webchats:\u2022 Q&amp;A: Neel Mukherjee answers your questions Ali Smith     Ali Smith. Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos for the Guardian    How to Be Both started with the structure of painting and the\u00a0notion of time and the notion, too, of the time we take (or don&apos;t take) to use our eyes. I tend to think all the arts are related and that the most exciting things happen, to them and us, when they cross borders into the other arts. I&apos;d been reading about frescoes and fresco restoration. The structure of fresco is intriguing; it has to\u00a0be light on its feet, done unbelievably fast, completed before the wet plaster dries, yet is so long-lasting, stays fresh-looking and still full of its same quickness, life and colour hundreds of years later. Frescoes become a physical part of the walls they&apos;re on \u2013 actually part of the plaster, as much a part of the wall as our skins are a part of us. The restorers, who invented ingenious ways of peeling the frescoes off the walls to mend or save them from the elements over the centuries, invariably found that they had structural underdrawings, the original sketches or figurings underneath the finished work, called sinopie, after the rust-coloured sticks the artists used to sketch their plans or drafts. Sometimes these uncovered sinopie resemble, sometimes they&apos;re a little different from, and occasionally they&apos;re completely other than, what we&apos;ve been looking at for all the\u00a0centuries on the surface. So you look at the wall, you see one thing, but something else is behind it, right in front of you, there but invisible. It&apos;s a perfect narrative structure. I&apos;d also been fascinated by something Jos\u00e9 Saramago, the\u00a0great Portuguese novelist, says in one of his novels, The Stone Raft, about narrative and simultaneity. In it he laments the fact that several things can happen at exactly the same time in life but that in narrative you can&apos;t do simultaneity \u2013 one thing has to follow another. This makes him comically frustrated, furious and funny. Opera singers can do it, he says. Why can&apos;t writers? I was in my publisher&apos;s office doing a recording for my last\u00a0book, and as we finished I asked Simon, my editor, whether it&apos;d be technically possible to publish a book in which two halves could be reversed, so that one book could simultaneously be two: one part of the story could, quite randomly, in one version come first, and in the other version come second. I&apos;d been thinking it would be at least gestural to that idea of the simultaneity of layers, both of story and time. I don&apos;t see why not, he said. I&apos;ll find out. Two other people were there listening to our recording, one young, one\u00a0more my age, and they both lit up at the idea. The man\u00a0who was recording our podcast in the other room was listening through the wall; he said the word &quot;palimpsest&quot; (I\u00a0remember it, in my earphone). A couple of days later Simon emailed me. &quot;It&apos;s possible,&quot; he said. I began to think about surface and underwork, about how all stories travel with at least one understory, and to wonder about this in relation to notions of time, sequence and consequence (I think the novel form is always about time), as well as about the act of looking, of representation across time. I had no idea what book would come of it. I knew it would be about then, now, and notions of observation over the centuries; right now in the western world we&apos;re living in a time where visuals and screens dictate almost everything. Then one day I chanced on a picture in a magazine by a 15th-century artist I&apos;d never heard of, and it was so striking it\u00a0stopped me in my tracks. Francesco del Cossa. Who? When I did a bit of searching to find out about this artist, what I discovered was: how little was known and how resonant that little was; and that I had stumbled on a story about art and worth, one that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.\u2022 Q&amp;A: Ali Smith answers your questions"}, {"sentences": ["One analyst said: \u201cThey are aggressively managing the business for profitability rather than grand developments...

Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic airline had, he said, made a bad mistake launching a domestic service from Heathrow. \u201cIt\u2019s looking terrible. The fact is they are struggling \u2013 you can\u2019t make money flying planes that are less than half full. I said it would be a mistake \u2013 and am delighted to be proven correct.\u201d A few days later, last Monday, those words proved prophetic as Branson announced that he was grounding the Little Red carrier permanently. So that\u2019s a point to BA and its parent company, International Airlines Group, in a long-running corporate rivalry that has seen both sides notch up notable victories. The bad blood goes back to the 1980s, to the early years of Virgin Atlantic, and peaked with \u201cdirty tricks\u201d claims that eventually saw BA pay damages of more than \u00a3600,000 to Branson and Virgin Atlantic in 1993. From the beginning, the entrepreneur positioned his airline as the challenger upstart to the might of BA. Echoes of this persist in the latest chapter with the Little Red closure. The mini-airline, which started flights from Heathrow to Manchester and Scotland only last year, owed its existence to the same gambit that gained Virgin its first foothold in the UK\u2019s main hub back in 1991. Competition authorities then, as 22 years later, concurred with Branson\u2019s lawyers\u2019 view that BA had too much market power at Heathrow, and forced the flag carrier to give up prized slots to its competitor. But whereas Virgin Atlantic went on from that point to become an established long-haul competitor, Little Red struggled in a short-haul market dominated by BA at Heathrow, and easyJet and Ryanair elsewhere. Little wonder that Walsh, who had accurately forecast Little Red\u2019s financial trouble, expressed glee at its demise. But Virgin argued that the competition authorities had granted it a totally inadequate number of slots at Heathrow. The odds, Branson said, \u201cwere stacked against us\u201d. With the demise of Little Red, the Heathrow slots will revert to BA \u2013 unless another contender wishes to give it a go. So the local skirmish is over, but the real battle continues elsewhere. Virgin Atlantic\u2019s defeat in its attempt to compete domestically with BA may have wounded its pride, but the cold logic for Little Red was not to unite the peoples of south and north Britain, but to bring the corporate travellers of Scotland and Manchester on to the Virgin international network. That network is now pointed firmly towards the US, ever since Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines bought 49% of Virgin Atlantic at the end of 2012. The hope is that the Delta will restore Virgin to fighting weight in the industry\u2019s most lucrative swath of sky \u2013 above the Atlantic between Heathrow and the US. This is a significant month for Virgin Atlantic and BA: both are rolling out new planes on US routes: Branson\u2019s first Dreamliner will start a regular service to Boston; and BA\u2019s A380 will begin flying to Washington. Last week BA marked four years of collaboration across the Atlantic with American Airlines in a joint venture that now generates revenues of almost $10bn a year. It was approved by competition authorities in 2010, despite bitter opposition from Virgin Atlantic. The subsequent merger of US Airways and American has further fattened the BA/AA joint business: the number of routes has grown from 50 to 88, and combined revenues are up by 50%. The deal allows the two airlines to co-ordinate slots \u2013 a practice Virgin had argued would be bad for consumers. Walsh counters that customers have benefited, particularly from a wider route network and more frequent flights \u2013 the airlines now provide 17 flights a day between New York and Heathrow \u2013 and says fare increases are due solely to rising fuel costs. \u201cAll of the evidence says the customer is doing very well,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cWe have spent more money on our product in the past four years than we had in the previous 10, because we know they have a great choice.\u201d Virgin Atlantic, one of the last major long-haul carriers not to join an airline alliance, fell into the open arms of Delta, the US\u2019s second-largest carrier. Insiders say Branson was scanning for a partner for some time before the BA/AA tie-up, confirmed in 2010, turned up the pressure on him. With Delta, Virgin Atlantic now has nine flights a day on the world\u2019s key business-travel route \u2013 to New York from Heathrow. It is still smaller than BA/AA, but edging closer. Analysts say the tie-up improves Virgin Atlantic in terms of size, breadth of network and number of flights. The deal also helps Virgin Atlantic sell tickets in America\u2019s corporate market, where Delta is a household name. But those brought up on the Branson swashbuckle may feel this comes at a high cost. Sitting in his new Airbus at 35,000ft, Walsh also claimed that Branson\u2019s airline was \u201ccontrolled by Delta\u201d. This dig was a nod to a European commission investigation into the ownership of Virgin Atlantic by a non-EU carrier. Delta\u2019s 49% stake is at the limit of foreign ownership rules, but the shareholder is not exercising control. Virgin chief executive Craig Kreeger said he was not unduly concerned at this: \u201cWe are very confident that Virgin is run by us.\u201d Even so, the Delta culture appears to have permeated its partner. One analyst said: \u201cThey are aggressively managing the business for profitability rather than grand developments... It\u2019s not dots on the map, it\u2019s not sexy and it\u2019s not glamorous.\u201d Virgin\u2019s retrenchment has seen it not just grounding its domestic flights but pulling back from destinations such as Tokyo, Mumbai and Cape Town, under stiff competition from Gulf carriers. Ambitious deals such as an option for six A380s to match BA are back on ice, although the efficient Boeing Dreamliners can not come soon enough to cut its fuel bills. The 28 October inaugural flight for Virgin\u2019s first 787 Dreamliner \u2013 the first of 17 on order \u2013 will be to Delta\u2019s Atlanta hub. But with a typical Bransonian flourish, the flight will be all about the journey rather than the destination: UK electronic soul band Rudimental will play what Virgin Atlantic promises will the first ever gig to be streamed live from over the Atlantic. Branson may be pleased that Walsh feels there is sufficient rivalry to keep up the invective. But one industry observer suggests that hostility is waning, pointing to a world where few airlines can survive alone, and the deep pockets of Gulf players such as Emirates and Etihad are displacing the big beasts of old: \u201cThey are busy trying to make money, rather than beat the crap out of each other.\u201d And with conventional aviation losing its sense of adventure, Branson\u2019s space programme has become a bigger obsession. His eyes are on the stars, and his mind more on Galactic than Atlantic. AERIAL ASSAULTS 2008 Branson on Walsh\u2019s accusation that the entrepreneur had lied when claiming he had condemned price-fixing on the BBC\u2019s Money Programme: \u201cIt is no wonder that BA is in the state it is in if Willie Walsh has the time to watch past editions of the Money Programme.\u201d 2012 Walsh on Branson\u2019s offer of a \u00a31m bet over the success of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s Delta deal: \u201cIs Branson going to be the 51% owner of Virgin Atlantic in five years from now? If he wants to bet that, I think it would be an acceptable bet. But he\u2019s a billionaire banker - allegedly - and I don\u2019t think a million pounds would hurt him. A knee in the groin would be acceptable.\u201d Branson replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve got used to BA hitting below the belt over the years, but I\u2019m confident it would be the other way around on this occasion.\u201d 2014 Walsh on the ice-bucket challenge: \u201cI nominate the man who effectively owns and controls the Virgin transatlantic business. That\u2019s right, Richard, this is for you - Richard Anderson, CEO of Delta.\u201d He went on: \u201cThe Delta management team are much more rational\u2026 Virgin has almost disappeared... Delta control Virgin\u2026 We just call it Delta now.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Japan\u2019s meteorological agency said typhoon Vongfong could reach the Tokyo area by Tuesday, gradually losing strength as it moves up the archipelago."], "tags": ["India", "Japan", "World news", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-12T06:45:25Z", "title": "Cyclone sparks evacuations in India while Japan braces for typhoon", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/11/cyclone-hudhud-andhra-pradesh-india-hundreds-thousands-evacuated", "article": "Heavy rains and gusts have ripped through a large swath of India\u2019s eastern seaboard, uprooting trees and snapping power cables as a powerful cyclone swept through the Bay of Bengal, one of two storms pounding Asia on Sunday.

The calls for three members of prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s government to distance themselves from extremists come amid a campaign of death threats and intimidation targeting liberal academics, which observers say is a symptom of Japan\u2019s sharp turn to the right. Eriko Yamatani, who as chairman of the national public safety commission is Japan\u2019s most senior police official, is the third senior Liberal Democratic party (LDP) politician to have been linked to ultra-rightwing groups, after a photograph surfaced of her with Shigeo Masuki, a senior member of the Zaitokukai group. Yamatani, however, has refused to condemn Zaitokukai, whose members have labelled ethnic Korean residents of Japan \u201ccockroaches\u201d and called for them to be killed. The 2009 photograph, which Yamatani claims she does not recall being taken, became public soon after two of her LDP colleagues acknowledged that they had been snapped with Kazunari Yamada, the leader of a Japanese neo-Nazi party, in 2011. Sanae Takaichi, the internal affairs minister, and the LDP\u2019s policy head, Tomomi Inada, claimed they were unaware of Yamada\u2019s extremist views at the time. When challenged to condemn Zaitokukai, Yamatani said it was not appropriate to comment on the policies of individual groups. \u201cJapan has a long history of placing great value on the idea of harmony and respecting the rights of everyone,\u201d she said. Masuki, who has left Zaitokukai, told Reuters he had known Yamatani for more than a decade through their shared interest in education. Zaitokukai calls for the end to welfare and other \u201cprivileges\u201d afforded to about half a million non-naturalised members of Japan\u2019s ethnic Korean community, many of whom are the descendants of labourers brought over from the Korean peninsula to work in mines and factories before and during the second world war. Rightwing activists have been emboldened by the Asahi Shimbun\u2019s recent admission that articles it ran in the 1980s and 90s on Japan\u2019s wartime use of sex slaves \u2013 so-called comfort women \u2013were false. The liberal newspaper\u2019s articles were based on now-discredited testimony of Seiji Yoshida, a former soldier who claimed he had witnessed the abduction of women from the South Korean island of Jeju. The Asahi\u2019s erroneous reporting prompted Abe and other senior politicians to accuse it of damaging Japan\u2019s international image, claiming that the foreign media had taken the inaccurate sex slave articles as the cue for their own coverage. Former Asahi journalists who work in academia have become the target of a campaign of bomb and death threats by the far right designed to hound them out of their jobs. Activists have posted online the names and photographs of the children of one former Asahi journalist, Takashi Uemura, denouncing them as the offspring of a \u201ctraitor\u201d and urging them to kill themselves. Uemura had written articles on the sex slave issue for the Asahi 20 years ago. \u201c[The government\u2019s] lukewarm attitude towards hate crimes by the revisionist right is in itself a reason why we need to criticise the government\u2019s handling of this [intimidation] issue, even if it isn\u2019t directly orchestrating what is happening,\u201d said Koichi Nakano, a politics professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. Hokusei Gakuen University in Sapporo, which employs Uemura as a part-time lecturer, has postponed a decision on whether to rehire him for the 2015 academic year. Another former Asahi reporter declined a position at a university in western Japan after receiving threatening letters. \u201cAbe and other leaders\u2019 outlook is encouraging the rightwing to conduct even harsher attacks on those who are critical of the history of the Japanese empire,\u201d said Jiro Yamaguchi, a professor at Hosei University in Tokyo. Abe\u2019s recent cabinet reshuffle has raised fears that Japan is veering sharply to the right amid rising tensions over history and territorial claims with China and South Korea. Yamatani, Takaichi and Inada are close allies of Abe and share his revisionist views of Japan\u2019s wartime history. They have questioned the consensus that Japan forced tens of thousands of mainly Korean and Chinese women to work in frontline brothels between the late 1920s and Japan\u2019s defeat in 1945. Fifteen of the 19 members of Abe\u2019s cabinet belong to Nippon Kaigi, a group launched in 1997 to promote patriotic education and end Japan\u2019s \u201cmasochistic\u201d view of its wartime campaigns on mainland Asia. Abe played a prominent role in pressuring the education ministry to remove references to the comfort women from school textbooks. Yamaguchi said the rightwing campaign had echoes of the 1930s, when militarists carried out purges of liberal academics. \u201cIf Hokusei [University] gives in to this pressure [to sack Uemura], that would mean academic freedom and freedom of speech is undermined, even under a democratic constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a watershed moment for Japanese society.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["In Tokyo, Australia\u2019s Sam Stosur defended her Japan Women\u2019s Open title with a 7-6, 6-3 win over Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2014-10-14T12:59:23Z", "title": "Wayne Rooney goal in Estonia keeps England on track for Euro 2016 finals", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/14/wayne-rooney-england-euro-2016", "article": "Uefa\u2019s latest cash-spinning wheeze of puffing out the Euro 2016 finals to 24 sides and staggering qualifiers over several days produced a seemingly interminable dribble of mismatched international games.

Peter van der Helm, who owns Amsterdam\u2019s Walls and Skin \u2013 a tattoo and a graffiti supplies shop \u2013 is offering a service that promises to preserve tattoos after their owners die, and allow them to be passed on as works of art. More than 50 people have already signed up with the Foundation for the Art and Science of Tattooing, so that after their deaths, pathologists can remove the skin carrying their tattoo, pack it in formaldehyde and send it to a laboratory where the water and fat will be removed and replaced with silicone.

It was where I saw my first hardcore gig on 7 October 2006. I was 18 and a contender for gangliest nerd in Sydney.  On the wall behind the bands, someone had hung a huge banner: \u201cYOU ARE THE FUTURE.\u201d I Killed The Prom Queen headlined. They sucked (see for yourself here), but I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever seen. \u201cYou are the future.\u201d I was there with the gronky black-haired kids with sleeveless band shirts and huge munters in Hurley gear and, fuck me, I believed it. Some parents stood up the back, covering their faces. The year before, Parkway Drive had released their first album, Killing With A Smile. It went into my CD player as soon as I bought it and rarely came out. Parkway were like nothing else in the still-nascent Aussie metalcore scene: five surfers from Byron Bay who didn\u2019t bother with complex guitar noodling, metal attitude, costumes (unless you count thongs and boardies) or grandiose solos.             There were no emo \u201cclean\u201d vox either \u2013 just huge guitars, Winston McCall\u2019s guttural screaming, mammoth breakdowns, stage-dives and circle pits, guys and girls jumping and pushing and screaming. Parkway is metal for punk kids, straight out of Australia\u2019s hardcore punk mecca: Byron Bay High School. Its members were never that into metal, but came up at the same time as US metalcore giants Killswitch Engage and As I Lay Dying. They were influenced by bands like Unearth and In Flames, bands with whom they now share top billing. At Sydney University\u2019s Manning Bar in December 2006, we screamed our guts out when Winston stuck his mic into the crowd and we cheered when they played Gimme AD. Guys jumped from the speakers and the stage into the kids below, Michael Crafter walked out on everyone\u2019s shoulders. All the songs sounded the same and I just wanted to jump around. Then in 2007, Parkway released Horizons. It was, in the language of metal reviewing, both more melodic and more brutal than ever. The shows got bigger. I went to Canberra for uni, dyed my hair black, grew a fringe and started wearing T-shirts with coffins on them. My mates and I kept going to the gigs, screaming \u201cCarrion!\u201d at the top of our lungs. The lyrics were emo as anything, but who cared?  In a moment I\u2019m lostDying from the insideHer eyes take me awayTear me apart from the inside out.  This was shit to shout until your voice went, while giving boosts to crowdsurfers wearing Alexisonfire shirts, Acacia Strain shirts, Trivium shirts, Bury Your Dead shirts. With Carrion, Parkway had a true crowd-pleaser and had arrived. \u201cCARRION!!!\u201d and then a huge breath for the call back: \u201cDying from the inside.\u201d That doesn\u2019t even make sense, really, but when you think about it, neither did straightening your hair in the bathrooms between sets.     Straightened circumstances: Adam Brereton at a uni bands competition in 2007. Photograph: Supplied    At one show, in the now-defunct Jamison Inn in Canberra, everyone screamed \u201cCARRION!!!\u201d while a guy jumped off the PA on a boogie board. By the end of the night we were all crammed onto the tiny pub stage, ears bursting from the kicks and getting those pointy ESP guitar necks in the ribs. I loved the solidarity of it all, even if I was too awkward to talk to anyone except my friends. We\u2019d come streaming out of the pit to knock back Bundy and Cokes between sets because we were 18 and we could; we\u2019d shout: \u201cSo cry me a fucking river\u201d with massive smiles on our faces before the breakdown in Romance is Dead; and we\u2019d always head home alone because we were terrified of the scene girls with pink hair and heart-padlock tattoos on their collarbones. At Soundwave in 2007, the rain belted down and we moshed to Carrion so hard that steam poured off the pit. The singer from the Bronx did his set crowdsurfing with a sombrero and a tin of VB. We never had problems at those shows like you do at the likes of Big Day Out. There were no idiots on pingers or festival creeps.            \u201cCARRION!!!\u201d We were screaming it at No Sleep Til Sydney, when I went with a mate who had just returned from Afghanistan on a tour; \u201cCARRION!!!\u201d at Woden basketball court; or at the UNSW Roundhouse, or in the car driving to the library to study, or in my first-year uni room screaming \u201cCARRION!!!\u201d while I was putting the iron over my fringe before tutes. Parkway put out two more albums and even got a song in the Triple J hottest 100 in 2011 (at 97!). But Carrion is still the one they close with.

I haven\u2019t been to a Parkway gig in ages. I shaved off my black hair because the regrowth made me look like I was going bald. Then I started going bald for real. A laundry mishap destroyed most of my good band shirts.

Tokyo). This four-day event brought together both international and Japanese leaders across politics and business. I was impressed by the real sense of urgency in working together to increase women\u2019s active role in economies worldwide \u2013 and by the efforts of prime minister Shinzo Abe to champion the need for women to play a vital role in reinvigorating the Japanese economy. Organised by the government of Japan, along with other Japanese organisations and institutions, the focus of the event was the link between female participation in the workforce and economic growth. This is particularly pertinent to Japan, which has an increasingly ageing population and a very great need for higher labour force participation rates among women. Even though Japanese women graduates are among the best qualified in the world, they face huge discrimination in the workforce \u2013 and this is despite the Equal Opportunity Employment law which came to effect in the country in 1986. Increasing the level of women\u2019s participation in the labour market to that of men\u2019s could see 7.1m people join Japan\u2019s shrinking workforce, potentially increasing the country\u2019s GDP by nearly 13%. While female representation on Japanese company boards is a mere 1%. While women in north America and Europe have been vital participants in the workforce since the 1960s, going from housewives, to clerical workers and finally to top executives, Japan has lagged behind. Now about 60% of women quit their jobs when their first child is born. Prime minister Abe believes that in order to modernise the Japanese economy, the country needs to start \u201ctapping into its most underutilised resource: Japanese women\u201d. Abe insists that his policies are all about empowering women and is actively trying to promote higher participation rates with his goal for Japan to have 30% of all leadership positions filled by women by 2020. During the opening session of Waw! I joined Japan\u2019s first lady Akie Abe in conversation on stage. In a country where first ladies are considered best when seen but not heard, Mrs Abe\u2019s public appearance at a government-sponsored women\u2019s conference was anything but conventional. Mrs Abe is a huge supporter of her husband\u2019s policy of promoting women\u2019s advancement, which has been described as \u201cwomenomics\u201d. In a light hearted exchange with her husband on stage, she revealed that he undertakes domestic chores, something that may seem unremarkable, but given that only 2.6% of men take paternity leave in Japan for fear of harming their career prospects, her message was clear albeit subtle, that men have a part to play in helping women take their place in the workforce. 2015 is the 20th anniversary of the Beijing declaration and Platform for Action, and the 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) will be held in March. This will be an opportunity to measure progress in achieving gender equality during the past 20 years, and also a space to come up with innovative ideas on how to move forward, as still no country in the world has achieved equal opportunities for women and men. There is also real momentum to strengthen women\u2019s empowerment within the post-2015 development agenda. This link between female participation in the workforce and economic growth is at the heart of our work at the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women. We are calling for gender equality to be mainstreamed across the new framework \u2013 not buried within specific goals. Women are still disproportionately concentrated in the informal economy.

They come to devour Main Street, destroy Manor Farm and put mankind in its place. Just maybe they are coming to eat up the arthouse as well. White God is a terrific Hungarian picture in which the stray dogs of Budapest take over the city and wreak a terrible revenge on their two-legged tormentors. In this respect the film can take its place alongside a raft of other forthcoming creature features. These include Zombeavers (killer rodents at summer camp), Beaster Day (Easter Bunny goes bad) and Timur Bekmambetov\u2019s Squirrels (tagline: \u201cHold on to your nuts\u201d). The difference, however, is that only one of these films won a top prize at Cannes and was recently selected as its nation\u2019s official submission for the foreign film Oscar. White God is an anomaly. I\u2019m seeing it as Lady, with all the rest playing Tramp. Is it a redundancy to complain that animal horror films are typically silly and cheap, and lacking in logic? That\u2019s part and parcel of the genre\u2019s USP. Animal horror has always been the great dumb beast of the cinema family, full of screaming extras and B-movie actors in flight. But amid the pursuits and ambushes, the snarling and slithering, might there be space for nuance and metaphor too? White God seems to think so. It takes the high road through some very well-trampled terrain.     Squirrels film poster. Photograph: PR    \u201cIn eastern Europe, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily see a film like this as part of the horror genre anyway,\u201d suggests author and horror expert Kim Newman. \u201cI think they would see it in much more allegorical terms.\u201d In White God, specifically, the mix-breed dogs of Budapest are a metaphor for the underclass. Persecuted and incarcerated, they eventually rise up under the leadership of the headstrong Hagen, who has a ginger coat, a furrowed brow and a curly tail. Hagen\u2019s army is savage, ruthless and baying for blood. And yet these dogs aren\u2019t the villains; they are angels of reprisal. Tellingly, director Kornel Mundruczo compares Hagen with Roy Batty, Rutger Hauer\u2019s vengeful replicant from Blade Runner. One thing I like about White God is the way it confounds expectations and keeps changing its coat. Mundruczo\u2019s film sets out as a social-realist family drama, briefly mutates into a Lassie Come Home-style tearjerker, and then suddenly kicks out the fences, blooming into an absurdist black comedy of animal armageddon. So it\u2019s a mongrel movie about mongrel mutts; a vibrant jumble of genre genes. And this, the director tells me, reflects his experience of 21st-century Europe. \u201cThe idea of European union \u2013 what does that even mean?\u201d he says. \u201cIn the past five years, the reality has changed. Pure genres and pure ideologies are just ruined. First we had the economic crisis and now we have the moral crisis. Today, if I walk from one block of Budapest to the other, I feel that I\u2019m passing from a melodrama to an action movie to a political drama to a fantasy. Everything\u2019s running together. So a mixed-genre movie is the only one that makes sense.\u201d He allows that a pedigree breed would be an easier sell. \u201cA crossover movie is always difficult to place. This isn\u2019t hardcore arthouse but it\u2019s not a big Hollywood genre movie either. And if people don\u2019t immediately understand what something is, in my experience they don\u2019t want to work with it.\u201d     A scene from Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds, 1963. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Universal    I hope he\u2019s proved wrong; I suspect that he will be. Besides, even a species as hardy as this one has to adapt and recalibrate in order to survive. Down the years the animal horror has flirted with critical acclaim (Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds) and blockbuster success (Spielberg\u2019s Jaws) and enjoyed a purple patch in the early 70s, when mounting alarm about global pollution gave rise to such cutprice paranoid classics as Frogs (which was about frogs), Sssssss (snakes) and The Night of the Lepus (rabbits). But in recent decades \u2013 as Big Ass Spider begat Dragon Wasps and Piranha 3D \u2013 the genre has largely mislaid its political bite, tipped into comedy, or found itself neutered by technological advances. One reason White God works so well is because Mundruczo has opted to load the film with 250 dogs. CGI beasts, for all their glossy coats and glittering fangs, lack a crucial whiff of chaos, dirt and danger. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a difficult genre to do well,\u201d says Newman. \u201cMost film-makers are lazy. Most animal horrors wimp out. You have to have real animals in the frame with real actors. That\u2019s why Snakes on a Plane didn\u2019t quite work \u2013 it was really Pixels on a Plane.\u201d He looks back fondly on films such as The Naked Jungle, in which Charlton Heston coated himself in honey before running through a swarm of army ants. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Ben Affleck doing that today.\u201d All animal horrors are equal; it\u2019s just that some are more equal than others. There is a distinction, Newman argues, between movies such as Jaws, Piranha or Alligator, in which animals are just doing what animals do, and films such as The Birds, The Pack or Frogs, in which they manifestly are not. The first bunch are basically disaster movies. The second, though, are where the pure horror resides. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary is when the seemingly innocuous animals turn on you, the ones you least expect. That\u2019s always more more jarring, when nature turns strange. It suggests that society is not running right. That there is something really wrong with the world. And that the animals are somehow striking back.\u201d     Napoleon in Animal Farm, 1954. Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar    Is there an ancestor for all of these allegorical horrors? Newman suggests The Terror, a 1917 short story by Arthur Machen in which the livestock of middle England start channelling the savagery in the trenches. Alternatively one might cite the 1954 adaptation of Animal Farm, George Orwell\u2019s pointed recasting of the Russian revolution as a barnyard revolt, replete with pigs, dogs and horses. Created by John Halas and Joy Batchelor, it\u2019s a thunderous, stentorian cartoon of oppression, revolution and the corruption that follows. Except it transpires that even this approach is as old as the hills. \u201cThe tradition of animal fables goes back to Aesop and the original tale-tellers,\u201d says film historian Brian Sibley. \u201cIt\u2019s already a popular form by the time that Orwell came along: the idea that animal life mirrors human life. You could argue that any animal film, whether it\u2019s Tom and Jerry, Wile E Coyote or a Hollywood horror movie, is a way of reflecting and commenting on our own human foibles.\u201d In Animal Farm, the beasts literally see red and proceed to turn on their masters. Orwell\u2019s version ended in glorious bleakness, with the pigs carousing with the men and the old order re-established. And yet Halas and Bachelor\u2019s film was bankrolled by the US. It demanded that the pigs (and by implication Soviet Russia) be itself overthrown by yet another insurrection. The good animals rise up, the bad ones are defeated. The film-makers\u2019 daughter, Vivien Halas, explains that her parents were socialists; they initially baulked at the changes. \u201cBut the money came from a slush fund to promote American art, which later morphed into the CIA. So they were forced to add an ending that had at least a glimmer of hope.\u201d Can one trace a line from the animated Animal Farm to Mundruczo\u2019s White God? The first film is rural and the second is urban. Both, however, stand as harsh political allegories of oppressive human frameworks. Its inhabitants are dangerous and they surely mean harm. But while the animals are the monsters, they also represent us. They are the downtrodden in our midst; angry and unsung and on the brink of revolt. If we can only learn to love them, we may just be OK. In steering White God on its route to the apocalypse, Mundruczo held true to one guiding principle. \u201cMan needs the dog and the dog needs man,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a relationship of cruelty and shame, but we are still bound up together. And maybe we just need to put ourselves in their shoes, or put ourselves on their level. If we really want to know who we are as a people, we should all take a look into the eyes of a dog.\u201d Revolting creatures: they\u2019re coming for you Dogs Before White God there was The Pack, a 1970s schlock horror in which a band of discarded canines start munching on the residents of an exclusive island resort. All at once the dogs are relishing a rich diet of wealthy bankers and the random tourists too corpulent and slow to climb into the trees. \u201cThey\u2019re not pets any more!\u201d the tagline needlessly informed us.

Birds \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the world,\u201d laments the town drunk as the crows and seagulls attack Bodega Bay. Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds juggled B-movie hysterics with arthouse gloss, sending sugar-frosted Tippi Hedren dashing from the playground to the dock. Are the birds a twisted manifestation of human sexuality or societal rage? Nobody knows; chaos reigns. The stark hanging ending leaves the film\u2019s mysteries intact.

My first impression: I purchased this book at the Frankfurt Book Fair last weekend because I am planning to conduct some bird research in northern India in 2015. Although this monstrously huge travel guide is a paperback, it has similar heft to a boat anchor -- not exactly the sort of thing I\u2019d carry with me whilst traveling! It is more than 1,000 pages long, and yes, it is crammed with all sorts of useful information, diagrams and tables, and lots of gorgeous maps -- everything that the wanderer needs to be inspired and well-prepared. I dip into this book nearly every night before I go to bed, and find it fascinating reading. However, after reading the \u201cSurvival Guide\u201d section about women and solo travelers, it looks as though solo female travelers can expect to run a gauntlet of theft as well as physical and sexual harassment and abuse, which made me deeply concerned for my safety in India. The many news stories about the rape and murder of women in India that I\u2019ve been reading the past couple years add to my concerns. Although I am still reading the book, my future research plans in India are uncertain. Any thoughts, dear readers?     .    Arrival of the Fittest: Solving Evolution\u2019s Greatest Puzzle by Andreas Wagner [Oneworld, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover; Amazon US hardcover/kindle US/mp3 CD]  Publisher\u2019s synopsis: The power of Darwin\u2019s natural selection is beyond doubt, explaining how useful adaptations are preserved over generations. But the biggest mystery about evolution eluded him: how those adaptations arise in the first place. Can random mutations over a mere 3.8 billion years solely be responsible for wings, eyeballs, knees, photosynthesis, and the rest of nature\u2019s creative marvels? And by calling these mutations \u2018random\u2019, are we not just admitting our own ignorance? What if we could now uncover the wellspring of all biological innovation? Renowned evolutionary biologist Andreas Wagner presents the missing piece in Darwin\u2019s theory. Using cutting-edge experimental and computational technologies, he has found that adaptations are not just driven by chance, but by a set of laws that allow nature to discover new molecules and mechanisms in a fraction of the time that random variation would take. Consider the Arctic cod, a fish that lives in waters cold enough to turn the internal fluids of most organisms into ice crystals. And yet, the Arctic cod survives by producing \u2018natural anti-freeze\u2019, proteins that lower the freezing temperature of its body fluids. The invention of those proteins is an archetypal example of nature\u2019s enormous powers of creativity. Meticulously researched, carefully argued, and full of fascinating examples from the animal kingdom, Arrival of the Fittest offers up the final puzzle piece in the mystery of life\u2019s rich diversity. My first impression: As an avid bookworm who is particularly attracted to books about science, I have been impressed by Oneworld Publishers\u2019 string of popular science books -- these books are successful, well-written and scientifically accurate. (For example, Oneworld has had at least one book on the shortlist for the Royal Society\u2019s Winton Prize for science books these past few years, and the winner of the Royal Society\u2019s 2013 Winton Prize for science books was a Oneworld title.) Which suggests that Oneworld provides consistent, strong support to its authors, and their staff attentively shepherd its popular science titles through the writing and editing process so the end product is the best that it can possibly be -- interesting, engaging and thought-provoking. This book follows the same tradition. The author provides a detailed argument in support of the idea that evolutionary adaptations are not random as Darwin originally proposed, but instead, adaptations obey a set of laws that maximise discovery of new molecules and molecular pathways. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve heard these arguments (I was first exposed to these ideas by my mentor when I was an undergrad) but the vast array of research presented in this book that supports this argument is worth thoughtful consideration by all evolutionary biologists. If I was still a zoology grad student at the University of Washington, this is a title I\u2019d propose for the zoology grad student science book forum, Pizza Evolution. I already expect I\u2019ll see this book on next year\u2019s Royal Society Winton Prize shortlist!     .    The Sword of Kuromori by Jason Rohan [Egmont, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK paperback; Amazon US paperback/kindle US]  Publisher\u2019s synopsis: Kenny Blackwood arrives in Tokyo to spend the summer with his father and is stunned to discover a destiny he had never dreamed of when he finds himself in the middle of a hidden war that is about to explode. Racing against an impossible deadline, Kenny must find the fabled Sword of Heaven and use it to prevent the disaster. But a host of terrifying monsters is out to destroy him, and success will come at a price. With clever, fearless, sarcastic Kiyomi at his side, Kenny must negotiate the worlds of modern and mythic Japan to find the lost sword, before it\u2019s too late. My first impression: This was a personally autographed gift from a person who knows of my intense passion for the Harry Potter books (and who also knows that I lived in Tokyo for a while as a grad student.) I\u2019ve not yet started reading this because I have five book reviews to finish writing before I allow myself to become spellbound by another page-turner that I will read cover-to-cover without stopping.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

People really are food crazy in Osaka. They talk about it all the time \u2013 it\u2019s a bit of an obsession. Street food is what it\u2019s all about: different areas are dedicated to different dishes. Takoyaki are gooey doughballs with octopus inside and brown sauce and seaweed on top. You\u2019ll find it in Triangle Park in the American Village (Shinsaibashi). It\u2019s the equivalent of chips and curry sauce. Kushikatsu is another favourite street food \u2013 skewers of breaded and deep-fried meat, though there are veg and seafood options too. Look for it in the New World area, around the Tsutenkaku tower, which used to be somewhere tourists would avoid, though it\u2019s quite gentrified these days. I grew up in Kobe, a quiet town about half an hour away, and over the new year holiday we would come into Osaka to go to the theatre in Dotonbori. I remember seeing the bright facades of restaurants \u2013 with giant crabs moving their pincers \u2013 and going to see my first kabuki play. It\u2019s not far but it felt like another world. Going out for a drink in Japan always involves eating. Often restaurants are very small, with one counter and a couple of two-seater tables. One of my favourite places is Fukusuke. It has a good selection of sake and shochu from small breweries across Japan, served with seasonal seafood. A friend I went to school with opened a bar/restaurant called Shoka in the north of town with great handpicked sake \u2013 I\u2019m having the next get-together with the girls there at Christmas, and I can\u2019t wait.

Photograph: Jon Hicks    There\u2019s plenty of designer shopping in Osaka in the big department stores, but I prefer wandering and browsing. Nakazakicho, near Umeda, is a haven for quirky knick-knacks and secondhand and contemporary clothes. Old residential houses have been turned into shops, giving a retro-modern feel to the whole area. I love Japanese stationery and always use it for my work, so I\u2019ll stock up on pens and pencils from Tokyu Hands or Loft, a great department store in Umeda. I swear by Japanese erasers \u2013 you can\u2019t get them as good anywhere else. Graf (graf-d3.com) is owned by some interior design friends: it\u2019s a workshop, studio, shop and restaurant/cafe \u2013 a design oasis away from the clamour of the streets. If you want to spend an afternoon immersed in a camp extravaganza of theatre, hop on a Hankyu train from Umeda to Takarazuka. It takes about 20 minutes. Takarazuka Revue is an all-girl theatre group where top stars play male roles (and they melt the hearts of housewives!). It\u2019s a world of feather boas, false eyelashes and fake moustaches. If I am up for staying out late, I\u2019ll go to Bar Bonanza on the edge of American Village (ameblo.jp/bar-bonanza).

Do you ever get tired of attending events that you have organised? No, I attend all of the events Timebased organises, unless I happen to be away or have two events on the same evening. If that does happen I am a fan of a taxi bike to get across London. If someone is thinking of starting a career in events, what are the top attributes they should possess? They must be focused on coming up with solutions and not a panicker. It\u2019s important to be calm and stay clear-headed under pressure. Organisation, multitasking and creativity are also key attributes in this industry. How has your background in theatre informed what you do? I started out in the theatre and I still use many of the skills I learned, directing performance pieces and creating unusual, one-off shows. It gave me a great grounding in events. Looking back on it now, the theatre shows I produced were really events as they were also audience experiences on many different levels. What has been the hardest aspect of setting up your own business? Juggling everything. The events themselves are very intense periods in the run-up and during. On top of managing clients\u2019 expectations, you have to have a good team spirit and work ethic \u2013 especially when you are pushing the boundaries of creativity by producing events that have never been done before. You need to mould a brilliant team and to keep everyone happy. What have been the most exciting brands to work with? GQ and Glamour as we have produced both their men and women of the year awards since their inception, and seen them both grow massively in terms of stature and profile. Both events now attract an incredible line-up of guests from Johnny Depp and Samuel L Jackson, Cara Delevingne and Naomi Campbell, to Pharrell, Iggy Pop, Bob Geldof and Pippa Middleton. Did you have a breakthrough moment? Arranging a meeting with the Cond\u00e9 Nast events director for the first ever GQ men of the year awards. Another particular moment that stands out for me was being asked to organise a party for Sting. He had a favourite flower and we planted them every metre in his back paddock so they flowered a couple of days before the event. What\u2019s next for Timebased?

He saw my slideshow in the 1980s when he was in a wheelchair and he said: \u201cHere is somebody with as big an ego as myself.\u201d I once got a gig to go talk with him, but I was too fucked up. It was my relapse period. I have some regrets, not many, and that\u2019s one. Cristina de Middel Her phenomenally successful Afronauts reimagined Zambia\u2019s 1970s space programme.     A young man in curlers at home on West 20th street, NYC, 1966, by Diane Arbus. \u00a9 1972 The Estate of Diane Arbus, LLC    The book I have spent most time with is Diana Arbus\u2019s Revelations, published in 2003. It is a comprehensive, visually dynamic biography of a photographer I still admire and whose work remains for me as exciting as the first time I saw it. There is this gossip element with all her private pictures, notes and contact sheets. It somehow illuminates her obscure and enigmatic character. It works for me almost as a glossy magazine in a hair salon.  Oliver Chanarin Controversial winner of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse prize, with Adam Broomberg. My favourite book is The British Dictionary of Sign Language, published by Faber and Faber in 1992. It contains 1,800 shots and is a great example of photography that\u2019s both beautiful and useful. Adam Broomberg Collaborates with Oliver Chanarin (see above).     Show Me!, by Will McBride    Show Me! by photographer Will McBride and psychoanalyst Helga Fleischhauer-Hardt had a profound effect on me. Originally published as Zeig Mal! in 1974, it was developed as a sex-education book, but with explicit images of sometimes pre-pubescent children engaged in sexual acts. The publishers found themselves in court for six years in the US defending it, until they finally pulled its distribution, unable to afford the legal costs. The book is challenging on so many levels \u2013 exposing the limits of photography, society and our own moral boundaries. At best, it keeps us thinking about how society has changed in terms of how we view, touch and interact with children \u2013 as parents, friends or strangers \u2013 highlighting the state of paranoia and paralysis we are in now, where all forms of intimacy and sensuality are actively repressed through fear. I don\u2019t agree with any suggestion that it\u2019s child pornography. I think what makes it such a scary read is not that anything depicted in the book is wrong (we all played doctor with our next-door neighbours). It\u2019s just the fact that such important, intimate and private moments in growing are captured on film and widely distributed. Maybe it\u2019s a reminder that these moments are meant to remain private, especially in a world where everything is now documented.  Bruno Ceschel Founder of online publishing house Self-Publish Be Happy.     The Kids Are Alright by Ryan McGinley    Every once in a while, a book comes along that transcends its own content. It appears at the right time and place, embodying the zeitgeist. That\u2019s what Ryan McGinley\u2019s The Kids Are Alright did. It rehashed things that were the tropes of youth for my generation: hedonism, pleasure, sex, drugs, nihilism. I remember picking up a copy in a New York bookshop in early 2000. It spoke to me. It put in pictures the new fluidity of identities, the pleasure of experimenting with drugs and sex.  Martin Parr Famous for his garish documentation of everyday British life.     New York, by William Klein. Courtesy HackelBury Fine Art    No book has had a greater impact on photography than William Klein\u2019s New York 1954-55. It sent ripples of awe and amazement round the photography community worldwide, as they digested the grainy, full-bleed, bold images of the city. From Tokyo to Buenos Aires, from London to Madrid, it changed the way photographers worked.  Juergen Teller Fashion photographer known for his harsh, flash-lit style and nudes of Kate Moss.      A Sentimental Journey, 1971, by Nobuyoshi Araki    Sentimental Journey by Nobuyoshi Araki [who documented his relationship with his wife Yoko, from their honeymoon in 1971 to her death in 1990] is beautiful, sentimental, heartfelt, full of love, full of life, full of death, sad, hopeful. It\u2019s life, not a stupid photobook.  Paul Graham Award-winning documentary photographer-turned-fine artist.      Ahnung, by Volker Heinze    Volker Heinze\u2019s Ahnung (Foreboding) was about Berlin in the late 1980s, when the wall was still up. Great images, shallow focus, details that are pointless to describe: a gate, a pipe\u2019s shadow, a girl\u2019s fingers. But really it\u2019s not about Berlin so much as a state of mind, a point of time in the walled-off city. We were close friends and shared an apartment in Berlin, working together and roaming the city. I was present when he took many of the images (and am in one). He was around for some of mine, which ended up in my New Europe book, so there is that sweet memory of freedom and fertile youth. He designed the book and struggled to find a way to print it \u2013 this was before digital presses, so it was expensive. But he managed. Just 1,000 copies. All gone now.  Viviane Sassen Dutch star of fashion photography. My favourite photobook is my first private album, which my mum made for me. Does that count? Probably not. Eyelids of Morning then, by Peter Beard, about the Turkana tribespeople who live side by side with Nile crocodiles. It was one of the first photobooks I ever laid my hands on.  Brett Rogers Director of the Photographers\u2019 Gallery, London.      The Map, by Kikuji Kawada Photograph: PR    Kikuji Kawada\u2019s The Map exemplifies what I seek in a photobook: it provides a radical new way of reading photographic images. Here, it was the experience of turning page after page of stark monochrome images, like a survivor coming face to face with the evidence and ruins of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima. A deeply moving and highly original investigation into a seminal moment in Japanese history.  Pieter Hugo South African photographer who has tackled the paradoxes of life there.     Case History, by Boris Mikhailov. Courtesy Galerie Barbara Weiss    In 2002, I was feeling constrained with the political pressures and so-called responsibilities one has as a \u201cSouth African documentary photographer\u201d. The field had such a limited lexicon: I was constantly reiterating the same ideas and functions. It felt more like propaganda. Then I found Case History by Boris Mikhailov [capturing the social disintegration that followed the break-up of the Soviet Union]. Calling it a breath of fresh air seems like a gross understatement. It was more like a hurricane, and it cleared away the cobwebs. It maintained the observational quality of documentary, but introduced a theatrical element. It is raw and transgressive, but in a fresh and stimulating way. A book that made me re-evaluate my whole approach. Mishka Henner Famed for recontextualising found images, including a series on sex workers taken from Google Street View. I have a slight obsession with a Chinese edition of Robert Frank\u2019s The Americans. It sits on my shelf, sealed and unopened. Having made Less Am\u00e9ricains [which erased parts of Frank\u2019s images], I know these pictures inside-out, so there\u2019s no need for me to look inside. But there\u2019s a wonderful and enigmatic link between the existence of this edition and the fact the Chinese are the largest foreign owners of US debt. Alec Soth American documentary photographer, independent publisher, and artist.     The Solitude of Ravens, by Masahisa Fukase    About 20 years ago, on the discount shelf of my local bookshop, I discovered The Solitude of Ravens by Masahisa Fukase. This was the American reprint and the design and printing were nothing special. Taken individually, Fukase\u2019s pictures aren\u2019t particularly memorable, either. The book consists mostly of repetitious images of blackbirds and moody winter scenes, but Fukase\u2019s sequencing transforms these humble pieces into the most unified and unforgettable progression of pictures I\u2019ve ever encountered. Simon Baker The Tate\u2019s first curator of photography and international art. Ilya Ehrenburg\u2019s 1933 book My Paris is both a photobook and extended essay on that most photographed of cities. It begins with an incredible combination of images and text, with Ehrenburg writing about \u201cthe lateral viewfinder\u201d. This ingenious device, he explains, is intended to avoid the unfortunate effect of the camera lens, which \u201cscatters a crowd like the barrel of a gun\u201d. Like a kind of periscope, it allows the photographer to face in one direction and shoot at 90 degrees to it. \u201cPeople would sometimes wonder: why was I taking pictures of a fence or a road?\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know I was taking pictures of them.\u201d Ehrenburg\u2019s book is as cunning and oblique as the device used to make it, turning the conventional view of Paris \u2013 all boulevards and romance \u2013 on its head. The city he depicts is one of small-time miseries, homelessness, poverty and old age. For every kissing couple, there is a sleeping drunk. He catches the capital unaware, with its hair unbrushed and its trousers down. But for all his inventory of Paris\u2019s flaws, Ehrenburg\u2019s work has great poetry and visual flair: it\u2019s an unflinching, brilliant counterpoint to the visions of Paris offered by the great modernist and surrealist photographers of the time. Perfectly conceived, presented, sequenced and captioned, it blows most of Ehrenburg\u2019s contemporaries out of the water.  Michael Hoppen Owner of influential London gallery and avid collector.

But one difference dominates here: there\u2019s no actual dancefloor. Instead, located in front of the elevated DJ booths at bling venues such as LINX, Mook and MYST (the latter acronym stands for \u201cMoving You Stunning Trip\u201d), are the most expensive VIP tables. Whereas in the west the highest rollers get to hide away in private rooms, here they are proudly on view for everyone to envy. At LINX they are elevated into this position ... quite literally: the VIP section is periodically lifted up via hydraulic pumps. Venues such as these \u2013 and many others in cities China-wide \u2013 are packed every weekend. And they\u2019re filled with an overwhelmingly local, newly moneyed clientele that generally isn\u2019t there for the DJ talent. Shanghai\u2019s big club culture may be dominated by social status-graspers rather than dance connoisseurs, but it has nevertheless become a popular stop for globe-hopping superstar DJs. The likes of Steve Aoki and DJ Falcon regularly return, seduced by high performance fees and the chance to explore the madcap city. \u201cShanghai is starting to attract the international DJ crowd,\u201d says Tim Crouch, entertainment director and DJ at Shanghainese favourite Mook, which has played host to Paris Hilton\u2019s DJ skills and an LMFAO PA set. \u201cBut we have catching up to do compared to cities in Korea and Japan. They have clubs that are focused purely on dance music and the underground scene, whereas here it\u2019s more mainstream. The style of music is almost second to the celebrity factor.\u201d The dance scene in Shanghai is healthier than the band scene and it\u2019s easy to understand why. It\u2019s tough for foreign bands to get visas to play in China, and many gigs end up getting cancelled anyway, limiting the international influence on local acts. DJs however only need to turn up with a laptop carried in hand luggage in order to take home a decent pay cheque.             If this all sounds somewhat soulless then it\u2019s exciting to find that, beyond the pneumatic thump of the super-clubs, a strong, largely expat-run alternative dance scene has evolved, largely as a reaction to them. Clubs such as the Shelter (a converted bomb shelter), Arkham and DADA attract feted, cultish acts that often end up building strong connections with the city. \u201cThe DJs love it,\u201d says Reggie Ba-Pe, an Australian who set up the charmingly-named S.T.D. club promotion company in 2007 as well as Arkham last year. \u201cShanghai is so different to the usual places they play, especially in venues like Arkham or The Shelter. It feels like a club from New York or Berlin that got dropped in the middle of China.\u201d Lauded underground dance types such as Hyperdub Records chief Kode9 keep coming back \u2013 he even released a single, Xinfu Lu, named after a Shanghai street. Goldie, meanwhile, has played to hipster expats at the Shelter numerous times. \u201cShanghai\u2019s on the top of the list when it comes to futuristic cities,\u201d he said ahead of his last gig here. \u201cShanghai\u2019s underground scene has come a long way,\u201d agrees Ba-Pe. \u201cCertainly in comparison to cities like Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul, which have more settled and mature scenes. Shanghai is grittier, it\u2019s raw.\u201d The champagne-glugging rich kids at LINX and MYST probably wouldn\u2019t agree with his \u201cgritty\u201d diagnoses.

But nothing here has made the link between monumental sculpture and sexual desire as literal as a green, abstracted Christmas tree that looked disconcertingly like a \u201cplug anal\u201d \u2013 the mildly more polite French term for a butt plug.  The Los Angeles provocateur, whose aggressive sculptures, installations and videos have in the past depicted Snow White in sexually compromised positions and figures wearing George Bush masks copulating with pigs, had installed the inflatable sculpture in the middle of Paris\u2019s elegant Place Vend\u00f4me, home to the French justice ministry and the Ritz hotel. Yet less than a day after its installation it was gone \u2013 a victim of the conservative populist backlash that has upended French politics over the past year.              Tree, as the sculpture was euphemistically titled, had received the approval of all the relevant organisations overseeing public art installations, from the Paris city government to the neighbourhood business association. Yet at the work\u2019s inauguration on Friday, a man accosted the artist, slapping his face three times before running off. Quickly images of Tree started circulating in right-wing social media circles, among them the Manif Pour Tous \u2013 a revanchist movement that first arose in opposition to the legalisation of gay marriage in France last year, and now serves as a catch-all protest movement. \u201cPlace Vend\u00f4me vandalised!

McCarthy\u2019s alleged anal dilator was installed as part of the public programming of Fiac, the Paris art fair that opens on Wednesday. Previous sculptures installed in the Place Vend\u00f4me include large humanoid sculptures by the Spanish artist Jaume Plensa in 2012, and a wooden bivouac fastened to the top of the square\u2019s victory column by Japanese artist Tadashi Kawamata last year. McCarthy is also preparing a major installation elsewhere in Paris: a working chocolate factory in the city\u2019s mint, which now hosts contemporary art installations. Visitors will be able to see dozens of varieties of chocolate shapes \u2013 among them a Santa Claus holding a smaller butt plug.  The controversy comes at a moment of right-wing populist revival in France, where President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande faces record low approval numbers, his centre-right rival Nicolas Sarkozy has failed to gain traction for his attempt at a revival, but Marine Le Pen, leader of the hard-right National Front, continues her ascent. Last month her party won seats in the Senate for the first time, and recent polling suggests that Le Pen could place first in the 2017 presidential election, beating even her father Jean-Marie\u2019s score in 2002.

At university her classmates thought her rounder physique lent her a homely air. They nicknamed her \u201cMama\u201d. Today, at 5ft 3in tall and just over 11 stone (70kg), Ando is, coincidentally, exactly the same height and weight as the average British woman. But in Japan, a country that has the slimmest population in the developed world, she\u2019s not so typical. Japanese women across all ages weigh an average of around eight-and-a-half stone. Fewer than 20% are officially overweight and a mere 3.2% are classified as obese. Combine this with a youth culture filled with childishly cute pop idols and petite fashion \u2013 the credo of kawaii \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see how larger women feel stigmatised. \u201cFor a long time I was very ashamed about my size,\u201d says Ando. Now Ando is at the forefront of a trend aimed at helping young women reject fat-shaming stereotypes. She is a model for La Farfa, Japan\u2019s first fashion magazine for plus-size women. She is also one of a trio of singers in a new band, La Big 3, which is sponsored by the magazine. The group released its first single last month, a song entitled Pochative, roughly meaning \u201cchubby-positive\u201d. The pocchari (chubby) trend has also seen the emergence of another all-girl band, Chubbiness, whose members are slightly less svelte than regular idols, and a number of trendy clothing brands designed for more ample bodies.            It\u2019s not a total departure from dominant beauty ideals though. Far from eschewing mainstream cuteness and the female infantilisation that goes with it, most young women like Ando want to be seen as desirably cute, too \u2013 only bigger-sized. They are embracing names such as \u201cmarshmallow girls\u201d, \u201csquishy girls\u201d and \u201cpudgy girls\u201d, and adapting the frills and bows of kawaii street fashion to their own body shapes. Ando says the point is to have fun and show that \u201cconfidence and beauty have nothing to do with size\u201d. The pocchari trend came to the fore in March last year with the launch of La Farfa (the name is an abbreviation of \u201cbutterfly\u201d in Italian). Publisher and editor-in-chief Harumi Kon says she started the magazine because she couldn\u2019t find styles to suit her own larger figure. \u201cMost clothes were too small, and the large clothes were always in boring dark colours or designed to hide your body,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to showcase bright, energetic fashions to make plus-size women shine.\u201d Kon teamed up with popular \u201cchubby\u201d comedian Naomi Watanabe, who had become famous a few years earlier when she performed an outrageous lip-synching impersonation of Beyonc\u00e9. (As in most countries, making people laugh is one area where fat women in Japan can find approval.) Watanabe appeared on the cover of the first issue, which sold out its print run of 50,000 copies, and she has been La Farfa\u2019s cover girl ever since. \u201cWe now sell 100,000 copies per issue and have changed from publishing the magazine twice a year to publishing it bi-monthly,\u201d says Kon.            Kon believes La Farfa\u2019s success is due to its unflinching acceptance of real women\u2019s bodies. For a start, most of the models are amateurs she found through auditioning ordinary women \u2013 there simply weren\u2019t enough professional plus-size models. \u201cAlso, we never give advice about how to look slimmer and we don\u2019t photoshop away rolls of fat, even after swimwear shoots,\u201d says Kon. The magazine uses animal shapes to help women choose clothes for their body type \u2013 pigeon (big chested), penguin (big bottom half) and teddy bear (round in the middle). \u201cThe aim is to help women look pretty and fashionable the way they are, not to give them impossible ideals.\u201d The magazine\u2019s platform also helped Watanabe launch her own plus-size clothing line last April. Punyus (onomatopeia for squishy) has a flagship store in the Shibuya 109 building, Tokyo\u2019s legendary teen fashion hub, selling items such as denim pencil skirts, hats and bags imprinted with fruit and animals, and cable knits in pastel colours. Turning the tables in a beautifully clever way, the shop boasts that it sells some of its most fashionable styles in smaller sizes \u201cso that thin women don\u2019t miss out\u201d. Not everyone in Japan welcomes the pocchari trend. Some critics argue it\u2019s just another way for the fashion industry to exploit women. Others complain that it could enable unhealthy lifestyles and encourage obesity. But Kimie Nakaguchi, 34, a GP in Tokyo, believes the trend is long overdue: 10 years ago, she almost died from using diet pills and other extreme methods to lose weight. (She says she was \u201chusband-hunting\u201d at the time). She is currently writing a book about her experience and the pressures on Japanese women to remain thin. \u201cIn general, the fashion for super-skinniness is far more dangerous to health than being a little overweight,\u201d she says. \u201cMany Japanese women actually eat too little.\u201d Whether that\u2019s true or not, Japan\u2019s low obesity rate doesn\u2019t look set to change. Figures from the health ministry show that, in stark contrast to global patterns, body mass index (BMI) in Japan has been falling steadily for the past 30 years \u2013 people have been getting thinner. The government is also vigilant about preventing unhealthy weight gain. In 2008 it introduced a law stipulating maximum waist sizes for company employees over the age of 40; those who exceed the limits of 33.5in (86cm) for men and 35.4in (90cm) for women must undergo mandatory nutrition and exercise counselling. Nakaguchi says she laughed out loud when she saw the video for La Big 3\u2019s single featuring Ando and her bandmates in bright 1950s-style dresses using ice-cream cones as microphones, and tucking into fried chicken thighs with abandon. \u201cObviously it\u2019s not good to eat too much junk food, but I don\u2019t think the pocchari trend is advocating that. It\u2019s telling women that they don\u2019t need to hide their appetites. It\u2019s telling them to please themselves rather than others,\u201d she says. \u201cThese are messages that many Japanese women, including me, have waited a long time to hear.\u201d @AbiHaworth"}, {"sentences": ["The 27-year-old South African will be 33 by the time of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2020 but it is debatable whether he will be in any shape to compete by then."], "tags": ["Disability sport", "Paralympics", "Rio 2016", "Olympic Games", "Sport", "Reeva Steenkamp shooting"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-21T10:34:23Z", "title": "Oscar Pistorius cannot compete until 2019, IPC confirms", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/21/oscar-pistorius-cannot-compete-2019-international-paralympic-committee", "article": "The International Paralympic Committee has ruled that Oscar Pistorius will not be allowed to return to competition until 2019 after he was sentenced to five years in prison for shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. An IPC spokesman confirmed that Pistorius, the first athlete to compete in both the Olympics and Paralympics in London in 2012, would be banned from the Rio Games even if he had been released on licence by that point. The athlete\u2019s counsel said following sentencing that he could serve as little as 10 months in prison before completing the rest of his sentence under house arrest. But the IPC said that under its rules he would be banned from competition for the full five years unless he appealed and his sentence was formally reduced. His family have said there will not be any appeal. \u201cThe rules state that if someone is given a five-year sentence by a court, they must serve that sentence before returning to competition,\u201d an IPC spokesman told the Guardian. The 27-year-old South African will be 33 by the time of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2020 but it is debatable whether he will be in any shape to compete by then. There will also be a question mark over whether he will be able to travel freely to some countries having been convicted of culpable homicide. The athlete\u2019s future on the track has been the subject of much conjecture throughout his lengthy trial and sentencing. The South African Olympic Committee said in the wake of his conviction that he would be free to compete again once out of prison because its regulations did not bar anyone with a criminal record, a stance the IPC then appeared to endorse. But the IPC president, Sir Philip Craven, then told the Guardian that no decision had been taken and that no decision would be taken until he was formally sentenced. Pistorius became a poster boy for the Paralympic movement in the run-up to London 2012. It is hoped that the conclusion of the high-profile trial will allow the IPC to move on and focus instead on the other stars created by the breakthrough London Games. Privately, there may be some relief that the run-up to the Rio Olympics will not be dominated by a debate over whether Pistorius will compete or not. In a statement, the International Olympic Committee added: \u2018We take note of the court\u2019s decision. This is a human tragedy for the family of Reeva Steenkamp and also for Oscar Pistorius. We hope very much that time will bring comfort to all those concerned but at this stage we have no further comment to make.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["City culture is explored across the genres: hip-hop musical Tokyo Tribe imagines a clashing of tribes in futuristic urban Tokyo, technology and social media takes on a dark side in the Snow White Murder Case and The God of Ramen chronicles the life of a much-loved chef."], "tags": ["Film", "Festivals", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-23T00:50:20Z", "title": "Around the world \u2013 and Australia \u2013\u00a0in five foreign film festivals", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/oct/23/five-foreign-film-festivals-australia", "article": "If cinema transports us to another world, it makes sense that Australia \u2013 occupying its own corner of this one \u2013 hosts such a wide-ranging selection of foreign film festivals. These eclectic programs offer unexpected landscapes, unfamiliar styles of humour and lesser known histories from their countries of origin. And all for a fraction of the price of a round-the-world air ticket.  What\u2019s more, once they land on our shores, most of these programs do the full Aussie tour. Here are five upcoming festivals, our pick of their screenings and the cities you can catch them in across the country. Russian resurrection film festival            The Russian film industry celebrates the 90th anniversary of Mosfilm this year \u2013 Europe\u2019s oldest film studio. It opened in Moscow in 1923 since when it has produced some of the world\u2019s most influential Soviet-era films. The Russian Resurrection festival\u2019s 11th year honours Mosfilm and the history of Russian cinema with six retrospectives alongside 14 new works. Together they showcase a cross-section of Russian society, from a look back at the life of artist Marc Chagall in Chahagall Malevich to accounts of the Soviet Union during World War II, children\u2019s animation, 3D horror, and modern romance, comedy and drama. Opening night film: Vasilisa in Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne; Kitchen in Paris in Perth Showing: Canberra: 28 October-5 November; Sydney: 30 October-9 November; Brisbane: 6-16 November; Perth: 6-12 November; Adelaide: 7-9 November; Melbourne: 13-23 November Jewish international film festival            Of the 49 Israeli and Jewish-themed films in this extensive festival program, 47 are Australian premieres. Festival director Eddie Tamir\u2019s selection comes from France, the US, Israel, Germany, Austria, the UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Bulgaria and the Philippines, providing an expansive look at the spirit of Jewish culture today. Highlights include a range of documentaries about cultural icons, including The Outrageous Sophie Tucker tracing its subject\u2019s dominance of 1920\u2019s flapper culture, Because I was a Painter exploring art made in Nazi concentration camps, and Regarding Susan Sontag, collecting the archival material surrounding the life of the prolific cultural critic. Opening night: Gett, The Trail of Viviane AmsalemClosing night: Above and BeyondShowing: Sydney: 29 October-16 November; Melbourne: 5-23 November; Gold Coast and Perth: 15, 16, 23 November Japanese film festival            What started out as a modest screening of three films is now the biggest Japanese film festival outside Japan, featuring more than 50 titles as well as a series of satellite events. City culture is explored across the genres: hip-hop musical Tokyo Tribe imagines a clashing of tribes in futuristic urban Tokyo, technology and social media takes on a dark side in the Snow White Murder Case and The God of Ramen chronicles the life of a much-loved chef. Anime and manga feature in some of Japan\u2019s most awarded films as well as new releases. In addition, the festival hosts a series of free screenings: JFF Classics draws on the Japan Foundation\u2019s 35mm collection, and JFF Mini takes a smaller program of films to Townsville, Cairns, Hobart, Darwin and Broome. Opening night: Lady MaikoClosing night: Vancouver Asahi in Sydney and Melbourne; A Tale of Samurai Cooking \u2013 A True Love Story in other cities Showing: Brisbane: until 26 October; Perth: 29 October-2 November; Sydney: 13-23 November; Melbourne: 27 November-7 December Emirates British film festival            Relive the revolution with a collection of works that reflect London at a time of significant social change. Along with a world-class collection of contemporary films, the 2014 Emirates British film festival features a retrospective of swinging 60s classics in Six from the 60s. The politics and activism of this era were reflected through a more free-spirited movement in British filmmaking, with playful works that draw on the liberation of pop art, rock music and fashion, from Beatlemania to the miniskirt. The festival also presents a High Tea event to enjoy along with the screening of the documentary When the Queen Came to Town, which recalls the Queen\u2019s 1954 visit to post-war Australia. Opening night: Testament of YouthClosing night: The Imitation Game Showing: Melbourne: 5-26 November; Sydney: 6-26 November: Adelaide: 5-16 November: Perth: 5-16 November: Canberra: 6-23 November; Brisbane: 6-16 November: Byron Bay: 6-16 November Delphi Bank Greek film festival            Greece\u2019s current affairs are as complex as its ancient history. The 21st Delphi bank festival features 24 films that do not shy away from serious themes and unusual ways of expressing them. Documentaries trace the political and economic crises of Greece, and several films explore the darker sides of relationships: Miss Violence is a brutal tale of domestic abuse and Panos H Koutras\u2019 Xenia explores homosexuality and immigrant rights with a bizarre reference to Donnie Darko\u2019s giant rabbits. But it\u2019s not all grim. Lighter films include the crowd-funded romantic comedy Committed and a Bollywood take on the financial crisis in Block 12. In addition to feature films, the fifth Greek-Australian short film festival shows a program of shorts competing for prizes in local and international categories.

Had it been Virgin Atlantic going under however, it would have been front page news. By killing off Little Red quickly rather than letting it die a slow, lingering death, Virgin Group limited the brand damage.  As Robert Kennedy said: \u201cOnly those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly\u201d. Shutting down Little Red fits with Richard Branson\u2019s entrepreneurial reputation and also contributes to the confidence and decisiveness of the Virgin brand. In truth, this failure won\u2019t damage it. In fact, it will tell the world that the brand knows when to stop and is capable of making bold decisions. So just how easy is it to keep your identity across so many different variations? How do these brands measure their success and keep customers loyal? Virgin\u2019s monolithic architecture certainly poses some risks. It uses one name for all of its products and services, meaning that if a problem affects one of those sub-brands, it may affect all of them. However, this strategy also increases marketing efficiency, meaning that one strong sub-brand can lead to the success of another. easyGroup     Staff at entrepreneur Stelios Haji-Ioannou\u2019s latest venture - the easyHotel in west London. Photograph: Sarah Lee/library    Stelios Haji-Ioannou\u2019s easyGroup has successfully launched sub-brands from property to pizza to gyms, and the company is currently expanding into the grocery category. The common denominator of their offering in each sector is value.  Both easyGroup and Virgin inspire brand loyalty by sticking to strong, defined strategies. Apple     iTunes is the common denominator across the Apple range. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images    The success of Apple\u2019s brand extensions is proof that if you can make an emotional connection with your customer it gives you a greater freedom to extend your brand. With every new product that Apple makes, be it computers, laptops, phones or music players, the common denominator is iTunes. iTunes is probably the most important product in their portfolio as it moves seamlessly across its products, is easy to use and Apple\u2019s customers are already familiar with it. Apple ensures that its customers are comfortable, which helps to reduce the risk of failure and allowing it to build on its recognition and reputation. Little wonder that on 20 October, Apple said its quarterly profit had risen by 13%, and it had sold 39.3m iPhones in the period ended 27 September, marking a 16% increase from 33.8m units in the previous year. Less successful ventures     Sir Richard Branson hands out free cans of Virgin Cola in downtown Tokyo. Sales of the brand lost fizz against the might of Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Photograph: EPA    The right extension should fit with the existing brand identity. If the new product doesn\u2019t fit, the extension can be seen as confusing and could weaken the existing brand. Bic, known for its disposable razors and pens, decided to move into disposable underwear. Needless to say the brand bombed, as the customer\u2019s association with Bic wasn\u2019t flexible enough to withstand the move into underwear. Brand extensions must be a logical fit with consumer\u2019s expectations. Vespa Scooters has just announced that they are launching a new range of fragrances for men and women. Whilst their scooters are iconic I have a feeling the fragrances won\u2019t be. Let\u2019s not forget Heineken\u2019s move into shoes and Harley Davidson\u2019s cake decorating kit. The critical factor in extending is that the distinctive product owned by the brand fits seamlessly in its new category. So while the Virgin Group has had a number of failures, such as Virgin Cola and Virgin Brides, the crash of Little Red hasn\u2019t affected the strength of the Virgin brand or its reputation, but rather enhanced its decisiveness and boldness. Virgin\u2019s common denominator between brands is its unconventional approach to marketing and its \u2018flying in the face of ordinary\u2019 customer service. And with Branson at the helm, a man known for his (extremely calculated) risk-taking, the Virgin name will continue to fly.

He says people often ask him if he\u2019s crazy. \u201c\u2018Hong Kong is supposed to be bright,\u2019 they say. \u2018Why are you even talking about light being some kind of pollution?\u2019\u201d  This is a city that is famous for its nightscape: neon signs advertising market stalls, pawn shops and steakhouses; illuminated skyscrapers; swanky malls that stay open \u2013 and stay lit \u2013 well into the night. \u201cWhen I walk at night around some of these commercial centres, it\u2019s so bright you almost want to wear your sunglasses,\u201d Pun says. Indeed, in our collective imaginations, cities are meant to be bright. But as studies begin to show that too much light can be detrimental to health, and fewer of us are able to see the stars when we look up, are cities getting too bright for our own good? Hong Kong isn\u2019t alone in celebrating light. Paris is still known as the City of Light; only slightly less glamorous Blackpool relies for tourism on its annual illuminations, when more than 1 million bulbs light a distance of 10km.           Video: This cloud-free nighttime view of our planet seen from space was assembled by Nasa from images captured by the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Satellite    This celebration of artificial lighting is perhaps unsurprising, given how recently electric streetlights became the norm. It\u2019s easy to forget that being bathed in light is a relatively modern phenomenon. Although electric streetlights first began appearing in European capitals in the mid-1800s, widespread street lighting did not become common until well into the 20th century. It soon became a clear view of the night sky that was uncommon. Hong Kong is now often touted as the most light polluted city in the world \u2013 a view supported by a recent study from Pun and his department, Hong Kong Night Sky Brightness Monitoring Network (NSN), which measured so-called \u201cnight sky brightness\u201d.  \u201cWe set up about 18 stations around the city, in all sorts of living environments \u2013 from the commercial urban centre, to more residential neighbourhoods, to relatively rural areas,\u201d he explains. Then they compared the levels of light to the standard provided by the International Astronomical Union, which states how bright the sky would be without artificial light. In the most-lit areas, it was 1,000 times brighter. \u201cSimilar studies in major capitals like Berlin and Vienna,\u201d says Pun, \u201cwould find something more of the order of 100 to 200 times brighter.\u201d      Europe at night from Space. Photograph: SPL/Barcroft Media    But with light pollution studies still in their infancy, and without any strict international standards on how to quantify the extent of light pollution, it\u2019s hard to say for sure whether Hong Kong is the most light-polluted city. Other candidates that are often cited by those with the best view \u2013 astronauts \u2013 include Las Vegas, Tokyo, Seoul and New York. And Hong Kong, like in many cities around the world, is proud of its illuminated city. \u201cThe brighter the better,\u201d Pun explains, mimicking a chirpy toothpaste ad. \u201cBrighter means more prosperous. We have a nickname for Hong Kong: the Pearl of the Orient. So I suppose a lot of people take this actually as a badge of pride without rethinking what all this brightness means.\u201d That can include health problems. \u201cThere\u2019s a cascade of changes to our physiology that are associated with light exposure at night,\u201d says Steven Lockley, a neuroscientist and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He has looked at the impact of light on human physiology, including on alertness, sleep, and melatonin levels.   Because humans evolved in a 24-hour light/dark cycle known as the circadian clock, any light after dusk is \u201cunnatural\u201d, Lockley says. When we are exposed to light after dusk, \u201cour daytime physiology is triggered and our brains become more alert, our heart rates go up, as does our temperature, and production of the hormone melatonin is suppressed\u201d.  Has the way city dwellers live, removed from natural light patterns, confused our bodies? \u201cNot so much confused as shifted: we\u2019ve been shifted later,\u201d Lockley says. \u201cWhat happens when people go camping? If you don\u2019t have sources of electric light, then you go to bed earlier, shortly after the sun\u2019s gone down, and you sleep for longer.\u201d Every day we don\u2019t go to bed at dusk, we experience what Lockley calls \u201cmini jetlag\u201d. His colleague, Ken Wright at the University of Colorado in Boulder, conducted an experiment on camping. Wright found that for campers, midnight was the middle of the night: living in brightly lit cities has artificially lengthened our days. \u201cWe go to bed later, we don\u2019t sleep as long, and we don\u2019t know of the long-term health impact of changing,\u201d he says.     Las Vegas at night. Photograph: Corbis    There have been studies about how changes in circadian rhythms \u2013 which may be explained by exposure to light at night \u2013 can have an impact on humans. Studies of shiftworkers found that circadian disruption is \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d; female nightworkers, for instance, were found to have a higher risk of breast cancer than women who do not work at night. \u201cAs a society we need to think, do we really need some of these amenities that are putting light pollution into the environment?\u201d Lockley says. \u201cDo we need 24/7 garages, do we need 24/7 supermarkets, do we need 24/7 TV? It was only in 1997 that the BBC turned off and there was the national anthem and we all went to bed.\u201d  The International Dark Sky Association is an organisation of astronomers that aims to teach how to preserve the night sky. Member Scott Kardel says he believes in balance: \u201cWhile we need certain amounts of light at night for safety, commerce and more, we also need to be more careful about how much light we use, where we use it and for how long.\u201d But at a more abstract level, Kardel also believes that \u201chaving bright skies takes something away from us. All of our ancestors had star-filled skies that inspired countless people in art, literature, religion, science and philosophy.\u201d It might not be plausible to put the metropolis to bed at dusk, but cities can mitigate some of the worst light pollution. \u201cProper outdoor lighting,\u201d says Kardel, \u201cconserves energy, reduces glare\u201d and cuts back on so-called light trespass, for example when your neighbour\u2019s bedroom light bleeds into your sitting room. Pun also suggests limiting the number of light installations and their hours of operation, and controlling the distance between lights and living environments. \u201cIt\u2019s a particularly big problem in Hong Kong because it\u2019s a very densely populated city,\u201d he says. Any change, he also points out, would have to be a community effort that involves not just business but government.  \u201cWhile a great many cities do have laws about light pollution or light trespass, they are still in the minority,\u201d Kardel says. \u201cThe number of cities adopting light pollution regulations is growing, but they mostly seem to be appearing in smaller towns where the problem isn\u2019t as great as it is in the larger cities.\u201d     The Empire State Building is seen lit up before Earth Hour in New York, during which lights were turned off for one hour to show support for renewable energy. Photograph: Eric Thayer/Reuters    Los Angeles, however, is one megacity that has been trying to scrape back some of its nighttime darkness. Not long ago a sprawl of apricot-coloured street lights, LA has since undergone one of the largest LED streetlight replacement projects in the world. LEDs are proving a popular choice for cities wanting to save on lighting costs: they are being rolled out in New York, Copenhagen and Shanghai. They\u2019re not a panacea. \u201cLEDs offer promise and peril,\u201d Kardel says. \u201cThey tend to be very directional in nature, which makes it easier to direct light where it is needed. And they are much better suited than older lighting technologies for integrating with dimming or motion-sensing technologies.\u201d But most energy-efficient LEDs contain a significant amount of blue in their spectrum. \u201cAnd blue disproportionately brightens the night sky.\u201d Lockley thinks LEDS are the \u201cproblem, but also the solution: they allow much more sophisticated lighting systems.\u201d The blueness can be fixed, he says. \u201cIt is possible to create LED light with multiple colours \u2013 you can alter the colours for the right time of day and the right application.\u201d  \u201cWe might not quite be at the point where cities are putting in those types of tuneable street lamps,\u201d he adds. But many communities in the UK have either adopted or trialled \u201cpart night lighting\u201d, switching off the lights where they\u2019re not needed or lowering illumination levels for part of the night. Motion-sensing technologies are being tested in the Netherlands and Ireland. At the centre of this shift is a change in the attitudes of city residents and their governments. In Hong Kong, until only a few years ago the government avoided even using the term \u201clight pollution\u201d, says Pun. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even admit such a thing exists. If you call it something else, like \u2018light nuisance\u2019, then I guess it will make life a little easier. Even though it seems like a gloomy situation, no pun intended, I do see a change of mindset.\u201d  So what about Hong Kong\u2019s brand \u2013 built at least in part on its reputation as a metropolis literally buzzing with electricity? \u201cAbout 100 years ago in London, we\u2019d be talking about all this soot from the factories nearby, and the poor air quality of the city,\u201d Pun says. \u201cAnd we move on.\u201d Tips for reducing your light pollution \u2022 It\u2019s an obvious one, but switch off any lights you are not using. \u2022 Ensure indoor and outdoor lighting is directed at what you\u2019re trying to light and that it\u2019s shaded. Table and floor lamps are better for this than overhead lights. \u2022 Use low-watt lightbulbs \u2013 you\u2019ll save on bills and reduce glare. \u2022 Install dimmer switches so you can alter brightness to suit ambient light. \u2022 Use motion sensors or timers so outdoor lights are only on when they need to be. \u2022 Install thick curtains or blinds to minimise light escaping your home at night. \u2022 Ask your local councillor to get street lamps fitted with directional, low energy lights \u2013 after all, residential areas don\u2019t need to be lit up like football pitches 24 hours a day.

Bach, who succeeded Jacques Rogge as president last year, said that the process would be made cheaper and involve more cooperation with bidders. He said the proposals, among 40 that form part of his Olympic Agenda 2020 overhaul that will be voted on at a special IOC congress in December, would turn \u201cthe bidding procedure more into an invitation, a discussion, a partnership with the IOC rather than just an application for a tender\u201d. Bach added: \u201cWe want to make an effort to reduce the cost of bidding and make it even clearer to bidding cities what from the point of view of the IOC is requested and what may be their own initiative on top of that.\u201d The move comes in the wake of criticism of the IOC over the race for the 2022 Winter Olympics. After Oslo pulled out amid much media criticism of the IOC\u2019s demands, there are just two bidders remaining \u2013 Beijing and Almaty. But following a two-day executive board meeting in Montreux Bach said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the \u201cstrong interest\u201d in bidding for the 2024 summer Games. He said the proposed changes had been part of his election manifesto and were not a response to the criticism that followed Oslo\u2019s decision. The US is expected to return to the table for the 2024 Games after missing out in humiliating fashion with Chicago\u2019s bid for the 2016 Olympics, while Germany, France and Argentina are also considering bids. Bach said that the prospect of IOC members touring the bidding cities, abandoned as part of the reforms that followed the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, would not be among the changes debated in December. He also confirmed plans for a global TV channel to maintain interest in Olympic sports between Games, promising further details if it was approved in December. The IOC session in Monaco will also debate proposed changes to the programme, which could involve reducing the number of disciplines in order to make way for new sports. \u201cWe have deliberately not addressed specific sports or the number of sports because we feel that this is about the principle,\u201d said Bach. \u201cWe don\u2019t make this effort for one particular sport, we do it to make more flexibility.\u201d Bach added that the door remained open for Tokyo 2020 organisers to come to the IOC and discuss possible alterations to the sports on offer, raising the possibility that baseball or squash could still be added to the programme.

Yoichi Miyazawa had already faced embarrassment on Thursday when it was revealed that members of his staff had claimed expenses for a visit to a bondage bar. On Friday, Miyazawa denied there was any conflict of interest over his shares in Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), saying he had decided to place them in a trust rather than sell them. Miyazawa was appointed only days ago after his predecessor, Yuko Obuchi, resigned over a political funding scandal involving her support groups. Hours after Obuchi quit, the justice minister, Midori Matsushima, resigned amid claims that she had violated election laws by distributing paper fans bearing her image to constituents. The double resignation, combined with the furore over Miyazawa\u2019s shares, have dealt a significant blow to the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, as he nears a decision on an unpopular tax rise and attempts to win public support for the restart of a small number of nuclear reactors. Miyazawa attempted to brush off criticism of his ownership of 600 Tepco shares \u2013 worth more than $1,800 \u2013 which he reportedly bought before the March 2011 triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi. Japan\u2019s remaining nuclear reactors were switched off after the disaster. \u201cKeeping [the shares] means I\u2019m supporting Tepco as the minister in charge,\u201d Miyazawa told reporters. Senior colleagues closed ranks around the embattled minister. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any problem at all,\u201d the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said. \u201cIf someone is sworn in as a minister, the rules say he or she should refrain from trading shares during their term and entrust those shares to a trust bank \u2026 minister Miyazawa has already started on that process,\u201d he added. Miyazawa said he had spoken to the staff who had claimed \u00a518,230 in expenses for a 2010 visit to a Hiroshima sex bar, where male customers pay to whip tied female employees. Miyazawa stressed that he had not visited the bar. \u201cI have scolded my people and ordered them to pay back the cost\u201d of the visit, he said. Abe had hoped that by acting quickly over the alleged spending irregularities involving Obuchi and Matsushima he could quickly regain the political momentum that saw his first cabinet last almost two years without a reshuffle or resignation. Instead, he is confronting uncomfortable reminders of his first term as prime minister, from late 2006, which ended after just a year. Four of his ministers resigned, and one killed himself. Atsuo Ito, a political analyst, said even if the share controversy did not force Miyazawa out, it was a distraction. \u201cIt takes energy away from the administration\u2019s difficult policies, such as raising the sales tax and restarting nuclear reactors,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThe ruling party wants to avoid further resignations.

Just as gas lamps were replaced with electric streetlights, so neons are being replaced with LEDs. And with them, the way our cities look in movies, as in real life, is morphing. Christopher Doyle\u2019s cinematography in the 1980s and 1990s for Wong Kar-Wai, including Fallen Angels and Happy Together, would look completely different had it not been for the electric glare of neon \u2013 but as cities set out to modernise lighting systems, reduce some of that city glare and cut municipal electricity bills, the films of Doyle and others will become visual archives of how our cities used to glow.  Here are five films in which a city\u2019s lights are almost a character in their own right. What have we missed? Tell us your picks (and don\u2019t say Bright Lights, Big City). Los Angeles in Collateral (2004) Cinematographers: Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron            The eerie green lighting of Los Angeles in Michael Mann\u2019s 2004 Collateral is suitably clinical. As Tom Cruise the contract killer and Jamie Foxx the hapless taxi driver move around the city, the latter coerced into the former\u2019s night-time business, that sickly hue accompanies them. Now that LA\u2019s yellow sodium streetlights have been replaced with LEDs, however, it means the end for that on-screen version of the Big Orange. Shot through HD cameras, the lights gave the film its glow \u2013 an effect Mann had actively sought in moving the shoot from New York. New York in Taxi Driver (1976) Cinematographer: Michael Chapman            Shot when Manhattan was simultaneously experiencing both a heatwave and a rubbish strike, this 1976 Scorsese film uses lighting to lead our eyes to follow those of Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, who plots to purge the city of the peep shows, the prostitutes, the \u201canimals\u201d that come out at night \u2013 the \u201cwhores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal\u201d.  As Bickle drives through the seedy streets in his taxi, the lights of the city\u2019s adult movie theatres, bars, tunnels and diners seep through the car\u2019s windows and on to his face. The moral degradation finds him even in his cab. But as with LA, the lights of New York are undergoing a massive retrofit that will alter the look of the city and firmly entrench Taxi Driver as a particularly 20th century film. Bangkok in Only God Forgives (2013) Cinematographer: Larry Smith             The lighting in this Nicolas Winding Refn film set in Bangkok is used with so much precision that it could almost have been painted on. The Thai capital looks like a smorgasbord of sin. Inside the hotels, the Muay Thai boxing club, the bars and clubs, the lights create an atmosphere of menace and frenzy. Peter Bradshaw summed up that crimson world: \u201ca place of deep-sea unreality in which you need to breathe through special gills \u2013 and through which the action swims at about 90% of normal speed through to its chilling conclusion. It is a kind of hallucinated tragi-exploitation shocker, an enriched uranium cake of pulp with a neon sheen.\u201d Whether you agree with Bradshaw\u2019s five-star review \u2013 and many have argued that the film priorities style over substance \u2013 the lighting is undoubtedly spectacular. Tokyo in Enter the Void (2009) Cinematographer: Beno\u00eet Debie            Gaspar Noe\u2019s psychedelic headfuck of a film follows a dead drug dealer\u2019s restless spirit as it floats through (and above) a lurid Tokyo nightscape. The film sets out to shock, and the relentless strobes and graphic hallucinatory sex scenes certainly knock your socks off. But after all the throbbing beats and freaky shagging are over, it is Noe\u2019s neon reimagining of Tokyo that remains.  Vienna in The Third Man (1949) Cinematographer: Robert Krasker            No rundown of cinematic street lighting could omit Carol Reed\u2019s classic thriller. Flickering shadows follow the befuddled Holly Martins as he searches the city\u2019s postwar warrens for a witness to the death of his old friend Harry Lime \u2013 a search that takes him to some spectacularly lit sewers. It\u2019s the kind of lighting you could never replicate in the city today: The Third Man was filmed, in part, by actual Vienna lamplight. Water was reportedly poured over the city\u2019s cobblestones to achieve that sinister gleam.

With the Airports Commission preparing to lay out its evaluation of the choice for one extra runway at either Heathrow or Gatwick for public consultation, Branson said it had to be Heathrow: \u201cWe need brave politicians, who bite the bullet and say we need two new runways at Heathrow, and maybe one at Gatwick too.\u201d Branson, whose airline uses both London airports, said there was a danger that people would think building a runway at Gatwick alone could solve the aviation capacity problem. \u201cIf you talk to politicians individually they know what has to happen, but if they feel they are going to lose votes they aren\u2019t going to make the right decision or the tough decision.\u201d Branson blamed slot constraints at Heathrow for Virgin\u2019s decision to retrench its network and withdraw from Tokyo, Mumbai and Cape Town in favour of more profitable transatlantic routes. \u201cIf we want to do a new route we have to close a current route. We have no choice. That\u2019s unlike anywhere else in the world. That will continue until a new runway or two is built at Heathrow. \u201cWe can\u2019t fly to South America or a whole lot of places we\u2019d like to fly to. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to make money of a route out of Gatwick when your major competitor has got a slot at Heathrow, because business people prefer Heathrow and you\u2019ve only got to lose half a percent market share to be lossmaking rather than profitmaking. Virgin Atlantic\u2019s chief executive Craig Kreeger said expanding Heathrow was \u201ca better solution in the long run for the UK\u201d even though Virgin could suffer, depending how slots were allocated. \u201cI could think of a lot of scenarios in which it\u2019s bad for Virgin. But I do really believe it\u2019s right for the UK.\u201d Both men were speaking in Atlanta at the inaugural flight of both the new route and the airline\u2019s first 787 Dreamliner, a quieter and more fuel-efficient plane than its existing aircraft. Virgin announced it has now confirmed all the options it had to buy 787-9s from Boeing, making a total of 21 planes. It will be replacing 60% of its fleet with the Dreamliners by 2018, with revamped seating and entertainment. Kreeger said: \u201cIt is a major symbolic and real step into the future for our airline. For Virgin Atlantic the experience our customers have is what brings people back, not our network.\u201d However, he said the route to Atlanta, the base of its US partner airline Delta, would give Virgin passengers unprecedented access to 160 destinations in the US. \u201cIt means we can offer lots of connecting opportunities to UK customers to fly via a Delta hub, but get there on a Virgin plane.\u201d Next steps in the joint venture, a response to the market domination of the transatlantic routes by a similar British Airways-American Airlines partnership, will see Virgin start a second daily flight to Atlanta in March. Delta meanwhile is taking over one of Virgin\u2019s services between Los Angeles and Heathrow. Despite the importance of the joint venture to Virgin\u2019s fortunes, Branson rejected recent jibes from Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways\u2019 owners IAG, that Virgin is controlled by Delta. He said: \u201cOne might as well say BA is BA-American. The fact is I own 51% of the company, I will never cede control in my life. We\u2019re firmly in control but we\u2019re delighted to have Delta as a partner.\u201d He said competition with British Airways was now \u201cslightly more fun ... some might argue slightly childish banter, below-the-belt humour from Willie.\u201d He said he \u201cvery much hoped\u201d that the resolution to the famous knee-in-the-groin bet with Walsh over Virgin\u2019s future would take place in 2017. \u201cWe\u2019re counting the days down and he\u2019d better get a strong pair of trousers if he wants to protect his, er, willy.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["There are dress-up-friendly events like a Vampire\u2019s Ball and an 1880s Night, while the vampire-slanted global selection includes self-explanatory oddities such as Dracula In Pakistan and Gyo: Tokyo Fish Attack."], "tags": ["Horror", "Film", "Culture", "Halloween", "Thriller", "Secret Cinema"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-25T05:00:20Z", "title": "Halloween cinema special", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/25/halloween-cinema-special", "article": "Like your horror to include deadly viruses, merciless sadists and barbaric warmongers?

As the genre continues to commodify itself faster than you can say Duke Dumont, these events can often feel tediously hetero and geezered out, a million miles away from house music\u2019s roots in queer club culture, when clubs were spaces for activism and social change as well as escapism. That\u2019s the bone that transgender DJ and producer Terre Thaemlitz has to pick with today\u2019s house music boom. \u201cIt seems that the queer factor of today\u2019s house events is really low,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the US and it\u2019s a straight, white club then it\u2019s just a fucking nightmare. These events are the celebration grounds for heteronormativity. There is a historic connection between queerness and deep house, and also things like transgenderism and vogue, that, to me, was really important \u2013 and it\u2019s utterly absent.\u201d It\u2019s not just about the music having broader appeal, either: \u201cIt has to do with this cultural shift away from the necessity to actually have clubs function as safe spaces for different types of sexual enactment.\u201d For Thaemlitz, the common view of the dance music scene as an apolitical, hedonistic space is mistaken. Born in 1968, she moved from Missouri to New York in the 80s to study fine art but became a DJ immersed in the queer house scene, where she saw first-hand how clubbing stemmed from a place of frustration and struggle. Her outlook was shaped at NYC transsexual hangout Sallys II, where she became a resident, and which served a purpose beyond the throb of the dancefloor. It was a \u201csite of education, where people could share information about their transitioning experiences. There were times when you really learned things on a political level, on a social level \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s interesting,\u201d she explains. \u201cMusic is usually one of the least interesting things about clubs.\u201d     Midtown 120 Blues   Thaemlitz is something of a true renegade in modern club culture. She tackles themes that are usually off limits in electronic music, eschewing conventional notions of \u2018having the night of your life\u2019 and instead confronting issues of gender, sexuality, race and class, often in lipstick and four-inch heels. Nineteen albums and multifarious monikers into her 20-year career, she\u2019s constructed a political discourse that\u2019s hard to find anywhere else in dance music today. Her 1995 album Soil, for example, features an account of domestic abuse over an electroacoustic soundtrack, while reflections on concerns such as queer identity and acceptance weave through Queerifications &amp; Ruins, a clubbier 2013 remix compilation. And then there\u2019s her 2012 album, Soulnessless, featuring one single track of almost 30 hours in length, formatted to an SD card and accompanied by a 165-page booklet of liner notes. This is what she calls \u201cculture jamming\u201d, her attempt to \u201cdisrupt passive listening\u201d. Julio Bashmore, it is not. Much of the interest in Thaemlitz as a dance music outsider, though, froths around Midtown 120 Blues, her 2009 album under her deep house alias DJ Sprinkles. It was respected dance music website Resident Advisor\u2019s record of the year and was re-released this May. Instead of hooks, there\u2019s a lengthy opening voiceover, which questions the accepted notion of what house is (\u201cthe answer is always some greeting card bullshit about life, love, happiness\u2026\u201d) and goes on to highlight the contexts from which deep house emerged in 1970s and 80s New York, be they transgendered sex work, drug and alcohol addiction, queer-bashing or the HIV crisis. It also takes aim at how nostalgia romanticises early house DJs\u2019 influence when many of them, Thaemlitz included, weren\u2019t that well known at the time. Not that her willingness to highlight the dance industry\u2019s failings has stopped the number of her DJ bookings from rising steadily.

The gender lines are blurred \u2013Thaemlitz turns up for our interview wearing \u201cboy drag\u201d and suggests that, if pronouns really have to be used, Terre is \u201cshe\u201d and Sprinkles is \u201che\u201d. A fiercely passionate talker, an hour with Thaemlitz is like having a sociology lecture where you can\u2019t fall asleep at the back of the class. My transcript reads like a thesis with sprawling ideas about the mainstreamness of LGBT politics, the complexity of \u201cclosets\u201d and the dangers of being marketed as an \u201celusive artist\u201d, most of which she has written about at great length in essays on her personal website.

Its successful UK business was the cash machine that reliably paid out profits measured in the billions to bankroll expansion around the world. But that old model is irreparably broken: the supermarket giant revealed last week that group pre-tax profits for the first six months of this year were almost completely wiped out by penance for past accounting sins and the collapsing profitability of the ailing UK chain. But with the results out of the way, and the first chapter of what promises to be a long-running accounting inquiry complete, new boss Dave Lewis feels it is now safe to leave the country, at least for a couple of days, to inspect his dominion. Having grounded the company fleet of corporate jets permanently, he will join hoi polloi on a gruelling long-haul flight to the Far East. He will have a lot to think about en route: sales are falling in 80% of the countries where Tesco has stores. His first ports of call \u2013 Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea \u2013 were once the jewels in Tesco\u2019s overseas crown, but even they are struggling as political and economic pressures dent sales. Closer to home in Ireland, previously the retailer\u2019s most successful European market, sales are in freefall. Like-for-likes are down a staggering 7.3% at the last count as German discounters Aldi and Lidl and homegrown rivals such as Dunnes and Musgrave eat Tesco\u2019s breakfast, lunch and dinner. Rather than flicking through the in-flight movie channels, Lewis will need to spend his travel time coming up with a battle plan. He also needs to decide how best to raise the cash the group needs to fight a price war at home and alleviate the financial squeeze on its balance sheet. Last week\u2019s first-half results \u2013 delayed by three weeks to allow external accountants to get to the bottom of the hole in profits created by the misbooking of supplier payments \u2013 made grim reading. Pre-tax profits crashed 92% to \u00a3112m on the back of more than \u00a3500m of financial one-offs. In the UK, trading profits more than halved to \u00a3499m while in Asia they were down 17% at \u00a3260m. Summing up the picture, Lewis was frank: \u201cI think relative to the market, we\u2019ve not been as competitive as I would have liked us to be.\u201d In the UK alone, BESI Research analyst Rickin Thakrar says that although its prices have now moved into line with major rivals such as Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s, it is still 38% more expensive than Aldi. Lewis has said that everything is up for review and has thus far refused to rule out a major asset sale \u2013 or even a rights issue further down the line \u2013 to get Tesco\u2019s house in order, telling the City: \u201cWe think that there are significant opportunities for us to extract value from the business that we have \u2013 either from self-help, in terms of cost cuts, or when we review the portfolio against whatever strategy we decide.\u201d     A Tesco Lotus store in Bangkok. Photograph: Pornchai Kittiwongsakul/EPA    Analysts think Tesco\u2019s Asian arm, which includes the successful South Korean chain Home Plus, could be worth as much as \u00a39bn, but others point to less drastic solutions such as the sale of Dunnhumby, the data mining firm behind Clubcard, or hiving off smaller interests such as the Dobbies garden centre chain, to return to its roots as a straightforward supermarket group. So far Lewis has only committed to a domestic cost-cutting drive, starting with its 32 head office buildings, so it can invest more in shopfloor staff. It turns out the accounting scandal \u2013 which revealed the estimate of first-half profits Tesco gave the City back in August had been artificially inflated by \u00a3263m \u2013 was just the tip of the iceberg that the previous management team left for him to negotiate. \u201cIt all stems from the previous management team [led by Philip Clarke] \u2026 they were not brave enough to tell the City the truth,\u201d says one senior supermarket executive. \u201cThey could have gone on the record and said consumers were being hit hard and they needed to invest in the shopping trip to protect sales. It would have hit profits but would have been the right thing to do for the long term.\u201d A trip across the Irish Sea provides a frightening case study of how Tesco has taken its eye off the ball. While in the UK it has four similar rivals to contend with, in Ireland there is only one retailer of its type \u2013 Tesco itself. But it is still being outsmarted by Aldi, Lidl and domestic chains such as Musgrave\u2019s SuperValu. \u201cIn Ireland you have got the rise of the discounters and two strong local players pointing out that Tesco is a British company in trouble,\u201d says Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. \u201cAldi and Lidl are in a big groove, with a combined market share of 19% in Ireland versus 8% in the UK.\u201d Lewis will also need to check out Tesco\u2019s supermarkets in Poland and Hungary, which are also finding life tough as the discounters make their presence felt. \u201cCentral Europe has been awful for a while,\u201d says Black. \u201cThe economies are very weak and the business is hypermarket-based, which is a square peg in a round hole. \u201cThe days of Tesco being a global retailer in Leahy\u2019s vision have gone but its European and Asian businesses together are more profitable than Sainsbury\u2019s and do not require as much capital as they used to, which is an important part as to why we still think Tesco is in control of its own destiny.\u201d Last week Lewis made it clear there was no \u201cbig bang\u201d presentation on the horizon where he would set out his stall to save Tesco. PowerPoint talks give too much commercially sensitive information to rivals, he argued, although the fall in the share price suggests his secretive approach has done little so far to reassure nervous investors who have already watched the value of their shareholdings halve this year. After his first formal outing, the jury is still out on Tesco\u2019s new management team. Analysts and industry watchers say it is too soon to judge the mettle of Lewis and new finance director Alan Stewart, whose tenure can still be measured in weeks. \u201cI think you have got to give Lewis some leeway,\u201d says the supermarket insider. \u201cHe\u2019s been dealt a shit hand and has played it as well as he could.\u201d     A branch of Irish supermarket chain SuperValu in Dublin. Photograph: Sam Boal/Photocall Ireland for the Observer    CHAIRMAN WANTED: MUST ENJOY A CHALLENGE Headhunters are racing to find a replacement for Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent after the former civil servant announced his resignation on Thursday. The ideal candidate would be a seasoned retailer, with exemplary boardroom skills, willing to take on what is fast becoming the mother of all turnaround challenges. He or she will work alongside Dave Lewis, the new chief executive, who has had little time to work on a new strategy for the retailer in his two months in the job since uncovering a \u00a3263m accounting scandal. One leading recruiter said: \u201cPreferably the new chairman should have retail experience, because the new chief executive doesn\u2019t. That experience could be in a non-executive context as long as they have had significant exposure to the retail market. They have also got to be highly respected in the City.\u201d So who might the headhunters place on their list? Archie Norman is the lead candidate. The 60-year-old has been chairman of ITV since 2010 and a non-executive director of Australian supermarket Coles since 2007. The consummate retailer, Norman rejuvenated Asda, sold it to Walmart, then served as Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells for eight years. A former McKinsey management consultant, He was brought into Coles to help rejuvenate it, and may not be interested in another big turnaround job \u2013 he\u2019s already been there. Sir Ian Cheshire, outgoing boss of B&amp;Q Kingfisher, is another retailer with a track record of taking on troubled firms. During his seven years at the DIY business he cut costs, axed the dividend to preserve cash and cut back its debt. He is popular in the City, but at 55 Cheshire is thought to have his eye on another chief executive\u2019s job rather than a chairmanship. John Gildersleeve joined Tesco in 1965 aged 19, then rose through the ranks to sit on the board for 20 years before retiring in 2004. Since then he has been chairman of tobacco company Gallaher, music company EMI and fashion retailer New Look and as well as Carphone Warehouse. He is now deputy chairman of Carphone Warehouse\u2019s offshoot Talk Talk. He is thought to be keen on the Tesco job, but to some he is too controversial a figure to chair Tesco. \u201cVery outspoken\u201d was the view of one source. Richard Cousins, a newly appointed non-exec at Tesco, is already been cited as a candidate. Cousins is not a retailer, but is chief executive of giant caterer Compass, which employs 470,000 staff. He took that job in 2006 \u2013 when the business was in the mire \u2013 and would have to quit if the chairmanship did appeal. John Allan, chairman of Dixons Retail at the time of its merger with Carphone Warehouse, may also get a mention. Now deputy chairman of the enlarged retailer, he is highly rated and has sat on boards including Deutsche Post and Samsonite. Former banker and trade minister Lord (Mervyn) Davies is not a retailer, but one of the great and good who has served on the Tesco board. He wrote a government report on getting more women into the boardroom and likes big challenges.

The counter-intuitive finding is the result of climate change melting the Arctic ice cap and causing new wind patterns that push freezing air and snow southwards. Severe winters over the last decade have been associated with those years in which the melting of Arctic sea ice was greatest. But the new work is the most comprehensive computer modelling study to date and indicates the frozen winters are being caused by climate change, not simply by natural variations in weather. \u201cThe origin of frequent Eurasian severe winters is global warming,\u201d said Prof Masato Mori, at the University of Tokyo, who led the new research. Climate change is heating the Arctic much faster than lower latitudes and the discovery that the chances of severe winters has already doubled shows that the impacts of global warming are not only a future threat. Melting Arctic ice has also been implicated in recent wet summers in the UK. The new research, published in Nature Geoscience, shows that the increased risk of icy winters will persist for the next few decades. But beyond that continued global warming overwhelms the colder winter weather. The Arctic is expected to be ice-free in late summer by the 2030s, halting the changes to wind patterns, while climate change will continue to increase average temperatures.       \u201cThe agreement between observations in the real world and these computer models is very important in giving us more confidence that this [doubled risk of severe winters] is a real effect,\u201d said Prof Adam Scaife, a climate change expert at the UK Met Office and not part of the research team. \u201cThe balance of evidence suggests this is real.\u201d Dr Colin Summerhayes, at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, UK, said: \u201cThis counterintuitive effect of the global warming that led to the sea ice decline in the first place makes some people think that global warming has stopped. It has not. Although average surface warming has been slower since 2000, the Arctic has gone on warming rapidly throughout this time.\u201d The melting of sea ice influences Eurasian winters because the open ocean is darker than ice and absorbs more heat. This in turn warms the air above and weakens the high-level winds called the polar vortex. This causes meanders in the jet stream to become stuck in place. This \u201cblocking\u201d pattern pulls freezing air southwards out of the Arctic and, because it is stuck, the resulting severe weather can last for long periods. Climate scientists have warned for many years that global warming is not simply leading to a slow, gradual rise in temperature. Instead, it is putting more energy into the climate system which drives more frequent extreme events. Deadly heatwaves in Europe and Australia have already been shown to be many times more likely because of global warming, while some floods were made twice as likely by climate change as long ago as 2000. \u201cAnnual average global temperatures continue to rise, but the distribution of temperature through the year is giving us more extremes, which is highly damaging to food production,\u201d said Prof Peter Wadhams at the University of Cambridge. \u201cAs ice continues to retreat, we can expect these weather extremes to continue to occur and maybe worsen.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Today, 35 million children have visited a KidZania in cities as diverse as Mumbai, Tokyo, Cairo, Istanbul, Lisbon and Seoul."], "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Activities for children", "Westfield", "Life and style", "Culture", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-26T19:00:05Z", "title": "KidZania: the mini-city where children are in charge", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/26/kidzania-westfield-london", "article": "\u2018It\u2019s a game-changer,\u201d says Joel Cadbury, the chocolate heir and former owner of the Groucho Club. This may be something of an understatement. Cadbury is the chairman of KidZania, a \u00a320m mini-city currently being built above the Marks &amp; Spencer in west London\u2019s vast Westfield shopping mall. KidZania will be two-thirds the scale of reality and will consist of a 75,000sq ft role-playing theme park for kids aged four to 14. It will include airport, A&amp;E, police station, sports stadium, theatre, shops, university, bank, sushi and pizza concessions. It will even have its own newspaper, passports and currency. Most strikingly, it will also feature a sort of holding pen for parents. It\u2019s certainly a game-changer for children\u2019s entertainment, but it may also be one for education. Instead of tranquilising kids with video games, or suckering them with rollercoasters in the traditional theme-park manner, KidZania will recreate workplaces such as operating theatres, plane cockpits, radio stations and banks. Children will play at working and will be paid in \u201cKidZos\u201d \u2013 above, you would hope, the minimum wage. There are more than 60 roles to choose from, each taking about 25 minutes. Your child could be a refuse collector in the morning, pizza chef over lunch, and surgeon in the afternoon. \u201cGet ready for a better world,\u201d is KidZania\u2019s slogan. In the park, everything works: slacker kids, like broken lightbulbs, are programmatically unacceptable.     Japanese children play at being dentists Photograph: Kiyoshi Ota/Getty Images    So the architecture of KidZania isn\u2019t just a simulation of the real world. It\u2019s a preparation for it. Cadbury, who has a touch of the Willy Wonka about him, explains why. Children can learn to fly a BA aeroplane, deliver letters dressed as little DHL drivers and make Innocent smoothies. At the Renault engineering centre, they can learn how to change tyres; at H&amp;M\u2019s academy, they will be taught the rudiments of fashion and design; and at the Dorsett Hotel, they can be managers, front-desk staff or housekeepers. Your child could even become an oompa loompa \u2013 sorry, an expert chocolatier \u2013 at the Cadbury factory. The promotional material shows a child in a pretend KidZania surgery, apparently anaesthetising a dog on an operating table. (That\u2019s got to be a contravention of something, surely, unless the dog\u2019s stuffed.) \u201cWe\u2019re opening children\u2019s eyes to the realities of life,\u201d says Cadbury, who talks glowingly of all the \u201cindustry partners\u201d who are being wooed to lend their brands. But why do you need them? \u201cIf you have a bank called The Bank, it\u2019s not very authentic,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need the real names to authenticate the content.\u201d While KidZania has lots of partners worldwide (including McDonald\u2019s, Waitrose, Epson, Sony, DHL, Walmart, Olay and Mitsubishi), its London outpost has yet to firm up a banking partner. Perhaps a failed one like RBS would be the perfect way to teach kids about banking in the real world. But that probably won\u2019t happen. The most intriguing KidZania simulation involves a pretend burning building. Paramedics will pull a child casualty from a fake blaze, check for a pulse, then stretcher them to a child-sized ambulance that will ferry them to A&amp;E, where little nurses will administer pretend treatment. Meanwhile, child firefighters will put out the blaze, child cops will investigate the incident, and cub reporters from the radio station and the newspaper will go Paxo on those responsible.     Junior Japanese firefighters. Photograph: Kiyoshi Ota/Getty Images    \u201cThe inspiration for KidZania is what children do every day,\u201d says Xavier L\u00f3pez Ancona, the creator of KidZania, who is taking me on a tour of the thing that has made him very rich. \u201cLittle girls pretend to be mothers or boys simulate driving cars.\u201d When the 50-year-old man described as \u201cthe Mexican Walt Disney\u201d was working at General Electric in the 1990s, an old schoolfriend approached him with an idea to launch nurseries focusing on role-playing. That morphed into KidZania and the first park opened in Santa Fe in 1999. Today, 35 million children have visited a KidZania in cities as diverse as Mumbai, Tokyo, Cairo, Istanbul, Lisbon and Seoul. Nine more, including the London one, are in the offing. KidZania hasn\u2019t yet broken into the US, but L\u00f3pez hopes to soon. The KidZania parks all have a similar formula. First, parents pay for admission. \u201cThe most expensive ticket will be \u00a328,\u201d says Cadbury, \u201cso it\u2019s cheaper than childcare.\u201d Children are then fitted with radio-frequency tags so their whereabouts can be monitored for the four-hour experience. They are then separated from their parents, who can watch from what\u2019s called the Parents\u2019 Clubhouse; or \u2013 as is more likely, given that almost all KidZanias have been cunningly built next to malls \u2013 go shopping. How refreshing, I say, that in the age of helicopter parenting, children are being separated from cosseting, overbearing adults. \u201cThat\u2019s essential,\u201d says Ollie Vigors, Cadbury\u2019s longtime business partner. \u201cThe kids are empowered to make their own decisions. Parents are an impediment. I know, as a parent, that I say \u2018Don\u2019t do that\u2019 to my children a ridiculous number of times a day. If parents are taken out of the equation, it actually gives children the freedom to play and learn.\u201d The only roles for parents are as spectators: they can watch a play or a football match, or sit in an aeroplane being told by pint-sized cabin crew what to do in case of an emergency, but nothing more. In London, this will be flight BA 2311 (actually the fuselage of a British Airways Airbus that\u2019s already been winched into place).     A Japanese child makes a hamburger Photograph: Kiyoshi Ota/Getty Images    Kids will be welcomed to KidZania with a cheque and the greeting from adult staff: \u201cHave a productive day!\u201d They can cash their cheque at the bank and spend their kidzos on food, go-karting or gifts. They can then earn more by working at different jobs. The children who graduate from the university will earn more. \u201cJust like in the real world,\u201d says L\u00f3pez. They can also open a bank account, deposit their cheque, and be issued with a debit card for use at KidZania cash machines. Japanese kids, says L\u00f3pez, save more KidZos than their Mexican or Indonesian counterparts. British kids would probably rack up massive debts, I suggest. L\u00f3pez laughs: in the happy land of KidZania, debt does not exist. Pity. If it did, kids could train as loan company flunkies, or take turns playing Carol Vorderman in debt-consolidation adverts. Dr Richard Barry, KidZania\u2019s head of education, is keen to stress that the emphasis is on learning through doing: \u201cI believe Einstein hit the proverbial nail on the head when he said, \u2018Learning is experience. Everything else is just information.\u2019 I think the experience is a tin opener for further learning.\u201d Barry and the team have been planning KidZania activities with an eye on the national curriculum and the Early Years Foundation Stage. Have any schools or teachers, I wonder, been put off by KidZania\u2019s capitalist ethos, its consumerism and its echoes of child labour? Not so far, Barry replies. He doesn\u2019t think that will be an issue. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting lots of school trips and lots of teachers as well as children to find this inspirational.\u201d     An aeroplane being installed at the London KidZania. Photograph: Matthew Lloyd    But for some, there is a problem. When I tell a fellow parent about KidZania, she emails: \u201cThis seems like total capitalist nightmare abomination, and I wouldn\u2019t want my child involved.\u201d Certainly, parts of the press pack do not seem to be directed at parents. I felt queasy at the description of KidZania as a \u201cnew and innovative way to build your brand\u201d. So it offers a means, funded by parents, for businesses to sink their claws into what the blurb calls \u201ccustomers of the future\u201d. Children: not so much little dudes as money-making opportunities. Still, it seems a safe bet that, come next year, this building site in west London will be teeming with children. Cadbury and Vigors expect up to one million children each year, and are already planning to expand their franchise to east London, as well as to Birmingham or Manchester. As a result, millions of British children may be readied for the world of work \u2013 and perhaps inculcated with a revulsion for benefit dependency \u2013 at Britain\u2019s most ideologically explicit theme park. As I leave, I can\u2019t help thinking that KidZania is what you\u2019d get if work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith was put in charge of Alton Towers. Goodbye white-knuckle ride.

Five or six guests are sat around a restaurant table waiting to share fermented mare\u2019s milk with you to celebrate the closing of an important business deal. It\u2019s a scenario ripe with possibilities for cultural cock-ups and etiquette faux pas, which entrepreneur Will Tindall recalls only too well. Refusing to down your fair share of the toe-curling concoction, famed for being the tipple of choice of Genghis Khan and his troops, will not only be socially embarrassing, it could cost you the deal you\u2019ve been working for months to broker. \u201cIf you were to not drink it or have any sort of reaction to that initial taste, it would definitely lower your standing within a meeting,\u201d says Tindall, co-founder of Emerging Crowd. \u201cAnd you\u2019re very much expected to have a shot each time someone has spoken.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s very hard to keep your head after 15 shots of fiery alcohol, and Tindall says even after living and doing business in the country for more than a year he left the meeting without a clue what had been said or what had actually happened. Any SME owner serious about exporting overseas, however, should be prepared for a culture clash or two, particularly in emerging markets unfamiliar with western customs. Tindall says he has a weighty portfolio of embarrassing blunders made during his last six years living and working in Asia. But despite becoming fairly accustomed to the rituals of business meetings in Hong Kong and Singapore, he says nothing could prepare him for Tokyo. Tindall remembers his first meeting in the Japanese capital 10 years ago, with a very senior and well known individual in an international bank. He was told to give a little bow upon taking the man\u2019s business card and it seemed all was going well. That was until he began to make notes about who the person was on the card. \u201cAt that point I saw this guy\u2019s face change to a very strange shade of red. My actions went down incredibly badly. Although I was giving this business card lots of respect, the idea of writing on it was definitely frowned upon. When I went to leave and try to shake his hand, he turned his back on me. It was embarrassing but then I quickly realised that was also because they don\u2019t really shake hands.\u201d It may have been awkward, but it taught him a valuable lesson about Japan\u2019s reverence for the mighty business card. They are incredibly important in Japan, Tindall says. If you are doing business there and have a card which is also translated on the other side, you will receive immediate kudos from the recipient. They love the extra effort that you go to, he adds, but warns to make sure you know which way up the Japanese language side is facing. Handing someone an upside down card is also considered rude. Thankfully, most hosts will be sympathetic to your cultural ignorance, providing you make the effort. Having the ability to laugh at yourself if you make a mistake and apologising is key to recovering from a particularly awkward blunder, he says. For Louis Barnett, the founder of Louis Barnett Chocolates, the biggest hurdle was understanding that in some countries doing business is as much a personal event as it is professional. The 22-year-old entrepreneur, who started his British chocolate company at the tender age of 12, was initially flummoxed by the reaction to his typically hard-nosed business talk. After expressing his professional concern about a matter and sticking to the cold hard facts in a meeting with his partners in Mexico, he was surprised that the reaction was one of offence. By neglecting to ask the client about his personal life \u2013 his wife and kids \u2013 he had inadvertently antagonised his hosts. Because overseas clients will be as unprepared for your way of doing business as you are for theirs, it is crucial you do your homework first and get one step ahead before meeting in person. Barnett found help and support from the British Chambers of Commerce, who have experts on the ground with an understanding of the culture of that nation and the ways UK exporters may have to adapt to doing business there. The chambers, he explains, has a wide reaching spider web of networks and contacts, from buyers and distributors to lawyers, who will help you understand the country\u2019s market. Bulldog Skincare is already a reputable brand of male grooming products in the UK, but it is fast becoming equally well known abroad, with around 14,000 retailers stocking the product range across 13 countries. Its founder, Simon Duffy, first dipped his toe in the overseas market in 2010 with a lucrative deal in Sweden. After the company\u2019s success in Scandinavia, Bulldog had the confidence to throw its net wider, branching out to as far as the US and Australia. One of their most interesting exporting experiences was breaking into the South Korean market. He hesitates to call it a challenge though, despite the vast cultural differences. He claims with thorough research and preparation, any exporting venture is totally manageable \u2013 you just have to be sensitive to the differences. Duffy recommends ediplomat.com, which features a helpful section about cultural conventions, such as how to meet and greet people, as well as information about names, titles, and even acceptable body language such crossing your legs, eye contact and showing the soles of your feet. \u201cCertain conventions which are encouraged in the west can come across as confrontational in Korea,\u201d Duffy explains. \u201cOne of the things we tried to avoid was phrasing questions that required a yes or no answer, as Koreans try to avoid the latter. The negotiation process has a completely different rhythm. Things take longer to be resolved but that isn\u2019t a sign of a lack of momentum \u2013 you have to be prepared for several visits to build trust.\u201d Once that rapport is built, however, then collaboration will become easier. Duffy adds that because they are making the best efforts to do the right thing, their partners are also cutting them a lot of slack. \u201cThey are meeting us in the middle now which is important and we value that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are very conscious that we don\u2019t want to offend the local sensibilities but we are aware that they are reaching out to us and finding common ground.\u201d Read more like this Accidental exporters: the businesses that fell into selling overseas Exporting food to the world\u2019s British expat community This content has been sponsored by UPS, whose brand it displays.

In 2015 it will multiply across commercial TV screens in an orgy of building, cooking \u2026 and of course singing. In one new hybrid show on Channel Seven the dual genres of food and renovation will collide in Kitchen Revolution: a reality format which will screen every week night until the restaurants built by the contestants are ready for the viewers to visit and eat the cooked by the reality stars. True interactivity. For viewers, there is the chance to buy in real time the products featured in the shows \u2013 such as fridges and drills \u2013 and for advertisers there is the chance to have their products featured in the action. \u201cEver dreamed of opening up your own restaurant? Restaurant Revolution will give regular people the opportunity to road test their restaurant dream and make it a reality.\u201d As CEO Tim Worner said: there isn\u2019t a single moment of TV Seven makes without thinking of where the advertisers can fit in. The buzzwords are \u201chighly integrative\u201d. Kitchen Revolution, in which contestants will locate, renovate and run a restaurant in pursuit of reality glory, is the new addition to Seven\u2019s schedule which is already bulging with The X Factor, Dancing with the Stars, My Kitchen Rules and House Rules. My Kitchen Rules was the number one show of 2014, now way ahead of MasterChef Australia which was once the king of cooking shows over on Ten. The MKR winner announcement was watched by 3.8m viewers. Seven says MKR will be back \u201cwith more instant restaurant rounds than ever before and a colourful array of new characters\u201d.  Colourful is the key. A showreel indicated the vaudeville \u201ccharacters \u201c of MKR created by clever casting are even more polarising this year. House Rules has done so well for Seven they have commissioned it twice. In 2015 there will be two series of House Rules, following in the footsteps of Nine\u2019s The Block, which already has two series each calendar year. Yes, renovation is still hot, and in TV if it works flog it to death.  Seven\u2019s director of network production Brad Lyons: \u201cWe will be expanding the domination of House Rules next year. The second season averaged 2.3m viewers and enjoyed an astonishing 25% year-on-year growth.\u201d Not to be outdone, Nine will launch \u201cthe most controversial social experiment\u201d next year in a new reality format Married at First Sight, in which contestants will be hitched to complete strangers. But more details will be unveiled when Nine Entertainment Co holds its programming launch in early December. Over two days at Fox Studios, Seven West Media showed off its wares to a stream of advertisers, media buyers and journalists, promising to remain at the top of the ratings until 2020 with a strong offering of multi-channel Olympic sport, Australian drama, Anzac commemoration and of course the real money spinner, reality. Seven will broadcast the Games of the XXXI Olympiad in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, the XXIII Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang in 2018 and the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Tokyo in 2020. The leading network for eight years, Seven has a 40% commercial share of viewers, leaving Nine and Ten to scrap over the remaining 60%. But what Seven doesn\u2019t have is enough younger viewers. Nine is winning in the key under-50 demographics loved by advertisers.  But it\u2019s not all reality. There is sport, news, current affairs and of course breakfast television in Sunrise, which is still streaks ahed of Nine\u2019s Today.  Adding to its drama slate of Home and Away and Winners and Losers are two new dramas which are star vehicles for the leads from Packed to the Rafters Rebecca Gibney and Erik Thomson. Thomson returns to Seven in the comedy drama series 800 words, about a widowed writer who takes a sea change with his two teenage daughters. His former Packed to the Rafters co-star Gibney will star in a crime series called Winter."}, {"sentences": ["His opening brace of rap tracks merge urgent South Central polemic with misty eastern atmospherics and cavernous soul hooks, and when he moves on to sing about missing his wife on Tokyo Ghost, he becomes a witch-house poltergeist, pining in spectral falsetto over slo-mo J-pop."], "tags": ["Electronic music", "Hip-hop", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-30T16:29:51Z", "title": "Eyedress review \u2013 Filipino freakiness unleashed", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/30/eyedress-review", "article": "For Eyedress \u2013 AKA 23-year-old Filipino freakball Idris Vicu\u00f1a \u2013 it\u2019s a night full of wonders. \u201cI can rap, oh shit!\u201d he exclaims, spitting standard hip-hop tropes, expletives and fellatio requests over compulsive beats on Snakes Never Prosper and Manila Ice. \u201cSamples, man!\u201d he gasps as a reggae guitar emanates from his DJ\u2019s laptop, \u201cIt\u2019s from the future!

Moca\u2019s highbrow art-lovers may balk at seeing their hallowed space filled with the super-cute Kittyphernalia but the convention is drawing record-breaking crowds. So is the related exhibition in the adjacent Japanese American National Museum. Called Hello! Exploring the Supercute World of Hello Kitty, it includes Lady Gaga\u2019s 2009 dress made entirely of plush Kitty toys \u2013 she\u2019s a big fan. More than 20,000 Kitty fans snapped up tickets for the sold-out, four-day convention. Timed to celebrate 40 years of the brand, it runs through Sunday. Ticket holders get a sneak preview of the first ever travelling Kitty show, a feelgood, techno-pop tribute touring US arenas, and first dibs at exclusive Kitty merchandise.     Fans pose for photos in a giant teacup at the Hello Kitty Con. Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP    By 10am on opening day the line stretched several blocks, with many enduring hours in the baking sun to gain entry. Inside, fans had another two-hour wait to get into the main Kitty store. Even Christine Yano, co-curator of the JANM show and professor of anthropology at the University of Hawaii, who has tracked Kitty\u2019s rise in her book Pink Globalization: Hello Kitty\u2019s Trek Across the Pacific, was amazed. \u201cThis is fandom and fandom is contagious\u201d says Yano. \u201cAnthropologists call it emotional contagion and Sanrio has been excellent at knowing how to amp it up.\u201d  Sanrio Inc is the Japanese merchandising company where Kitty was \u201cborn\u201d in 1974. The company is named after its founder Shintaro Tsuji Sanrio, now in his 80s, who wanted a character to embellish a line of gifts, and coined the line\u2019s motto: \u201csmall gift, big smile\u201d. Kitty first appeared on a little purse, the original of which is kept in a vault at Sanrio\u2019s headquarters and which it has loaned to KittyCon, where it is displayed on a velvet pedestal in a huge glass case, flanked by security guards.  Today Sanrio has reason to smile broadly, with sales of around $8bn from global licensing agreements and products, more than half due to Kitty. Over the years, she has morphed from a kiddie-centric character to a style icon. Much credit goes to Kitty\u2019s in-house designer Yuko Yamaguchi, known as Kitty Mama, who took over Kitty\u2019s design reins more than 30 years ago, softening the character\u2019s image and introducing the pink palette. She is on hand for signings at Kittcon, her bright orange hair twirled into two tight pigtails on either side of her head.      Brandee Amore of Glendale, California, walks across the street before the start of the Hello Kitty Con. Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP    \u201cKitty has evolved over the years into a rock star who can do goth and hipster,\u201d says Yano. She has inspired serious artists to explore Kittyness, such as Colin Christian, who has sculpted a giant fiberglass Kitty in bondage titled Super Space Titan Kitty, which is in the exhibition. But under the layers there is always the base of what Yano calls \u201cinfantalized cuteness\u201d. Cute, or kawaii, is now synonymous with Japanese culture. And with this edginess comes a blurring between cute, kitsch and sexy, and fuel for Kitty detractors.  Kitty is, of course, a little girl, not a cat, though she happens to have whiskers. Her official bio from Sanrio says she is Kitty White and lives outside London with her family, \u201cborn\u201d in an era when Japan looked at Britain through rose-tinted glasses. Janet Hsu, Sanrio\u2019s US president says: \u201cShe\u2019s a girl in a class of her own.\u201d Kitty\u2019s feminist critics point to her mouthless, expressionless face, a mute object on to which viewers can project whatever they want. KittyCon exhibitor Kevin Krieser, who is selling limited edition Kitty sweatshirts made under licence by his California-based clothing company, calls Kitty a designer\u2019s dream. \u201cShe\u2019s completely flexible. Wherever you put her, she always works. Disney [characters] are not like that.\u201d  Krieser credits retailer Target, the co-sponsor of Hello Kitty Con, for resurrecting Kitty in the late 90s, teaming with Sanrio on a line of Kitty products. The range coincided with the wave of \u201ccool Japan\u201d sweeping into the west, bringing with it Manga comics, anime and ramen, which some dub Japan\u2019s \u201csoft power\u201d invasion. That, coupled with Kitty\u2019s flexibility, allowed Sanrio to make a broad range of licensing agreements with diverse companies, and sowed the seeds of her comeback.  Along the way, Sanrio managed to turn cute Kitty into cool Kitty, helped by her distance from the Euro-American mainstream, free publicity from the rich and famous, deft licensing agreements and links with fashion.      Fans wait in line to attend the Hello Kitty Con. Photograph: Jae C. Hong/AP    A walk through the crowds at KittyCon attests that Kitty is pure product. Apart from the obvious \u2013 Kitty dresses, shoes and bags \u2013 there is Kitty toilet paper, a Kitty mould for Spam and even Beats by Dre Kitty headphones. There are cute Kitty stuffed animals for kids and edgier offerings, such as free Kitty tattoos. Stevie Nutter, 22, from West Virginia, who sports giant ear and tongue piercings, has been waiting in line for her \u201ccute\u201d Kitty tattoo for hours. She already has her own zombie version of Kitty tattooed on her thigh. \u201cI like a little bit of everything,\u201d she explains. There are very few little children at KittyCon. Most attendees, at least on this school day, are seasoned collectors and fans who have come to snap up limited-edition products. Cherell Finister, 17, who\u2019s with her mother, sports a pair of Kitty-themed Vans sneakers which she bought a while ago. \u201cI\u2019m a bit upset because they are selling them here and I bought them as a limited edition,\u201d says Finister, who also has a $500 Swarovski crystal Hello Kitty USB drive.  Kitty\u2019s fans include some men: there is a panel entitled Even Guys Like Hello Kitty. Tattooed bodyguard to the stars Big Abe, who poses with a couple of Kitty superfans, says he got to know Kitty through his clients. \u201cI have a lot of stuffed dolls and some luggage, though I pretend it belongs to them when we travel,\u201d he says. Lisa Katzoff, 47, a rock singer from New Jersey who flew in for KittyCon, is weighed down with bags after spending hundreds of dollars on Kitty items, including a $300 limited-edition music box. Katzoff, who has been collecting since she was seven and even made a pilgrimage to Tokyo, visiting PuroLand, the Kitty theme park, says she doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019s so hooked. \u201cI just know she\u2019s cute and fun and I love her. She reminds me of childhood.\u201d  What does she think of Kitty as a female role model, given her lack of a mouth? \u201cReally, she doesn\u2019t have a mouth? I never noticed. She\u2019s just a cute cartoon character.

Justin King, the former chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, said: \u201cThere are many businesses that detach themselves from normal rules for periods of time but eventually the consumer catches up and they are forced to change.\u201d Really? Could public revulsion have been more effective than government or regulatory action in preventing the latest scandals to cloud Britain\u2019s corporate reputation? Last week Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, two of Britain\u2019s biggest banks, set aside a total of \u00a3900m for settlements related to rigging of the foreign exchange market, and the Serious Fraud Office launched a criminal investigation into a misstatement of profit guidance at Tesco. With regard to banks, another intervention last week underlined how public anger over the behaviour of the financial services sector \u2013 from taxpayer bailouts to continued payment of bonuses \u2013 has failed to filter through to the glass and steel towers of Canary Wharf and the Square Mile. The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Nemat Shafik, said that the City had deep-rooted problems that could no longer be blamed on a \u201cfew bad apples\u201d. Underlining the consequences to consumers of criminal behaviour in esoteric areas such as currency markets, she said: \u201cThe integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain. Markets here set the interest rates for people\u2019s mortgages, the exchange rates for our exports and holidays, and the commodity prices for the goods we buy.\u201d It has taken the intervention of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), not the consumer, to reprimand banks over forex rigging. Shafik is clearly frustrated that years of exhortations against bank misbehaviour have yet to trigger genuine cultural change. Public opinion, backed to varying degrees by politicians and regulators, caught up years ago but banks, perhaps emboldened by a reluctance among many customers to even switch accounts, continue to misbehave. The problems with supplier payments at Tesco \u2013 to the extent that its first-half profit forecast was overstated by \u00a3263m \u2013 came despite many UK consumers catching up with Tesco\u2019s \u201cdetachment\u201d and deciding to shop elsewhere, including in the aisles of German discounters. Indeed, one theory is that payments were pulled forward in a bid to meet difficult profit targets in a cut-throat commercial environment. It is arguable that people power helped detach Tesco from the normal rules of business in this case. So where does this leave King\u2019s argument about the consumer as ultimate arbiter? In the case of rigging financial markets, the public is hopelessly underpowered compared with bodies such as the FCA, the Bank of England and the Houses of Parliament. Criminal sanction and legislation remain the best tools for instilling moral rigour into the markets. The same applies to underhand accounting practices: the shopper who rumbles Tesco\u2019s shoddy pricing strategy can\u2019t be expected to extend their scrutiny to the supermarket\u2019s internal bookkeeping. Regulators and elected representatives must be in the vanguard of protecting consumers. King made his comments at a conference about tax, where he said public anger against Starbucks had forced the coffee chain to pay more to the UK exchequer. But only tougher laws and regulatory vigilance can make these concessions \u2013 and behavioural change \u2013 permanent. In surprising echoes of Russell Brand, King added: \u201cBy far the most powerful vote is not the one we make every five years at the ballot box, but the one shoppers make day in day out.\u201d But a vote for the party that promises to truly reform the financial services industry, and make morality an imperative ahead of profit for businesses in general, offers more reliable long-term protection. It will take more than voting with our feet. Abe needs to keep his balance as he drives down the yen     Shinzo Abe will decide by the end of the year whether to increase sales tax again. Photograph: Andre Penner/AP    Timing is everything for central banks, and the Bank of Japan chose the perfect moment to announce the expansion of its quantitative easing programme. Coming less than 48 hours after the US Federal Reserve brought its money-creation scheme to a halt, the move had the element of surprise and ensured Tokyo got maximum bang for the buck. Shares soared and the yen fell sharply. The reason for the beefing-up of QE in Japan is plain. Growth has faltered since the increase in sales tax in the spring, intensifying downward pressure on inflation caused by falling global food and fuel prices. There has been much muttering about how Abenomics, the three-pronged growth strategy for the economy introduced by prime minister Shinzo Abe, is failing. Abe says he will decide by the end of the year whether to go ahead with a second rise in sales tax, due to be implemented in October 2015. The additional monetary boost provided by increasing the purchase of Japanese bonds from \u00a550tn (\u00a3279bn) a year to \u00a580tn a year is designed to offset the drag on demand caused by higher taxes. Even so, the second sales tax increase is a gamble: Abe\u2019s credibility will suffer if he pulls the tax hike, but Japan\u2019s recent history is littered with examples of the economy being derailed by over-aggressive and premature policy tightenings. Abe\u2019s delicate balancing act may therefore need even more aggressive QE during 2015. Tokyo wants to boost growth by driving down the value of the yen, thereby making its exports more competitive. The problem with this is that one country\u2019s currency depreciation is another country\u2019s appreciation. What Japan does has consequences for the rest of the world. A weaker yen means a stronger dollar and a stronger euro. That suggests US interest rates will stay on hold for longer and increases the pressure on the European Central Bank to launch its own QE programme. The danger is clear, though: Japan, Europe and the US compete with each other to drive down their currencies, mirroring the tit-for-tat trade wars of the 1930s. Two powerful gay executives, two very different stories     Seven years ago, and in a very different industry, Lord Browne\u2019s coming out was a shattering experience. Photograph: Murdo Macleod    Lord Browne was among the first to congratulate Tim Cook last week after the Apple chief executive publicly came out as gay. The former BP boss said it sent an \u201cimportant signal round the world\u201d and might encourage other executives to come out. Most poignantly, Browne said that Cook\u2019s coming out was \u201cdifferent to my own\u201d. One of Britain\u2019s most powerful and respected business executives saw the divide between his public and private life shattered in 2007 by a kiss-and-tell, then the fateful application for a court injunction that led to his resignation. Browne\u2019s admirable work on LGBT issues since has helped pave the way for announcements like Cook\u2019s, even though the Apple chief works in an industry that is much more tolerant than the oil business. For all the moving eloquence of Cook\u2019s statement, one wishes that Browne had been able to speak similar words seven years earlier."}, {"sentences": ["Coming less than 48 hours after the US Federal Reserve brought its money creation scheme to a halt, the move had the element of surprise and ensured Tokyo got maximum bang for the buck.", "Tokyo wants to boost growth by driving down the value of the yen, making its exports more competitive."], "tags": ["Yen", "Quantitative easing", "Currencies", "Japan", "Shinzo Abe", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-02T10:27:56Z", "title": "World shares soar and yen crumbles as QE is beefed up in Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/02/world-shares-soar-and-yen-crumbles-as-qe-is-beefed-up-in-japan", "article": "Timing is everything for central banks, and the Bank of Japan chose the perfect moment to announce the expansion of its quantitative easing programme.

Other stars of the summer \u2013 including the Commonwealth and European 800m silver medallist, Lynsey Sharp, who made the podium in Glasgow despite being sick the night before the final and the 21-year-old sprinter Jodie Williams, who returned from serious injury to win four medals in Glasgow and Zurich \u2013 are expected to have their funding upgraded when British Athletics announces who will receive lottery money for 2015 this afternoon. However, the 41-year-old Jo Pavey, who followed up a shock 5,000m bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games with gold in the 10,000m at the European Championships in August shortly after the birth of her second child, is not expected to be funded again after falling off the list in 2013 because of the more stringent requirements laid down by British Athletics after London 2012. British Athletics requires that any athlete given \u201cpodium funding\u201d \u2013 worth up to \u00a327,737 to a potential Olympic or Paralympic medallist and \u00a320,804 to a world-level finalist, plus coaching and medical support \u2013 must be considered capable of reaching the podium at Rio 2016. Pavey, for all her brilliance this season, is unlikely to reach such heights given that she will be nearly 43 when the next Olympics comes round. This year, for instance, she was ranked 18th in the world over 5,000m and 47th in the 10,000m. In previous years, announcements about athlete funding have mostly concentrated attention on those missing out. Last year it was the former world triple-jump champion Phillips Idowu; in 2012 it was the world marathon record-holder Paula Radcliffe. But it is not thought there will be a dramatic culling of athletes whose careers may have peaked. Instead the focus will be largely on rewarding those who helped Britain win 23 medals, including 12 golds, at the European Championships in August \u2013 the nation\u2019s greatest performance at the event. That means several young athletes on lower-grade \u201cpodium potential\u201d funding \u2013 granted to developmental stars who are considered to have the ability to win a medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 \u2013 will be upgraded to full podium funding. They are expected to include not only Sharp and Williams but also the world indoor 60m champion, Richard Kilty, who ran so brilliantly around the final bend as Britain won European 4x100m gold in Zurich, and the 20-year-old Chijindu Ujah who showed his enormous potential by dipping under the 10-second barrier for 100m when running 9.96 sec in June. Hudson-Smith, also 20, is set to be funded for the first time after coming from nowhere to be ranked among the world\u2019s fastest 400m runners. He took up the event only this year and he quickly cut four seconds off his personal best before breaking the 45-second barrier in his sixth race and then running 44.75 sec in Zurich. No wonder the Olympic champion, Kirani James, predicts that Hudson-Smith is \u201ccapable of great things as long as he keeps on the right track\u201d. Another athlete expected to join Hudson-Smith on the funding list for the first time is the 14-year-old Paralympian sprinter Maria Lyle who set a T35 200m world record of 31.01 sec \u2013 smashing the previous best by over a second \u2013 on her international debut in February. Lyle, who has cerebral palsy, went on to win double T35 100m and 200m gold at the IPC European athletics championships in Swansea in August."}, {"sentences": ["People arrive here from New York, Tokyo, and we are the first people they meet in London."], "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style", "TfL", "London", "UK news", "Fashion industry"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-03T19:00:25Z", "title": "London Underground launches new uniform from Wayne Hemingway", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/nov/03/london-underground-launches-new-uniform-from-wayne-hemingway", "article": "Twitter is the harshest of fashion critics, so when Transport for London launched its new staff uniforms on Monday, the response was predictably cynical. \u201cWonderful \u2013 if they wanted to look like they were selling trainers in a sports store,\u201d commented one. \u201cCan we get a tube strike to force Fred Perry to redesign those new uniforms?\u201d asked another. Designed by Wayne Hemingway, the uniforms are certainly a departure from the over-sized, red-collared, navy blue fleeces most commonly seen in London Underground ticket halls. The most significant changes come via outerwear: a zip-up gilet, with a round, bright red collar, and the intriguingly named \u201cfleecington\u201d \u2013 a combination of a fleece and a Harrington jacket. At the launch of the uniform, at Oxford Circus tube station, enthusiasm levels are high. Standing proud in a smart, over-sized navy covert coat with the London Underground roundel embossed on the pockets and tailored trousers, customer service assistant Serge Ake says he was \u201ca bit tired\u201d with the existing uniform, \u201cbut in this I feel proud, and protected and warm. People arrive here from New York, Tokyo, and we are the first people they meet in London.

It was in a staff meeting that the \u201cFleecington\u201d was born: \u201cTwo blokes brought along Harrington jackets and said they were their favourite things in their wardrobes. Loads of others said that they loved fleeces. But fleeces are a bit scruffy \u2013 they don\u2019t shout out \u2018vibrant London\u2019. So we decided to merge the two.\u201d This democratic feeling cuts across the new uniform, with customisable options ranging from beanies to traditional peaked caps; from crisp shirts to polos. The uniform is designed to cater to all religions, too, with Rastafarian hats, headscarves and turbans part of the eventual collection. The overall aim is visibility: \u201cIncreasingly we\u2019re tapping credit cards to get into barriers, not buying tickets, and staff are taking a more ambassadorial role \u2013 we want people to easily see them and ask them for directions; to tell people what\u2019s above ground too,\u201d says Hemingway. \u201cSome of my colleagues are sceptical,\u201d admits Ake. \u201cChange isn\u2019t easy, and there have been a few glitches with sizes, but I\u2019d urge them to keep an open mind.\u201d Currently on trial at six London stations \u2013 Harrow on the Hill, Greenford, Oxford Circus, Mile End, Camden Town and Perivale, as well as train depots at Acton Town and Edgware Road \u2013 the uniforms will be rolled out across the network next year.

Keiko Arimoto was 23 when she was tricked into flying to North Korea while studying English in London in 1983. She is one of 12 Japanese citizens Tokyo says were abducted by communist agents during the cold war: lured on to planes or bundled into boats, and taken to North Korea to teach their language and customs to generations of spies. Seventeen years after Japan\u2019s government recognised that its citizens had been abducted, only five have returned. The failure of two days of talks between North Korean officials and a Japanese delegation in Pyongyang last week has only added to the frustration felt by their families. The government officially recognises 12 people as abductees, but the national police agency believes there could be up to 883 Japanese citizens who ended up as prisoners of the secretive state in the 70s and 80s. The Arimotos\u2019 hopes were raised in July when North Korea agreed to reopen its investigation into the abductees, in return for a Japanese offer to lift unilateral sanctions. Keiko\u2019s mother concedes that the inquiry is probably her last chance of being reunited with her daughter. \u201cI am hopeful, and I am convinced that Keiko is still alive, but I do wonder if all of the abductees will be able to return,\u201d Kayoko, 88, told the Guardian at the family\u2019s home in Kobe, western Japan. \u201cIf this latest round of talks don\u2019t result in anything, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever see them again. We\u2019re both in our late 80s, so we have to accept that we might not be around for much longer. She is constantly in my thoughts. When I think of how I have been unable to do anything to help her all these years, I quietly say sorry to her.\u201d     Keiko Arimoto (left, dated May 1983 in London) and Megumi Yokota (dated April 1977 in Niigata city). Photograph: Jiji Press/EPA    Until it receives verifiable information on the fates of the remaining abductees, Japan says it will not begin lifting sanctions, including a freeze on remittances by North Korean residents of Japan and a ban on port visits by a North Korean ferry. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has made solving the abduction issue a cornerstone of his political career. The emotive power of the abductees\u2019 plights is such that Japan places more importance on their return than on ending North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. \u201cWe have said all along that North Korea must solve [the abduction] issue or it has no future,\u201d Abe said recently. A breakthrough came in 2002, when the North\u2019s then leader, Kim Jong-il, admitted that the country\u2019s agents had carried out abductions during a landmark summit in Pyongyang with his Japanese counterpart, Junichiro Koizumi. Five abductees were allowed to return home, but North Korea said eight others had died in bizarre accidents, while the remaining four had never entered the country. Keiko was said to have died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a gas heater, while others had drowned or died in car accidents. Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she was snatched on her way home from school badminton practice in 1977, reportedly killed herself while being treated for depression in 1994. The Arimotos refuse to believe their daughter is dead until the North provides irrefutable evidence. \u201cWe were both dead set against her studying in London,\u201d said Keiko\u2019s 86-year-old father, Akihiro. \u201cShe normally did exactly as she was told, but on this she wouldn\u2019t budge, so we had to let her go.\u201d Keiko had been studying in London for a year when a Japanese woman lured her to Denmark, and then to Pyongyang. A postcard from Copenhagen was the last the Arimotos heard from their daughter.     Japanese PM Shinzo Abe briefs reporters on his talks with a Japanese envoy who visited North Korea. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    Five years after Keiko vanished, her parents learned via a letter that had been smuggled out of North Korea to Poland that she was living in Pyongyang with Toru Ishioka, a compatriot who had gone missing in Spain in 1980, and their young child. Conformation came in 2002 when Megumi Yao, the ex-wife of a Japanese Red Army member involved in the 1970 hijacking of a Japanese airliner, admitted luring Keiko on to a flight to North Korea, where she was handed over to the local authorities. \u201cYao was Japanese, and grew up not far from here, so Keiko trusted her,\u201d Kayoko said. \u201cI think curiosity and naivety got the better of her.\u201d Encouraged by occasional, but unconfirmed, reports that their daughter has been spotted in North Korea, the Arimotos are pinning their hopes on Abe. With last week\u2019s high-level talks ending only with a North Korean promise to deepen its investigation, they believe Japan\u2019s conservative prime minister has little choice but to fly to Pyongyang and confront the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. In the meantime, they and Keiko\u2019s five siblings can only wait, and take comfort in the belief that she is alive and, along with other abductees, is being used by North Korea to win concessions from Tokyo such as a resumption of humanitarian aid and diplomatic ties. Today, as on every other day for the past 31 years, Kayoko will lay a place at the dinner table for her daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s to show that she\u2019s still part of our family,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s my way of making sure she gets enough to eat in a country where so many people are starving. While she fears the worst, Kayoko occasionally allows herself to dream of the day her daughter walks down the steps of a plane and back on to Japanese soil. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d even be able to speak,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a mother, all I\u2019d want to do is hold my daughter again.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["These wobbling marks of respect were far from gracious, but for us it was a mission accomplished!\u201d Guillem will bow out with a world tour called Life in Progress beginning in Modena, Italy, on 31 March, stopping at Sadler\u2019s Wells in May and ending in Tokyo in December."], "tags": ["Sylvie Guillem", "Ballet", "Stage", "Dance", "Royal Ballet", "English National Ballet", "Tamara Rojo", "Akram Khan"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-04T18:48:50Z", "title": "Prima ballerina Sylvie Guillem prepares to take her final bow", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/04/prima-ballerina-sylvie-guillem-prepares-take-final-bow", "article": "Sylvie Guillem, arguably the greatest ballerina of her generation, has announced details of her final performances before she retires 39 years after she joined the Paris Opera Ballet school as a \u201clittle rat\u201d.

Through a program comprising online videos and in-person classes, the company has built a business model which preys on lonely desperate men, offering them the promise of female sexual attention through force when it doesn\u2019t exist by will. The instruction and promotion of abuse and the total violation of consent is this company\u2019s stock in trade. Blanc\u2019s \u201cPhD in female attraction\u201d involves a disturbing fixation with physical violence. Blanc proudly posts photos across social media of him propositioning women in chokeholds using the hashtag \u201c#ChokingGirlsAroundTheWorld\u201d.  In a video that has amassed over 50,000 views (and since switched to \u201cprivate\u201d), he teaches men how to sexually assault women in Japan, where he is apparently headed in two weeks. \u201cJust go through Tokyo, grab girls and yell \u2018Pikachu\u2019 and put her head on your dick\u201d, Blanc instructs his audience before showing footage of himself doing just that. This is nothing short of a lesson teaching how to rape.            Asian women, consistently hypersexualised by western culture, have long been the targets of a predatory, booming sex-tourism industry. White western men travel to Asian countries to sexually exploit women on whom they project their orientalist, racist fetishes. In doing so, he actively instructs men to exploit their white male status to assault women, declaring that \u201cif you\u2019re a white male, you can do what you want\u201d.  That Blanc can sustain a profitable business out of promoting sexual violence with total impunity is a testament to the extent to which our society accepts rampant rape culture and abusive attitudes towards women. These men epitomise the rabid culture of male entitlement and the toxic social enabling of violent hypermasculinity that puts women in danger every day. Here in Australia, one woman is killed by her own male partner every week. The leading cause of death, disability and ill health for women aged 15-44 is intimate partner violence. Just yesterday it was acknowledged by the nation\u2019s police commissioners that vulgar attitudes towards women are the primary cause of such abominations, and yet men like Blanc are able to commit and even teach sexual violence unrestrained. These \u201cpick-up artists\u201d hunt women as sport, referring to women as \u201cgame\u201d. This is how sexual violence becomes normalised. Backlash has mounted rapidly. Japanese activists have been warning women and the hashtag #takedownjulienblanc has been circulated widely. Most significantly, Hotel Como Melbourne this morning announced its decision to cancel Blanc\u2019s planned seminar this week after an online petition generated over 10,000 signatures and hundreds of social media posts pressured the hotel to refuse Blanc the venue.  Blanc has several more seminars planned in Australia this month and again in December, for which the venues are yet to be made public. Once they are publicised, they can expect the same public backlash and PR disaster. As the public campaign against Blanc has made clear, this man and his company\u2019s business are based on a heinous model of promoting rape culture under a phony label of \u201cpick-up artistry\u201d to sanitise and normalise their behaviour.  For now, refusing him yet more platforms for his harmful views should be of the utmost priority to send the resounding message that the promotion and glorification of sexual violence is unacceptable."}, {"sentences": ["It was supposed to represent a dynamic future vision for Tokyo, flaring up out of the city\u2019s Meiji Jingu park in sinuous white arcs.", "\u201cThe sight left me in despair,\u201d he writes, having seen the revised scheme at a current exhibition at Tokyo\u2019s Opera City Art Gallery.", "\u201cIf the stadium gets built the way it is, Tokyo will surely be burdened with a gigantic white elephant.\u201d     Zaha Hadid\u2019s original design for the Tokyo Olympic stadium, unveiled in 2012, which has since been scaled down by a quarter.", "The London-based, Iraqi-born architect says the scheme is the result of \u201cthree decades of research into Japanese architecture and urbanism,\u201d and promises it will be an \u201cintegral element of Tokyo\u2019s urban fabric, directly engaging with the surrounding cityscape\u201d.", "\u201cIts precious green space serves as an oasis for Tokyoites and visitors alike.", "Image: ZHA    Arata Isozaki, meanwhile, who dreamt up visions of gargantuan \u201cskytrees\u201d sprouting across Tokyo in the 1960s, is keen to revive the \u201cdynamism\u201d of Hadid\u2019s original design.", "\u201cBy doing so, we can create a new format for the Olympics of the 21st century, here in Tokyo.\u201d In a statement, Zaha Hadid\u2019s practice said: \u201cAll projects around the world go through this process of design evolution."], "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Zaha Hadid", "Japan", "Sport", "Culture", "Asia Pacific", "Cities", "Tokyo Olympic Games 2020", "Olympic Games", "Heritage"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-06T09:47:02Z", "title": "Zaha Hadid's Tokyo Olympic stadium slammed as a 'monumental mistake' and a 'disgrace to future generations'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/nov/06/zaha-hadids-tokyo-olympic-stadium-slammed-as-a-monumental-mistake-and-a-disgrace-to-future-generations", "article": "It was supposed to represent a dynamic future vision for Tokyo, flaring up out of the city\u2019s Meiji Jingu park in sinuous white arcs. But Zaha Hadid\u2019s design for the 2020 Olympic stadium has been subjected to a two-year tirade of criticism, alterations and budget cuts \u2013 and it\u2019s now facing its fiercest public attack yet. After viewing the revised stadium designs, which were scaled down by a quarter in July following a 40% reduction in budget, one of the country\u2019s most eminent architects, 83-year-old Arata Isozaki, has launched a blistering assault against the project, declaring it to be a \u201cmonumental mistake\u201d and warning it will be a \u201cdisgrace to future generations\u201d. In a lengthy open letter to the Japan Sports Council, the government body in charge of plans for the 2020 games, Isozaki rails against the \u201cdistorted\u201d process that has led to \u201ca dull, slow form, like a turtle waiting for Japan to sink so that it can swim away\u201d. \u201cThe sight left me in despair,\u201d he writes, having seen the revised scheme at a current exhibition at Tokyo\u2019s Opera City Art Gallery. \u201cIf the stadium gets built the way it is, Tokyo will surely be burdened with a gigantic white elephant.\u201d     Zaha Hadid\u2019s original design for the Tokyo Olympic stadium, unveiled in 2012, which has since been scaled down by a quarter. Image: ZHA    It is the latest chapter in a saga that has seen the design subject to widespread opposition, led by a number of Japan\u2019s leading architects. Shortly after the project was unveiled, 86-year-old Pritzker Prize winner Fumihiko Maki organised a symposium to protest against the scheme, joined by Toyo Ito, Kengo Kuma and Sou Fujimoto, resulting in a petition that called for the project to be scrapped, which has since gained 32,000 signatures of support. Located in the historic outer gardens of the Meiji Shrine, on the site of the existing 50,000-capacity 1964 Olympic national stadium, Hadid\u2019s 80,000-seat venue is planned to writhe across the park in her trademark style of intertwining white sinews, with broad arches rising up to 70m high. The London-based, Iraqi-born architect says the scheme is the result of \u201cthree decades of research into Japanese architecture and urbanism,\u201d and promises it will be an \u201cintegral element of Tokyo\u2019s urban fabric, directly engaging with the surrounding cityscape\u201d. Yet opponents have pointed out it is grossly out of context, looking like a gigantic bicycle helmet plonked down in the gardens, and standing in flagrant breach of the 15m height limit in force in the area. \u201cI\u2019m saying it\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d says Maki, who designed the neighbouring National Gymnasium in 1990, over which Hadid\u2019s scheme will loom. \u201cWe are raising our voices, but they don\u2019t listen. We are not a civil society where citizen voices can be critical.\u201d         A virtual fly-through around the original design    Responding to outcries of profligate public spending, the JSC reduced the approved budget from 300bn yen (\u00a31.8bn) to 169bn yen (\u00a3970m) last year, after sports minister Hakubun Shimomura described it as \u201ctoo massive a budget\u201d. The revised designs, says Hadid\u2019s practice, will \u201coptimise the investment and make the stadium even more efficient, user-focused, adaptable and sustainable\u201d. Remaining more expensive than any other Olympic stadium in recent years \u2013 standing at twice the size of the London Olympic stadium, despite holding the same number of seats \u2013 the downsized scheme has done little to appease the project\u2019s critics. \u201cThe new stadium design, though scaled back from the original, is still a mammoth totally out of sync with its verdant surroundings,\u201d says Nobuko Shimizu, chair of the Custodians of the National Stadium group, which is battling to save the existing venue. Over the summer they organised a protest that drew over 500 people marching in support of keeping the existing stadium. \u201cThe historic area has been carefully conserved with strict building height limits for any construction in the area,\u201d writes Shimizu in another open letter to the JSC. \u201cIts precious green space serves as an oasis for Tokyoites and visitors alike. The planned 70-metre-high new stadium with its affiliated facilities will inevitably decimate the landscaping and greenery in this area.\u201d The group has proposed an alternative plan, drawn up by fellow Pritzker Prize-winning architect, Toyo Ito, to adapt and reuse the existing national stadium on the site, citing the Olympic Movement\u2019s Agenda 21, paragraph 3. 2. 3, which states: \u201cA special effort must be made to encourage the best possible use of existing sports facilities, to keep them in good condition and to improve them by increasing safety and reducing their environmental impact.\u201d     The revised design, as seen from across the street. Image: ZHA    Arata Isozaki, meanwhile, who dreamt up visions of gargantuan \u201cskytrees\u201d sprouting across Tokyo in the 1960s, is keen to revive the \u201cdynamism\u201d of Hadid\u2019s original design. He has called for the architect to be sent back to the drawing board, taking into account the new conditions of the revised brief. In detailed recommendations accompanying his letter, Isozaki suggests that the fundamental problem with the stadium lies in its conception as the centrepiece of the opening ceremony. He says this celebratory bonanza should be held in a separate, purpose-built venue outside the city\u2019s Imperial Palace moat, using the Edo castle walls and keep as a dramatic backdrop. He says Kazuyo Sejima is the right architect for the job. \u201cThis is an opportunity to surpass the format of an opening ceremony on the main athletic field that has been standard ever since the 1936 Berlin Olympics,\u201d he writes. \u201cSuch a stage could capitalise on being live for the media age, addressing the 1 billion people watching on TV or online, not just the 100,000 or so people at the venue.\u201d Afterwards, he says, the grandstand could be dismantled into 50 parts for relocation to each of Japan\u2019s prefectures, contributing to the creation of parks or stadiums to commemorate the Olympics. \u201cBy doing so, we can create a new format for the Olympics of the 21st century, here in Tokyo.\u201d In a statement, Zaha Hadid\u2019s practice said: \u201cAll projects around the world go through this process of design evolution. The stadium\u2019s scheme design has been developed with our Japanese partners and responds to the revised brief issued by the client earlier this year.\u201d They added that the design requires no construction works or redevelopment costs for use after 2020, when it will be used for \u201cthe widest variety of sporting, cultural and community events\u201d. Responding to criticism last year, project architect Jim Heverin told Kyodo News: \u201cI don\u2018t think [the design] is something that you can decide by committee. The articulation, how [the design] manifests itself, really needs to come from a single vision, otherwise there won\u2018t be authorship, there won\u2018t be an authentic voice behind it.\u201d In Isozaki\u2019s eyes, design-by-committee is exactly what\u2019s happened, seeing the project \u201cstraying off course \u2026 leaving the organisers falling into a trap of their own making\u201d."}, {"sentences": ["A cluster of Japanese islands has become a potential flashpoint in already tense relations between Japan and China after Tokyo urged Beijing to crack down on a rise in illegal coral poaching by Chinese fishermen.", "The demand came as Japanese officials warned that Chinese poachers currently in the area would not be allowed to take refuge on the Ogasawara islands, located about 600 miles south of Tokyo, from a powerful typhoon expected to arrive later on Thursday.", "More than 200 Chinese fishing boats have been spotted in waters off the Ogasawara and Izu island chains in recent days, prompting calls for Tokyo to put more pressure on Beijing.", "Media reports said Japan had refused to agree to Chinese demands that Abe acknowledge the dispute over the islands as legitimate, and to guarantee that he would not visit Yasukuni, a controversial war shrine in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "China", "Coral", "Wildlife", "Marine life", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-06T11:45:35Z", "title": "Japan-China relations strained over illegal coral poaching", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/06/japanese-ogasawara-islands-china-coral-poaching-typhoon", "article": "A cluster of Japanese islands has become a potential flashpoint in already tense relations between Japan and China after Tokyo urged Beijing to crack down on a rise in illegal coral poaching by Chinese fishermen. The demand came as Japanese officials warned that Chinese poachers currently in the area would not be allowed to take refuge on the Ogasawara islands, located about 600 miles south of Tokyo, from a powerful typhoon expected to arrive later on Thursday. Japan has boosted its coastguard and police presence near the islands after observing a dramatic rise in the number of poachers searching for red coral in its exclusive economic zone. Chinese boats traditionally poached coral in the East China Sea and near the Japanese island of Okinawa, but are thought to have moved to the Ogasawara chain to escape beefed up security and to take advantage of calmer waters. Jewellery and ornaments made from the coral are popular among wealthy Chinese, with the price per gram having more than quadrupled over the past five years, according to the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun. More than 200 Chinese fishing boats have been spotted in waters off the Ogasawara and Izu island chains in recent days, prompting calls for Tokyo to put more pressure on Beijing. Members of the ruling Liberal Democratic party adopted a resolution this week calling on the government to lodge the strongest possible protest, adding that they were outraged by the \u201cbarbaric act of pulling out coral by the roots\u201d. The standoff will only add to tensions between the two countries as their leaders struggle to set up their first-ever bilateral meeting at next week\u2019s Apec summit in Beijing. The Kyodo news agency quoted diplomatic sources as saying that the prospects were dimming for an official summit between Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, although the two may hold informal talks lasting 10-15 minutes. The leaders have yet to meet due to long-standing disputes over the sovereignty of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea and Japanese attempts to sanitise its military\u2019s conduct on the Asian mainland before and during the second world war. Media reports said Japan had refused to agree to Chinese demands that Abe acknowledge the dispute over the islands as legitimate, and to guarantee that he would not visit Yasukuni, a controversial war shrine in Tokyo. Abe sparked anger in China and South Korea last December when he visited the shrine, where war criminals are among those honoured. Abe has been pushing for a summit with Xi for almost two years, but insists there must be no preconditions for talks. Chinese officials said they were taking measures to end the illegal harvesting of red coral. \u201cWe have asked the fishermen to carry out their operations at sea in accordance with the law,\u201d the Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters, adding that more would be done to enforce the ban. The potential for the standoff to further sour ties between Asia\u2019s two biggest economies was demonstrated late last month, when Japan\u2019s coastguard arrested a Chinese fisherman on suspicion of poaching coral after an 85-minute chase on the high seas."}, {"sentences": ["She was later mass-produced in Japan and there\u2019s now a shop in Tokyo dedicated to her."], "tags": ["Sophie Ellis-Bextor", "Toys", "Life and style", "Hobbies"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-07T10:53:49Z", "title": "Why collect dolls?

I have around 60 now: I don\u2019t do things by halves. When I was six, I collected stamps. I was inspired by my grandfather on my dad\u2019s side and my great-grandfather on my mum\u2019s side. They\u2019d get out their old stamp collections to show me, and I loved the pictures and the stories. At that age, I also loved wondering how valuable some of them might be. I fantasised that I\u2019d be very wealthy if I collected the right ones. In the end, I grew out of stamps. I found it too serious \u2013 maybe that\u2019s why I got into dolls.     A Mouseketeer doll that Sophie bought from eBay. Photograph: David Levene/Guardian    Most of my dolls are cheap and cheerful, from car boot sales, charity shops and eBay. Archiving and categorising doesn\u2019t do it for me either. I\u2019m not precious about any of the things I collect. I wouldn\u2019t want anything in the house that the kids weren\u2019t allowed to touch. My dolls are all over the place: in our sitting room, the boys\u2019 rooms and the den. They\u2019re used to me having weird bits and bobs lying around. The eldest has even got into collecting. He\u2019s currently after a 1980s Beetlejuice toy.     \u2018They all have a personality and a charm,\u2019 says Sophie. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian for the Guardian    Friends come round, look at the dolls and say: \u201cI couldn\u2019t have that in my room, it\u2019s so spooky,\u201d and I say: \u201cCalm down, it\u2019s only a doll.\u201d I like the bizarre way they look. Maybe they\u2019re a bit macabre but I find that amusing. I collect 50s and 60s picture books, postcards and posters, too, and I love the aesthetic of that era, the innocence of it, everything being picture perfect, neat and sweet. The dolls evoke that. I have had one or two arrive that were too weird even for me. I once found a clown doll on eBay from the Moscow Cat Theatre, famous for their \u201ccat performers\u201d and \u201ccat clowns\u201d. When the doll came, I thought: I can\u2019t keep this. He looked terrifying, big orange hair in a halo and a clown face. I had to give it away to a friend. I say I like the freaky ones but, really, what I like about my dolls is that they\u2019re a representation of humans. They all have a personality and a charm.     Blythe, Sophie\u2019s rare find and her favourite doll. Photograph: David Levene/Guardian    My favourite doll is Blythe. It was a quest to find her. She was only available in the shops for one year, 1972, a reject because the kids didn\u2019t like her. I came across her because someone in the States made a photographic book about her having all sorts of different adventures (Blythe by Gina Garan). She\u2019s an absurd-looking thing, with an enormous head in relation to her body, but I thought she looked cool in an odd way. One of my friends said she looks like me. It took me two years to find one that was in good condition but not too expensive. In the end, I paid around \u00a3200. She was later mass-produced in Japan and there\u2019s now a shop in Tokyo dedicated to her. I think the newer ones are worth \u00a3500-600 now but I never buy for the investment.     Sophie exchanged these dolls with a friend for a clown doll that was too weird for her. Photograph: David Levene/Guardian    I buy quite a lot of dolls on tour. I love Soviet-era dolls from Russia and Ukraine. I like their style. They\u2019re basic and quite unsentimental but there\u2019s a real quirk to them. I guess it helps if you\u2019re a bit geeky. I like reading about what I collect, finding out the history behind them. When I find a new doll to hunt for, it raises my endorphins, I get excited. I\u2019ll eventually find it and think: \u201cThat\u2019s too expensive, I know I can find it elsewhere\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the challenge and the joy. For me, collecting has got to be fun, so you can bring it into everyday life. I suppose I\u2019m an extrovert with my collecting. Some women collect shoes and dresses, I collect dolls \u2013 it\u2019s got to be showy in some way.

Three pint-sized teenage girls from Japan performing choreography in front of a band of middle-aged, heavy-metal session musicians and singing songs about their demands for chocolate. It\u2019s silly, and by rights a true metal fan should hate it. But as proven at July\u2019s Sonisphere festival, they don\u2019t. There were no bottles of piss hurled at Babymetal, a reception that has been lavished upon novelty rock-festival bookings from Daphne and Celeste to Kelly Osbourne. Instead a circle pit the size of Shinjuku opened, and that most genuine of metalhead welcomes \u2013 merry jocular violence \u2013 ensued.  In fact, they were so well received at Sonisphere and at a headline show at London\u2019s Forum that they\u2019re coming back for a victory lap, with enough support for them to play Brixton Academy. So why would anyone in Britain want to watch a sugar-coated, schoolgirl pop-metal group? Key Kobayashi, better known as Kobametal, the group\u2019s producer, pins their success on Babymetal\u2019s alternative to the male, white norm: \u201cRock music hasn\u2019t changed much over its history,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen a group from the other side of the world suddenly appears playing something so weird, it captures your attention.\u201d       The video for their breakthrough song Gimme Chocolate!! has generated 17m YouTube views since it was published in February 2014. Clad in medieval corsets and frilly black and red miniskirts, 16-year-old Suzuka Nakamoto (Su-Metal) and 15-year-olds Moa Kikuchi (Moametal) and Yui Mizuno (Yuimetal) dance super-cute choreography in front of a giant statue of the Virgin Mary, backed by musicians in skeleton outfits, as a vast sea of fans throw their hands into a modified version of the devil horns based on the Fox God, the divine entity credited with selecting Babymetal to pursue a Bill &amp; Ted-like quest to reunite the world with the power of metal. The video ends with the baffling invitation to \u201csee you in the mosh\u2019sh pit\u201d.   As outrageous as their aesthetic may be, their self-titled 2014 album has been a serious contender in the metal world: it topped the metal charts on iTunes around the world, despite the band being signed only in Japan and their lyrics being in Japanese; the queue at their recent New York show wrapped halfway around the block of 34th Street and 9th Avenue; genre giants from Slayer to Metallica to Anthrax have fallen over themselves to take photos with the girls backstage at festivals. \u201cIf Babymetal had been American, you can bet they would have been laughed right off the planet, but there is something truly unique about Japanese entertainment that it can get away with peddling something that\u2019s a bit ludicrous and unthinkable,\u201d says Stephen Daultrey, music editor at extreme-culture magazine Bizarre. \u201cIt\u2019s fascination, really \u2013 we\u2019re just too fascinated by Babymetal to even care whether they\u2019re good or not, or that they were manufactured.\u201d      Babymetal at Sonisphere. Photograph: Dana (distortion) Yavin    The artificial nature of their formation is no secret, however. In fact, the three members had no interest in metal before joining the group, nor did they even know what it was. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in a moshpit,\u201d admits Yuimetal.\u201cI think I\u2019d get smashed to bits.\u201d Instead, they came to the project as members of junior-high girl group Sakura Gakuin (of which Yuimetal and Moametal are still members) and had ambitions of becoming stars in Japan\u2019s booming \u201cidol pop\u201d industry, composed of extremely youthful manufactured groups, who must appear saccharine, innocent and cute at all times. In an effort to get their groups noticed in this crowded field, talent agencies and labels are trying all sorts of weird fusions to capture a slice of the growing domestic market of loyal obsessive fans known as otaku \u2013 stay-at-home pop-culture nerds whose disposable income fuels the anime, manga and idol-music industries. The results, of which Babymetal are one, are sometimes as thrilling and experimental as they are absurd. Check out the sensory overload of Momoiro Clover Z, whose song Roudou Sanka was written by the Go! Team\u2019s Ian Parton; and Dempagumi.inc, whose demented cover of Sabotage is equal parts Beastie Boys and Banana Splits.  Babymetal have progressed beyond the idol genre, though: \u201cWhen we started out we only played at idol festivals, but now it\u2019s like this weird mix where they react partly like an idol crowd and partly like a rock crowd,\u201d says Su-Metal. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos.\u201d  The band now describe themselves as kawaii metal, kawaii meaning \u201ccute\u201d in Japanese. A recent show I saw at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, near Tokyo, drew 9,000 fans, most of whom were not otaku but regular rock kids, adhering to metal\u2019s time-honoured dress code of black T-shirts and sweat. Once you get past the initial hilarity of a Babymetal show, the quality of the music begins to emerge: wildly supersonic guitar solos, doom-laden organs, industrial dual-pedal kickdrums, the lot. Lead singer Su-Metal may be pint-sized, but she\u2019s a commanding presence on stage, her aloof vocal style well suited to their metal melodies. Producer Kobametal fuses the heavy sound he has loved since childhood with the idol pop that is ruling the charts in Japan right now. It sounds cynical \u2013 it is cynical \u2013 but it\u2019s also made with care. \u201cBeing schoolgirls means they can only work in the studio till 8pm, but the girls know they\u2019d never get away with cutting corners,\u201d Kobametal notes.     Babymetal in London. Photograph: Dana (distortion) Yavin    Lyrically, if you don\u2019t speak Japanese, you\u2019re missing out. Yes, there are singalong English bits in Gimme Chocolate!!, but some of Babymetal\u2019s Japanese lyrics are delightfully tongue-in-cheek. Onedari Daisakusen (which translates as Manipulation Strategy) offers practical advice to teens on how to extract extra pocket money from one\u2019s father with a well-timed shoulder-massage/flattery combo, though you could also read it as a knowing insight into how idol groups titillate their core fanbase of otaku men with fat wallets and Lolita fetishes.  Being a teen group, they have some love songs, but more often the lyrics cut a little deeper. Megitsune (Vixen) is about the beguiling power women wield over men, while Ijime, Dame, Zettai (or Bullying, Unacceptable, Absolutely) pleads with the listener to not stand by while someone is being bullied.  \u201cMy friends tell me I\u2019m like a different person [in Babymetal] than when I\u2019m in class,\u201d smiles Yuimetal. Moametal adds: \u201cMy friends were quite envious that we performed with Lady Gaga [with whom the band toured the US], but they\u2019re also so supportive. They sing Babymetal songs whenever we go to karaoke.\u201d Citing the limitations of balancing school life with touring schedules as one reason, Kobametal says he doesn\u2019t plan to go chasing overseas success. He says the girls might have a go at recording some songs in English, but if it sounds rubbish they\u2019ll stick to what they do best and see where it leads them. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached fans around the world without localising anything, and the fact that Babymetal sound different from other metal bands is what people like about us,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019ve come to think that perhaps we should stay as we are.\u201d  Babymetal play on 8 November at the O2 Academy Brixton, London.

Then the director shows you what replaced that building and the others that had once stood around it: the giant bowl of a new sports stadium, rimmed with flagpoles, fit for a modern age. If the organisers of the 2020 Games are planning a new version of Tokyo Olympiad, the cameras of Ichikawa\u2019s successor will be trained on that same stadium early next year, watching the construction crews move in to create the space for a replacement already surrounded by a controversy that intensified this week. In its elegant simplicity and satisfying symmetry, and its sense of being open to the elements of nature in which the Games\u2019 track and field events take place, Mitsuo Katayama\u2019s stadium, opened in 1958, echoed the places where the citizens of ancient Greece assembled to watched their sporting heroes. But probably more has happened to architecture in general, and to the design of sports stadiums in particular, in the past half-century than in the 1,900 years between the building of the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens and the first Tokyo stadium. That\u2019s certainly how it feels when you look at the artist\u2019s impression of Dame Zaha Hadid\u2019s design for 2020, a swoopy dome slashed with vents, which has been compared many times to a squashed cycling helmet \u2013 the kind with a small peak worn by mountain bikers \u2013 but from above also resembles an inert spermatozoon. Like everything designed by Hadid, an Iraqi-born architect trained and based in London, it is a statement of the possibilities of architecture as much as a reaction to the requirement of the brief, which also requires it to be ready to welcome 80,000 spectators for the final of the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Since she succeeded in overcoming early resistance to her work and finally got her projects built, she has shown that sometimes the result can achieve the desired transcendence. In the past few years she has done well in the field of sport. Her ski-jump tower and ramp at Innsbruck, host to the annual Four Hills championship, and the railway stations that link to it, manage to leap out of the Tyrolean landscape while seeming integral to it \u2013 \u201clike ice dribbles\u201d, she has said. Her spectacular aquatics centre was part of the presentation that won the 2012 Olympic bid for London, although its aesthetics were severely compromised during the event by the need to add temporary grandstands. Its reception was also cooled by the knowledge it had run massively over budget \u2013 from an original figure of \u00a375m to a final total of \u00a3269m, not all of it the result of specification changes. Her critics claimed the increased cost was also generated by her habit of dreaming up the shape of her building first and worrying later about how the structural engineers were going to get it built. Unfavourable comparisons were made with London\u2019s velodrome, which came in on budget at \u00a390m and made at least as satisfactory an aesthetic impression. Since the aquatics centre\u2019s unsightly temporary structures were removed, however, and the swimming pool was opened to the public, its users now have the benefit of a exhilarating facility whose shape, like that of a dolphin arrested in mid-leap, is an adornment to the landscape of the Olympic Park. And for locals there is the benefit of a 10-lane 50m pool and a 25m diving pool \u2013 with its three platforms like matching electric toothbrush chargers in his, hers and child\u2019s sizes \u2013 for use at less than a fiver an hour for adults at peak times. So, for all the controversy that surrounded a cost increase that seemed to symbolise the uncontrolled spending on London 2012 as a whole, Hadid\u2019s project turns out to have a satisfactory legacy. That may be of some comfort to the organisers of the 2020 Olympics as they contemplate the row that blew up this week when an eminent 83-year-old Japanese architect, Arata Isozaki, issued fierce criticisms of Hadid\u2019s design for Tokyo, calling for something more appropriate to its setting. Other leading Japanese architects, led by the 86-year-old Fumihiko Maki, had already gathered 32,000 signatures on a petition of protest. Given that Japan\u2019s architects have a considerable reputation to protect, the obvious countercharge is one of jealousy. Hadid\u2019s commission came as a result of her victory in a competition judged by a 10-man panel of whom the only non-Japanese members were two Britons: Sir Norman Foster \u2013 the designer of the new Wembley \u2013 and Sir Richard Rogers. A round of cost-cutting has already forced Hadid to modify her design in order to reduce the budget from an extraordinary \u2013 let\u2019s say obscene \u2013 \u00a31.8bn down to \u00a3970m, which is still almost twice that of London\u2019s flat-pack 2012 main stadium. The revised design, although lower than the original 70m height, still mocks the 15m limit that is supposed to govern the Meiji Jingu Park area, which includes a famous 100-year-old Shinto shrine. It is hard to take an unambivalent view of Hadid\u2019s work. Her most breathtaking building, the Heydar Aliyev Centre in Baku, was built to the glory of a thoroughly unpleasant regime. Her addition to the Serpentine Sackler Gallery in Hyde Park is like something scrawled on the back of an envelope and tossed to an assistant for completion via parametric design software. Big architecture is seldom neutral in impact \u2013 when it is, it usually isn\u2019t much good \u2013 and the stadiums for Olympic Games and World Cups occupy a particularly exposed place in our world. However many years\u2019 notice the planners are given, they are seldom able to make accurate budget projections or to devise a long-term plan for future use. Amid the gnashing of teeth over the extra expenditure incurred in converting the London 2012 stadium before making a virtual present of it to a Premier League football club, perhaps we should be grateful it has not shared the fate of Santiago Calatrava\u2019s lovely Athens 2004 stadium, now a wasteland, or even Beijing\u2019s 2008 Bird\u2019s Nest, designed by Herzog and de Meuron in collaboration with the artist Ai Weiwei but today not much more than a tourist attraction. Once you get past the stuff about \u201cperceptual density\u201d and \u201cvectors of transformation\u201d, Hadid\u2019s Tokyo stadium raises all the old questions about finding the right balance between human ambition and the proper use of resources. And by insisting on infusing her designs with such blatant drama, she forces us to join a worthwhile debate."}, {"sentences": ["Photograph: Carleton E Watkins/Department of Special Collections, Stanford University Libraries    What we learned this week Jonathan Jones wants UK museums to return their \u2018cultural booty\u2019 Australia is churning out stunning buildings year after year Your animal artworks are seriously good The people of Detroit still believe in their future The world\u2019s most extreme performance artists were photographed by Manuel Vason Zaha Hadid is still getting flak for her Tokyo Olympic stadium designs New Anthony Gormleys are going to crop up all over the UK William Klein told us about his return to New York And finally \u2026 Follow us on Twitter Share your pencil drawings with us for our Share Your Art feature"], "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Painting", "Sculpture", "Photography", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-07T14:10:16Z", "title": "Allen Jones riles and Peder Balke chills \u2013 the week in art", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/07/allen-jones-peder-balke-week-in-art", "article": "Exhibition of the Week: Allen Jones The most controversial of 1960s British pop artists brings his sexually charged art into the 21st century with a retrospective that may cause a few fireworks.\u2022 Royal Academy, London W1J from 13 November until 25 January.

The pipes and pylons operator, which once described its property portfolio as \u201ca well-kept embarrassing secret\u201d, is teaming up with homebuilder Berkeley to build 14,000 new homes inside the M25 over the next 15 years. The plan means that some of the capital\u2019s eye-catching gas holders, built by the Victorians but out of use since the 1960s, will be demolished to make way for houses and parks, transforming 84 acres of disused brownfield land into public space. The first houses will be finished in 2017 at sites in Battersea and Rickmansworth. Twenty areas will be developed, with the final homes in Beckton expected to be completed by the early 2030s. National Grid last year began demolishing the Victorian gas holders at Battersea, known as telescopic gasometers because the inner chamber rose and fell as gas volumes changed. Their demolition, set to be complete at the end of the year, is part of a broader transformation of industrial Battersea that has seen the art deco, Grade II-listed power station transformed into luxury apartments. One apartment was bought last month by Sting and the development is being marketed at glamorous events in Los Angeles, New York, Paris and Tokyo. A three-bedroom flat in the power station development, including river views, membership of a private residents\u2019 club, on-site restaurants and cinemas, is on sale for \u00a33.6m. Affordable homes are still on the drawing board for a later stage of the development. National Grid\u2019s joint venture, called St William, will make the company one of the country\u2019s top 10 housebuilders and is expected to create 5,500 jobs. Around 2,000 (30%) of the first 7,000 homes will be classed as affordable \u2013 short of the 50% target for new developments set by the mayor of London, Boris Johnson. But Rob Perrins, managing director of the Berkeley Group, said the affordability mix was well balanced for the \u201cquite low-value areas\u201d, such as next to the Blackwall tunnel and Bethnal Green and Bow, all in the east of the capital. \u201cSome of these areas are challenging areas to develop,\u201d he said. \u201cThese sites have to be decontaminated, we are building two schools \u2026 there is going to be open space. It is a very good, affordable offer on contamination sites.\u201d The development \u201cwill make a substantial difference to the shortfall in London,\u201d he added. With enormous demand for housing in London and the south-east the developments may be welcomed by local authorities and struggling buyers. According to the mayor\u2019s office, London needs to build 42,000 homes a year for the next 20 years to cope with soaring demand as the city\u2019s population climbs to 10 million. National Grid is concentrating re-development efforts on London, where property prices are highest. But across the country it has nearly 500 disused industrial sites spread over more than 700 acres. Some of these sites are also being converted, but none on the same scale. Last year, National Grid, announced plans to demolish 76 gas holders at a cost of \u00a379m. During the interwar years, almost every town had a gas holder, sometimes called a gasometer, but most fell into disuse in the 1960s following the discovery of North Sea gas and advances in pipeline technology. Some gasometers are likely to be spared demolition and will become part of the new St William developments. The deal was announced as National Grid published its latest financial results, revealing a 12% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a31.2bn in the six months to the end of September. Operating profits at National Grid\u2019s UK electricity business rose sharply, up 22% on last year, fuelling concerns that the company is benefiting from a lax price-control system at the expense of bill payers. A new eight-year pricing regime introduced last year, by the regulator Ofgem, has been condemned as too lenient. Steve Holliday, National Grid\u2019s chief executive, defended the increase, saying the company had invested \u00a31.6bn in new infrastructure over the six-month reporting period. \u201cWe are investing enormous sums of capital in ensuring that we have modern, reliable, efficient energy networks. We clearly need to make as much as we are investing and that is what we are doing.\u201d But the Conservative MP Tim Yeo, a former chair of the energy and climate change select committee, said the company\u2019s results \u201creinforce concerns that the [price-regime] settlement is too generous to National Grid\u201d. Holliday said it was a \u201creally clever\u201d, rigorously scrutinised scheme that tied efficiencies at National Grid to customers\u2019 bills. \u201cFor every pound we are able to save, 50 pence goes back to customers. As we find new innovations and efficiencies all of those benefits are shared with customers.\u201d He promised that National Grid\u2019s contribution to consumers\u2019 energy bills would not rise in real terms for seven years. \u201cOur contribution to the electricity bill is \u00a320 \u2026 and that figure will be essentially flat right out until 2021.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Ueshima, a chain of coffee shops in Tokyo, has sturdier chairs, wider aisles, lower tables and bigger print on the menus."], "tags": ["Ageing", "Life and style", "Family"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-09T00:05:04Z", "title": "The UK is an ageing society \u2013 so maybe it\u2019s time to start seriously catering for people\u2019s needs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/09/ageing-britain-time-to-cater-peoples-needs", "article": "Falling birthrates and the lengthening lives of baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964 produce an extraordinary statistic. On current trends, from now until 2037, while the numbers of those aged 15 to 64 in the UK will grow on average by 29,000 a year, the numbers of people aged 65 and over will rise by 278,800 a year, according to the thinktank International Longevity Centre \u2013 UK. That includes an expanding slice of the \u201coldest old\u201d, those aged 85-plus. The Queen has already hired extra staff to dish out birthday cards to centenarians.     UK population structure in 2000 and in 2040. Graphic: Giulio Frigieri/Guardian   The World Health Organisation estimates that globally, for the first time in history, the number of people aged 65 and over will, by 2050, outnumber children aged five and under. According to Age UK, there are nearly 14.7 million over-60s, almost 23% of the population, in the UK. . Some have plenty of money to spend, others are anchored in poverty, but all share needs, interests and challenges that culturally and commercially are already changing the shape of society \u2013 often without us even being aware. The \u201csilver economy\u201d has become all the more attractive to the marketplace because next year compulsory annuities are axed, and would-be retirees can withdraw their entire pension pot in one go, if they so choose. The scale of this demographic change is unprecedented in history. Ready for Ageing?, a report by the select committee on public services and demographic change published last year, said that despite the scale of the change under way, already triggering a crisis in health and social care, we are \u201cwoefully underprepared\u201d for what has been called \u201cthe age to come\u201d. Professor Laura L Carstensen, director of the US Stanford Centre on Longevity, says scientific evidence shows that the older people become, the less like one another they grow, a challenge for those who see ageing as uniformly about decline and frailty. The variability is not based on good luck or genes: \u201cRather it reflects a range of behavioural, social, economic and occupational factors that, at their core, stem from differences in education and social class.\u201d The better-educated and more affluent offer a treasure trove of assets to society, but poverty, harsh working conditions and long-term stress exact a terrible toll on others. How we meet the task of ensuring fair and equitable ageing for all means we have to start young, investing in good education and skills from an early age. We will also need to set aside a fondness for stereotypes and try to understand the lives of older people. For instance, 80% of the UK population is urbanised, but more than 75% of people aged over 65 live in rural areas. Yet innovation hasn\u2019t begun to catch up. The global spending power of the baby boomer generation will reach $15tn (\u00a39.6tn) by 2020, Euromonitor has forecast. Consumer spending among those over 60 rose 50% more quickly than for those under 30 in the past two decades, according to Eurostat. Age UK says over-65s in the UK spend \u00a32.2bn a week on goods and services \u2013 but are they being properly served? Understanding of who spends what, when and why is patchy. Advertising persists in pitching products for the older market using models barely past 30. A number of today\u2019s baby boomers stay fitter as they age, wish to remain in work for much longer, and may be part of an intergenerational household living with children and grandchildren, able to spend more on holidays, cars and entertainment than they ever could in their youth. Others are isolated, broke and in need of intensive support for chronic diseases. Telemedicine delivered to their home, in which a person monitors their own care, is often offered as a solution, but that may intensify a sense of isolation that does its own damage. Action by central government is still in its infancy; housing, for instance, that can expand to accommodate a dependent relative, or tax incentives to encourage an older person to downsize, and public spaces geared to accommodate the older as well as the younger person. At the same time, research tells us that, as people move into their 60s, when it might be wise to prepare for a major transition in life in which health and long-term conditions such as diabetes could become an issue and voluntary work and hobbies more important, many prefer to avoid looking to the future. Change may be on the way. In the US, where there are 77 million baby boomers, the International Council on Active Aging will begin a three-day conference on 13 November. Colin Milner, its founder, says half of all money spent in North America is by the over-50s, yet 95% of the marketing dollar is spent on people aged 30 and younger. The axis has yet to turn. Last week Barratt Developments, Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder, announced it was changing how it designs, locates and markets some of its homes to tap into the baby-boomer market. Three-quarters of over-60s own their own homes, compared with less than a third of those aged 25 to 34. Downsizing is what many older people are doing to provide a roof over the heads of their children; that has to be made easier. According to David Sinclair of the International Longevity Centre \u2013 UK, products and services are already being covertly adapted to suit an older population, with a wider benefit to all. Amazon has spent heavily on redesigning packaging. Google increased the size of its entry box. Oxo created tools for the arthritic that were aesthetically pleasing enough to appeal to all. Ueshima, a chain of coffee shops in Tokyo, has sturdier chairs, wider aisles, lower tables and bigger print on the menus. Sinclair argues small is beautiful \u2013 and more attention should be paid to products for less than a fiver that can transform a life. \u201cWe know bath rails reduce falls, yet they are not in people\u2019s homes as a matter of course. A plug that changes colour when the water is too hot and empties the bath to avoid flooding costs less than \u00a35, but how do you market on issues we don\u2019t want to know about, such as ageing and vulnerability?\u201d As we age, perception, cognition and control of movement are all affected. A sense of taste and smell diminishes, factors that could influence the design of a restaurant, for instance, and a choice of food for those who have the money to spend. The solution is not an exclusive ghetto, such as the \u201csenior\u201d gated villages of the past, but a design for life for those growing older that also includes the young. As Michael Shea, author of The Freedom Years: Tactical Tips for the Trailblazing Generation, writes of ageing: \u201cFailing to prepare is preparing for failure.\u201d     Age no limit: future cars with the technology to aid older drivers are now being developed.

After that, life may continue for two or more decades for women (less for men), but illness and impairment may be features.

Abe was in China, along with other world leaders, including the US and Russian presidents, Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin, to participate in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit\u2019s economic leaders\u2019 meeting, two days of high-powered talks at a lakeside resort in Beijing\u2019s far-northeastern mountains.He and Xi met at the Great Hall of the People, a massive granite reception hall abutting Tiananmen Square, at 11.50am on Monday, hours before an economic meeting hosted by Xi. During an awkward handshake before the meeting, both leaders looked dour and resigned, a clear indication that feelings between the two countries remain raw. Abe said he asked Xi to establish a hotline aimed at preventing armed clashes over conflicting claims by the countires to a string of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, called the Diaoyu by China and the Senkakus by Japan. \u201cI asked him that we implement a maritime communication mechanism, and I think we will start working on concrete steps toward it,\u201d he told Japanese media in Beijing after the half-hour summit. But a Japanese official said the islands were not specifically mentioned during the meeting, Japan\u2019s Kyodo news agency reported. The Chinese government has not yet commented on the meeting. Since 2012, diplomatic relations between the two countries have been frozen over the islands issue. Both sides have repeatedly scrambled fighter jets in response to perceived incursions, raising tensions so high that observers have feared the possibility of armed clashes. Chinese state media have repeatedly cast Abe as a closet militarist. In January, a Chinese envoy called Japan the \u201cLord Voldemort\u201d of east Asia; Japan\u2019s ambassador to the UK called China Voldemort in return. In 2012, government-sanctioned anti-Japan riots broke out across China. In some cities, demonstrators burned Japanese cars and destroyed Japanese-owned storefronts. Monday\u2019s meeting \u201cwas on the cards for a couple of reasons\u201d, said Ronald Huiskin, an expert on east Asian security at Australia National University. Firstly, he said, the Apec meetings had given both governments a high-profile public relations opportunity, and neither wanted to appear excessively \u201cnegative and hardline\u201d. Secondly, Chinese authorities had \u201cgotten about as much out of Tokyo from the recent icy period as they were going to get\u201d.  \u201cBeijing has raised the bar with Tokyo in terms of what kinds of humiliation the Japanese will be willing to endure to see a stable relationship with Beijing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly obvious that Abe has done the running to try to get at Beijing. I don\u2019t think Xi Jinping has wasted as much time saying we have to make offers and draw a line under this particular episode. Whether this leads to anything of substance, who knows.\u201d Abe said before the trip that he hoped to develop relations by \u201cgoing back to the original spirit of a mutually beneficial strategic relationship\u201d, according to the Japan Times. \u201cMy wish is to improve Japan-China relations, and that wish hasn\u2019t changed since 2006, during my first administration.\u201d Last week, Abe told the Washington Post: \u201cThe China-Japan relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships. As far as the economy is concerned, we do have an inseparable relationship. Because we are neighbors, there are many problems. But because we do have problems, we should have a dialogue with each other without attaching any preconditions.\u201dAbe has not signalled that Japan will change its fundamental stance on the islands, however, and has not agreed to Chinese demands that he cease visits to Yasukuni shrine for the war dead. Beijing saw Abe\u2019s December 2013 visit to the shrine as a symbol of military aggression and a refusal to acknowledge the brutality of Japan\u2019s occupation of China during the second world war.

Rodney Fitch, who has died aged 76, became famous and rich in the \u201cdesign decade\u201d of the 1980s, but was only a loose fit with the popular idea of what a designer might be. In a period when red spectacle frames were not rare (I know, I had some), he often wore a tweed jacket and a jumper. Although a youthful and incarcerated CND supporter, he became a cricket-playing Thatcherite with a beautiful country house in Wiltshire and a taste for what his friend the interior designer Peter Glynn-Smith called \u201cDickensian\u201d Christmases. While some designers were inclined to posture, preen and develop absurd affectations (I know, I had some), Fitch was robustly populist, insisting that he preferred the high street\u2019s M&amp;S to the Tokyo fashion designer Issey Miyake. His \u201cshopping\u201d remark will go down in history as a marker of the zeitgeist, as surely as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u201cno such thing as society\u201d. Fitch was born in a modest part of Islington, north London, at a time when even its prosperous parts did not have much lustre. He maintained a slight, doggedly not toff, north London accent even when circumstances no longer required it. After failing his 11-plus, there was technical college in Willesden, where he learned shopfitting; the Central School of Arts and Crafts, where he studied set and television design; and national service. Following a brief and unhappy spell with an architectural practice that he found snooty, in 1963 Fitch joined Terence Conran\u2019s young Conran Design Group, then occupying offices in a crepuscular alley called Hanway Place, off Tottenham Court Road. This signalled two factors that defined Fitch\u2019s career. One, the clever transition from artisan shopfitting to creative design. (Another of Conran\u2019s influential lieutenants, the late Oliver Gregory, had also been trained as a shopfitter.) Two, the beginnings of an apex-predator competition between Fitch and Conran that lasted for the rest of his life.     Rodney Fitch designed the interiors of Heathrow airport\u2019s Terminal 4, which opened in 1986. Photograph: Ben Brooksbank    By 1968, Fitch was managing director of the Conran Design Group, then an integral part of Conran\u2019s Habitat shops. In 1969, Conran merged with the Ryman stationery business. The Burton Group then bought the lot. While Conran set about starting up a new design consultancy, Fitch stayed with the merged business, bought out the Conran Design Group in 1972 and renamed it Fitch &amp; Company. The Fitch business grew ambitiously, working on commercial interiors for the big names in British retailing. By 1982 he was confident enough to take the company public on the USM (unlisted securities market). Two years later he was on the Stock Exchange\u2019s main listing. Topshop, Debenhams, Asda and Dillons were made over in pursuit of his desire to give people better places in which to shop. Fitch did the interiors of the BAA\u2019s Terminal 4 at Heathrow airport, opened in 1986, to give people better places to hang about in. There were acquisitions: in 1987 he bought Benoy, an architectural firm specialising in shopping malls, and the following year he added product design to the portfolio with the US firm Richardson Smith. In 1990 he was appointed CBE. By the City\u2019s calculation of wealth, Fitch prospered impressively, and bought huge premises in King\u2019s Cross, north London. However, in the retail slump of the early 1990s, overheads soon exceeded income and Fitch was forced out of his own business; he suspected that Conran had had some influence. \u201cMy departure from Fitch plc was horrible,\u201d he said. One account had him pushing his bicycle away from King\u2019s Cross without being allowed time to blow up the tyres. But by every account, Fitch remained warm and human. Glynn-Smith said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t do pessimism. He always seemed very English to me, but always without a hint of pretension.\u201d His successor as managing director of what became Conran Associates, David Salter, said Fitch was \u201calways kind, courteous and relaxed in both victory and defeat\u201d. Fitch told Management Today he did not like the word \u201cdeal\u201d since he preferred to talk of \u201carrangements I\u2019ve made with mutually compatible people\u201d. Nonetheless, he proved adroit at both deals and arrangements. Sometimes they worked, sometimes they did not. Richard Branson rescued him in 1996 and an energetic period followed, mostly in Asia and the Middle East. Then the latest Fitch business was bought by Martin Sorrell\u2019s WPP in 2004, and he stepped down from it in 2010. There was no Fitch style: he saw design not as a form of art, but as a function of business: \u201cIt\u2019s a service, not an end in itself.\u201d Not a bookish man, he often recommended that young designers read Harry B Creswell\u2019s The Honeywood File (1929), a curio of architectural literature. However, Creswell, a pupil of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum architect Aston Webb, did not write a book about the abstract ideals of the Modern Movement, but rather an epistolary account in satiric mode of the ups and downs of architect-client relationships. Nor are there great Fitch monuments: while design aims at permanent values, retail is perforce temporary, a continuous revolution driven by the whimsical cycles of fashion. Instead, Fitch\u2019s great achievement was to realise contemporary possibilities to the full, adding a brisk and unflinching commercialism to the sometimes myopic nostrums of the inward-looking design establishment. Conran\u2019s Habitat had better rhetoric, but Fitch\u2019s Topshop had more customers. He gave enhanced shopping experiences, but he was pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter, not haute couture. On Fitch\u2019s website there is no mention of his association with Conran. When I asked Conran if he would like to contribute a comment to this piece, he said: \u201cWe had a slight falling-out. But Rodney was the best seller of design I have ever met.\u201d More a merchant than an artist? Who is to say if either is the lesser calling? The no-nonsense Fitch had a commitment to education and was influential on advisory and trustee boards including the Royal College of Art and the V&amp;A. From 2010, he was a popular professor at the Delft University of Technology, where his personal warmth, loathing of pomposity and anti-elitist instincts found a sympathetic audience. In 1965, Fitch married Janet Stansfield. She survives him, as do their son and four daughters. \u2022 Rodney Arthur Fitch, retail design entrepreneur, born 19 August 1938; died 20 October 2014"}, {"sentences": ["Scholarship and historical writings are typically focused on the legacy of the Nuremberg or the Tokyo trials or contemporary courts and tribunals."], "tags": ["International criminal court", "United Nations", "Soas", "Higher education", "Education", "War crimes", "Law", "International criminal justice", "International court of justice", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-11T12:02:49Z", "title": "Secret war crimes indictments of Nazis released after seven-year fight", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/nov/11/secret-war-crimes-nazis-soas-un-archive", "article": "Secret, internationally approved war crimes indictments of tens of thousands of Nazis have been released to researchers at Soas, University of London, after a seven-year fight, and will soon be made available to the public. The recovered \u201chidden history\u201d of the minutes and deliberations of the UN war crimes commission (UNWCC) reveal the inner workings of a largely forgotten international criminal justice initiative in which 16 states worked together in London on the investigation of more than 36,000 international criminal cases. The list of internationally approved war crimes indictments drawn up by the commission cover important modern categories of crimes, including aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity, modes of liability \u2013 including that of mid-level perpetrators - and international procedures, as well as the development of international criminal justice as a whole. Had the archive been more widely known, international law enforcers say it would have given them new understandings and legal precedents to use in international criminal justice trials. For example, rape and enforced prostitution were successfully prosecuted as war crimes in UNWCC-supported trials. But those sitting on tribunals set up after the genocides in Rwanda and Yugoslavia believed international law did not recognise those acts as war crimes and so were unable to extensively prosecute perpetrators. \u201cAs the first chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, I would have benefited immeasurably from access to this rich material,\u201d said Justice Richard Goldstone. \u201cThe fact was that the statutes for the two ad hoc tribunals did not refer to rape as a war crime save in the definition of crimes against humanity. In some cases we resorted to charging rape as a form of torture and in others as inhumane treatment. \u201cHad we been able to access the ample records of the UNWCC, our approach would have unquestionably been influenced by the careful analyses that emerged from its deliberations and decisions,\u201d he added. The UNWCC formed and began defining a list of new, internationally agreed war crimes at the Foreign Office on 20 October 1943. After the war, sufficient evidence of those crimes was found against 36,800 people, leading to trials by the US and major European nations, as well as China and India between 1945 and 1948. At least 2,700 accused persons eventually faced trial, receiving sentences ranging from imprisonment to the death penalty. The commission, however, was hastily wound up in 1948 and quickly forgotten \u2013 thanks to the US, which believed the trials were impeding Germany\u2019s rehabilitation. Since then, the UN archives have been accessible only to those who received personal authority from their government and permission from the UN secretary general. \u201cEven then, you weren\u2019t allowed to make notes or take copies of the documents,\u201d said Dan Plesch, director of the centre of international studies and diplomacy at Soas, formerly known as the School of Oriental and African Studies. Plesch, alongside Shanti Sattler, initiated the fight for the release of the UN archive in 2007. \u201cThere are many hidden histories in international criminal justice,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the record and practice of the UNWCC is the best-kept secret in the field. Scholarship and historical writings are typically focused on the legacy of the Nuremberg or the Tokyo trials or contemporary courts and tribunals. But the thousands of cases we can now access can reinforce international political will and practice in facing the crimes now being perpetrated in the Middle East and elsewhere.\u201d Plesch is seeking funding to make the 900-gigabyte archive available to the public. \u201cPublic access to trials of Nazis and Japanese for torture including stress positions and water boarding is likely to increase support for civilised values today,\u201d he said."}, {"sentences": ["His garish style, and its congruence with anime, tended to obscure Murakami\u2019s historical rigor (he holds a doctorate in traditional Japanese painting from Tokyo University of the Arts) as well as his political convictions."], "tags": ["Art and design", "Sculpture", "Art", "Culture", "Kanye West", "Japan disaster"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-11T17:29:38Z", "title": "Takashi Murakami review: a welcome return to a more disturbing style", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/11/takashi-murakami-review-gagosian-gallery-fukushima", "article": "The Japanese artist Takashi Murakami has become a divisive figure in the contemporary art world: hailed by some for his merging of high and low styles, reviled by others for his commercial slipperiness and taste for the media spotlight. His newest show, which opens this week in New York, may not win over all his detractors. But it will go a long way to convincing sceptics that the goofy-seeming Murakami is actually a serious artist \u2013 in this case, a deadly serious one. Murakami\u2019s exhibition In the Land of the Dead, Stepping on the Tail of a Rainbow represents a strong shift towards darker and bleaker subject matter from an artist who had grown a reputation \u2013 partly justified, partly not \u2013 for uncritical happiness and market complicity. It responds, obliquely but with verve and anger, to the Tohoku earthquake of March 2011, as well as the nuclear meltdown at Fukushima that resulted. The largest gallery features a giant sanmon, or sacred gate, modeled after gates from the Heian period (the ninth to 12th centuries AD) and, according to the artist, inspired by the titular gate of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s film Rash\u00f4mon. The gate incorporates his frequent motif of druggy, stupefied eyes, as do several paintings in which the giant eyeballs look like the centers of a nuclear blast. Three massive panoramas, whose narratives progress horizontally like a traditional scroll painting, incorporate angry divinities, distressed fish and dragons, and multiple tsunamis: of waves in one case, of human skulls in another.     Tan Tan Bo \u2013 In Communication, 2014. Photograph: Robert McKeever/Takashi Murakami/Kaikai Kiki Co/Gagosian gallery    Other, smaller paintings feature Murakami\u2019s familiar anime characters from decades past \u2013 such as Dob, the artist\u2019s big-eared alter ego \u2013 in states of trauma. In one case they seem to be collapsing from the effluvia of nuclear cooling towers. In another painting, whose background consists entirely of black skulls, the character Mr Pointy appears with a thought bubble that reads in part: \u201cWe feel the futility and sadness of war and yet we cannot atone for this inescapable human behavior.\u201d Murakami came to international prominence in the 1990s for his cartoonish paintings and sculptures \u2013 sometimes cloyingly cute, sometimes erotic and even perverse \u2013 in a style he called superflat. He also played with the Japanese subculture known as otaku, and its intense obsession with sexualized animated figures, in sculptures depicting a winsome girl with giant lactating breasts who uses strands of milk as a jump rope, or else a young blond man harnessing a gushing strand of semen as if it were a lasso.  His garish style, and its congruence with anime, tended to obscure Murakami\u2019s historical rigor (he holds a doctorate in traditional Japanese painting from Tokyo University of the Arts) as well as his political convictions. In his youth Murakami was an engaged anti-nuclear activist, and in his writings and exhibitions he often insisted on the legacy of the 1945 bombings, as well as Japan\u2019s US-written pacifist constitution, as antecedents for his art\u2019s traumatic cuteness.     The Golden Age: K\u014drin \u2013 Kansei, 2014. Photograph: Robert McKeever/Takashi Murakami/Kaikai Kiki Co/Gagosian gallery    But in 2002, Murakami took a sharp turn when he was invited to collaborate with Louis Vuitton, emblazoning the fashion label\u2019s leather goods with his cartoon characters, grinning sunflowers and googly eyes. It was one of the first mashups of high art and luxury that have now become omnipresent in an age of extreme wealth inequality \u2013 Tracey Emin purses at Longchamp, or Damien Hirst skulls and butterflies on Alexander McQueen frocks, were still to follow. Murakami\u2019s complicity, however, went even further than the department store: he began incorporating the LV monogram into his paintings, and even installed a Vuitton boutique in his retrospective at Los Angeles\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art. Unfortunate collaborations with Kanye West and Pharrell Williams further cemented the view that Murakami had abandoned any antagonistic flair. These new works mark a welcome return to a tougher and more disturbing style. The smiling flowers are still here in a few works, but they\u2019re modulated by backgrounds of skulls and dark, polluted rivers. The familiar cartoon characters seem in one large sculpture to be melting down, victims of a nuclear disaster or some other catastrophe. \u201cEven using the cute characters, I was trying to portray an apocalyptic world,\u201d Murakami remarked at the exhibition opening. \u201cBut maybe they\u2019re now morphing into something darker and more sinister.\u201d  Takashi Murakami: In the Land of the Dead, Stepping on the Tail of a Rainbow.

At the time of writing, nearly 18,000 people and counting have signed a petition to deny him a UK visa as well. Women, apparently, do not want to share a landmass with Julien Blanc. And you can\u2019t exactly blame us. Blanc is a self-styled \u201cpick-up artist\u201d, an odious brand of conman who specialises in \u201chelping\u201d lonely, desperate, socially inept men by turning them into repulsive, entitled, sexually aggressive creeps with horrible fashion sense. He\u2019s currently touring the globe leading expensive seminars and \u201cbootcamps\u201d in which he teaches sad sacks how to violate women\u2019s boundaries through persistence, psychological abuse or outright sexual violence. In one of Blanc\u2019s most widely publicised videos, \u201cWhite Male Fucks Asian Women in Tokyo (And the Beautiful Methods To It)\u201d (catchy title, bro), he describes \u201cseducing\u201d Japanese women with all the subtlety of a billygoat in rut: \u201cAt least in Tokyo, if you\u2019re a white male, you can do what you want. I\u2019m just romping through the streets, just grabbing girls\u2019 heads, just like, head, pfft on the dick. Head, on the dick, yelling, \u2018pikachu\u2019, with a pikachu shirt.\u201d Truly, a master of seduction. That anecdote, which Blanc finds so darling and educational, describes nothing short of a violent, racist sexual assault. (And you don\u2019t even have to use your imagination or take my word for it \u2013 he recorded his attacks on video, if you have the stomach.) Pick-up artist culture is steeped in the language of coercion, manipulation, and pseudoscientific mumbo jumbo: women are targets to be hunted, maths equations to be solved, literally objects to be \u201cpicked up\u201d. Its explicit objective is to disregard women\u2019s signals, and privilege men\u2019s desire over women\u2019s autonomy. In other words, SEXY. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hypnotise your sex\u00a0mongoose in no time, boys. Blanc is a sexual predator teaching sexual predation classes, and it\u2019s likely that many Australian women were spared uncomfortable, dehumanising, if not downright dangerous encounters with his \u201cstudents\u201d. The revocation of Blanc\u2019s visa is a powerful, institutional investment in women\u2019s safety. Taken alongside \u2013 just off the top of my head \u2013 the broad mainstream rejection of GamerGate\u2019s misogynist subterfuge, last week\u2019s near-universal revulsion at the harassment of ESPN reporter Cari Champion, this week\u2019s wicked trolling of accused serial rapist Bill Cosby, and the still resounding power of #YesAllWomen, I\u2019m wondering if women\u2019s safety isn\u2019t having a moment right now. If 2015 might be the year of sticking up for the goddamn ladies. It certainly seems like it. (And it\u2019s about time.) Over the weekend, I had coffee with Susie Lee, an artist who, with partner Katrina Hess, recently developed Siren, part art project, part online dating app. It\u2019s an interesting model that prioritises women\u2019s safety: if you\u2019re a woman, when you sign up and create your profile, you\u2019re invisible to 100% of the men on the site. You can see them, but they can\u2019t see you. As you browse, when you come across men you find interesting or attractive, you can make yourself visible to them. They get a notification and can then contact you, if they like you back. It\u2019s an incredibly simple idea that solves so many of the problems endemic to the traditional heterosexual dating model (they\u2019re currently working on a same-sex version too). Women\u2019s safety might be at Siren\u2019s heart, but everyone benefits. Men are forever complaining that they have to take all the \u201crisks\u201d by approaching women (there are some risks inherent in simply being a woman, but we can leave that one there for now), not knowing whether or not they\u2019ll be rejected, while women are constantly being harangued by sexually aggressive men in whom they have no interest. With Siren, men can only contact women they know are interested, and women can only be contacted by men they like. Everybody wins, it seems. Much like pick-up artistry\u2019s cynical legerdemain, traditional models of online dating exploit the masculine duty to barrel through women\u2019s boundaries, as well as the potent cultural conditioning that trains women to be nice, pliant, make ourselves available and be grateful for male attention. Siren, on the other hand, attempts to mirror the way that attraction generally works in real life: one person subtly signals interest, via eye contact or a smile, and the other person, feeling safe and emboldened by those signals, initiates a conversation. So why aren\u2019t men \u2013 especially the type of insecure, frightened rabbits drawn to pick-up artistry \u2013 lining up in droves for a safe, low-risk app like Siren? Why is there, in fact, angry pushback, like this website comment noted by Seattle newspaper the Stranger: \u201cIf a man can\u2019t see the merchandise, he ain\u2019t buying it ... I can go pretty much anywhere and decide whether or not I am visually interested in a woman WITHOUT her snarky permission to do so ... Men won\u2019t use this app and the user base will turn into a lonely, angry clam fest\u201d? Why would heterosexual men not want to look for dates in a clam fest? Isn\u2019t that what\u00a0you\u2019re there for? Clams? It\u2019s almost as though some men are really there for the power trip. Respect is only a hindrance if your goal is exploitation. There is no reason to object to Siren\u2019s design unless you specifically want to bother women who don\u2019t want to be contacted by you. Just like there\u2019s no reason to fear California\u2019s \u201cYes Means Yes\u201d bill unless you specifically want to have sex with women who don\u2019t say yes. And there is no reason to turn to pick-up artistry over actual human interaction unless you specifically don\u2019t want to interact with a human. But if what you really want is a date, then what are you so afraid of? Men\u2019s fun and women\u2019s safety aren\u2019t mutually exclusive."}, {"sentences": ["The ABC\u2019s 11 foreign bureaux will be hit hard by the Coalition\u2019s budget cuts, with plans to scale back the Tokyo, Bangkok, New Delhi and New Zealand offices.", "Sources said the restructure would save on the significant expense of employing a fully-staffed reporting team of journalists, camera operators and producers in Tokyo, Bangkok, New Delhi and New Zealand.", "\u201cIt seems idiotic to downgrade the role of the cameramen in Bangkok and Tokyo when they are an absolutely essential element of the coverage.", "To think that we might move to a model where we would have to survive without him is horrendous.\u201d In recent years the then-Tokyo correspondent, Mark Willacy, and his camera crew and producers were on the ground to cover the earthquake and tsunami, and subsequent nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima."], "tags": ["Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "Australia news", "Australian media", "Television & radio", "Television industry"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-12T00:05:19Z", "title": "ABC funding cuts target 11 foreign news bureaux, with 20 jobs facing axe", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/12/abc-funding-cuts-target-11-foreign-news-bureaux-with-20-jobs-facing-axe", "article": "The ABC\u2019s 11 foreign bureaux will be hit hard by the Coalition\u2019s budget cuts, with plans to scale back the Tokyo, Bangkok, New Delhi and New Zealand offices.

But the ability of ABC News to cover major events such as the 2011 tsunami in Japan or the recent political upheaval in Bangkok would be severely diminished, former correspondents have warned. \u201cThe ABC has a strategic advantage in international affairs at a time when the commercial networks are only covering Hollywood,\u201d one former foreign correspondent told Guardian Australia.  \u201cIt seems idiotic to downgrade the role of the cameramen in Bangkok and Tokyo when they are an absolutely essential element of the coverage. \u201cWe\u2019ve used a cameraman in Bangkok for years. Without him we would have been in danger in such a volatile area. He is a lifesaver. To think that we might move to a model where we would have to survive without him is horrendous.\u201d In recent years the then-Tokyo correspondent, Mark Willacy, and his camera crew and producers were on the ground to cover the earthquake and tsunami, and subsequent nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima. One source said his unrivalled coverage could not be matched by a video journalist working alone. There are fears the popular TV program Foreign Correspondent, already cut to 30 weeks a year, may be scaled back again to just 26. Foreign Correspondent is served by the ABC\u2019s network of correspondents posted overseas as well as two based in Sydney. It is the second time the ABC has attempted to scale back its international coverage. In 2011 most of the recommendations of a two-year review of the ABC\u2019s international operations were abandoned following protests from former foreign correspondents, including Lateline host Tony Jones and the now-retired Peter Cave. An ABC spokeswoman said no plans had been finalised and that as soon as they were, staff would be informed."}, {"sentences": ["The water problem is so severe that the plant\u2019s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], and its myriad partner firms have enlisted almost all of their 6,000 workers in the 2tn yen (\u00a311bn) mission to bring it under control, almost four years after a deadly tsunami sparked a triple meltdown at the plant."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "World news", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-13T13:03:38Z", "title": "Fukushima \u00a311bn cleanup progresses, but there is no cause for optimism", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/13/fukushima-11bn-cleanup-will-take-another-40-years", "article": "The man in charge of cleaning up the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has admitted there is little cause for optimism while thousands of workers continue their battle to contain huge quantities of radioactive water. The water problem is so severe that the plant\u2019s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], and its myriad partner firms have enlisted almost all of their 6,000 workers in the 2tn yen (\u00a311bn) mission to bring it under control, almost four years after a deadly tsunami sparked a triple meltdown at the plant. But Fukushima Daiichi\u2019s manager, Akira Ono, said he believed workers had turned a corner in the long road towards decommissioning. \u201cFor three years we were dealing with the aftermath of the accident, so there was no way we could plan ahead. \u201cEven though I have no intention of being optimistic, it\u2019s possible to say that we can now start to look forward,\u201d Ono told the Guardian. Each day about 400 tonnes of groundwater streams from hills behind the plant and into the basements of three stricken reactors, where it mixes with coolant water being used to prevent melted fuel from overheating and triggering another major accident. Most of the contaminated water is pumped out and stored in tanks, but large quantities find their way to other parts of the site, including maintenance trenches connected to the sea.     Some of the 1,000 water tanks being used to store contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi site. Photograph: Shizuo Kambayashi/AFP/Getty Images    So far, the plant has accumulated about 500,000 tonnes of contaminated water, which is being stored in more than 1,000 tanks occupying a large swath of the Fukushima Daiichi complex. By comparison, the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in the US in 1979 produced 9,000 tonnes of toxic water. \u201cThe contaminated water is the most pressing issue \u2013 there is no doubt about that,\u201d Ono said. \u201cOur efforts to address the problem are at their peak now. Though I cannot say exactly when, I hope things start getting better when the measures start taking effect.\u201d Previous versions of Tepco\u2019s Alps [advanced liquid processing system] water treatment unit were plagued by technical hitches. In addition, tanks used to store the contaminated water were poorly assembled and suffered serious leaks, while plans to freeze water that has gathered in a trench near the damaged reactors are eight months behind schedule. Work has begun on a 1.5km frozen barrier to prevent groundwater from reaching the reactor basements, but some experts, including Dale Klein, a former chairman of the US nuclear regulatory commission who now advises Tepco, have questioned its viability. Despite doubts about its effectiveness, Tepco officials say the wall should be finished by next March, and completely frozen by May.     A Tepco worker in protective gear works at the back of the new Alps water-treatment system, which should be able to process 2,000 tonnes of contaminated water per day. Photograph: Shizuo Kambayashi/AP    Along with the underground \u201cice wall\u201d, the utility is pinning its hopes on a new version of its Alps water treatment system that can remove more than 60 radioactive elements. Recent \u201chot testing\u201d of the apparatus has been successful, raising hopes that a solution to the water problem may not be far off, said Shinichi Kawamura, head of risk communication at Fukushima Daiichi. \u201cThis is a high-performance system because it uses only filters and absorbents to remove the contaminants,\u201d Kawamura said. \u201cThe old system depended on chemical agents, which caused problems and created a lot more waste. We have confidence in this machinery.\u201d As Japan moves closer to a return to nuclear power after the local authorities on the southwestern island of Kyushu this month gave their approval for reactor restarts, Tepco can claim a significant victory in its efforts to improve safety at Fukushima Daiichi.     The No 4 reactor\u2019s cooling pool. All of the 1,331 used fuel assemblies have now been removed and the plant hopes to empty the pool by the end of 2014. Photograph: Shizuo Kambayashi/AP    This month, workers completed the removal of the 1,331 spent fuel assemblies from a storage pool in reactor No 4, which was badly damaged in a hydrogen explosion after the March 2011 disaster. The removal of the unused fuel rods should be complete by the end of the year. Some experts had warned of a potential catastrophe had the fuel rods collided or been damaged during the operation; Japan\u2019s former ambassador to Switzerland, Mitsuhei Murata, went as far as claiming that \u201cthe fate of Japan and the whole world\u201d depended on the successful removal of spent fuel from reactor No 4. \u201cThis was a risky job, so when we removed the last fuel assembly we were delighted,\u201d said Yuichi Kagami, who oversees fuel removal at the reactor. \u201cThis was a big step forward in the decommissioning process.\u201d The most dangerous and difficult jobs lie ahead, however. Tepco has yet to begin removing melted fuel from reactors 1, 2 and 3, where radiation levels are too high for humans to enter. Tepco engineers admit they do not know exactly where the damaged fuel is located. Robots have been used to inspect debris inside reactor buildings, but none have been able to get anywhere near the melted fuel. The dangers posed by this unprecedented operation recently forced Tepco and the government to delay the planned start of fuel removal from reactor No 1 by five years, to 2025. Decommissioning the entire plant is expected to take at least 40 years. The operation, including compensation for tens of thousands of people forced to evacuate their homes, will cost around 10tn yen (\u00a355bn)."}, {"sentences": ["We are in KidZania Tokyo, one of 16 branches of the fast-expanding global theme park chain: a two-thirds-scale indoor town, with fake sky, fake streets and fake buildings housing 70 shops, restaurants and businesses \u2013 from pizza parlours to police stations; there\u2019s even the fuselage of a Boeing 737 for budding cabin crew \u2013 all staffed by the thousands of children aged four to 15 who visit each day.", "), but the waiting times of up to an hour on the day we visited the Tokyo branch testified to the enthusiasm of KidZania\u2019s citizens there, if nothing else."], "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Theme parks", "Japan holidays", "Asia", "Day trips", "Travel", "Westfield", "London holidays", "Family holidays"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-14T13:20:23Z", "title": "KidZania \u2013 the theme park where kids work for their fun", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/nov/14/kidzania-theme-parks-tokyo-london", "article": "My eldest son, aged seven, is examining a crime scene with his new colleagues. A stolen wallet has been found, and they must trace the owner. The mood is solemn, intense. Meanwhile, across the street, my youngest, aged four, is busy making pizza. He is bursting with can-do pride, but trying to look as though he does this kind of thing every day. We are in KidZania Tokyo, one of 16 branches of the fast-expanding global theme park chain: a two-thirds-scale indoor town, with fake sky, fake streets and fake buildings housing 70 shops, restaurants and businesses \u2013 from pizza parlours to police stations; there\u2019s even the fuselage of a Boeing 737 for budding cabin crew \u2013 all staffed by the thousands of children aged four to 15 who visit each day. The idea behind KidZania is that children will experience the world of work via role play with adult \u201czupervisors\u201d \u2013 parents are excluded from the town \u2013 teaching lessons about responsibility, decision-making and teamwork. Since the first one opened in Santa Fe, near Mexico City, in 1999, more than 35 million children have visited branches of KidZania in cities from Mumbai to Seoul. Early next year, the first branch in the UK is due to open in west London, at Westfield in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, and the company predicts a million people a year will visit. On entering KidZania, children are given radio-frequency tags \u2013 so they can\u2019t leave without an alarm going off \u2013 and handed 50 kidzos \u2013 KidZania\u2019s currency. These they can deposit in the KidZania bank, which is staffed by children of course and offers 10% interest \u2013 to retrieve later using bank cards at pretend ATMs. Or they can spend it on souvenirs and junk food. They can then earn more by working \u2013 between five and eight kidzos for a 25-minute shift, depending on the job. The Japanese branch is rather earnest. I am not getting strong \u201cplay\u201d vibes from many of the children. \u201cThere is no baby-talk here,\u201d a spokesman tells me. \u201cAnd in KidZania you will notice it is always dusk, because dusk is when kids have to go home, so it adds an exciting air.\u201d A fire engine blares past on its way to a fake fire. Fireman is one of the most popular professions in KidZania, along with cabin crew and police officer. The fully equipped TV studio always has big queues, too, as, more perplexingly, does the car-rental office. I was sceptical when I heard about KidZania: why not let kids be kids? Lord knows there\u2019s plenty of time in one\u2019s life for the rigours and restrictions of the workplace. Also, the London version will be heavy on corporate sponsorship: companies such as DHL, Renault and H&amp;M have signed on for brainwashi\u2026 sorry, sponsorship deals. The first KidZania, in Mexico, is apparently more relaxed than the Japanese version, and secretly I hope British children will find ways to subvert the project (an Occupy movement, perhaps?), but the waiting times of up to an hour on the day we visited the Tokyo branch testified to the enthusiasm of KidZania\u2019s citizens there, if nothing else. \u201cThere is a KidZania newspaper.

For David Cameron, it is the answer to how to deal with British jihadists who wish to return to the UK. And for an internet campaign, it is the answer to dealing with the odious pick-up artist and \u201cguru\u201d Julien Blanc. We mustn\u2019t expect Cameron to reconsider his perspective. He is running scared of Ukip. However, for those backing the campaign to get the home secretary to ban Blanc (which had well over 100,000 online signatures at time of writing), the comparison might give pause for thought. Call me old-fashioned, call me a sexist, call me an apologist; hey \u2013 I expect Blanc would divine I\u2019m gagging for a call. But just because the home secretary has the power to ban someone doesn\u2019t mean she should use it or that she should even be asked. Crikey, even the Bush administration let Mahmoud Ahmadinejad into the US in 2007 to make a speech at Columbia University. It\u2019s one thing for those who take righteous issue with Blanc\u2019s demonstrable misogyny and racism to apply commercial pressure. That is what happened this week, when another web campaign persuaded ITV2 that its relationship with a fellow by the name of Dapper Laughs was no longer worth it. Oh Dapper! We knew you so briefly. To watch Mr Laughs stuttering through his penitential Newsnight interview, sounding like Joey Essex\u2019s less intelligent younger brother, was to wish to look away in embarrassment. This was a victory against a man so small that the victory itself should not be described as anything other than small. Nothing wrong with that, I should emphasise: a victory is a victory, and it all counts in a world where street harassment is an unacceptable menace. But convincing ITV2 not to recommission a show no one really watched anyway ain\u2019t Roe v Wade, and you can be sure that those who defend the big injustices against women will be perfectly happy allowing what is becoming excessive celebration of this affair to continue as long as it likes. As I say, that\u2019s commercial pressure. But pressure on the home secretary to use discretionary powers is a different matter, and should be subject to two distinct sets of considerations. The first is rooted in principle, namely the trade-off between liberty and security, in which so-called security has too often prevailed in recent years. It may be more complex than clicking on a petition, but those demanding Blanc be banned ought to ask: has a crime been committed? If it has, then the campaign should focus on demanding it be investigated. This would be a far worthier course of action, as it might see Blanc held to account for his actions. He might have a case to answer in Tokyo, where his videos appear to show him approaching women on the street and shoving their heads toward his crotch. If so, these films must be highlighted as pieces of evidence and the Tokyo authorities urged to investigate. Ditto with any similar films made in other jurisdictions. The second set of considerations is practical, and it is here that the campaign feels especially wrongheaded. There\u2019s no need to point out that this is the age of the internet, given that is the very medium of the petition. But there does appear to be a need to point out that, in the world that the web has shrunk and interconnected more closely than before, a ban is next to pointless. Ideas do not have borders. You do not stop someone from saying things and having them heard by not letting them visit somewhere \u2013 if anything, you make them into the cause celebre they so transparently long to be. Bans turn ranting clerics you\u2019ve never heard of into ones you suddenly never stop hearing about, and a ban could easily turn Blanc into a guy who doesn\u2019t even need to turn up to dispense his rancid ideology. He could simply hire a London venue and be beamed in from the States \u2013 and get twice the coverage off the back of it. His followers \u2013 who we can only surmise already suffer from feelings of alienation or they wouldn\u2019t need to pay him huge sums to help get them laid \u2013 will feel even greater solidarity with their outcast overlord. He\u2019ll be a pick-up martyr. As a lesson in self-defeat, it would be trumped only by Cameron\u2019s latest plan, which I expect he thought would fall on more traditionally hardline ears if he announced it in the Australian parliament. (Incidentally, Australia had just revoked Blanc\u2019s visa). The PM\u2019s focus is on another sort of martyr, or rather those who\u2019ve decided the career of martyr isn\u2019t for them after all \u2013 the young jihadists who bound off to Syria, only to get there and find things slightly different to how they looked in the brochure. Is banning their return the reaction of a grown-up, responsible state? Or, as Liberty neatly summarises, \u201cdump[ing] your citizens like toxic waste into the international community\u201d? Either way, Cameron deems the posturing of a ban to be more valuable then any intelligence that could be gleaned from returning jihadists. Make of that what you will. In the end, I hope you agree immigration control as anything other than a means of making us feel better about these things does not work. Indeed, if I had an invitation for Blanc \u2013 and he thinks women are sending him invitations all the time \u2013 it would be: come on over to Britain, mate, and let\u2019s see your act. That act would be engaged with by women and men, from bloggers to columnists to tweeters. Secret recordings of his guru-ing sessions would be made by hacks and enterprising citizen journalists, giving the public the right to decide precisely what sort of chap Blanc is. I don\u2019t think it would be beyond the resources of the Met to stick a police officer in each of his events, or to tail his filming activities on the basis that they may pose a threat to public order. If he breaks the law, then let him be dealt with by it \u2013 not by a visa ban.

Quite apart from the brilliant football on display, there have been plenty of lively old encounters down the years, from the 1937 Copa America game that the Brazilians team departed before the final whistle, apparently fearing for their safety amid much barracking from the crowd, to the 1946 game which descended into a mass brawl involving players and spectators, after Argentina\u2019s captain Jos\u00e9 Salomon\u2019s leg was broken in two places, to the 1982 World Cup game in which Diego Maradona was sent off for booting Jo\u00e3o Batista up in the air. Perhaps the most notorious encounter was at the \u2018Holy Water\u2019 game at the 1990 World Cup, where the drinks of the Brazilian players were apparently spiked with a little something to hamper their performance, something confirmed by Maradona but denied by Argentina coach Carlos Bilardo. NM 2) Germany v Holland As with many sporting rivalries, there is more than a touch of politics and history to this one, even ignoring the many big encounters between the two sides down the years. Will van Hanegem, a midfielder who played for the Dutch in the 1960s and 70s, said after the 1974 World Cup final between the two sides: \u201cI didn\u2019t give a damn about the score. 1-0 was enough, as long as we could humiliate them. I don\u2019t like them. It\u2019s because of World War II.\u201d West Germany would of course win that final despite Holland going ahead with an early penalty, a tournament in which the German newspaper Bild ran a story about a \u2018naked pool party\u2019, with accounts differing as to whether it really was an episode of bacchanalian excess by Johan Cruyff and chums, or whether it was a sting/honey-trap from the ever-willing newspaper. Of course the rivalry manifested itself in a rather revolting manner during the 1990 World Cup, when Frank Rijkaard enthusiastically spat into Rudi V\u00f6ller\u2019s mullet, as covered in some depth by Barry Glendenning. NM 3) Egypt v Algeria If anyone wondered about the extent of the rivalry between these two, who are separated geographically by Libya, they were given a gentle reminder in 2009, when the pair found themselves neck and neck for World Cup 2010 qualification. Algeria had won their home game, that June, 3-1 in relative calm but the stakes were somewhat higher by November. When they met in Cairo, Egypt had to win by three goals to overhaul the Fennec Foxes, or by two to force a play-off between the two. When the Algerian side arrived, two days prior to the game, their bus was stoned by hooligans to such an extent that three players and an official were injured; explanations in the Egyptian media that the visitors had smashed the windows from the inside in a bid to see the game moved to a neutral venue held little water. In the end, despite suggestions from within the Algerian camp that they were mentally unfit to play, the match was played in an atmosphere of staggering intensity and ended in typically high-octane fashion when, 30 seconds from the end of injury time, Emad Moteab\u2019s goal gave the Egyptians the 2-0 win they needed. So they met again, in a winner-takes-all shootout staged in the calmer climes of Omdurman, in Sudan. It did not stop 15,000 police being deployed to keep order, and nor did it prevent all manner of claim, counter-claim and posturing about dastardly needs perpetrated by either side. Algeria won 1-0 and proceeded to send everyone to sleep in South Africa. But the mould for these tensions was firmly set in 1989, as Brian Oliver recounted in these parts five years ago, when a crowd including Mido was present for an edition of the \u2018hate match\u2019 that ended in criminal proceedings from Interpol. It was far from the first time that there had been trouble between the two; this one is as hot as it gets, on and off the pitch. NA 4) England v Scotland That this is the oldest international fixture of all used to be imprinted into the minds of schoolchildren on both sides of the border, and there is no doubt that the clash of the \u2018Auld Enemy\u2019 has seen heady enough times. Played every year of peacetime between 1872 and 1989, usually as part of the long-gone British Home Championship or \u2013 latterly \u2013 the Rous Cup, its clockwork regularity became for many years a genuine case of familiarity breeding contempt. While never the incendiary fare seen elsewhere on this list, each meeting was loaded with centuries-old cross-border antagonism and as such was one of the most important fixtures on the football calendar. Highlights have generally been more football-based than off-field \u2013 Scotland\u2019s \u2018Wembley Wizards\u2019 won 5-1 in London back in 1928 and England had to wait until 1961, when they won 9-3, to inflict something even more miserable. The next two stand-out meetings both ended in Scottish victories on English soil, a 3-2 win in 1967 leading to plenty of crowing about being \u2018unofficial world champions\u2019 and a 2-1 success a decade later resulting in such unbridled joy among the visiting faithful that they took to yanking the goalposts down after the game. England prevailed in rather more meaningful affairs in 1996 and 1999, in European Championship group stage and play-off ties respectively, but the fixture then died a 14-year death until being revived at Wembley last year. The decline of the Scottish side and a growing apathy towards international football among England followers meant that, to all bar the old-timers, it was not missed as much as it should have been. \u201cFor me what mattered was that we had lost to the Jocks and I have never gone home from Wembley in such a bad mood. I was furious,\u201d quoth Stuart Pearce of the second leg of that 1999 tie, which England lost 1-0 but still went through 2-1 on aggregate. It is tempting, from that alone, to make conclusions about the difference 15 years makes. NA 5) Japan v South Korea A good case could be made for the North Koreans\u2019 rivalry with the Japanese too, but it is the South who really go way back against a country with which they have grappled for regional supremacy \u2013 and so much more \u2013 since 1954. Back then, wounds were still especially raw from Japan\u2019s 35-year occupation of Korea, which had come to an end in 1945. Korea had subsequently been divided into north and south. In 1954 South Korea were paired with their former colonial masters in a World Cup play-off to decide who represented Asia in Switzerland. Both games had to be played in Tokyo after Syngman Rhee, the South Korean president, refused to allow the Japanese to enter his country. It mattered little: an inspired, whirlwind performance from the visitors saw Japan blown away 5-1 on home soil in the first leg, a 1-1 draw doing nothing to alter things at the second time of asking. If that could be viewed as spectacular payback on the Koreans\u2019 part, things have continued to bubble along in the years since. Cardiff was the venue for one flashpoint in 2012, when the pair\u2019s Under-23 sides met in the 2012 Olympic bronze medal match and South Korea\u2019s Park Jong-woo, whose team had just won, held up a banner proclaiming \u201cDodko is our territory\u2019, referring to a group of islands claimed by both nations. And they don\u2019t even have to be playing against each other for sensitivities to be piqued: in 1993, a late goal for Iraq against Japan sent the Koreans through to the USA World Cup at their bitter rivals\u2019 expense. That match is known in Seoul as the \u201cMiracle of Doha\u201d and in Tokyo as, yes, the \u201cAgony of Doha\u201d. NA 6) England v Germany Like a bigger, more intelligent and better-looking older brother, England have generally been in Germany\u2019s footballing shadow over the years. Other than in 1966 and the clownish encounter at Euro 2000 when Kevin Keegan\u2019s men just about succeeded in being slightly less terrible, the Germans have held sway over the English, winning in heart-breaking circumstances in 1970, 1990 and 1996, and of course the embarrassing shellacking in 2010. As if this ritual humiliation wasn\u2019t enough, Germany were also the last team to beat England at the old Wembley, and the first to beat them at the new version, asserting their superiority at just about every turn. The imbalance extends to women\u2019s football as well, with the Germans taking 17 of their 19 encounters, with the other two being draws. Of course, it\u2019s something of a one-sided rivalry that tends to bring the worst out of the more bombastic sections of the media and indeed population, with a crass reference to either world war just round the corner whenever the two sides face each other. Indeed, Germans tend not to bother particularly with England, preferring to focus their ire on Holland, their true rivals, as Marina Hyde wrote back in 2010, before Mesut \u00d6zil and chums delivered their first-order paddling in Bloemfontein: \u2018From the minute England\u2019s round of 16 destiny was clear, you will have heard much about this sainted antagonism with Germany. Yet the so-called rivalry is quite obviously an illusion, existing only in the minds of those wishful to the point of insanity \u2013 which is to say, the English. We are rivals with Germany in the same way Christine Bleakley is rivals with Oprah.\u2019 NM 7) Serbia v Croatia That there is no love lost between Serbia and Croatia was underlined on 22 March 2013, when the Croatians beat their rivals 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier amid a tempestuous atmosphere in the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb. It was a rivalry whose tale was well told in the match-up between the teams\u2019 then-managers, as Jonathan Wilson recounted at the time, and one that exploded from intra-Yugoslavian enmity (fans of leading clubs such as Dinamo Zagreb and Crvena Zvezda had famously fought before, notably in a shocking riot at the Maksimir in 1990 in the run-up to Croatian independence) to a full-blown international conflict following the terrible war that followed the old nation\u2019s break-up. The rematch in Belgrade six months later saw honours finish even at 1-1, but it is unlikely that much bread was broken afterwards. Not only did the result rule Serbia out of any remaining interest they had in a trip to Brazil, but Croatia\u2019s well-known shrinking violet Josip Simunic cleaned out Miralem Sulejmani with one of the most cynical challenges imaginable. Predictably, the bad blood now extends into many other sports and, even though last year\u2019s two meetings were their first as independent countries on the football field, its early incarnations suggest that this one is going to run and run for many a year. NA 8) USA v Mexico A rivalry spiced up by geography and a healthy dose of Mexican immigration to the States, this wasn\u2019t much of a rivalry for some years, with Mexico losing just one game between 1937-1990. However, the Americans have improved since then, and the rivalry has gained some of the petty bickering that make feuds like this so entertaining. In 2004 before an Olympic qualifying game in Guadalajara, Landon Donovan allegedly relieved himself on the training pitch, causing a minor international incident in the Mexican media, until it was revealed that Landycakes actually did his wee in a bush outside. In the game two days later, the Mexican crowd, perhaps irked by this flagrant display of urination, responded by chanting \u2018Osama! Osama! Osama!\u2019 at the Americans. Charming. When they faced each other again three years later, Mexico keeper Oswaldo Sanchez rather cheekily attempted to trip US striker Eddie Johnson up, which might not seem that unusual, apart from the fact he did so after Johnson had scored, and was wheeling away to celebrate. NM 9) Serbia v Albania As we have seen very recently, things are liable to go south in a hurry when these two face each other. The history between Serbia and Albania is long and complex, but Uefa didn\u2019t deem the rivalry to be dangerous enough to keep the two apart as they had for Spain v Gibraltar and other potentially explosive encounters. As you\u2019ll recall, the match between the two sides in October descended into chaos after a drone carrying the flag of \u2018Greater Albania\u2019 was flown into the Partizan Stadium in Belgrade, an incident covered by the Guardian\u2019s Nick Ames at the time: \u201cThe vision \u2013 as surreal as anything you might be confronted by at an international football match \u2013 had a dreamlike quality at first but, once the Serbian defender Stefan Mitrovic had leapt to receive the flag and was rounded upon by Albanian players hotly seeking to retrieve their national symbol, reality quickly bit. By any standards, the violence that followed was shocking. The number of marks overstepped during the next two and a half minutes may keep Uefa busy for weeks: it will want to consider the fan who attacked Bekim Balaj with a chair as he carried the flag towards the away dugout, the supporter who attempted to kick one Albania player in the head as the team fled down the tunnel never to return, even the intensity of Lorik Cana\u2019s retaliation on Balaj\u2019s assailant \u2013 and these are just for starters.\u201d NM 10) Denmark v Norway Not the first pair of countries that springs to mind when thinking about big international rivalries, but things can get pretty spicy between these two Scandinavian nations, and when things get spicy, the insults get personal and childish. Before the teams faced off in a Euro 2004 qualifier back in 2003, the Danish press referred to their rivals as \u2018mountain apes\u2019, apparently quite cross about a late John Carew equaliser in their previous encounter, as the Guardian reported at the time: \u201cThis week the feud has left the pitch and strayed down a much more nationalistic path. The Danish newspaper BT started the unpleasantries with a piece headlined \u201cWhy we can\u2019t lose\u201d. Its reason was that Norway was \u201ca nation full of losers\u201d and \u201cblue-eyed Arabs\u201d and it also complained about their attitude to sex - Norwegians are over-horny, apparently.\u201d NM"}, {"sentences": ["Now Tokyo is staring at a decline in growth."], "tags": ["Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-17T19:38:19Z", "title": "Global economy hovering between growth and stagnation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/17/global-economy-hovering-between-growth-stagnation", "article": "UK trade to the EU Ambitious plans for Britain to export its way out of trouble have foundered. The message from David Cameron was that Britain, which exports a third of its output, can expect to see little improvement in the next few years. In fact things might get much worse. Fostering an export boom was a central plank of government policy following the banking crash, when a fall in the value of the pound was supposed to further help booming demand for British goods in all parts of the world. Sterling did indeed drop by a quarter, but Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the EU has become increasingly negative. We are importing more and exporting less. For a time an improvement in exports to south America, China and the emerging economies of Asia made up for some of the worsening figures from Europe. That came to an end earlier this year as several emerging economies began to falter.       Eurozone GDP Gridlock in Brussels has prevented Europe\u2019s largest nations from firing up their economies to boost growth and leave the crisis behind. Germany, France and Italy were quick to recover from the banking crash of 2008, but have struggled to gain any momentum. A sovereign debt crisis in Greece in 2010 that spread to Spain in 2012 undermined the recovery in the region\u2019s banking sector. The word economist\u2019s increasingly use to describe the situation is stagnation. This year has been marked by increasingly strident debates over how much the European Central Bank (ECB) should join the Bank of England, US Federal Reserve and Japan\u2019s central bank in pumping trillions of euros into the financial system to reduce the cost of credit and spur lending. Germany wants the ECB to keep its powder dry, claiming cheap credit will lead to rampant inflation. Critics say that without an injection of funds, business confidence will wane further as inflation falls below zero and unemployment rises again.       Eurozone unemployment and inflation The high jobless count has proved difficult to bring down in France and Italy. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s Socialist administration has sought to bring the unemployment rate below 10%, only to see it stay in double digits and hit a record of 3.43m. In Italy, the broad jobless rate is 12.5%, just above the eurozone average, but officials in Rome are wrestling with a youth unemployment rate of 44%. The country\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, promised his \u201cJobs Act\u201d would kickstart Italy\u2019s economy and attract foreign investors, but Brussels has frowned on his spending proposals and unions are upset that he wants to make it easier for companies to fire people. Fearful of the future, eurozone consumers have stayed away from the shops, and with the situation still fragile businesses have delayed investment. One effect has been to drive the inflation rate down close to zero. Prices rose a little last month, but not enough to indicate that consumer demand has returned.       China\u2019s GDP The extent to which China\u2019s booming economy has been propping up the rest of the region, plus Brazil, Russia and Germany has become obvious in the last year. Beijing exported work and jobs as manufacturing became increasingly interconnected. It imported huge amounts of energy from Russia and food from Brazil, and machine tools and cars from Germany. To overcome weak demand from Europe and elsewhere, the Chinese authorities allowed state enterprises to borrow vast sums for investment spending. To head off a debt-fuelled crash, Beijing has restricted the flow of credit, so much so that the official growth rate of 7.1% could translate to more like five to 5.5% in reality. Many economists believe this would not be enough to keep the growing population in work.       Japan\u2019s GDP Japan appeared to recover from the 2011 tsunami under the guiding hand of the country\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. His \u201cthree arrows\u201d of reform \u2013 higher government spending, cheaper credit and shaking up old-fashioned business practices \u2013 appeared to be working. Government spending put more money in people\u2019s pockets and they spent rather than saved. This pushed up inflation above zero. Cheap credit also helped and discouraged saving, weakening the currency. Reforms, however, have proved more problematic and an ill-timed rise in VAT earlier this year discouraged spending. Now Tokyo is staring at a decline in growth. To reboot his policies, Abe is considering calling a snap election.       Oil price Oil prices have proved a reliable bellwether for the health of the world economy. Since dropping below $50 a barrel after the financial crash, it has mostly stayed above $100. This illustrated the strength of the global recovery, but in the summer Brent crude prices reacted to the fall in China\u2019s growth and slowing growth elsewhere. On Monday it fetched less than $79. The US would in times past have picked up the slack in demand. The world\u2019s biggest economy is growing at between 2% and 3% a year and demand for energy is picking up. The difference with just a few years ago, however, is that the US is edging closer to self-sufficiency in oil and gas. Such is the shale gas, or fracking, revolution that there are concerns Washington is in league with Saudi Arabia to drive down the price for the purpose of bringing Russia and Iran to heel.

With the world\u2019s highest level of debt \u2013 230% of national GDP \u2013 these solutions to the challenge of dementia must be both innovative and cost-effective. While political leaders take the stage in Tokyo to promote their \u201cbig\u201d dementia policies, at ground level grassroots initiatives are helping to make communities dementia friendly. Central government is beginning to take notice, appreciate and even promote these volunteer-led examples of dementia care and support. This positive response reflects the overriding economic pressures and concerns \u2013 to defuse the \u201cticking time-bomb\u201d of dementia. The sophisticated long term care insurance system, which is universal and funded partly by tax, partly by insurance contributions, ensures robust national provision for dementia care and support. It is part of the overall drive for an integrated community care system by 2025, when people aged 65 and over will exceed 30% of the population. But fresh new voluntary approaches are supporting the publicly-funded health and care provision. Free from bureaucracy (exacting health and safety legislation, risk assessments, evaluation-driven inspections and safeguarding) Japanese families, carers and wider community members are providing low key, informal and seemingly effective social care, compassion and support. Across Japan, 5.4 million trained volunteers known as \u201cdementia friends\u201d are being efficiently managed by only four full time paid staff. Many of them are beginning to form task forces and are enjoying a free hand as they introduce an imaginative range of dementia care and support programmes which are friendly and flexible \u2013 and which can flourish in the climate of trust. The approval of central government along with the laissez-faire approach of local authorities has enabled distinctive forms of grassroots care and support models to emerge and flourish. Such initiatives include the \u201copen house\u201d provision together with neighbourhood-watch style networking. The key feature of these \u2013 and other initiatives \u2013 is that they are local, based on voluntary support and are unencumbered by restrictive bureaucracy. Created in early 2014, the latest example of the open house \u2013 \u201cSuzu-no-ya\u201d \u2013 scheme is run by volunteers who offer local residents with dementia and their carers the weekly opportunity to access all-day care including lunch and tea. Drop-in facilities also include informal advice and peer support for carers, backed up by a 24 hour phone carer support line. The open house concept embraces normalisation through familiar, relaxed and friendly surroundings. The scheme takes places in volunteers own houses, or in low cost, empty rented houses. There are 8.2m empty properties in Japan \u2013 13.5% of the national housing stock. In Kobe the \u201cSakura-chan\u201d \u2013 a variation on the scheme \u2013 has privately rented residential dwellings to receive dementia patients and their carers for lunch, day-trips, dementia awareness raising and education. Carers are offered respite by peer carers along with a 24 hour help line. Situated next door to the Kobe local authority offices, lunch is always on offer to officials and care managers. Through informal but successful lobbying the start-up funding for 12 more open houses has been approved. Neighbourhood-watch style networks specifically look out for the 10,300 \u201cwanderers\u201d; people with dementia who become lost and confused away from home. Led by volunteers, who act in partnership with the police, local businesses and charities, the network helps to steer wanderers safely home, and provides invaluable support and reassurance for carers and families. It is also an essential safety net for those living with dementia. 61.3% of Japan\u2019s 1,741 local authorities embrace the scheme. Taken seriously, wanderer alert drills are practiced on a regular basis \u2013 and the scheme is officially endorsed. This month, Japan hosted the global dementia legacy event \u2013 during which prime minister Shinz\u014d Abe promised more dementia policies \u201cto realise the creation of a dementia integrated community care system\u2026 an all party approach\u2026 reflecting the views of those with dementia and their carers\u201d. Big policy promises \u2013 again. Perhaps the solutions can be found in the low cost, apparently high impact initiatives carried out with quiet dignity and little fanfare in Japan\u2019s dementia friendly community.

His bare, tattooed torso adorned cinema posters throughout the length and breadth of Japan from the late 1950s onwards and he starred in more than 200 films. He also had considerable success abroad in the 1960s and 70s, when Japanese film dominated the popular foreign film market, and his Hollywood films included Sydney Pollack\u2019s The Yakuza (1974) and Ridley Scott\u2019s Black Rain (1989). He was born Goichi Oda, in the city of Nakama, in Fukuoka prefecture, and educated at the prestigious Meiji University, Tokyo. He had recently graduated and was in the process of applying for a lifelong \u201csalaryman\u201d position at the Toei film company in Toyko when, on the lot, he entered an audition on impulse. His first film was released in 1956, and he was immediately cast in action films, under the name Ken Takakura. In 1958 he starred in the director Tomu Uchida\u2019s The Outsiders, a story set in the northern island of Hokkaido that put the minority Ainu people at the centre of the drama. But his studio, Toei, devoted its efforts to promoting him in its new ninkyo genre of yakuza (or gangster) films. Ninkyo is generally translated as \u201cchivalrous\u201d. In films such as Tales of Showa Era Chivalry (1965), one of a long\u2011running series, Takakura depicts an older, and, we are persuaded, more honourable gangsters\u2019 code. Ninkyo films pit defenders of the weak against the machinations of the powerful and feature depictions of masculinity with an appeal that is not only heterosexual.         Black Rain trailer    These films, shot in studios and set in the recent past in cities such as Tokyo, rapidly became popular. Takakura would play the outsider with the patience and heart to right a wrong. This he would eventually do, not with an elegant display of skill with his blade, but a willingness to take horrific levels of injury. In publicity stills, if he is shown with a woman, he usually has his back to her in a way that suggests singularity of purpose and even chastity. He would be stripped to the waist for a final showdown, with his tattoo visible, marking him as someone outside mainstream society. The identity of the ninkyo genre seems inseparable from Takakura and relates not just to his physical appeal but to a sense of male esteem that some saw threatened in a rapidly developing society and modernising workplace. He epitomised an idea of rebellion in a broad swath of society \u2013 the songs from his films were sung on the student barricades of the 60s and 70s. When yakuza films changed to emphasise a lack of chivalry, Takakura was more likely to be found in other genres. In the much-admired A Fugitive from the Past (1965), also by Uchida, he played the part of the investigating police officer who ultimately fails to uncover the wartime identity of another protagonist.     Ken Takakura starred in many of the ninkyo genre of yakuza films. Photograph: Koji Sasahara/AP    But in that year, he also starred in the film Abashiri Prison, the first in a stream of action films that also had considerable success abroad. Abashiri is a real prison, located at the northern tip of Hokkaido. Its setting in remote unspoilt lands had a practical appeal for the studio. Period films, jidai geki, were proving increasingly difficult and expensive to mount as TV antennae, concrete and bitumen spread across the Japanese landscape. Technology was making it more viable to shoot action films on location, often using the wide, scope format. The Abashiri prison series provided all that and offered a range of underdog characters with whom viewers could identify. The reach of Japanese action films in this period spread Takakura\u2019s fame to Hollywood, and he found himself in demand there. Pollack\u2019s The Yakuza was a gangster film starring Robert Mitchum as a detective who travels to Japan to help a friend involved with the yakuza and seeks help from an acquaintance, played by Takakura. In Black Rain, he was a Japanese police officer, Masahiro, assisting two New York cops (Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia) in pursuit of an escaped killer. Takakura as Masahiro, responding to the casual insults of the Americans towards their hosts, had the memorable line: \u201cI do speak fucking English.\u201d He also added appeal to the 1992 comedy Mr Baseball, in which Tom Selleck plays an ageing baseball player who joins a Japanese team, with Takakura as his manager.         Abashiri Prison trailer    Takakura\u2019s fame abroad was not confined to the west. His yakuza and action films were also popular in the Chinese-speaking diaspora and latterly in China itself. The Chinese director Zhang Yimou was a longtime admirer of Takakura\u2019s work and chose him to star in Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005). From 1959 until their divorce in 1971 Takakura was married to the singer Chiemi Eri. \u2022 Ken Takakura (Goichi Oda), actor, born 16 February 1931; died 10 November 2014"}, {"sentences": ["The Australian government has reiterated its opposition to whaling following Japan\u2019s plan to resume hunting in the Antarctic waters next year but has been urged to apply diplomatic pressure to Tokyo over the issue."], "tags": ["Whaling", "Greg Hunt", "Australian politics", "Australia news", "Coalition", "Conservation", "Marine life", "Whales", "Japan", "Antarctica", "Oceans", "Asia Pacific", "Animals", "Wildlife", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-19T07:00:58Z", "title": "Australian government to scrutinise new Japanese whaling plan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/19/australian-government-to-scrutinise-new-japanese-whaling-plan", "article": "The Australian government has reiterated its opposition to whaling following Japan\u2019s plan to resume hunting in the Antarctic waters next year but has been urged to apply diplomatic pressure to Tokyo over the issue. On Tuesday, the Japanese government revealed a plan to kill 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean next year. Over the 12-year period of the plan, 3,996 whales will be targeted. The target of 333 whales is significantly lower than previous quotas Japan has awarded itself and follows legal action brought by Australia. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in March that Japan\u2019s whaling program did not fulfill the scientific criteria that the country claimed justified its culling. A spokesman for Greg Hunt, the environment minister, said Australia \u201cremains opposed to all forms of commercial whaling and believes that all information necessary for the contemporary conservation and management of whales can be obtained using non-lethal methods. \u201cAustralia remains of the view that lethal research on whales is unnecessary and that non-lethal research techniques are the most effective and efficient method of studying all cetaceans.\u201d Hunt\u2019s spokesman added that Australian scientists will provide \u201crobust scrutiny\u201d of Japan\u2019s whaling plan when it is submitted to the International Whaling Commission\u2019s scientific committee. But the government has given no commitment to raising the issue directly with Japan, prompting criticism from the Greens. \u201cThe Liberal government has abandoned the leadership that had been shown by successive Australian governments for the last 30 years when they said they would put trade deals ahead of whaling in their relations with Japan,\u201d said Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson. \u201cGreg Hunt\u2019s once routine habit as opposition spokesperson for the environment in calling for the Australian PM to raise whaling with the Japanese PM has strangely lapsed upon entering government.\u201d Whish-Wilson said Australia needs to \u201cpile on the diplomatic pressure\u201d to back up the ICJ\u2019s judgment and prevent further whaling by Japan. Japan\u2019s new plan, called Newrep-A, replaces the Jarpa II program, which was deemed as commercial whaling with a scientific facade by the international court. Jarpa II targeted 855 minke whales, 50 humpback whales and 10 fin whales, although the take was far less than this due to harassment from anti-whaling activists Sea Shepherd. Japan suspended this year\u2019s Southern Ocean whale harpooning, but intends to return to the icy waters in late 2015. A non-binding vote at the International Whaling Commission in September that would\u2019ve suspended Japan\u2019s whaling for a further year was ignored by the country. \u201cThe killing of 333 whales per year is still far too many unnecessary deaths in an Antarctic whale sanctuary,\u201d said Alexia Wellbelove, senior program manager at Humane Society International. \u201cIt is now time that Japan listened to international public opinion and consigned their so-called research program and plans to resume commercial whaling to history where it belongs.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Here are the main players: Westbrook Partners Founded in April 1994, the privately-owned real estate investment management company has offices in New York, Boston, Washington DC, Palm Beach, San Francisco, Los Angeles, London, Paris and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Housing", "Communities", "Society", "UK news", "London", "Property", "Real estate"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-19T21:33:56Z", "title": "New Era estate: how US pension fund manager fuels London rent rises", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/19/new-era-estate-westbrook-partners", "article": "It is a story that links firefighters and retired teachers in America to pensioners and single mothers in east London \u2013 via a millionaire Tory MP and a portfolio of billion dollar, international property deals. The story of what happened after the American private equity firm, Westbrook Partners, bought a low-rent housing estate in Hoxton, with the help of Richard Benyon MP&apos;s advocacy, is devastating evidence of the failing of successive governments to provide affordable housing for all and combat private equity greed. Last week, Westbrook reneged on its previous warning that rents at New Era would, in some cases, quadruple in 2016 to meet market rates. Instead, it served tenants with an eviction notice giving them until Christmas to find new homes. These are private properties on private land. The council can, and is, protesting \u2013 pointing out that Westbrook&apos;s profits will be made at the cost of the British taxpayers who will foot the bill when the families are made homeless \u2013 as is the mayor of London and the local MP. But the homes now belong to an American private equity firm which has made no secret of its sole objective: to make the maximum profit from its investments. Here are the main players: Westbrook Partners Founded in April 1994, the privately-owned real estate investment management company has offices in New York, Boston, Washington DC, Palm Beach, San Francisco, Los Angeles, London, Paris and Tokyo. It claims to have raised and invested about $10bn (\u00a36.3bn) of equity in $40bn of real estate transactions, according to Investment &amp; Pensions Europe magazine. \u201cinvesting in companies with dysfunctional ownership\u201d. It has 10 British and American employees in London in an operation headed by a British national, Mark Donnor, a 40-year-old chartered surveyor with an interest in racing classic cars. Among properties Westbrook owns in London is Dolphin Square, a large block of 1930s apartments in Pimlico, central London, which has long been popular with MPs. After it bought the estate, a tenant took Westbrook to court claiming the firm had criminally harassed her to secure an eviction. A high court judge cleared Westbrook, while still finding some of its behaviour \u201cunreasonable and oppressive\u201d. The company also owned Shell-Mex House, the huge art deco office building next to the riverThames in central London, but sold it last year for a reported profit of more than \u00a3100m to a German firm. The firefighters Westbrook invests money from public and private pension funds, endowments, foundations, and financial institutions, mainly in America \u2013 and largely in Texas. It includes many lower paid workers including firefighters, teachers and other public sector employees. The Texas Permanent School Fund, the nation\u2019s largest education endowment, has committed $375m to Westbrook over the past six years while the Teacher Retirement System of Texas has invested $150m. The New York State Teachers Retirement System and the Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System have invested $50m and $30m respectively. The Ohio Police &amp; Fire have committed $30m. The New Era estate residents The residents of the 1930s, 96-flat housing estate include pensioners, teaching assistants, PAs, NHS staff and construction workers. Many have lived in the estate all of their lives and the community is a tight one: older residents are able to continue living independently in their own homes because their neighbours keep close eyes on them. Parents are able to go out to work because their friends and family look after their children. With house prices and rents in London soaring far above what this community can afford to pay, they face not just losing their homes but being forced out of London altogether. \u201cIf I have to leave New Era, I\u2019ll have to leave London,\u201d said Danielle Molinari, who has lived in the estate all her life. \u201cMy son\u2019s father is really involved with his boy at the moment but he won\u2019t be able to follow us out of London. We won\u2019t just lose our home if we\u2019re evicted: my son will lose his relationship with his dad.\u201d       Twelve-month tenancy contracts signed in July allow for \u2018two-week break clauses\u2019 to refurbish properties on the estate meaning residents can be evicted with two-week\u2019s&apos; notice. New York residents In April, just a month before Westbrook completed the deal for the New Era estate, it found itself labelled a \u201cpredatory landlord\u201d by tenants in Three Borough Pool, a group of 44 buildings in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan co-owned by a private equity owners who bought the properties in 2007 but defaulted on the $133m (\u00a397m) loan in 2010, foreclosing the buildings a year later. Two of Westbrook\u2019s properties were listed as being among the 200 \u2018most distressed\u2019 buildings in New York. After protests outside New York city hall, the attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, forced all four owners, including Westbrook, to make repairs to the 1,592 properties, resolve thousands of building violations and provide tenants with more than $1m in rebates for illegal fees and overcharges. The Benyons The Benyon Investment Company Limited were an active part of the bid that Westbrook made to the Lever family, who owned the estate until earlier this year. When Westbrook won the bid, they bought a 10% shareholding in the property and were given management responsibilities by the company. Richard Benyon, is the Conservative Berkshire MP, who along with his brother Edward owns the 300-year-old Englefield estate, which comprises 20,000 acres of land from Hampshire to Scotland. Their private family company has owned properties in east London for more than 150 years after the brothers\u2019 great-great-great uncle first developed the area known as De Beauvoir Town. The family still own about 300 properties there. After Westbrook took over the estate, Edward met residents to announce their plans to refurbish the homes and build more flats on the roof. At a meeting of residents, he is quoted as saying: \u201cThe goal, which is something I have had to say to all of you, is the fact that the rents will be going to market value.\u201d The Benyons sold their shares last week after Russell Brand climbed up the scaffolding outside Edward\u2019s house to erect a sign saying \u2018social housing not social cleansing\u2019.

It has 12 retail units and 96 flats was still being built when Arthur died in 1933 and it passed to his wife, Lily. Rents were always kept well below market rates. Located on the border of London\u2019s financial heart and 3.5 miles from the West End, the blended average weekly rent for a flat on the estate is currently just \u00a3143. It was inherited first by the Barsht\u2019s daughters, Eileen Lever and Daphne Scher, who moved to America, and then by their daughters, Jillian Kanavage and Robert Henry Lever. Kanavage now lives in Tucson, Arizona while Robert and his wife, Judith, live in Northwood, Middlesex. The family put it up for sale two years ago and sold it at \u201ccommercial market value for a substantial profit\u201d: the family\u2019s company, First LBS Holdings Limited, show it made a \u00a3306,865 profit and its shareholders received a \u00a3300,000 dividend last year. First LBS Holdings Limited changed its name to Hoxton Regeneration Limited earlier this year, when five Westbrook directors joined the board.

But if a Japanese construction firm gets its way, Ocean Spiral could be a reality within just a couple of decades. Shimizu Corp, which has a reputation for dreaming up grandiose schemes, says Ocean Spiral will \u201ccapitalise on the infinite possibilities of the deep sea\u201d to accommodate human life, as rising sea levels threaten the survival of island communities. According to an artist\u2019s rendering, the ambitious structure will be divided into three sections. A floating sphere with a diameter of 500 metres, located just beneath the surface of the sea, will house business and residential zones and hotels. The pod will be connected to a 15km-long spiral path that winds its way to the ocean floor 3-4km below the surface. There, scientists will explore ways to excavate energy resources from the seabed. Officials at Shimizu said the project would take about five years to build, at an estimated cost of 3tn yen (\u00a316bn). The firm believes the technology needed to build the structure and to sustain life below the surface of the ocean will be ready in as little as 15 years\u2019 time. \u201cThis is a real goal, not a pipe dream,\u201d the Shimizu spokesman Hideo Imamura told the Guardian. \u201cThe Astro Boy cartoon character had a mobile phone long before they were actually invented \u2013 in the same way, the technology and knowhow we need for this project will become available.\u201d The project is drawing on experts from Tokyo University, government ministries and energy firms to turn Shimizu\u2019s blueprint into a reality. The firm hopes to secure funding from private industry and the government. \u201cIt would be great if research institutions and governments become interested in our project,\u201d Masaki Takeuchi, the manager of the project, told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Christian Dimmer, an assistant professor in the urban studies department at Tokyo University, said \u201ctechno-utopias\u201d such as Ocean Spiral were a response to crises, in this case climate change and rising sea levels. \u201cWe had this in Japan in the 1980s, when the same corporations were proposing underground and \u2018swimming\u2019 cities and 1km-high towers as part of the rush to development during the height of the bubble economy. It\u2019s good that many creative minds are picking their brains as to how to deal with climate change, rising sea levels and the creation of resilient societies \u2013 but I hope we don\u2019t forget to think about more open and democratic urban futures in which citizens can take an active role in their creation, rather than being mere passengers in a corporation\u2019s sealed vision of utopia,\u201d Dimmer said. Ultimately, Shimizu envisages an eco-friendly underwater city sustained by energy brought up from an \u201cearth factory\u201d on the ocean floor. The factory will use micro-organisms to turn carbon dioxide into methane, while power generators located along the ocean spiral will use differences in seawater temperatures to create additional energy \u2013 a process known as ocean thermal energy conversion. Desalinated water produced using hydraulic pressure will be pumped into the residential pod. The idea of creating communities in the sea resonates in Japan, where land-based communities are at risk from large earthquakes and tsunamis. It is not the first time the country\u2019s construction industry has given serious thought to building sustainable communities in unusual places. Obayashi Corp has said it plans to build a 60,000-mile-long \u201cspace elevator\u201d by the middle of the century.

Women\u2019s rights advocates are urging the British government to use the major conference on Afghanistan it is co-hosting on 3-4 December to send a clear message that women\u2019s rights must be sacrosanct. They see it as a test of the government\u2019s commitment to honouring promises it made in June on ending sexual violence in conflicts and getting more women involved in peacebuilding. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to call on the British government to prove what they said, and turn this rhetoric into reality. There have been so many promises made in this last year \u2026 so let\u2019s see something meaningful in the conference communique that really safeguards women,\u201d said Kate Hughes, chairwoman of the Gender Action for Peace and Security (GAPS-UK) campaign group on Afghanistan and a campaigner at Amnesty UK. The London conference, which is being held before the official end of the international combat mission, comes as Afghanistan\u2019s new power-sharing administration, led by the president, Ashraf Ghani, grapples with a renascent insurgency and a crippling shortage of funds. Taliban militants are regaining ground as analysts warn there is a risk that international donors may cut back funding once foreign troops leave.  With no prospect of a military victory, Ghani \u2013 who was inaugurated in September after disputed elections \u2013 may have to push for peace negotiations with the Taliban and, in this context, any signs that the international community is backtracking on its commitment to women\u2019s rights could have serious consequences, say activists.  Rowan Harvey, a women\u2019s rights advocacy adviser at ActionAid UK, said Britain had to show full, unflinching support for women\u2019s rights.  \u201cWe\u2019ve made so many promises to Afghan women. We now have to recommit to realise those promises and say when that will happen. It\u2019s good to hear the UK government say women\u2019s rights will be a top priority for the conference \u2026 We have to act now. Women cannot do it on air,\u201d she said. Heather Barr, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, added: \u201cAny sign of disengagement by the international community on women\u2019s rights is going to be seized on as an indication that it doesn\u2019t really matter \u2026 It will have incremental effects immediately and it will have bigger \u2026 visible impacts before long, because there are people waiting to roll back laws to protect women.\u201d  There had been concern about women\u2019s rights being sidelined at the conference, but Britain\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID) has indicated that women will be actively involved throughout the two days.  A DfID spokeswoman said: \u201cThere is no question that the rights of Afghan women and girls are a top priority for the UK and next month\u2019s London conference on Afghanistan. We are working hard to ensure that Afghan women actively participate in the conference, and improving the lives of women and girls will be firmly on the agenda.\u201d Rights groups urged the British government to show Ghani that the international community was serious about honouring commitments made under the 2012 Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF), such as ensuring human rights for all citizens, especially women and children, and implementing the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) law and the National Action Plan for Women.  The conference is meant to review progress against the provisions of the TMAF, but there have been reports that new Afghan administration may want to change the terms \u2013 a prospect that women\u2019s rights activists say could seriously undermine commitments to ensure women\u2019s security and political participation. They are also concerned about the prospect of women being excluded from any possible negotiations with the Taliban.   \u201cWomen have been all too aware that if you have a peace negotiation process where the door shuts and there\u2019s a bunch of people in the room and half are from the Afghan government and half are from the Taliban, there\u2019s no one in that room who cares about women\u2019s rights,\u201d said Barr. Although women\u2019s participation in the political process has increased, they are still underrepresented in decision-making forums. Only nine of the 70 members of the High Peace Council are women. While they make up about 28% of parliamentarians, there is evidence that traditional attitudes towards women persist. Some Afghan lawmakers have threatened to repeal the 2009 EVAW. There have been other signs of a reactionary resurgence, including the drafting of a law that would have reintroduced stoning as a punishment for adultery , and the passage of a law lowering the proportion of provincial council seats reserved for women. \u201cThere\u2019s been a parade of attempted rollbacks \u2026 in the late days of the [former president Hamid] Karzai administration. The people in parliament who tried to do that are still in parliament. The people in the courts who came up with bad decisions are still in courts. We\u2019re waiting and watching very closely to see if Ashraf Ghani is going to get rid of some of the people in his own government who are enemies of women\u2019s rights,\u201d said Barr. DfID says significant gains have been made over the past 13 years: nearly six million children now attend school, compared to one million in 2001, and nearly 40% of them are girls; maternal mortality has halved since 2001, and life expectancy has increased. The UK has pledged to provide development assistance of \u00a3178m a year up to 2017. However, campaigners are concerned that international funding may begin to dry up in the wake of the military drawdown, partly as a result of competing global crises, donor fatigue, and disappointment over corruption. \u201cInternational funding is definitely something on everybody\u2019s radar,\u201d said Hannah Bond, director of GAPS-UK. \u201cWith the drawdown of troops \u2026 it is really important that women\u2019s rights remain at the core of what is being done internally and also through donor support.\u201d  In addition to its other activities, the conference will also receive reports from a summit on empowering women in Afghanistanbeing held in Oslo on 23 November with participation from Afghan women\u2019s groups, civil society groups and officials from Norway and the US."}, {"sentences": ["The sponsors are not our sponsors.\u201d With a league and association sharing the same headquarters building in Tokyo yet seemingly unable to align their purposes toward common prosperity \u2013 and sense \u2013 it may be that Japan is the epitome of a leading football nation already."], "tags": ["Gamba Osaka", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-21T11:59:09Z", "title": "Urawa Reds and Gamba Osaka in the last J League title race for some time | Ben Mabley", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/nov/21/urawa-reds-gamba-osaka-j-league-title-race", "article": "Earlier this month on the Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast, Raphael Honigstein summarised the joy of the Bundesliga thusly: \u201cBayern are a freak team \u2026 but people inside Germany don\u2019t really care that much because for the other 17 teams, this is the most open league anywhere in Europe. You don\u2019t know if your team is going to fight relegation; they might make the Champions League, they might be mid-table. You have absolutely no idea from week to week what\u2019s happening. And people love the fact that their sides have a real, meaningful season ahead of them.\u201d It is perhaps little wonder that so many Japanese players, from the returning Shinji Kagawa at Borussia Dortmund to the free-scoring Shinji Okazaki at Mainz, have settled into the ways of German football so smoothly. Twenty-one years since its inauguration, the J League continues to provide absorbingly unpredictable competition which parallels the Bundesliga for drama in all but one key aspect \u2013 there is no freak team. The best-supported club, Urawa Reds, can clinch the J1 title this weekend just as they did eight years ago with victory at home to Gamba Osaka. However, 2006 was the only season to date where the side from Saitama have finished on top of the pile, and a history of late slip-ups means that none of the 60,000-plus Reds fans expected to turn out on Saturday will be counting their chickens just yet. Most famously, in 2007, Urawa collapsed in the wake of continental exertions and failed to win any of their last five league games; a shock final-day defeat at long previously relegated Yokohama FC allowed Kashima Antlers to complete an improbable 10-point turnaround. Of more immediate relevance, the momentum right now is with Gamba, who will be returning to the site of their J League Cup final victory over outgoing J1 title-holders Sanfrecce Hiroshima two weeks ago. When the top flight paused for its two-month World Cup break in May, the 2008 Asian champions were in the relegation zone with just 15 points from their opening 14 games; concerned less with overhauling a 14-point gap to Urawa than with avoiding an immediate return to the ignominy of J2, where they had spent last term after a disastrous change in management the year before. Instead, buoyed by the explosive form of their fit-again former academy striker Takashi Usami \u2013 who sat on the bench for Bayern Munich in the 2012 Champions League final \u2013 the Osakans have soared up the table with 13 wins from 17 since the resumption of play, to stand in second. Gamba\u2019s turnaround under the stewardship of the former Japan international Kenta Hasegawa has been all the sweeter for their notoriously vocal supporters due to the failings of their neighbours to the south. Cerezo Osaka enjoyed a sudden surge in popularity last year \u2013 especially among female fans \u2013 due to the presence of a number of young national-team starlets, and were many observers\u2019 favourites for silverware when their parent company, Yanmar, broke the bank to acquire the services of the Uruguay legend Diego Forl\u00e1n in January. But the former Manchester United man has found the net only seven times and, with his fellow forward Yoichiro Kakitani upping sticks for Basel in mid-season, Cerezo have replaced their city rivals in the bottom three. Defeat away to fellow strugglers Vegalta Sendai this weekend could confirm their relegation. Yet as remarkable as the resurgence in the northern half of Osaka has been, by Japanese standards it is far from unique. Led by the Brazilian tactician Nelsinho Baptista, perennial yo-yo club Kashiwa Reysol beat off the challenge of Gamba and Nagoya Grampus to clinch the J1 crown in 2011 a year after promotion as champions of J2. Gamba themselves are no strangers to late-season title pushes, either. At the halfway mark of the 2009 campaign, they sat fully 19 points behind the runaway leaders, Kashima, only to close to within three ahead of an effective title decider on the penultimate weekend, when the Antlers ran out 5-1 winners. A five-point gap this time with three to play means that even victory would not bring Gamba\u2019s fate into their own hands, but Urawa have the harder run-in and must travel to fourth-placed Sagan Tosu on 29 November. The small provincial club from the island of Kyushu \u2013 Sagan\u2019s 24,000-capacity stadium would accommodate almost exactly a third of Tosu city\u2019s population \u2013 are still just about in the title picture themselves, but for their fans and romantic neutrals it is a case of what might have been after Yoon Jung-hwan, their South Korean manager, was let go in August due to an internal conflict with the side top of the table. This, again, was not an entirely new storyline in the J League soap opera. The coach Zdenko Verdenik pulled off a record 21-game unbeaten sequence to first save Omiya Ardija from relegation in 2012 then lead them to the summit midway through last season; but all was not well behind the scenes, the Slovenian was fired, and Omiya promptly went on a run of 16 losses in 17 to wind up 14th. Such unlikely storylines and fluctuations of fortune are partly evidence of a league still in the early stages of maturity; and partly the result of the firm community roots embedded in the J League regulations to prevent the emergence of corporate franchises such as the Yomiuri Giants, who have dominated Nippon Professional Baseball. However, Japanese domestic football is approaching a serious crossroads. Attendances have stagnated since the exploits of Kagawa, Keisuke Honda, and Yuto Nagatomo triggered an outflow of talent to Europe at the beginning of this decade. With sponsors beginning to lack confidence, the organisers have panicked \u2013 from next year, the traditional league format will be replaced by a two-stage season with play-offs. The move drew widespread outrage from match-going fans when it was originally announced last summer. G\u014dru-ura (behind-the-goal) terraces across the country were decorated with angry banners as supporters united to denounce the desecration of their famously competitive top flight. Embattled J League officials dealt with the backlash by encouraging broadcast partners to point their cameras away from the stands. \u201cAverage crowd figures have fallen from over 19,000 to around 17,000 in the last five years,\u201d explained Daisuke Nakanishi, the J League\u2019s director of competitions, to J Sports. \u201cEven when 62,000 people turned out to see Yokohama F Marinos play Albirex Niigata last November, with the championship on the line, the television audience share on NHK was only 3.5%. We needed to act to attract new spectators. Winner-takes-all matches are easier for non-hardcore viewers to understand, so we decided we had to introduce a knockout stage for the trophy at the end of the season.\u201d One respected television commentator scoffed: \u201cThey are just looking for any quick fix. There is no way this will make any difference.\u201d Indeed, the J League were in such a hurry to devise an \u201ceasy-to-understand\u201d play-off format that their original proposal was flawed to the point where it could be advantageous for certain teams to deliberately lose second stage matches. This was later revised, but there was still the issue of the Emperor\u2019s Cup \u2013 a purely knockout competition dating back to 1921, whose final three or four rounds are traditionally played after the end of the league season in December. If cup-style football is supposed to attract new fans to league football, then why not just use the cup that was there all along? Nakanishi shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \u201cYes, but the cup is run by the JFA, not by the J League,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s out of our jurisdiction. The sponsors are not our sponsors.\u201d With a league and association sharing the same headquarters building in Tokyo yet seemingly unable to align their purposes toward common prosperity \u2013 and sense \u2013 it may be that Japan is the epitome of a leading football nation already. Had the two-stage system been in place this year it would be Gamba going into that Urawa game with a chance of securing the clausura title but, while nobody yet knows for sure what impact the change will have upon perceptions of the league both inside and outside Japan, supporters have generally now resigned themselves simply to enjoying the final \u201cproper\u201d season while it lasts. As one member of the Sledgehamor Bros ultras in Osaka put it: \u201cIf Gamba do manage to win the league this year, at least everyone will know for sure we are the real champions.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Ok, I admit that I\u2019m skeptical because I\u2019ve lived in some cities -- Tokyo, for example -- which was home to an astonishing variety of birds, insects and other wildlife and I\u2019ve also lived in cities -- Seattle, for example -- where just a few dozen species of birds and a handful of wildlife species lived."], "tags": ["Science", "Science", "Science and nature", "Dystopian fiction (children and teens)", "Materials science", "Materials and mineral engineering", "Birds", "Wildlife", "Cities", "Children and teenagers", "Animals", "Fiction"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-21T14:59:12Z", "title": "New books Party: Books that arrived recently | @GrrlScientist", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2014/nov/21/new-books-party-books-that-arrived-recently", "article": "   .    Welcome to Subirdia: Sharing Our Neighborhoods With Wrens, Robins, Woodpeckers, and Other Wildlife by John Marzluff [Yale University Press, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover; Amazon US hardcover/kindle US] Publisher\u2019s synopsis: Welcome to Subirdia presents a surprising discovery: the suburbs of many large cities support incredible biological diversity. Populations and communities of a great variety of birds, as well as other creatures, are adapting to the conditions of our increasingly developed world. In this fascinating and optimistic book, John Marzluff reveals how our own actions affect the birds and animals that live in our cities and towns, and he provides ten specific strategies everyone can use to make human environments friendlier for our natural neighbours. Over many years of research and fieldwork, Marzluff and student assistants have closely followed the lives of thousands of tagged birds seeking food, mates and shelter in cities and surrounding areas. From tiny Pacific wrens to grand pileated woodpeckers, diverse species now compatibly share human surroundings. By practising careful stewardship with the biological riches in our cities and towns, Marzluff explains, we can foster a new relationship between humans and other living creatures -- one that honours and enhances our mutual destiny. My first impression: Large cities are an entirely new ecosystem, argues John Marzluff, one that can provide homes to birds and other wildlife as well as humans. Ok, I admit that I\u2019m skeptical because I\u2019ve lived in some cities -- Tokyo, for example -- which was home to an astonishing variety of birds, insects and other wildlife and I\u2019ve also lived in cities -- Seattle, for example -- where just a few dozen species of birds and a handful of wildlife species lived. However, Professor Marzluff (who also happens to live in Seattle), argues that if city-dwellers learn how to meet the needs of birds and other wildlife, needs that he has distilled into \u201cNature\u2019s Ten Commandments\u201d, and do what we can to welcome birds and wildlife into large cities, then they will come. The writing is optimistic and engaging, the ideas are thought-provoking and realistic, and the drawings by Jack DeLap are lovely.     .    Materials: A Very Short Introduction by Christopher Hall [Oxford University Press, 2014; Amazon UK paperback; Amazon US paperback/kindle US] Publisher\u2019s synopsis: The study of materials and their properties forms an important area of research. Christopher Hall introduces the field of material science using gold, sand, and string -- familiar things that represent the big families of metals, ceramics, and polymers. By explaining their properties, how materials are created, and the processes involved in their fabrication into objects, he shows how materials science brings together engineering and technology with physics, chemistry, and biology. He also shows how materials influence communications, the media, architecture, building, and the fine arts. My first impression: If you enjoyed Stuff Matters by Mark Miodownik, which won the 2014 Royal Society Winton Prize for popular science books, then you will enjoy this book, too. The author, an emeritus professor of materials at the University of Edinburgh, is an expert on the subject and has written a readable account about three main types of materials -- metals, ceramics and polymers -- how they are made, objects they are fashioned into and significance of these materials in modern society.      .

It is the future. There is no war, no hunger, no pain. No one in the community wants for anything. Everything needed is provided. And at twelve years old, each member of the community has their profession carefully chosen for them by the Committee of Elders. Twelve-year old Jonas has never thought there was anything wrong with his world. But from the moment he is selected as the Receiver of Memory, Jonas discovers that their community is not as perfect as it seems. It is only with the help of the Giver, that Jonas can find what has been lost. And it is only through his personal courage that Jonas finds the strength to do what is right\u2026 The Giver is the award-winning classic of bravery and adventure that has inspired countless dystopian writers as the forerunner of this genre.

Giant screens blare out ads for electronic gadgets and energy drinks. High above street level, trains arrive every couple of minutes and deposit hordes of office workers on to Shinbashi\u2019s narrow back streets in search of grilled chicken skewers and beer, and the chance to take stock of an extraordinary week for the world\u2019s third-biggest economy. If the buzz of activity in Shinbashi \u2013 packed with offices, bars and restaurants \u2013 is any indication, this does not look like a country in recession. But the Friday evening feelgood factor is at odds with the hard data. Last Monday Japan\u2019s government caught almost everyone off guard when it announced that, after a second consecutive contraction in quarterly GDP, the economy was officially back in recession for the first time since 2012. Put simply, Japan\u2019s consumers have stopped spending. Exhibiting the same caution that consigned their economy to more than two decades of stagnation, their thrift threatens to derail prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s inflation-led mission to revive the economy. The news had barely sunk in when Abe announced that a rise in sales tax, from 8% to 10%, that was due to go into effect next October would be delayed until April 2017. A three-percentage-point rise in the same tax last April was widely blamed for battering consumer spending, the driving force behind 60% of the economy, and raising the spectre of deflation and recession. For now, the clamour at home and abroad for Japan to use the extra tax revenue to tackle its public debt \u2013 now worth 230% of GPD \u2013 and pay for rising health and social security costs is being drowned out by Abe\u2019s mantra of growth. On Friday evening, office workers with one eye on the clock were interrupted by their prime minister, who appeared on TV to explain his decision, just hours earlier, to dissolve parliament and call an election for next month. The 14 December poll, he said, would be a referendum on the three \u201carrows\u201d of his economic policy: monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reform. \u201cThis dissolution is an Abenomics dissolution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an election that is asking voters whether to continue with Abenomics, or to put a stop to it.\u201d Among the groups of workers manoeuvring for elbow room at a standing bar in Shinbashi, the sake fumes blended with resignation about the economy and incredulity that they would have to vote again, just two years after Abe took office. \u201cHave you any idea how much it costs to hold an election?\u201d asks Miki Takahashi, an office clerk who concedes she has been emboldened by a few glasses of sake. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculously expensive, and it\u2019s taxpayers like us who have to pay for it. I want Abe to give us our money back.\u201d     Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe announces a general election for 14 December. Photograph: Xinhua /Landov /Barcroft Media    While investors and major exporters have gained from Abe\u2019s early success in boosting the stock market and weakening the yen, employees of Japan\u2019s myriad small and medium-sized firms say the benefits have yet to trickle down in the form of wage rises and job security. Among those hit hardest is the rapidly expanding underclass of temporary workers, their contracts stripped of the benefits enjoyed by their counterparts during the postwar era of breakneck growth: jobs for life, incremental pay rises and seniority-based promotions. This summer, the labour ministry said, a record high of one in six Japanese lived in relative poverty due to falling incomes in families with young children and the rise of poorly paid, irregular jobs. Izumi Oba, a 50-year-old office worker on a temporary contract, has no winter bonus to look forward to and a modest salary that barely covers her rent and bills. \u201cIt\u2019s a good job I live alone, as I can just about survive on my salary,\u201d Oba says. \u201cFriends of mine with families are having a much harder time.\u201d Abe knows that next month\u2019s election is far less of a gamble than his record-low approval ratings might suggest. The recent resignations of two ministers over alleged funding and election-law violations were unwelcome reminders of his brief, scandal-plagued stint as leader in 2006-07. But voters sceptical of his claim that there is \u201cno alternative\u201d to Abenomics say they have nowhere to turn to register their protest. The main opposition, the left-of-centre Democratic party of Japan, is still in disarray after its drubbing at the last election two years ago. Major scandals notwithstanding, Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic party [LDP] and its junior coalition partner will emerge victorious next month, perhaps with a small dent in their two-thirds majority in the lower house. So why call an election now? It\u2019s a question voters are struggling to answer. In a recent poll just 18% of respondents approved of Abe\u2019s decision to call a snap election, while 62% opposed it. And despite Abe\u2019s \u201cback me or sack me\u201d histrionics, last week\u2019s disappointing GDP figures did not sound the death knell of his economic policy. \u201cJudging Abenomics on a quarterly basis does not make much sense,\u201d said Martin Schulz, chief economist at the Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo. \u201cThe data were poor because the economy is taking time to recover after the sales tax hike in April. Declaring Abenomics a failure because of the recent GDP figures would only work if you are a strong believer in monetary miracles.\u201d Many suspect that Abe\u2019s decision to go to the country has precious little to do with the (albeit delayed) inevitability of a tax increase. In the first half of next year Japan will confront two of the most divisive policy issues of recent times. Almost four years after the triple meltdown in Fukushima, Abe is lobbying hard for the restart of two nuclear reactors in the country\u2019s south-west, even though more than 50% of Japanese oppose immediate restarts. He will also attempt to push through legislation to overturn Japan\u2019s constitutional ban on collective self-defence, enabling its troops to fight overseas in the defence of allies \u2013 most likely the US \u2013 for the first time since the end of the second world war. After opinion polls showed that the public did not share his enthusiasm for changing the wording of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution, Abe has opted instead to reinterpret the meaning of its Article\u00a09, which forbids the use of force to settle international disputes. \u201cAll the talk is of tax and the economy,\u201d says Masahiro Tani, a retired IT consultant and a regular visitor to Shinbashi. \u201cNo one is saying anything about the constitution, but what could possibly be more important than peace? Next year Abe will be able to claim that we support his plans to change the constitution. By delaying the tax rise, it\u2019s like he\u2019s offered us delicious beef and then added a few other ingredients on the sly.\u201d With his party\u2019s re-election practically a formality next month, Abe will try to claim an all-encompassing mandate for his rightwing agenda, said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. \u201cMost people consider the decision as self-serving on Abe\u2019s part,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to bribe the electorate with a delay of the tax increase in the hope that the trickledown effect will come in due course. \u201cAnd if he wins substantially, it is quite possible that he will feel comfortable and complacent and focus again on his nationalist agenda rather than the economy.\u201d At the standing bar, Tani, a striking figure in his dark-blue kimono and a trilby, puts down his drink, pauses, and recalls the time he spent working abroad. \u201cJapan has become like Singapore,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a democracy where you have a choice \u2026 of one. We get the politicians we deserve, but in a democracy we have to exercise our right to vote. I always go to the polling station, but the question is, is there anyone I really want to vote for this time? At this point all I know is that I won\u2019t be voting for the LDP.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["A YouTube video shows him, in Tokyo, pushing women\u2019s heads into his groin, one of his \u201cseduction techniques\u201d."], "tags": ["Domestic violence", "Sex education", "Schools", "Education", "Society", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-23T00:05:07Z", "title": "The Observer view on violence against women | Observer editorial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/23/observer-view-on-violence-against-women", "article": "The United Nations\u2019 International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, on Tuesday, initiates 16 days in which the UN invites the world to \u201cOrange Your Neighbourhood\u201d with flags, ribbons and events, ending on 10 December, Human Rights Day. Violence against women and girls \u2013 sexual, physical and psychological \u2013 is endemic. Female genital mutilation, honour killing, child brides, trafficking, grooming, rape and domestic violence are rampant in societies in which women are classed as second-class citizens. However, as the events of the past few days in the UK have shown, degrading attitudes to women also exist under the veneer of progress. The statistics on violence against women in the UK remain woefully high. At the same time, resources for picking up the broken pieces are shrinking. Yet taboos, especially around the silence of the suffering, are being broken. So, can we afford optimism? We have seen a week in which the court of public opinion has won a number of victories. On Friday, Sheffield Utd reversed their decision to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to train at their ground. The use of Twitter and the lever of online petitions resulted in the axing of the new ITV2 series of comedian and video blogger Daniel O\u2019Reilly, who performs as the infantile character, Dapper Laughs. Last October, he approached a female member of his audience and announced: \u201cShe\u2019s gagging for a rape.\u201d Again, last week American \u201cpick-up artist\u201d, Julien Blanc, was denied entry into the UK. A YouTube video shows him, in Tokyo, pushing women\u2019s heads into his groin, one of his \u201cseduction techniques\u201d. In the US, comedian Bill Cosby has also seen television appearances axed as women have alleged similar historical assaults. The cracking of the code of silence in the UK, kept in place because victims rightly assessed that, powerless, they wouldn\u2019t be believed, has been helped by the exposure of Jimmy Savile and the sentencing of celebrities such as Rolf Harris. Banning entry to a country, government by petition that can come close to modern mob rule, censorship and trial by popular opinion are all deeply uncomfortable developments that deserve greater scrutiny. However, life is rarely clear-cut. Many of us have not given consent to our sexist and pornographic culture from which there is little escape. Rap star Eminem\u2019s new song, Vegas, for instance, suggests he wants to rape singer Iggy Azalea: \u201cScream! I love it\u201d. Some human rights have priority over others \u2013 and freedom from violence is an essential human right. \u201cHumour\u201d when it incites rape, \u201cseduction\u201d when it incites hatred, cannot be justified under the banner of free speech. Over the past few years, the coalition\u2019s strategy to end violence against women and girls has included tougher laws on stalking, forced marriage and FGM and the roll-out of Clare\u2019s Law that allows police to disclose a partner\u2019s previous violent offending. Last year, for the first time, an overview of sexual offending in England and Wales was published. In court, victims of rape are less likely to be accused of \u201casking for it\u201d because of their sexual history, but violence against women is still not effectively addressed. One in five females (16 to 59) has reported being the victim of unwanted sexual attention, including assault since the age of 16. Only 15% of victims had reported the incident to the police. On domestic violence, the record is equally abysmal. A highly critical report earlier this year by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspector of Constabulary judged that only eight out of 43 police forces were providing a good service. Seventy-seven women were killed by a partner or former partner last year and there were 96,000 cases of assault with injury. The report, Everyone\u2019s Business: Improving the police response to domestic abuse, pointed to \u201calarming and unacceptable weaknesses\u201d in policing. The home secretary, Theresa May, now chairs a special committee to spur action. Far more needs to be done. Davina James-Hanman is the outgoing director of Against Violence and Abuse (AVA). She is a former home office adviser and, in the 1990s, was the first local authority domestic adviser in the country. Everyone talks about prevention, she says, and nobody knows what it looks like. Lessons for boys on consent only accentuate the outdated paradigm that men \u201ctake\u201d and women \u201cgive\u201d sex. The pleasurable side of sex is still shrouded in shame, ignorance and ambivalence about women\u2019s carnal interest. Currently, the House of Commons education select committee is conducting an inquiry into the quality of sex and relationship education in schools, still patchy and not compulsory. AVA has developed an award-winning programme  that promotes a whole school approach to the encouragement of healthy relationships that are as important to boys as they are to girls. The lack of structure in health and education means that such schemes currently have to happen school by school. What is also lacking is intervention for those who need help. Project Mirabal, a research study begun in 2009, is looking at perpetrator programmes, what reduces violence and increases safety for women and children. Its findings will go to waste if not backed by investment. Increasingly, too, in communities, women and men are initiating their own actions and debates. Masculinity that shuns homophobic, women-hating themes is too little endorsed. Last Thursday, the Wellcome Collection opened the first UK exhibition to bring together the pioneers of the study of sex. The Institute of Sexology: Undress Your Mind fascinates in its examination of the culturally constructed nature of sexual behaviour. Included is a brief history of the pioneering National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal). Established by a female team to learn more about sexual behaviour at the peak of the HIV-Aids crisis, its findings in 1990/91 informed successful sexual health strategies. It has conducted three major studies every decade since then. On average, men now have around 12 partners and women 7.7 in a lifetime, double the 1990 figure but hardly Sodom and Gomorrah. \u201cMedia portrayal of sex is so different from people\u2019s lived reality,\u201d says Professor Dame Anne Johnson, one of Natsal\u2019s leaders. In the UK, a temporary Institute of Sexology ought to be replaced by a permanent Institute for Sexual Health. A whole curriculum approach, from primary school, is vital. More men need to join the discussion about how anger is often a disguise for fear and abuse damages victim and perpetrator. Improved education and the shaping of a different robust public consensus have to be an effective weapon both here and internationally to trigger the change that women and men so desperately require."}, {"sentences": ["The Tokyo, Bangkok, Delhi and Jerusalem offices will be closed and the camera crews made redundant, as reported earlier this month."], "tags": ["Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "Australian media", "Radio", "Television industry", "Australian television", "Television", "Television & radio", "Australia news", "Mark Scott", "Coalition", "Australian politics"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-24T05:49:47Z", "title": "ABC news division to axe 100 jobs as budget slashed from top TV programs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/24/abc-news-division-axe-100-jobs-budget-slashed-top-tv-programs", "article": "Some of the ABC\u2019s top TV news programs, including Four Corners, Lateline, Australian Story and Landline, will have their budgets slashed as the news division loses 100 jobs after the Coalition\u2019s $254m budget cut. While cuts to Four Corners, Australian Story and Landline will be relatively modest, Lateline will take the biggest hit with all its staff put on a redundancy list pending a skills audit. Foreign Correspondent has lost 10% of its budget. The big changes in the news division include cutting all radio news bulletins except 7am and 7.45am from 10 to five minutes, and reducing the size of the fact-checking unit. Half the features producers on Radio National will be made redundant and five programs will be decommissioned: 360 Documentaries; Into the Music; Poetica; Hindsight and Encounter. Experienced program-makers will be replaced with freelancers. Bush Telegraph, the rural news and features program commissioned in the Howard era after complaints the ABC was too city-centred, has also been axed. As tipped on Guardian Australia, the ABC has commissioned a new program hosted by a conservative voice, the former opinion editor at the Australian Tom Switzer.  \u201cIn a media environment saturated with opinion \u2013 much of it repetitive in its perspective \u2013 Tom Switzer would filter through that, pointing the audience to new and different takes on the big issues, sometimes including his own analysis,\u201d the ABC said in a statement to staff. News director Kate Torney briefed the 1,500 news staff on the details of the changes on Monday afternoon. She said 70 new digital positions would be created as more resources were poured into online and mobile news. But those positions will be lower paid, sources said. The 100 redundancies announced across the news division are not voluntary. Journalists whose programs have been targeted for job losses will be measured against an objective \u201cskill set\u201d, sources said. Those deemed not to have the required skills for the remaining positions will be made redundant. The same process will apply to staff in Radio National. \u201cPlenty of room for discrimination there, and no transparency,\u201d one source said. A national Friday edition of 7.30 will be launched following the cancellation of the eight local editions. Local current affairs coverage will be included in specials and across the 7pm News, ABC News Sunday, News 24, local radio and local digital sites, as reported by Guardian Australia. Lateline has survived the axe but will be moved to a fixed timeslot on News 24 and will have a makeover, the details of which have yet to be announced. Management said Lateline would also focus more on its digital audience. In international news gathering, the Auckland bureau will close and New Zealand will be covered from Australia. The Tokyo, Bangkok, Delhi and Jerusalem offices will be closed and the camera crews made redundant, as reported earlier this month. Teams will be replaced by video journalists working from home with the help of a local producer. Staff were told that precautions would be taken to protect video journalists working alone. Bigger bureaux will be established in Washington, London, Beijing and Jakarta, and the number of foreign correspondents will stay the same. A new role of chief foreign correspondent will be created. The president of the Community and Public Sector Union, Michael Tull, accused the government of lying.  \u201cAfter promising not to cut, the government has cut millions from the ABC\u2019s budget and forced it to slash one in 10 jobs from its workforce. It is now abundantly clear that the government\u2019s cuts will seriously impact the quality of programming, despite assurances by Malcolm Turnbull to the contrary.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Courtesy of Taka Ishii Gallery, Tokyo       Fait #43, 1992Sophie Ristelhueber\u2019s aerial views of the desert landscape of Kuwait after the first Gulf War evoke the technology of modern warfare, which relies on aerial bombardment, surveillance and missile strikes Photograph: Sophie Ristelhueber.", "Courtesy of the artist and the National Gallery of Canada       The Japanese National Flag, Tokyo, 1965, from the series The MapOne set of images from the photobook The Map shows the effects of the atomic bomb still visible when Kikuji Kawada was photographing in Hiroshima from 1959 to 1961 Photograph: Kikuji Kawada."], "tags": ["Tate Modern", "Photography", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-24T17:15:54Z", "title": "160 years of war photography: an audiovisual guide to the world's most powerful conflict images", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/24/-sp-conflict-time-photography-tate-modern-audio-guide-war", "article": "    Listen to Simon Baker, the curator of Conflict, Time, Photography, talk about the exhibition      Vebranden-Molen, West-Vlaanderen, 2013.

As the headquarters of the city\u2019s council, the building\u2019s huge leather-clad doors, vast chandeliers and abstract art embody not just a strident modernism, but two bigger ideas that seem to have been frozen into every tile and fitting: a determination to pull Newcastle away from long industrial decline, and a belief that city government has the power to do so. In that sense, though it was conceived before he took office and opened after he had moved on to other things, the civic centre embodies the visions of T Dan Smith, the notorious Labour leader who once gloried in the unofficial title of \u201cMr Newcastle\u201d. Smith, who ruled the city from 1960 to 1965, was eventually jailed for corruption, and provided the inspiration for Austin Donohue, a central character in the BBC\u2019s epic drama Our Friends in the North. He said he had come to transform a place he thought was \u201cmoribund\u201d. \u201cCities are what men make of them, on land that is given by God,\u201d he said; he dreamed of turning Newcastle into \u201cthe Brasilia of the north\u201d.       Whereas Smith drove around Newcastle in a Jaguar with the number plate DAN 68, his latest successor owns a two-door VW Fox whose only remarkable feature is a souvenir teddy bear from the National Railway Museum, tucked into the cup holder next to the passenger seat. Such frugality fits the role forced upon Nick Forbes, who has had to implement drastic cuts since becoming leader in 2011. Forbes and his city are caught in a pincer movement, split between Westminster\u2019s unrelenting austerity and a rise in demand for local services \u2013 driven by poverty, economic instability, and an ageing population. As things stand, there is no obvious way out. Five decades after Smith\u2019s ideas had reached their hubristic peak, I met Forbes, 39, in the council leader\u2019s office; lined with wood panels and plush red carpet, it was recently used by a Japanese television crew as the location for a drama set in 1960s Tokyo. The hallway outside is dominated by a wooden model of Newcastle, which emphasises the more ambitious elements of the city\u2019s architecture, and seemed to symbolise the manic optimism of Forbes\u2019s most renowned predecessor. By contrast, the computer screen on Forbes\u2019s desk displayed a graph that suggested mounting doom. When we first met, in early 2013, he had showed me the same image: two green stripes, representing everything the city could spend on a range of services, which dovetailed to a point representing absolutely nothing. Since that first meeting, the situation had only become worse. \u201cBy 2017-18,\u201d Forbes said, \u201cour estimate is that we will have less than \u00a37m to spend on everything the city council does, above and beyond adult and children\u2019s social care. So it\u2019s completely untenable.\u201d     T Dan Smith, centre, was the Labour leader of Newcastle City Council from 1960 to 1965. Photograph: NCJ    In fact, the city\u2019s predicament already seemed impossible. The council cut \u00a337m from its spending in 2013-14, and another \u00a338m is set to follow this year. Then, according to current projections, there will be further annual cuts of \u00a340m, \u00a330m, and \u00a320m. Over a third of the money the council once spent must go, so Newcastle is in the midst of a dire squeeze on funding for children\u2019s centres, youth services, rubbish collection, parks, aid for homeless people, swimming pools, museums, and the arts. Back in 2011, Forbes said, when he and his colleagues had first confronted the depth and breadth of what they faced, a lot of them lapsed into silence. \u201cPeople went white,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey literally went white, at the prospect of it. There was a sense of disbelief about what it all meant, and the scale of cuts we would have to make.\u201d Newcastle is hardly alone. Birmingham is in an even more precarious position, as is Liverpool. Last week, the National Audit Office published a report warning that more than half of all local councils in England are at risk of \u201cfinancial failure\u201d within the next five years. \u201cI think that once the first or second wave of councils has gone down, somebody, somewhere, will have to think again,\u201d Forbes told me. But something in his voice suggested that he was less than certain. * * * Two years ago, Nick Forbes said that unless policies being pursued in London were seriously changed, cities such as Newcastle \u201cwill see the eventual disappearance of many of our public services, increased inequality, rising crime, a greater sense of desperation and resentment and a feeling of helplessness\u201d. In the civic centre, such words might still sound theoretical and abstract, but you do not have to go far to understand what he meant.  Ten minutes\u2019 drive to the west of the city centre, and north of the River Tyne, sits the area of Benwell. It is one of those places where the post-industrial condition seems to fill everything with a low melancholy; a sense of something that once happened here having been inexplicably snatched away. On a clear day in early October, at the backs of houses, there were great piles of rubbish every 15 or 20 yards \u2013 bits of plastic furniture, soggy children\u2019s clothes, discarded food. The bins were overflowing. A few passersby suggested that newly arrived Roma people from Slovakia were to blame; others said that was unfair, and pointed out that the city council had lately halved its bin collections, and reduced street cleaning. One woman stared out at a shabby alley from a first-floor window: \u201cNot me do rubbish,\u201d she said in halting English, and then disappeared inside. Denise Kelly, 22, led her three-year-old son Aaron-Lee through the mess, on their way back from a play session at a nearby nursery. \u201cI don\u2019t like living here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shithole, and it\u2019s got worse and worse.\u201d Around a year ago, she had moved back to Newcastle from Glasgow; now, she said, she wanted to return to Scotland. A few minutes away on West Road, I dropped into the As New shoe repair shop, a business that has been in the same family for 75 years. Peter Brien, 70, was behind the counter, lamenting the decline of the cobbling trade and the stilling of local street life. \u201cIt\u2019s all takeaways \u2013 that\u2019s all there is now,\u201d he said. He put the neighbourhood\u2019s uneasy calm down to simple hardship: \u201cPeople don\u2019t have as much money, so they don\u2019t get as much done.\u201d He still mended the odd pair of shoes, always handed back to their owners in crisp white paper bags bearing the legend \u201cExecutive shoe repairs\u201d. But his key-cutting machine broke a year ago, and two grand was too much to spend on a new one; he said he would be closing the shop in the summer.     Pre-school age children play at Riverside community centre in Newcastle. Photograph: Christopher Thomond    He talked about the area\u2019s history: the armaments plant owned by Vickers-Armstrongs, the Parsons factory that had once made turbines for power stations, local shipyards, and the sturdy terraces of workers\u2019 houses that were still here, extending towards the Tyne. Now, only a matter of yards away, there stood a signifier for harder times: a branch of Cash 4 Clothes, offering money for \u201call good quality reusable clothing, paired shoes, belts, handbags, jewellery, perfumes, and soft toys\u201d \u2013 a de facto pawnbroker for people with precious little left to pawn. A kilogram of castoffs paid 60p; for a tonne, they\u2019d hand over \u00a3600. In a compact playground to the side of the Riverside Community Health Project on Atkinson Road, a dozen or so toddlers were playing with scooters and trikes. The project\u2019s chief executive, Anne Bonner, 58, explained what it offers: help for recent arrivals from eastern Europe (\u201cthe most disadvantaged ethnic group in this area at the minute\u201d), cookery classes, a toy library, support for victims of domestic violence and \u201cactivities so that parents learn to play with their children\u201d. Some blame parents\u2019 seeming inability to engage with their kids on their constant use of mobile phones; Bonner put it down to stress \u2013 about money, more often than not. She recalled a woman brought up in care, who had moved to Benwell and come to the project for help. When she had quietly raised her worries and fears at one of the centre\u2019s mother and toddler groups, the project\u2019s staff had helped her get qualifications in basic maths and English, and eventually make it on to a childcare course, as well as helping her through a few bad relationships. One of her children had been bullied at school. \u201cShe was nervous about going to see the head, so someone from the project went with her.\u201d Now, both this woman\u2019s children were at university.Almost half of the project\u2019s funding comes from Sure Start, the initiative introduced by the Blair government in 1998, to improve children\u2019s lives by teaching parenting skills, offering support to parents who are struggling, and more. When I spoke to Nick Forbes, he said that Sure Start \u201cwas a symbol that we were a progressive country. It was a statement of intent to invest in the next generation of young people.\u201d It was perhaps understandable that he spoke in the past tense, because the programme\u2019s reach is now shrinking across the country: a survey by one children\u2019s charity recently found that spending on Sure Start had fallen by 20% over the three years to 2014, and a third of children\u2019s centres are now reckoned to be at risk of closure. In Newcastle, the city\u2019s spending devoted to children and families, centred on Sure Start, is about to be cut by 40% \u2013 a calamitous drop. In a hall at the back of the Riverside health project, Lorraine Morris, 38 \u2013 a mother of six, aged between two and 18 \u2013 was sorting out clothes and toys for a jumble sale in aid of the project\u2019s women\u2019s group. All her kids, she said, had been helped by Sure Start or were still benefiting from it. \u201cPeople have got used to cuts,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil things aren\u2019t there, they won\u2019t notice. We\u2019re very good at just making do. We\u2019re very \u2026 resilient. And maybe we\u2019ve had it so bad for so long that we just think that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201dThey might be used to cuts, but she and her neighbours were seeing new manifestations of austerity. Last winter, when temperatures were below freezing, they had received a delivery of grit, and been asked to spread it over their street themselves. Over Christmas in 2012, she said, their bins had sat unemptied for eight weeks, while \u201cthe rats bred like Jack Russells\u201d. Since last winter, Bonner said, her staff had been giving food vouchers to people in danger of going hungry. \u201cEven on a snowy day,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019d be queueing up outside, and we\u2019d be giving out 100 vouchers a day.\u201d Almost exactly half the project\u2019s funds, she said, come from the Sure Start budgets now being hacked back. She had already lost \u00a350,000 of annual funding; chasing donations from charities, she said, now took 10 times more effort than it did even a year ago. Closure, she said, was \u201csomething we face all the time. We\u2019re always on this knife-edge.\u201d  * * * Nick Forbes speaks in a softened north-east accent, seems to never swear, and is unfailingly courteous. Quietly, he has become one of the country\u2019s most highly-rated Labour politicians, winning elections while the party\u2019s leaders pinball from bad headline to bad headline. Jon Cruddas, the senior Labour MP charged with producing the party\u2019s policy review, who speaks regularly to Forbes, describes him in deeply admiring terms. \u201cHe sees the future of the Labour party as being very different. He really understands big questions about democracy, and he has a real understanding of the crisis of politics. What he\u2019s dealing with is terribly difficult, no question \u2013 but he\u2019s stepping up to how it changes the role of people in his position. Labour leaders outside Westminster have been in that situation for four years now, and it\u2019s given them a real maturity. He\u2019s really interesting.\u201d Forbes grew up about 30 miles from Newcastle, in Weardale, County Durham \u2013 \u201can idyll or a nightmare, depending on how old you are\u201d. His father was a postman, who then founded a museum devoted to the history of local lead-mining; his mother looked after Forbes and his two younger sisters. At home, they did not talk about politics much; Forbes got his ideological bearings from his maternal grandmother, a former primary school teacher in a pit village \u2013 who, he said, was \u201cdriven by an understanding of poverty, and the scars that it leaves on people\u201d.     Anne Bonner, chief executive at Riverside community health project in the Benwell area of Newcastle. Photograph: Christopher Thomond    The fact that he is gay made his school years very difficult. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what gay was at the time, but I was bullied for it,\u201d he said. \u201cPretty mercilessly. I used to come home covered in bruises; I had a bloody nose a couple of times. Chinese burns, cigarettes put out on my arms \u2013 all that kind of stuff.\u201d Forbes made it to Cambridge, where he studied social and political sciences, and was elected president of the student union. Though he had resolved to stay away from the north-east, towards the end of his time at university, his parents were involved in a serious car accident \u2013 which, he says, reminded him of the importance of family. So he returned, and spent three years as a trainee manager in the NHS, while tentatively taking his first serious political steps, as a city councillor. Back then, he wanted to be an MP, but he now thinks that a life in Westminster would have been no life at all. \u201cI kind of look back and think I wasted 15 years of my life trying to get into an institution which is bust. Why would I want to do it? For me, what\u2019s much more exciting is the idea that collectively, by bringing together the assets and resources that we have here, we can make this a kind of modern-day Jerusalem. That\u2019s a much more exciting prospect.\u201d After just over 10 years as a councillor, he became leader of the city in May 2011, when a rout of the Liberal Democrats in local elections across England brought Newcastle back to the Labour party. He kept his job as the chief executive of a health charity called Involve North East; his days are split between the two roles, meaning that he often does not finish work until around 9pm. For his work as the leader of the council, he is paid \u00a316,000 a year; an absurdly small amount, perhaps, but one that austerity has locked down. Other cities have faced even more drastic economies than Newcastle. But the way that Forbes has chosen to deal with his council\u2019s predicament has put him in the foreground of a national story. Three years ago, rather than approach his financial challenges year by year, he decided to take the long view, and baldly set out the impact of the cuts, up to 2016. \u201cWhat I said internally, was, \u2018We have to understand what these cuts mean for us. We can\u2019t simply stagger through year to year, on the basis of shaving off a bit here, and a bit there,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was becoming increasingly untenable to do that, given the scale of the problem. So I challenged the organisation to profile what three years of cuts would look like.\u201d The basics were clear enough: the real-terms loss of around 40% of the money the council used to get from central government to cover an array of services, along with rising costs \u2013 which combined to spell deep financial trouble. To make things worse, there was what he still sees as the simple iniquity of the government\u2019s actions, which arguably had a distinct flavour of class war, waged from the top: drastically cutting council funding per head in predominantly Labour areas, while more affluent, Tory-inclined places were comparatively untouched. In Guildford in Surrey, for example, the cuts between 2010 and 2013 worked out at \u00a319 per resident; in Newcastle, it was \u00a3162. \u201cEven civil servants have given up trying to justify it as objective and rational,\u201d Forbes told me. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely political. And I think it denotes an intent by the government to push mainly Labour-run councils into bankruptcy.\u201d The government response to such charges has tended to be curt: according to official statements from the Department for Communities and Local Government, the funding settlements in question have been \u201cfair to the north and south, and fair for rural and urban areas\u201d, and councils can apparently \u201cprotect frontline services and save the taxpayer billions in cash if they share back-office services, tap into their healthy reserves and cut out the non jobs and waste\u201d. If they fail to do such things, they are \u201cletting down their hard working residents\u201d. For a time, Forbes became notorious in his home city. There was resentment about how much basic services were to be cut, while the council was also attempting to fortify the city\u2019s economy via capital investment in housing, broadband, and redeveloping parts of the city centre, which was to be sizeably funded by borrowing. As Forbes pointed out at the time: \u201cIn the same way that you could get a mortgage to buy another house but couldn\u2019t get one to pay for food and daily living expenses, the council cannot borrow more money for its day-to-day expenditure.\u201d But such clear points were rather lost in a haze of anger, and personal attacks.     Nick Forbes earns \u00a316,000 a year as leader of Newcastle City Council. Photograph: Christopher Thomond    \u201cI did not go into politics to oversee this level of damage,\u201d Forbes said at the time. However, Lee Hall, the Newcastle-raised author of Billy Elliott, accused Forbes of \u201ctrying to cut as much as possible\u201d for \u201chis own political aggrandisement\u201d: in essence, hyping up the severity of what he faced and then decrying the government so as to raise his own profile. The very real cuts that have since been forced upon Newcastle and other councils rather suggest that this accusation was misplaced. Forbes himself says that his categorical rejection of a career in Westminster shows he was hardly set on making any kind of national name for himself. But the hostile noise was inescapable: led by Hall, a number of celebrities born and raised in the city \u2013 Bryan Ferry, Sting, Mark Knopfler \u2013 put their names to a letter claiming a proposed 100% cut to the council\u2019s arts funding would \u201cdecimate the cultural life of the city\u201d, and ensured that a small part of Newcastle\u2019s predicament got the attention of the national media. It was perhaps a shame nobody famous chose to speak up for youth centres, swimming pools, respite care for disabled children, or road-sweepers. During the six months or so when the city had to digest the scale of what was on the way, Forbes was assailed by strangers in the street; on one occasion, he was attacked by a man holding a placard with his own face on it. \u201cThere happened to have been a march on: I didn\u2019t know about it. The picture had a dotted line across my neck, with the words \u2018Cut here\u2019 on it.\u201d For a few months, he made sure he did not go out alone. Even now, he is occasionally still the focus of very personalised anger: after a recent Hallowe\u2019en protest organised by a group called Parents Against Cuts who are opposing the council\u2019s moves on Sure Start, the local Chronicle carried a picture of a white-faced protester dressed as \u201cthe ghost of regular bin collections\u201d, carrying a placard that decried \u201cSlasher Forbes\u201d. \u201cI worried, and worried, and worried,\u201d he said. \u201cI could sense that a lot of this would be deeply politically unpopular in the city. I was worried about the public reaction; I was worried about the political confidence of my relatively new group, in power, taking big decisions like this. I knew this would mean big job losses: there was a heavy human cost to this.\u201d He recalled regularly \u201cgoing home, late in the evening after long, intense difficult, emotionally challenging meetings with officers, talking about the detail of what we were going to have to cut \u2026 it was very, very difficult \u2026 Being the leader of a council in those circumstances is a lonely place to be.\u201d     Forbes was assailed by strangers in the street; once, he was attacked by a man holding a placard with his own face on it    What kept him going, he said, was his relationship with his partner, a lecturer at an FE college, and weekly rehearsals with the Royal Northern Sinfonia. \u201cI\u2019d go home and listen to all his problems at work, and that would make mine pale into insignificance,\u201d he said, emitting a dry laugh. \u201cAnd there was music. I\u2019ve always been a musician, so I sing. Baritone. My two and a half hours on a Sunday was the thing that kept me sane.\u201d I assumed the Labour leader would have been in touch, to hear from someone running such a big city. So I asked if he and Ed Miliband talk, reasonably frequently. \u201cUm \u2026 er \u2026 in passing,\u201d said Forbes. Miliband, he said, had recently visited Newcastle on his way back from a campaigning stint in Scotland and done a campaigning tour of the city\u2019s covered market, but they had not spoken since. What about Ed Balls? \u201cThe only conversation I\u2019ve had with Balls,\u201d Forbes said, \u201cended in an argument \u2013 about whether devolution [within England] is the right approach. I think it is, but his view was, \u2018We can\u2019t all move at the same speed, and therefore we\u2019ve got to move at the speed of the slowest\u2019 \u2013 to paraphrase.\u201d This exchange happened at a fundraising dinner, as Balls toured the tables. \u201cI was irritated, because it reinforced the Westminster-centric mentality: the idea that you get into power, to pull levers to make lives better for people,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cBut I think that experience has shown that they\u2019re rubber levers. People pull them but nothing happens. It makes our politics look even more hollow.\u201d When Forbes\u2019s anxiety about the cuts was at its height, he had regular discussions with other Labour leaders of English cities, but the party\u2019s national organisation never called them together to work out any collective stance. \u201cWe were on our own. Everywhere was on its own,\u201d he said. To that, there was one obvious response: That wasn\u2019t very good, was it? Across the country, the Labour party was \u2013 is \u2013 faced with a grave set of circumstances. And of the national leadership wasn\u2019t interested in that, it wasn\u2019t much of a signal to send out, surely? \u201cI don\u2019t want to be critical of individuals,\u201d Forbes told me. \u201cBut for a party that has solidarity as one of its core values, there wasn\u2019t a great deal of it on show.\u201dWhen I first met Forbes in early 2013, just as popular fury about the cuts was growing, he sometimes had the air of a man in a state of shock, thrown by the business of having to push through economies of which he really wanted no part, and the hostility he had kicked up. Indeed, when I followed him to a meeting about the government\u2019s plans for the benefits system, held at a women\u2019s centre close to Benwell, he came close to looking downright scared. Eighteen months on, he was much more assured, and the qualities that set him apart from much of his political milieu were all the more evident. When he met a dozen-strong group of Labour councillors from other parts of the north-east to discuss radically changing the arrangements for local buses \u2013 Newcastle\u2019s fares are a big source of grievance in the city \u2013 he was the only person in the room under 50: urbane and drily funny where others were often gruff and withdrawn. At one point, he spent an hour going through a diary which included everything from plans for visits from Chinese trade delegations to a desperate letter a man who had just become homeless (According to the city council, rough sleeping in Newcastle has trebled since 2011.) Soon after, he met four newly-elected Labour councillors \u2013 all women \u2013 who bemoaned the city council\u2019s seemingly institutionalised conservatism, and talked about the effects of the cuts on their local wards. Some of them represented affluent parts of the city, but still mentioned the visible decline of Newcastle\u2019s physical and aesthetic fabric: park lawns left unmowed, trees unpruned \u2013 and rubbish, always rubbish. From time to time, Forbes talked more enthusiastically than ever about the current vogue for devolution, the delicate negotiations it entails with national politicians, and how Newcastle might benefit: he thinks taking back power from Whitehall will \u201chelp set citizens free from a sense of hopelessness and neglect\u201d. His big problem is the fact that on current projections, his ideas about city government as a powerful force may soon fade into nothing, as Newcastle effectively goes bust.   * * *      The Millennium Bridge and Baltic Mill art centre. Photograph: Paul Thompson/Getty Images    Newcastle has attributes that can make any visitor quickly fall in love with the place: a deep sense of history, dizzying Saturday-night hedonism, the swirl of energy and creativity around its two universities, and an addictive sense of life being lived far from the shadow of London. The elegance of much of its city centre rises to a peak on Grey Street, the perfectly proportioned thoroughfare that is arguably England\u2019s most breathtaking example of 19th-century urban architecture. I walked from my hotel on the south bank of the Tyne, past the hulking Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art (opened in 2002), over the Millennum Bridge and into the city. On the undulating roof of the Sage, the concert complex designed by Norman Foster, built at a cost of \u00a370m and opened in December 2004, two men tethered by ropes were polishing the glass panels, one by one; on the north side of the water, people were emerging from well-appointed apartment blocks. It was one of those clear autumn mornings when metal glints and the sun\u2019s rays bounce off water. Superficially, Newcastle and neighbouring Gateshead looked like the embodiment of the post-industrial dreams \u2013 \u201cliving on thin air,\u201d as one former adviser to Tony Blair put it \u2013 that defined the giddy opening years of New Labour, many of whose prime movers \u2013 Blair, Peter Mandelson, Alan Milburn, David Miliband, Stephen Byers \u2013 had parliamentary seats in this part of the country. This patina of success reflects the story of Newcastle United, the 25th richest football club in the world in terms of annual revenue, who in 2010 were restored to the Premier League. But other aspects of their recent history speak of more troubling aspects of life in the city. The club\u2019s owner \u2013 none too popular with many fans, and said to be preparing to sell up \u2013 is Mike Ashley, the billionaire behind the retail chain Sports Direct, 85% of whose staff are on zero-hours contracts. The team\u2019s shirts once bore the insignia of Northern Rock, the north-east institution whose demise kicked off the financial crash in Britain; they now feature the logo of the payday lenders Wonga \u2013 which even adorned replica kits for children (until they recently decided that this was not quite in keeping with the ethics of a \u201cresponsible lender\u201d). In Newcastle, even the escapist pleasures of sport are weighted with the reminder of dire issues: the \u00a383m that has been taken out of the city\u2019s economy every year by benefit cuts, or the fact that the Northeast has the highest rate of unemployment in the UK. At the Citizens Advice on Nelson Street, where Georgian and Victorian architecture nudges up against the brutalist Eldon Square shopping centre (another monument to the visions of T Dan Smith), I spent two mornings observing encounters with people at the sharp end of those problems, who had come in seeking help. At 10am, they began crowding into the reception area: most accepting the wait, with the odd person crashing in and venting their frustration to anyone who would \u2013 or wouldn\u2019t - listen. Most of the people I observed trying to address seemingly intractable problems were women. One had registered for jobseeker\u2019s allowance, assumed all was well, and had what she assumed would be free dental treatment \u2013 only to be hit with a \u00a350 bill, and \u00a3100 penalty for saying she was on out-of-work benefits before her claim had been officially signed off. Another woman who worked as a carer on a zero-hours contract \u2013 for \u00a36.50 an hour, she said \u2013 had been confronted with a \u00a31,500 demand for overpaid tax credits, those supposed kindnesses designed for a world in which people\u2019s hours did not wildly vary. She now also owed \u00a3617 in unpaid council tax, and had been threatened with a visit from bailiffs. Debt collectors had proposed that she pay off the debt at the rate of \u00a345 a fortnight. \u201cI told them I couldn\u2019t afford that,\u201d she told me, \u201cand they said, \u2018Well you\u2019ve got to\u2019.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s changed is the amount of work that we now do that would have previously been done by the state \u2013 by civil servants, or the city council. Particularly for vulnerable people,\u201d said Shona Alexander, the bureau\u2019s chief executive. A quarter of her paid staff had gone. She said she worried that the demise of preventive support would only cause more problems to fester. And within 10 minutes, she mentioned reductions to Sure Start. \u201cWe just dread to think what\u2019ll happen when that\u2019s cut back,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will be absolutely massive. Without that support, a lot of families will struggle.\u201d Here was a clue to another aspect of the city council\u2019s problems: it is currently owed \u00a312.5m in unpaid council tax. One woman I met said that until recently, she had worked full-time at a barber\u2019s shop, for a boss who never gave his employees payslips. Determined to get a better job, she had then started training as a lecturer in hairdressing, which meant going from full-time to part-time, and claiming housing benefit. But the latter required the payslips she couldn\u2019t get \u2013 and very quickly, she found herself behind on her rent and council tax, and \u00a3800 in arrears for both. She had left the old job, and was still trying to get her payslips, to no avail; she had been to the city council for help and advice, but evidently not got very far. She glanced at a poster about domestic violence. A couple of years ago, she had exited an abusive relationship. \u201cI left with two black bags and my two daughters while he was out,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then, I was just putting my life back together, but I keep thinking I\u2019ve done something wrong, because all this has happened.\u201d She broke down in tears. And then she said something so straightforward that it might easily have sounded banal, had it not reflected both her travails, and those of the whole city. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain,\u201d she said. \u201cYou work hard your entire life. And then you need help. But you just don\u2019t seem to get it.\u201d At a six-day-a-week youth club rub by the YMCA in the faded Newgate shopping centre, nine of its teenage regulars answered my questions with a very adolescent mixture of wry amusement and flashes of insight. Most of them had parents who had come to the city from abroad \u2013 Nigeria, Brazil, Zimbabwe and Angola. They made disaffected noises about the cost of higher education, older siblings on minimum wage jobs, and the sense that in the last five years, the opportunities presented to people their age had shrunk. But they talked most ruefully about the council\u2019s closure of the huge City Pool, opened in 1927, where the Newcastle Amateur Swimming Club recently trained three Olympians. \u201cThey should never, ever have closed that,\u201d said Marcelo Neves, 16. Until last year, he had gone there every Friday; now, he said, he had stopped swimming altogether. They were watched by Jeff Hurst, 52, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 from Croydon who moved here \u201cfor love\u201d, and is now the YMCA\u2019s chief executive. Entry charges to swimming pools transferred from the council to a new trust, he said, have recently gone up by nearly a quarter. At the same time, the increasingly parlous state of the city\u2019s parks was clearly diminishing their appeal. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 50% of six-year-olds in our city who are either overweight or obese. We\u2019ve got some of the least active people in the country, and some of the poorest people in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cSo where\u2019s the sense in that?\u201d Among his biggest concerns, he said, was the council\u2019s drastic cuts to youth services and play centres. More cuts in help for young people would affect drug and alcohol advice, and programmes for teenage pregnancy. Hurst mentioned that the recent Jay report into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham had made repeated reference to the importance of youth work, and worries raised by the people involved in it about the consequences of cuts. Newcastle has its own sexual exploitation case, focused on the west end of the city, with grimly familiar elements (taxi firms, takeaways, vulnerable girls and young women), which has so far led to over 50 arrests. \u201cYoung people need someone they can trust, someone they can go to without it triggering a formal intervention,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you can take away youth workers, they have only have their family. And for a lot young people, the last people they\u2019ll go to are their parents. \u201cQuite soon,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll see the results of that.\u201d  * * *  When I spent time with Forbes in early October, there were moments when grim stories would momentarily give way to flashes of optimism, and he and his colleagues would enthuse about the creative ways some of the cuts had been parried. Partner organisations and volunteers had saved nine of 10 libraries that had been threatened with closure: in the middle-class suburb of Jesmond, I spent an hour at a volunteer-run library that now worked as kind of meeting-space and cultural centre, though the people in charge lamented the fact that they had been cut loose from the city\u2019s library system, so that they couldn\u2019t access books kept elsewhere. The city\u2019s arts budget is now to be handled via an independently-managed \u201cculture fund\u201d which will guarantee half the old budget, and offer low-interest loans to arts groups, as well as being able to solicit money from charity. On the face of it, these stories might feed a fantasy about councils doing \u201cmore with less\u201d. But in Newcastle, as elsewhere, they have proved to be exceptions: strangely enough, cuts tend to lead inexorably to what politicians would call negative outcomes. In October, when anyone mentioned Sure Start, a crackle of anxiety would pass through the room. Four weeks on, in early November, the council had decided how it would cut nearly \u00a35m a year from the relevant budgets: folding what was left of a whole host of services for children and families into a new creation called Community Family Hubs, focusing their efforts on communities with the highest level of deprivation. The only certainty was that money would go, and some of the city\u2019s 20 Sure Start centres would close. Once again, I met Forbes at the civic centre, where he emerged from a long meeting about the city\u2019s new ways of funding the arts, wearing his customary pin-stripe suit. He agreed that there would inevitably be needy children and families who would fall just the wrong side of the council\u2019s new \u201cdeprivation\u201d line. He also sympathized with the revulsion about this latest cut, which was bound up with the abandonment of a very powerful idea \u2013 that a lot of Sure Start services are universal, and therefore don\u2019t come with the stigma of targeted help for the poor. \u201cI absolutely understand that,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cBut if we have no money, what else can we do?\u201d    But we\u2019ve got to keep our eyes on a far horizon. Because if we don\u2019t, then we simply wallow in self-pity  Nick Forbes     On paper, I suggested, perhaps \u00a34.7m wasn\u2019t that much. \u201cIt is when the council has virtually no money to do anything else with,\u201d he said. So, metaphorically speaking, he was now down to counting out change. \u201cIn budget discussions, we\u2019re down to talking about the last thousand. Seriously: we argue about where the decimal point goes.\u201d And were these cuts the most painful yet? \u201cNo. No,\u201d he said. What could be worse, I asked. \u201cTransport for kids with special educational needs and disabilities.\u201d He paused. \u201cThat is in the pipeline.\u201d Looking ahead, he seemed to worry about one part of the council\u2019s responsibilities more than most. Government funding for children\u2019s social care, he said, has already fallen by a third, while need in Newcastle has gone up by 40%. \u201cWe haven\u2019t cut children\u2019s social care to nearly the same extent that we\u2019ve cut other areas of the council\u2019s budget,\u201d he went on, and he said the council\u2019s role in the city\u2019s ongoing sexual exploitation case proved it. \u201cWe had the teams in place to go in, and make sure children were safe and they were protected from further harm.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd my very real concern is that \u2026 well, if this level of cuts continue, even our statutory responsibilities, like children\u2019s social care, will be affected. What frustrates me like nothing else is how deaf government is to this argument.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019re into the realm of impossible cuts,\u201d he said. What, I wondered, keeps him going? What is it to be a progressive politician when most of what you do comes down to the administration of a nightmare? \u201cPart of the progressive nature is dealing with the challenges of today, but also thinking about what tomorrow will look like,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not leading a city in decline. I\u2019m not prepared to lead a city in decline. This is a city with some difficulties, certainly. But we\u2019ve got to keep our eyes on a far horizon. Because if we don\u2019t, then we simply wallow in self-pity.\u201d To have his picture taken, he went up on the roof. The lights of Newcastle were gleaming; traffic was backed up along the Great North Road. In some inexplicable way, and if only for a moment, the scene seemed of a piece with Forbes\u2019s belief in how Newcastle might sooner or later get back on the right track. But then my thoughts flitted back to Benwell, a place staring into the future with much more uncertainty. That morning, above an off-licence, I had glimpsed a spectacularly incongruous billboard announcing high-end flights on Emirates, advertising a new daily service from Newcastle to Dubai. \u201cEnjoy business class to over 140 destinations worldwide,\u201d it said, to no one in particular.

The only other British cities to make it into this year\u2019s top 50 are Edinburgh (26), Manchester (29), and Coventry (45).

Europe boasts 20 cities, North America 12, Asia nine, Oceania seven and South America two.

Julio Le Parc\u2019s exhibition in the Serpentine\u2019s Sackler Gallery is alive with twinkling lights and little balls going boingy-boingy on bits of string. There are floors that tilt as you step up to bash a balloon, funny glasses that screw up your sight, low seats on springs that hurl you to the ground. Even the press release describes the show as an amusement arcade. Last year Le Parc held a major exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, breaking attendance records. In the cramped, dark spaces of the Sackler, the effect is less spectacular, and the crowds likely to diminish the essentially fragile and ephemeral pleasures of his best art. They invited little kids to the press view, maybe as a photo-opportunity, perhaps so they\u2019d go home and Facebook or Snapchat their friends. They looked unimpressed. They want stronger stuff. When you press a button nothing dies and no one twerks or gets their kit off. Perhaps, like me, they have become inured to simple pleasures.     Julio Le Parc\u2019s Continuous Light 1962-1996: lack of space cramps his best art. Photograph: Sarah Lee/Guardian    Owing something both to post-war Latin American modernism, with its curious synthesis of formal purism and experiment, op art and kinetics, and to the anti-formal games of fluxus and iconoclasm of French art from the 1960s, Le Parc\u2019s art has an endearingly period flavour \u2013 but that is also its trap. Born in Argentina in 1928, Le Parc has spent most of his career in France, except for a short period of exile after the manifestations of May \u201968. A former student of Lucio Fontana in Buenos Aires during the war years (Le Parc holds an entirely imaginary, fictional conversation with Fontana in a book that accompanies the show), he remains radical and anti-authoritarian in spirit. I expected more than mild entertainment at the Serpentine, but came out with something less. Radical politics and radical art are not the same. Somehow Le Parc\u2019s trick spectacles don\u2019t work as well (or as weirdly) as the Brazilian Lygia Clark\u2019s; his experiments with distorted light and mirrors evoked no sense of childhood wonder. I kept looking round to see what all the pretty moving lights were meant to advertise. Looking back at Le Parc\u2019s versions of Op and clunky kinetics, time and technology have been less than kind. The interactive elements of his work \u2013 the switches that send ping-pong balls careening round a vitrine, and set twirling bits of wood clicketty-clacking about \u2013 don\u2019t really do the business any more. The trouble with any new technology is that it soon looks old, and not necessarily in a good way. Nor do the fun-fair games hold their own: one area is decked out with dangling punchbags, each emblazoned with a hate-figure. You can punch a judge, whack a journalist, belt a banker, kick-box a priest or head-butt a pop idol. Other games invite you to throw sucker-tipped darts at imperialists and dictators, or to knock down nursing mums, cops or even Mickey Mouse with a ball. This feels more lame than tame. Maybe we\u2019re meant to get into a spirit of late-1960s rebellion, but it is somehow quaint, and feels as subversive as drenching a vicar at the village fete for a quid a go.

These times of heavy travel and weather disruptions remind us how reliant we really are on our transit systems. But that\u2019s something John O\u2019Grady never, ever forgets. His job is to keep the stormwater that can paralyze those systems out. O\u2019Grady has worked for 26 years at New York City\u2019s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) as a manager of infrastructure and facilities projects \u2013 he knows the nuts and bolts of how New York City subways run. But when the MTA faced a series of flash floods in 2007 and then Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012, his job changed currents. That\u2019s when New York transit realized they needed a whole department dedicated to long-term flooding prevention.     Flooded escalators to the South Ferry Whitehall St subway station after Hurricane Sandy. Photograph: Handout/Reuters    \u201cI was never, and don\u2019t profess to be, a flood or stormwater or hurricane expert,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe day after Sandy, this work pretty much found its way to me.\u201d For my Stormproofing the City series, O\u2019Grady explains, in simple terms, how he\u2019s protecting his transit system \u2013 one of the world\u2019s oldest, biggest and busiest \u2013 from future natural disasters. What are some ways you\u2019ve been making the system more resilient? So you\u2019ve been speaking with people with a more global, city-wide picture. Keep in mind that my work is specific to New York City Transit. We can\u2019t stop a hurricane. What we can do is protect the transit infrastructure, because our system can\u2019t go down for a couple weeks. We need to start moving the city again as soon as the storm has passed. And to do that, we have to make sure the yards don\u2019t flood, that under-river tunnels don\u2019t flood, that stations don\u2019t flood, etc.  So we look at ourselves as being responsible for our own fate. It\u2019s been two years and we\u2019re just finishing the planning phase \u2013 there\u2019s still a lot of work to do. But we can\u2019t wait for some of the more global strategies to be implemented.   stormproofing the city sidebar   This is interesting, because a transit official wrote in to the series to suggest that \u201cthere is no appearance of coordination between the MTA and NYC, and hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on redundant projects.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t call them redundant. Fifty years from now you may be able to say that, but until there\u2019s a global strategy for the overall city, I think the MTA is being smart. There\u2019s always the potential for overlap, but sometimes you have to fix things while you\u2019re waiting for that overlap to materialize. And I think the best course of action is for each of these agencies, like Con Edison, Transit, and the Department of Environmental Protection, is to go about fixing and hardening their systems while the global approach works through its necessary environmental and funding processes. Someone with a more global perspective could say, \u201cWhy is Transit doing that? We\u2019re going to do it in the next year or two.\u201d But it won\u2019t be the next year or two. It takes longer than that. Can you tell me about a few of the floodproofing projects you\u2019re planning for the subway? The approach for MTA is to keep the water out. First you have to know where you can possibly flood, so we imposed flood mapping over our transit system to identify our most vulnerable assets. Then we figured out how to best keep water from destroying or coming through those assets to flood the system. Assets are things like ventilation bays \u2013 the grating on the sidewalk that people walk over every day, which allows for the natural exchange of air between the subway and the street above. Those wind up being an extreme vulnerability in floodprone areas. There are also the manholes on the street, equipment hatches on the sidewalks, and emergency exits for underground evacuation. None of these are watertight. We\u2019ve developed a structure for the vent bay, for example, that\u2019s like a bottomless box that allows air through day in and day out, but that allows us to release a pin that closes the bottom, keeping water out should there be a storm.     The MTA\u2019s solution for floodproofing manholes. Photograph: Metropolitan Transportation Authority    How did you create these solutions for keeping water out? Did you look to other cities?    We didn\u2019t find any innovative solutions by exploring what's used in Tokyo or Hong Kong.    Honestly, one of the first things we did after the storm was a worldwide survey of all transit systems to see if any brilliant idea existed that we hadn\u2019t thought of. And we didn\u2019t find any innovative solutions by exploring what\u2019s used in Tokyo or Hong Kong or Europe or South America. Generally, the systems prone to flooding pretty much use the same technologies we were proposing. Then, when we looked at the floodproofing technologies available, we couldn\u2019t find any that existed for the kinds of facilities that Transit has. So we had to work with vendors to develop or adapt their technologies to our system. This has really been a significant effort. Here\u2019s one example: we worked with a vendor to develop flexible closure panels for station staircases. That lets us close off a staircase, which normally could allow water to flood the system, by deploying a hi-tech strong curtain material across it horizontally.      A sample flexible closure panel covering a staircase at Whitehall St Station.    Where does the money come from to pay for these projects? It comes from the Federal Transit Authority. We\u2019re still in the design process \u2013 with a couple years of implementation to go \u2013 so how much money we\u2019ll need is still being determined.  And there are always going to be projects that you can\u2019t get to. But I do believe that Transit\u2019s most vulnerable areas can be made to sustain a similar event to Sandy. The system will remain vulnerable, however, as we put these remedies in place.  So if another storm like Sandy was to happen tomorrow, nothing will have changed yet? We\u2019re pretty much still in the initial stages of implementation. We\u2019ll be awarding a slew of projects for lower Manhattan locations over the next few months, and they\u2019ll be in construction for the next year or so.  In the end, I\u2019m certainly expecting to get this work into place before another Sandy-type event. But it does concern me.    I\u2019m certainly expecting to get this work into place before another Sandy-type event. But it does concern me.    Our operating department has plans for how to temporarily protect these most vulnerable locations should another storm suddenly appear. They can barricade entrances, like they did with Sandy \u2013 and they\u2019ll build higher and stronger ones in the future. Certainly Con Edison is hardening their system. And we do have pumping capability, if water starts to come into the system on a gradual basis. The problem with storms as big as Sandy is the volume of the surge and the floating debris, which can include massive objects \u2013 like dumpsters. When a marine timber 30ft long traveling in a moving current of water barrels into a wooden barricade, that trumps any temporary defense we can put up. During Sandy, even the power was out. There wasn\u2019t a fighting chance. Are you working to protect the system against storms like Sandy, or bigger? We\u2019re protecting for a storm that\u2019s a degree stronger than Sandy. Two to three times more powerful, the city\u2019s gonna be in trouble. But for a storm a grade up, we\u2019ll be fine. When I spoke with scientist Klaus Jacob, he suggested we consider bigger and longer-term solutions, like raising the entrances of the trains, or raising the trains themselves. Can you imagine working on something like that?  I actually can\u2019t. To raise or build a new line so you\u2019d never flood again would be a significant investment. And it\u2019d be many years of environmental and funding processes \u2013 I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d ever have the money for it.  Is that an approach that works? Absolutely. Is it necessary? Not yet. I understand that his job is to anticipate the things we may have to face in 20 years, but for right now my team just needs to focus on existing facilities \u2013 we simply don\u2019t have the dollars to rebuild the system.     Commuters pack into the F train two days after Hurricane Sandy, after limited public transit returned to New York. Photograph: Allison Joyce/Getty Images    What\u2019s the biggest challenge your team faces? It\u2019s the fact that we have so many riders that depend on us. Rush hour is now every hour of the day, so we have to be careful about upsetting the general path of commuting New Yorkers. But to do this work, we have to take trains out of service. If I had a magic wand, I\u2019d love to fix all nine of our under-river tubes at the same time, but it\u2019s not practical. We have to do one or two at a time. And that drags the schedule out. This is making me feel bad for cursing MTA during weekend service outages. Yeah! Folks like to be able to walk to their station and take the train. If they\u2019re used to a path of travel, they get upset when they don\u2019t have it \u2013 even if another is just as convenient. But it\u2019s important to remember that we have to close off these areas to keep the public safe and make the system stronger. We\u2019re working our way through this, and we\u2019re working as fast as we can. This interview is part of a series called Stormproofing the City.

Joji Morishita, the head of Tokyo\u2019s delegation to the International Whaling Commission, said Japan would defy \u201ceco-imperialist\u201d anti-whaling countries \u2013 led by Australia and New Zealand \u2013 and resume the slaughter of whales in the Southern Ocean in late 2015. In March the International Court of Justice ruled that Japan had produced insufficient scientific data to justify the killing of whales for \u201cresearch\u201d and put an immediate end to its hunts in the Antarctic. Morishita said international objections to whaling, partly on the grounds that the hunts are unprofitable and bankrolled by Japanese taxpayers \u2013 could be compared to restrictions on the wearing of kimono. \u201cThe average Japanese woman wears kimono perhaps two or three times in her lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cThose ceremonial kimono cost millions of yen, so some might argue that they are a waste of money. But what if another country then said that only a small number of women could wear kimono?\u201d He added that Japan had responded adequately to ICJ criticisms in a revised scientific whaling program revealed last week, adding that he fully expected the country\u2019s fleet would leave for the Antarctic at the end of next year. Under the 1986 IWC moratorium on commercial whaling, Japan was permitted to kill almost 1,000 mainly minke whales a year for \u201cscientific research\u201d. Meat from the slaughtered whales is sold on the open market, although a dramatic drop in demand in recent decades means thousands of tonnes of meat has been left unsold. The world court withdrew Japan\u2019s whaling licence in the Antarctic, forcing officials in Tokyo to devise a new program that they say has solid scientific foundations. \u201cSome countries won\u2019t allow any whale hunting under any circumstances,\u201d Morishita said on Wednesday, a week after Japan unveiled its new scientific whaling proposal. \u201cThey have a zero-tolerance policy. But it\u2019s time to end that paradigm. If we don\u2019t, there is no reason for the IWC to exist.\u201d In its revised program, Japan says it will kill 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean next year, and a total of 3,996 over 12 years. The quota is significantly lower than the 850 minke whales it targeted each year until Australia\u2019s legal challenge at The Hague put a temporary halt to the hunt. Australia has been the most vocal opponent of Japan\u2019s lethal research hunts in an area of the Southern Ocean that Canberra regards as a whale sanctuary. Environmental groups condemned the new plans. \u201cJapan\u2019s new whaling proposal for the Southern Ocean sanctuary is neither new nor improved,\u201d said Kitty Block, vice-president of the Humane Society International. \u201cDespite the ICJ decision condemning the nation\u2019s so-called scientific program, Japan is still trying to explain the inexplicable and defend the indefensible. The hunt is for commercial purposes \u2013 not science.\u201d Morishita accused Australia and other countries of offering only \u201cemotional\u201d arguments in defence of an animal that had come to be seen as \u201ccharismatic\u201d. Japan, by contrast, was only interested in scientific proof that sustainable use of an \u201cordinary marine resource\u201d was possible. He said weak demand for whale meat among Japanese consumers was no reason to end the slaughter. \u201cYes, if you ask ordinary Japanese people they say they don\u2019t eat whale meat, but at the same time they say they don\u2019t like the idea of being told not to eat it by people who eat, say, beef. \u201cPeople in India don\u2019t eat beef, but what if they started a campaign against McDonald\u2019s in other countries, perhaps imposing economic sanctions? You can see the stupidity of the [anti-whaling] argument when you apply it to beef. But what is the difference between cows and whales?\u201d The resumption of whaling in the Antarctic could be short-lived. From 2016, \u201cscientific\u201d whale hunts must first be reviewed and approved by the general membership of the IWC, the majority of which is anti-whaling. The next hunt will not be subject to the requirement because it is due to start a year before the IWC\u2019S next meeting."}, {"sentences": ["At the London conference, Afghanistan and its international partners are meant to review progress against the 2012 Tokyo mutual accountability framework, which includes commitments on governance, democracy, finance and rights."], "tags": ["Conflict and development", "Afghanistan", "Aid", "Global development", "UK news", "Women", "Ashraf Ghani"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-27T07:00:04Z", "title": "Afghanistan: what will happen when the troops \u2013 and their dollars \u2013 depart? | Cl\u00e1r N\u00ed Chonghaile", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/27/afghanistan-nato-troops-withdraw-ashraf-ghani", "article": "It would be a challenge for any leader: balance the books after years of systemic corruption, battle a resurgent rebellion and form a government despite entrenched ethnic divisions. But Afghan\u2019s new president, Ashraf Ghani, must do all this as thousands of foreign troops pull out, taking their services, experience, hardware and dollars with them. Ghani\u2019s most pressing task at a summit with international donors in London on 3-4 December may be to make sure the world does not forget Afghanistan once foreign soldiers are no longer fighting on its soil. Nato troops are due to withdraw from Afghanistan by 31 December. From a peak of around 140,000 in 2011, the force will shrink to 12,000 soldiers, who will stay mainly to train Afghan security forces.  The withdrawal leaves Afghanistan more vulnerable to Taliban insurgents, who have been gaining ground this year, and deprives the economy of the benefits of having tens of thousands of foreign troops stationed in the country.  \u201cThe Afghan economy is a war bubble and we are seeing it slowly deflate,\u201d says Graeme Smith, senior analyst at International Crisis Group. He says the budget deficit was $300m-750m, with security costs eating up around $650m of the government\u2019s meagre funds. \u201cIf the Afghans were not paying that \u2026 to fight the war which, to be frank, we started, then most of these budgetary pressures would disappear overnight,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile we\u2019re putting Afghanistan through these shocking political and military transitions, it behoves us to try to ease the economic transition, to smooth the way with some cash.\u201d  However, many international partners are disillusioned after 13 years of rampant administrative corruption. Although Ghani represents a new start after Hamid Karzai\u2019s discredited presidency, it is not clear yet whether this will be enough to guarantee continued, long-term financial support. At the London conference, Afghanistan and its international partners are meant to review progress against the 2012 Tokyo mutual accountability framework, which includes commitments on governance, democracy, finance and rights.      Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. Photograph: Massoud Hossaini/AP    Omar Samad, a former Afghan ambassador to France and Canada, says Ghani may want to recast some of these commitments to try to make aid more effective and accountable.  \u201cThis is going to be seen by the new Afghan government as an occasion to renew ties with the international community and to receive strong political and \u2026 development support for [its] agenda,\u201d Samad says.\u201cIt\u2019s a very critical moment because the glass is seen as half-full from the Afghan side. We need to solidify the gains of the last 13 years but we also need to enhance and \u2026 grow in a sustainable manner.\u201d There is real fear of gains being lost in the sphere of women\u2019s rights, with activists warning that women could be excluded from future peace talks with the Taliban, endangering their status and protection. Peace talks are seen as inevitable despite a decade of failed negotiations with the insurgents, who are partly funded by profits from the illegal opium trade, which fuels corruption and subverts the legal economy. Aid groups have urged British and Afghan authorities to make it clear in London that women\u2019s rights are non-negotiable. The main conference meeting on 4 December will be preceded by a civil society event \u2013 the Ayenda conference, which means \u201cfuture\u201d in Dari \u2013 on 3 December. Britain\u2019s Department for International Development said it expects women to be actively involved throughout the two days.  The withdrawal of most Nato troops has triggered soul-searching about the achievements of a military mission that cost billions of dollars and thousands of lives, including 2,210 American and 453 British soldiers. Ghani, too, may be reassessing his options, with some signs that he may turn increasingly to China, which has signalled willingness to take a more active role in Afghanistan, with which it shares a narrow, mostly impassable, border.  \u201cGhani is making a very rational move by reaching out to China, not only because China has legitimate economic interests in Afghanistan and Afghanistan desperately needs new economic partners, but also because of China\u2019s significant sway over Islamabad, and Islamabad\u2019s very significant influence over the [Taliban] insurgency,\u201d Smith says.     An Afghan woman buys silk yarn for weaving from a shop in Herat. Photograph: Aref Karimi/AFP/Getty Images    Samad says the greatest gains since 2001 include the creation of greater political, economic and social spaces, especially for women and young people. But governance and rule of law are still lacking, infrastructure projects are not well thought out, and there is a middle-management skills gap. The troop withdrawal will affect every aspect of life: Smith says there will no longer be demand for armies of trucks to carry gravel, diesel or other inputs to military bases, and construction activity is expected to slow.  David Haines, country director for Mercy Corps, says employment rates among people who have completed the aid group\u2019s vocational training in Helmand province have already dropped significantly for men and dramatically for women this year as fighting raged and business slowed.  He hopes the London conference will underline international support for Ghani to allow him \u201cto get his house in order\u201d over the next few years. \u201cIf he has to try and negotiate peace with the Taliban, deal with a massive falling economy, deal with corruption and a lack of accountability of public servants \u2026 it\u2019s an impossible task to ask of anybody,\u201d he says. Smith says history has shown that when troops pull out of a country, funds tend to follow. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have fresh-faced British soldiers whose lives are at risk, it\u2019s much easier to turn off the tap. And that\u2019s the real danger now for Afghanistan: that the world will forget.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Photograph: Alderac Entertainment Group    King of Tokyo Based on the public-domain dice game Yahtzee, King of Tokyo transforms players into giant monsters competing to wreak destruction on the Japanese capital."], "tags": ["Games", "Board games", "Technology", "Family", "Game culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-27T12:24:36Z", "title": "Start your own board game collection \u2013 our pick of the best titles", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/27/start-your-own-board-game-collection-our-pick-best-titles", "article": "If you\u2019re a newcomer to board games, the hobby can seem bewildering. With a staggering array of titles to choose from and thousands of new games released each year, it\u2019s quite a challenging to pick out the best newcomers to add to your collection. To help you, we\u2019ve compiled a list of some of the best games to suit a variety of tastes. Strategy games Star Wars X-Wing Miniatures Game This fast-paced space combat game puts you in command of a fleet of Rebel or Imperial ships from the Star Wars universe. Your aim is to destroy your enemies with flashy manoeuvres, clever tactics and superior firepower. The base set comes with everything you need for a small two-player dogfight, while expansion packs let you deploy new ships including the Millennium Falcon and the gargantuan Tantive IV. A Game of Thrones: The Board Game In the mood for something more complex? A Game of Thrones lets you command one of the great houses of George R R Martin\u2019s realm of Westeros. With more than 500 components and a rulebook that runs to over 30 pages, it\u2019s not for the faint-of-heart, but this game of alliances, diplomacy, backstabbing and betrayal is fantastically evocative of the bloody struggle for the Iron Throne. Pandemic Of course, strategy doesn\u2019t always have to mean violence. Matt Leacock\u2019s Pandemic sees players join forces as a team of medics attempting to eradicate four deadly diseases. Each player has their own special ability, and you\u2019ll need to use each of them to their best effect if you hope to save humanity. It\u2019s a tense, masterfully designed co-operative game that requires players to respond to increasingly drastic threats.     Pandemic pits players against a series of deadly diseases. Photograph: Z-Man Games    Honourable mention: Eight Minute Empire \u2013 a complete nation-building experience in a small, quick and simple package. Family games Love Letter The most successful of a crop of tiny games by Japanese designers, Seiji Kanai\u2019s Love Letter packs a respectable helping of intrigue and deduction into just 16 cards. As a suitor for the hand of a beautiful princess, you\u2019ll have to overcome the royal family, the palace guards and rival players to deliver your love letter. The rules fit on the back of a single card and a round takes less than five minutes to play.     In Love Letter players attempt to win the affections of a princess. Photograph: Alderac Entertainment Group    King of Tokyo Based on the public-domain dice game Yahtzee, King of Tokyo transforms players into giant monsters competing to wreak destruction on the Japanese capital. You\u2019ll roll a set of six dice which let you score points, attack other monsters or build up energy which you can use to gain special powers like telepathy, fiery breath or an extra head. Riff Raff If you\u2019re a fan of Jenga but feel the need for a stiffer challenge, Riff Raff might be for you. You\u2019ll have to stack various kinds of cargo on to a wooden ship, either on deck or dangling precariously from the yardarms. What complicates matters is the fact that the ship is connected to a pendulum which swings wildly when the vessel becomes unbalanced, throwing precious cargo into the murky depths. Honourable mention: Dobble \u2013 a collection of lightning-fast mini-games based on quick reflexes and keen observation. Bluffing games Cash \u2018n Guns Probably the only board game that lets you point imitation firearms at your fellow players, Cash \u2018n Guns places you in the role of a gangster freshly returned from a successful heist. Your goal is to get away with as much loot as you can carry, but your opponents will attempt to stop you by aiming their squishy foam pistols in your direction. Only they know whether their guns are loaded \u2013 so, do you feel lucky, punk? Skull A beautifully simple game that takes the core concept of poker, strips out the maths and leaves the fun. Skull has players secretly lay down cards showing either a flower or a skull, then bet on how many of their own and their opponents\u2019 cards they can turn face-up without revealing a dead, hollow grin. The pressure mounts with every flip of a card, and if you reveal too many skulls you\u2019ll be knocked out of the game.  Ultimate Werewolf Monsters are stalking the village. Every night one of the townsfolk is murdered. In the morning, the people wake to find one of their number slain and vote to execute another player as a suspected werewolf. The werewolves\u2019 goal is to avoid discovery, while the villagers must root out the real culprits before they fall victim to the creatures, or to the pervasive and deadly paranoia that grips their community. Honourable mention: Coup \u2013 lie and cheat your way to power in a futuristic city-state where competing nobles vie for influence. Brainy games Concept A game modelled on 20 questions probably shouldn\u2019t be this much fun. Teams of players attempt to describe a word or phrase so that others around the table can guess what it is. No talking is allowed \u2013 instead players have to use a set collection of graphical icons to provide meaningful clues. An ideal after-dinner game that\u2019s alternately funny and wonderfully frustrating. Quirkle The winner of the 2011 Spiel des Jahres (Game of the year) award, Qwirkle works much like Scrabble. Players score points by laying tiles to create lines of different shapes and colours. Unlike Scrabble, though, there\u2019s no board. The game sprawls out across the table as you try to maximise your own scoring opportunities while cutting off your opponents\u2019. Blokus A competitive, Tetris-like puzzle game, Blokus gives each player a collection of plastic tiles made up of different configurations of square blocks. Your objective is to place as many of your tiles onto the grid-patterned board as possible, but your own pieces can only touch each other on corners. As the board fills up, you\u2019ll fight with increasing urgency for rapidly dwindling space. Honourable mention: Hanabi \u2013 co-operate with other players to play the right cards and orchestrate a perfect firework show. But your own cards are hidden from you; you\u2019ll have to rely on clues from your partners to choose the right one. Which games got you into gaming? Are there any we should have included on our list?

Depending on whom you ask, the need ranges from 10 to several dozen million units. If you add families that currently live in inadequate homes, the number increases exponentially. While the government is struggling to find innovative ways to address the shortage, thousands of small homes are being built daily without much external support and outside any official scheme. Wherever access to land is possible, people build homes and improve them over time. This energy must be recognised and harnessed if India is to provide decent housing to its growing urban population.  According to well-circulated statistics, 60% of Mumbaikars live in \u201cslums\u201d, which occupy 6% of the city\u2019s land. What is less known is that many of these so-called slums have little to do with the kind of apocalyptic imagery sold to the world in blockbuster movies, best-selling books and tabloids. A majority of homes in areas notified as \u201cslums\u201d by the government are built in bricks, steel and cement, by experienced teams of contractors, masons, plumbers, electricians and carpenters. What these individual initiatives lack is a framework proving better planning at a neighbourhood level. Many of Mumbai\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods could become functional and even desirable with a little support from the authorities. If most \u201cslums\u201d don\u2019t enjoy adequate infrastructure, it is not because it is technically difficult or even expensive, but rather because there is a deliberate will to keep certain neighbourhoods in a state of precariousness and political dependency.            The biggest impediment to the improvement of many settlements is the misconception that they are illegitimate, because residents don\u2019t own the land they occupy. However, some neighbourhoods such as Shivaji Nagar in Govandi, where our office is located, were never illegal encroachments to start with. Shivaji Nagar is a government-planned resettlement colony where poor Muslim and Dalit communities from slums in the city at large were relocated in the 1980s. After decades of neglect the authorities now treat it and even call it a slum \u2013 all over again. In Shivaji Nagar original occupants were given a lease, which the bureaucracy has made nearly impossible (or too costly) to transfer. Water infrastructure was initially provided but never upgraded to respond to the needs of a fast-growing population. Deep-rooted biases against certain populations and the neighbourhoods where they live, rather than their legal status, explains the way they are being treated by the authorities.  The question of legitimate use of urban land is an old one and full of inconsistencies. All through Mumbai\u2019s history, subsidies around land have nourished generations of communities and institutions. This is a significant contributor to the city becoming such a major economic hub. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, migrant populations were encouraged to make land productive so the government could earn revenue. It made sense to the authorities to make land accessible to create housing infrastructure and for institutions to develop. Municipal schools were opened in Dharavi in the late 19th or early 20th century itself.     Dharavi at twilight. Photograph: Rajanish Kakade/AP    Paradoxically, since independence, poorer communities found that the only recourse to the same process was through local political patronage, connected to the economy of elections and votes or informal dealings with municipal authorities.  Perhaps is it time to accept that some land must be indeed be subsidised so that every community can keep a foothold in the city. A clear policy of subsidising land for the poorest would reduce the ability of municipal authorities to blackmail slum dwellers\u2019 politically and financially.  Rather than \u201cslums\u201d, which in Mumbai is a political label, we call Shivaji Nagar, Dharavi and other such settlements \u201chomegrown neighbourhoods\u201d. These neighbourhoods include many of Mumbai\u2019s urban villages (gaothans) whether they are gentrified or not. They were developed gradually, by the people who live there, with the help of local artisans of construction, usually with little or no support from the authorities. They belong to another history of urbanisation, one that is as universal and ubiquitous as the skyscraper, only much older.  Homegrown neighbourhoods are more common than usually assumed. At a global level they are the norm rather than the exception. Entire cities have been developed outside official plans. Tokyo or even Shenzhen (one of China\u2019s newest and most flamboyant cities, where at least 50% of the population live in hyper-dense urban villages) are cases in point. Most Middle Eastern and European old towns, with their charming, irrationally narrow streets and small buildings are homegrown. Even the well-planned streets of New York and Los Angeles\u2019 suburbs are full of houses that have been modified by their users in contradiction to zoning codes (think of Steve Job\u2019s garage start-up \u2013 an illegal business activity in a residential neighbourhood).  Looking at Mumbai\u2019s homegrown neighbourhoods less as urban anomalies and more as a combination of residents\u2019 initiative and government contempt, helps think housing policy afresh. This is important because these neighbourhoods are the biggest producers of affordable homes, at an order of magnitude beyond what developers and the government can provide.  This realisation pushes us, as urban practitioners, to rethink the roles of architects and planners in a context where the government is at best indifferent and at worst hostile to the local development of neighbourhoods. After studying and documenting closely the work of local artisans of construction in Dharavi, Bhandup, Ghatkopar, Sakinaka, Shivaji Nagar and other homegrown neighbourhoods in Mumbai (but also in Sao Paulo, Rio, Shenzhen and Tokyo), we decided to join forces with artisans whom we thought were particularly diligent and innovative.  Rather than offering wholesale solutions to \u201crehabilitate\u201d slum dwellers, we partnered with local actors to marginally improve the way they build already. No big bang, but rather a tactical approach based on mutual respect and a shared desire to and learn and build together. After working on a Shiva temple, we started helping with the repair of several homes in Shivaji Nagar. Our latest initiative is a 14ft tall house standing on a 10x15ft plot. This tiny house is part of our Homegrown Neighbourhood project, which has the rather grand ambition of contributing to the recognition of the local economy as a prime provider of affordable housing.  The house was built with the inputs of professional architects, designers, and engineers who worked closely with the contractor, workers and masons. It used the existing material and techniques of local construction practices and improved on them through a collaborative process. We paid particular attention to the optimisation of space, the penetration of daylight, ventilation, the economy of material, and the solidity of the structure. It was built by respecting highly restrictive norms that regulate construction activity in slums and for less than the average cost of construction in the area. Of course, there are many things that we can still do better in our next house.  We hope that this small move gets us one step closer to looking at such homes, construction practices and the neighbourhood as a whole in newer, less biased ways.  In the long run, if the government encourages official financial support for home and infrastructure improvement in homegrown settlements, along with a clear recognition of occupancy rights and the development of co-operative housing societies, we will have a robust system in place.  The official target of producing millions of quality homes for all can be reimagined as one in which the process of construction itself becomes a transformative moment. Before that, however, we need to transform our perception of these neighbourhoods.  Rahul Srivastava and Matias Echanove are based in Mumbai and Goa.

He said you can\u2019t learn hip-hop. You have to become hip-hop.\u201d I meet Dhangar, aka B Boy Akku, and members of his crew at a cafe in Mahim West one warm Sunday morning. In Mumbai, where railway lines partition localities into Easts and Wests, there is no recognisable Mahim East. Instead, you only have Dharavi, the infamous shantytown that forms the backdrop of Danny Boyle\u2019s film Slumdog Millionaire and Mani Ratnam\u2019s Nayakan. In this 500 acres of land, you will find no cafes \u2013 at least, not ones with couches, air-conditioning and a perplexing list of coffees. We are at the nearest relatively chic option to Dharavi, on the other side of the railway line.     Akash and Sagar of the SlumGods. Photograph: Benita Fernando    Dhangar is one of the estimated 750,000 residents of Dharavi, and belongs to a settlement of a once-nomadic community known as the Kunchikorve. The 22-year-old founded the SlumGods, many of whom are Dharavi youth, in 2009; they are currently an underground hip-hop crew of 17 members. As he and his bros gulp down cappuccinos, Dhangar recalls feeling out of place at a trendy restaurant just a couple of years ago. \u201cLooking at the other diners, we seemed shabbily dressed. From the moment we entered, everybody was staring at us. As I cut into my burger, the patty unfortunately slipped out, and it was obvious that people were judging us,\u201d he says. Not any more. Over the past five years, the crew has collaborated with renowned hip-hop artists such as Tokyo-based DJ Sarasa, AKA Silverboombox, dancer-choreographer Prosenjit Guy Kundu, and the California-based MC Mandeep Sethi. Their previous Saturday night had been spent at an international street artist\u2019s birthday party in the fashionable part of town called Bandra (at this point, Dhangar brings up the legendary block parties thrown by Afrika Bambaataa in the Bronx). \u201cHip-hop and SlumGods gave us the self confidence that we badly needed,\u201d he says. The SlumGods crew is ever-growing, with all the core elements of hip-hop culture: graffiti artists and beatboxers, b-boys and b-girls, breakdancers and DJs. Their conscious rap, by MCs such as Vineet Nair (Poetik Justis) and Rohan Augustine (Supersonik) is part of a socially relevant hip-hop culture that is emerging in India, in line with the \u201creality rap\u201d of Kashmiri rappers Shyn9 and EssXaar. \u201cTake Dharavi Rap, for example,\u201d says Dhangar. \u201cIt\u2019s a freestyle piece about the perception that tourists and foreigners have of our home. They think there is only poverty in Dharavi, but when they come here, they realise there is so much more to the place. People are industrious and hardworking; you will not find beggary here.\u201d SlumGods easily draws in local talent such as Rakesh Kunchikorve, known as Martin. The 23-year-old joined the crew in 2010 as a self-taught breakdancer. His greatest challenge prior to the SlumGods was finding a room spacious enough to train in. This is considered a luxury in Dharavi.     SlumGods co-founder Akash Dhangar, aka B Boy Akku. Photograph: Amit Madheshiya    Since last year, however, not only do the SlumGods practise out of two centres in Dharavi, they also teach young children from the slum and the streets about the things they know best. (I work at one of these centres, called the Colour Box; in the evening it\u2019s a miniature hip-hop artists\u2019 parade.) The children wear baggy pants and fluorescent earrings, and have spiked haircuts. They headspin and breakdance, and stand in a Buffalo stance. Many of them do not attend regular school. Dhangar believes in preparing them for \u201ca future of opportunities and recognition for hip-hop in India ... Some years ago, I did not even know how to speak English or use the internet. Hip-hop and rap taught me these things, and it can do the same for these children.\u201d The lessons are free and the SlumGods refrain from accepting donations. They fund themselves with their concurrent venture, SlumGods Tours and Travels, brainchild of Sagar Vatapu (DJ Segar). Vatapu previously worked as a travel guide at a slum tourism enterprise in Dharavi, but broke away \u2013 wanting to show tourists \u201cthe real Dharavi\u201d of entrepreneurship and enterprise. He is more embarrassed to admit that there was a time when he played Bollywood beats at marriages and events in Mumbai. \u201cThe company is not the same as the crew. Akku and I stepped out of the bubble to start something new and support the bubble,\u201d says Vatapu. Having rubbed shoulders with internationally acclaimed artists such as Karsh Kale and B.L.O.T, the SlumGods are frequently invited to participate in competitions and festivals overseas. Unfortunately, none of them have passports. The reasons are trying: Dhangar\u2019s house has no electricity supply, and thus there is no electricity bill for address proof. Vatapu\u2019s family has lost his birth certificate.  But beyond the practicality of missing documents, their greatest hurdle is the perception that what is born in a slum is destined to stay in a slum. No amount of Slumdog Millionare-ing can change that. Dhangar says their families and friends do not understand their talents, and simply label them as \u201cpainter\u201d and \u201cdancer\u201d or as doing \u201ctime-pass\u201d. \u201cBut hip-hop has brought us to the world,\u201d he adds, smiling quietly.

Yet the artist imbues his own miniatures with the painful topicality of wasted life. Images shift from blossoms to bloodstains; on closer inspection each is seen to be composed of meticulously painted ornamental motifs. It\u2019s the disparities that carry the poignancy: visceral spillages set against detailed finesse, violence countered by vulnerability. In an accompanying installation, And They Still Seek The Traces Of Blood, thousands of paper prints of his paintings are piled on the floor in a grim memorial to mass mortality. Ikon Gallery, to 25 Jan RC Howard Hodgkin, London Howard Hodgkin said he\u2019d forgotten all about these gouaches (work pictured) until the Wiltshire printing workshop where he made them in the early 1990s returned them to him recently. Yet there\u2019s every reason to pay attention to these bold, layered works that channel the painter\u2019s lifelong muse: India. In a primary palette of red, yellow and blue shading into the green of a warm sea, his thick semi-abstract crescents and coils conjure rainbows and sunsets. Their immediate appeal to feelings and associations is classic Hodgkin, as is the involved process behind their creation, beginning with printing then finishing with expressive hand-painting. Gagosian Gallery At Davies Street, W1, to 31 Jan SS Mel Brimfield &amp; Gwyneth Herbert, Sheffield Mel Brimfield creates installations that recall art-world figures through kitsch and camp celebrations. Here, she teams up with the singer Gwyneth Herbert to tell a tale of the real and imagined relationship between sculptors Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore. Herbert sings a plaintive confession of creative struggle while dolled up as a sculptural block of plaster. A critics\u2019 chorus debate the comparative quality of their work, while Barbara and Henry squabble over who first came up with the trademark abstract hole. Meanwhile, visitors will be invited to install their own sculptural efforts in a mock-up of Moore\u2019s Perry Green studio. With their po-faced back-to-nature sobriety, I reckon Hepworth and Moore were asking for this. Site Gallery, to 13 Dec RC Liza Lou, London Colour field painting, that subdivision of abstract expressionism, meant flat planes of pure pigment. It was also a boys\u2019 club, immersed in the myth of the unique artist genius. New York artist Liza Lou has turned that history on its head, riffing on the planes of colour that characterised the output of one of the movement\u2019s stars, Barnett Newman. Lou made her name in the 1990s with kitchens and backyards crafted from millions of tiny glass beads. In 2005, she began working with Zulu bead workers in South Africa, and it is this all-woman collective who have fashioned her latest. In place of colour field painting\u2019s smooth perfection, up close these beaded works betray signs of an individual\u2019s touch. White Cube Bermondsey, SE1, to 18 Jan SS Manuel Chavajay &amp; Rebecca Wilcox, Glasgow In this series, the CCA brings together two artists, with no contextual connection, to see how their works play together. Guatemalan Manuel Chavajay, working from the small village of San Pedro de Laguna, presents mysterious ceramic sculptures that look like significant archaeological finds. As an accompaniment, Glasgow School of Art graduate Rebecca Wilcox sets up a series of tables containing repetitive texts, whose precise meaning remains inscrutable. Together, the works evoke the tenuous and fragile means by which we all find and hold on to our rightful place in the world. CCA, to 18 Jan RC Kevin Coyne, Derby Despite the fact that the maverick singer-songwriter Kevin Coyne made more than 40 albums before he died 10 years ago, he still found the energy to create this convincing collection of appropriately madcap paintings. Coyne revelled in his outsider status, his heartfelt eccentricity seeming outlandish even within a 1960s and 70s rock scene hardly short of misfits from the back of beyond. His paintings may appear to fit in more with the compulsive efforts of outsider art, but Coyne\u2019s apparently cack-handed brushwork and graffiti inscriptions are fully controlled works. With titles such as Heaven Trousers, King Of The Assholes and Mummy Is Mad as well as downright daft fantasy imagery \u2013 composite images of a dog on a human head or a dagger piercing a sausage \u2013 his smeared and scrawled improvisations are the work of a truly lovable grown-up kid. Deda, to 28 Mar; University Of Derby, to 6 Feb RC Julio Le Parc, Reiner Ruthenbeck, London The radical art trickster Julio Le Parc turned down the chance for a major retrospective at Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne on the flip of a coin in 1972. Now that he\u2019s in his 80s, it seems he\u2019s finally enjoying his moment in the spotlight. Following a lauded show at Paris\u2019s Palais De Tokyo last year, the Serpentine\u2019s Sackler Gallery is showing his dazzling illusionistic works with light and jauntily political \u201cgames\u201d, including punchbags bearing cartoon images of dictators, politicians and the artist himself, and platforms made from wobbly paving. Also at the Serpentine, German artist Reiner Ruthenbeck plays with perception, though his sculptures made from piles of crumpled paper or coal dust bristling with hedgehog-like iron spikes and his overturned chairs and tables strike a different note. A former student of Joseph Beuys who got into art photographing Fluxus performances, his formal experiments speak eloquently of the creative process. Serpentine Gallery, W2, to 15 Feb SS William Blake, Oxford No one sums up the Romantic period quite like William Blake. The poet and engraver took the era\u2019s notion of the visionary artist to another level, seeing angels \u2013 or so he claimed \u2013 and wandering around nude in his back garden. His uncompromised principles and outsider status have since inspired everyone from Allen Ginsberg to Alan Moore. This show traces his evolution across 90-plus works, including his best-loved illuminated books, Songs Of Innocence And Experience, and The Marriage of Heaven And Hell. The show\u2019s centrepiece, though, is a lifesize reconstruction of Blake\u2019s lost studio in a Lambeth house, where he plotted an artistic and spiritual revolution.

It would be an exaggeration to say that for Great Britain\u2019s cyclists the road to Rio will begin when the flag falls on the first race at the velodrome in the Olympic Park, but the timescale does not lie: the midpoint in the Olympic cycle is past, and the countdown is on. For the new man at the helm of British Cycling, Shane Sutton, the World Cup is about \u201cmanaging expectations\u201d. It is an intriguing cocktail: the high-profile nature of the London event, its evocative location in the Pringle, its timing in the season and the background of February\u2019s world championships, the worst in terms of results in recent years. \u201cThe riders will want success in front of their home crowd but ultimately it\u2019s about Olympic qualification, so it\u2019s about securing points and if wins come on the back of that then fantastic,\u201d Sutton says. \u201cEveryone is going to be living off what happened in London [in 2012] and the public will expect, but that\u2019s part and parcel of elite sport. We were a force in London, and we want to be a force in Rio, but this is part of the pathway to get there. A lot of people are in heavy work still and this isn\u2019t something we can taper for, given we want to go and have a successful Worlds. We can\u2019t be at our optimum. There\u2019s a lot of people doubting us after what happened in Colombia, but we can see a trend and we will be competitive across the board.\u201d The 57-year-old Australian took over from Sir Dave Brailsford in mid-April after two Olympic cycles as Brailsford\u2019s right-hand man. In some ways the succession seems like a poisoned chalice. Expectations remain sky high after the London Games but that ignores certain facts. Part of the London gold rush was dependent on two riders at the end of their careers \u2013 Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton. Brailsford and Sutton\u2019s intense focus between Beijing and London, first on setting up Team Sky and then getting through the home Games, was not conducive to long-term thinking. Between 2008 and 2013 there was a brain drain, with several key coaches \u2013 Scott Gardner at sprint, Matt Parker and Dan Hunt at endurance \u2013 leaving for other sports. That helps explain, in part, the disaster that was the world championships in Cali. Although the women won five medals \u2013 with two golds for Joanna Rowsell \u2013 for the first time since 1998, the men returned empty handed, outshone by the Irish, who have no velodrome and minimal funding. Sutton puts that down to the remaining hangover from the Olympics. \u201cIt was tall building [syndrome]. They had to get themselves so high for London that when it finished they crashed and burned because they\u2019d given everything. It\u2019s taken a while to bounce back from that. \u201cWe sat down and looked at ourselves and re-addressed our philosophy. I said we needed to freshen up and we\u2019ve done that. I\u2019ve seen changes. I wouldn\u2019t say the riders weren\u2019t committed but after the success in London there were a lot of distractions. The riders have a certain amount of earning potential and limited time to capitalise on that. We always said the best time for that was the two years after the Games and then they need to start on the road to Rio.\u201d The changes have come apace. Heiko Salzwedel, one of the best endurance coaches in the world who worked wonders on small budgets with Switzerland and Denmark, has been persuaded to return for a third spell in Britain, with \u201ca clean sheet of paper\u201d to work off. Below him, the endurance coaches have been reshuffled, with Paul Manning returning to supervise the women. A new sprint coach, Justin Grace, has been added to the team. A new mountain bike coach is being sought. Further down the ladder the talent development system has been revised. In the short term, Sutton wants his coaches to be \u201cRio ready\u201d by New Years\u2019 Day, with all the structures in place for the run-in to the Olympics. He also has very specific problems to contend with. A replacement is urgently needed for Hoy in the Man Three position in the men\u2019s team sprint, although Callum Skinner, another Scot, has recently made promising strides. In the women\u2019s sprint, Becky James appeared certain to take over from Pendleton after taking four medals at the 2013 Worlds in Minsk, but she has been ruled out at least for this season with a severe knee injury, and her return date is unknown. Alongside the sprint conundrum, there are the small matters of managing Sir Bradley Wiggins\u2019s return to the track midway through next year \u2013 with the foundation of \u201cTeam Wiggo\u201d to include the bulk of his fellow potential team pursuiters \u2013 and persuading Mark Cavendish or Ben Swift to take a brief break from professional road racing to ride the omnium. Cavendish has said he feels he could win the omnium, but is undecided. \u201cThe ball is in their court,\u201d says Sutton. \u201cWhen you see the way Cav has been whizzing round Ghent and Zurich I\u2019m sure it has whetted his appetite. All he needs to know is that GB is there for him.\u201d Sutton\u2019s long-term goal is \u201ca full British coaching structure by the time I call it a day\u201d \u2013 and currently he has his eyes on continuing to Tokyo in 2020, which is \u201cnot far away\u201d. In the medium-term, he is looking to expand the women\u2019s endurance academy and possibly return it to its former Belgian base. He would also like to see the men\u2019s under-23 academy return to Europe. \u201cWe need to go back to the structure that worked in the past. We need to scour the world and find the right person. It needs to be done abroad because you take away the home comforts and they just have to ride their bikes.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Photograph: \u00a9 Shomei Tomatsu, courtesy of Taka Ishii Gallery, Tokyo    The watch stopped at 11.02am on 9 August 1945."], "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Culture", "Don McCullin", "Tony Harrison", "Tate Modern"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-30T00:07:01Z", "title": "Conflict, Time, Photography review \u2013 emptiness, ruin and absence", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/30/conflict-time-photography-review-tate-modern-emptiness-ruin-absence", "article": "   11.02 Nagasaki, 1966 (detail) by Shomei Tomatsu.

They record the split-second in which thousands of Japanese civilians died when the Americans dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki. Somehow this trivial object survived, strap gone but glass intact, to tell of that apocalyptic end-time. These facts are known and can be stated in words. But the object itself says far more, and more still when photographed by the great Japanese artist Shomei Tomatsu. Tomatsu\u2019s famous 1966 image shows the watch in isolation, damaged and dark, a lone disc surrounded by a flaring blast of light. Twenty-one years have passed by now and still the inanimate relic continues to invoke the owner it will always outlive, coinciding with all future time twice every day. It is a more intimate and human commemoration than any shot of a soaring mushroom cloud. A wall and more are devoted to Tomatsu\u2019s works in Conflict, Time, Photographt at Tate Modern, and they so deserve it \u2013 the bottle melted into a twisting corpse, the keloid scars so exactly resembling a nuclear blast in and upon a victim\u2019s face.

Photograph: Victoria and Albert Museum, London    How to find the past in the present is the question raised by this huge survey of the many ways in which artists have photographed the aftermath of conflict. Will it still be there, in the atmosphere, a year or even a decade later? The idea is to look at images taken at different intervals: two minutes after an explosion in Afghanistan, 20 minutes after Hiroshima, 16 years after Srebrenica, 66 after the bombing of Dresden. What can the camera skim from the scene to picture history as it happens, or bring it forward into our moment? This ought to be compelling, and sure enough there are some classic images on show. Roger Fenton\u2019s The Valley of the Shadow of Death shows the hellish lunar landscape of the Crimea in 1855, deserted except for the fatal cannonballs that have so recently destroyed the young soldiers. Kikuji Kawada\u2019s images of the Genbaku Dome in Hiroshima present the instant fusion of human flesh and blood with the walls as a new and horrific form of geology. Don McCullin\u2019s deathless photograph of an American marine in Vietnam, moments after fighting, his dark eyes sightless with shock, appears in the opening gallery \u2013 an incomparable and pioneering work.

Photograph: \u00a9 Don McCullin    Photographs that show the scene moments later have the advantage of movement. The smoke rises, the building falls, the marine turns to the camera. But perhaps this smacks too much of journalism, for the curators hurry us along into the months and years after the event where, alas, one sees too many weak pastiches of the same image \u2013 the building toppled, smoke (or pathetic fallacy clouds) still hanging in the air. Occasionally time has reworked the scene \u2013 the ruins are dusty, overgrown, barely visible; amnesia enters in. Or perhaps there is a memorial in the form of graves or graffiti. But often there is nothing at all, and it takes a considerable artist to make something profound of the terrain. There are countless shots of low-lying fields beneath overcast skies, indistinguishable except where the photographer has included portentous mist or some harbinger bird. A shell half-buried in the desert, an aeroplane\u2019s rusting engine, the bare ruined choirs of a cathedral shattered by a bomb: these artists can never resist a platitude. Not one but several photographs of German coastal defences, cast in concrete, observe their similarity to modernist buildings or sculpture. Not one but half a dozen artists photograph the places where Hitler or his henchmen saw their last, trying to find the Nazi presence in these empty rooms and bunkers. Occasionally history is made explicit in extraordinary ways. Tomatsu\u2019s photograph of a Japanese helmet reveals a tiny patch of white in its black interior: part of the skull of the soldier who was wearing it during the atomic attack. A dark and solemn C-print by journalist-turned-artist Luc Delahaye shows a group of skeletons excavated in a shallow grave in M\u00e1laga. Pale surrogates of living beings, they are clasping their bound hands in what might almost be prayer. These are the remains of Republican fighters in the Spanish civil war, discovered 50 years after their execution. The earth conceals untold crimes against humanity.

Instead we are to consider the difficulty of bringing the past into meaningful life. Taryn Simon remembers the massacre of Srebrenica by producing family trees of the survivors \u2013 predominantly portraits of women and children \u2013 with blanks for the missing and dental fragments for those who were eventually found in mass graves. As a coda she includes a piercing image of an Orthodox priest blessing a Serbian warlord on his way to carry out genocide. And Jim Goldberg\u2019s panoramic wall installation of the Democratic Republic of Congo, devastated by civil war, unites images of people from all over the country with their own testimonies: an attempted democracy, as it were, in portraits. But generally \u2013 and astonishingly \u2013 this show stints on human beings themselves in favour of emptiness, ruin and absence. The artists often seem specially chosen for taking more interest in skeletal buildings and wounded landscapes. Why show gigantic aerial shots of roads battered in the first Gulf war, which resemble nothing so much as outsize maps, and not the people involved? Sophie Ristelhueber\u2019s banal prints communicate nothing compared with Kenneth Jarecke\u2019s devastating image of a burned Iraqi soldier in his tank on the road to Basra, \u201chis windscreen wiper like a pen, ready to write down thoughts for men\u201d in Tony Harrison\u2019s grimly magnificent poem A Cold Coming. But Jarecke wouldn\u2019t make the cut because he is purely a reporter in the curators\u2019 eyes; Don McCullin is the only photojournalist in this show, presumably because he edges a fraction closer to their definition of an artist. This distinction \u2013 which has considerable consequences for the range of conflicts represented as well as the quality of the images \u2013 would raise my hackles if I were a photojournalist. It also feels both arbitrary and subjective. Who is to say that Matthew Brady, Frank Hurley, Robert Capa or Lee Miller (to name only a few) are journalists rather than artists and in any case why should it matter? The proof is in the print. McCullin\u2019s shell-shocked marine is more profound, in all its terrible and bewildering beauty, than many of the mediocre images that follow.

The four-day event at the Museum of Contemporary Art, the first of its kind, is being held to mark Hello Kitty\u2019s 40th anniversary. The sell-out crowd can attend Hello Kitty seminars, workshops and lectures, eat Hello Kitty-themed food and shop until they drop. Even if you don\u2019t think you know Hello Kitty you have probably seen the logo: a small, mouthless cat-like character, with a bow or a heart in her hair, stamped on everything from handbags to T-shirts to lunchboxes to videogames to jewellery to aeroplanes. There are more than 50,000 Hello Kitty product lines available in over 130 countries. Sanrio, Hello Kitty\u2019s parent company, is reluctant to talk figures, but its total global sales amount to around \u00a35bn a year and it\u2019s thought Hello Kitty products account for most of this. As the totemic Japanese brand enters its fifth decade, however, the character herself remains ageless. Despite her name and appearance (including whiskers), Hello Kitty is not a cat, but an English girl who never ages. She was born in London in November, has blood type A and is five apples tall. She began life in 1974, on a purse, but quickly spread. In August this year the Japanese government blasted her into space. Hello Kitty attracts a level of eccentric devotion that, say, Peppa Pig cannot match. You might expect her to be popular with young girls, but the convention proves that Hello Kitty fans are of every age and stripe, and with a limitless thirst for Hello Kitty-related activities. What\u2019s the appeal? One of the first events I check out is a Spam musubi workshop (musubi is a popular dish in Hawaii, and comprises a slice of Spam on rice, wrapped with seaweed), where participants can make an edible Hello Kitty. Leading the workshop is Katie Chin, a television chef. When she asks the audience to sum up Hello Kitty in one word, \u201chappy\u201d features at least five times, as do \u201cjoy\u201d, \u201cfriendship\u201d and \u201csmiles\u201d. One woman pauses for a second before blurting out \u201cshopping\u201d. Ah yes, shopping. In Hello Kitty Con\u2019s Super Supermarket area, the most expensive items include a \u00a3250 Hello Kitty vintage telephone and a \u00a31,132 Casio executive set containing a briefcase, camera and watch. There are Hello Kitty Ty toys, building blocks, comics and pyjamas. Dylan\u2019s Candy Bar, the sweet-shop chain owned by Ralph Lauren\u2019s daughter, has a stand piled high with limited-edition Hello Kitty chocolate. Visitors can get Hello Kitty nail art or Hello Kitty face-paint makeovers, and pick up a \u00a375 Swarovski-studded, perfume-filled Hello Kitty ring. The Hello Kitty Beats by Dre headphones are selling like hotcakes. At the Major League Baseball stand, visitors can get temporary tattoos depicting Hello Kitty wearing the uniform of their favourite team.     \u2018Getting a Hello Kitty tattoo was a novelty five years ago, but now it\u2019s just a no-brainer if you are a fan\u2019: two women show their devotion. Photograph: Barry J Holmes/Observer    Sarah Walsworth, a visual-brand manager for Sanrio, is after something more permanent. I catch up with her at the Hello Kitty tattoo parlour, where professional tattooists are on hand to give Hello Kitty fans free, permanent reminders of their visit. For Walsworth, who\u2019s getting a tattoo depicting Hello Kitty alongside a pair of scissors and the word \u201chello\u201d, her job is clearly more than a way to pay the rent. \u201cHello Kitty is my boss and my ultimate muse in every sense of the word,\u201d Walsworth says. The queue for free inkings stretches around the building, but Walsworth sees her tattoo as a unique mark of her devotion, as well as displaying her membership of the tribe. \u201cGetting a Hello Kitty tattoo might have been a novelty five years ago, but now it\u2019s just a no-brainer if you\u2019re a fan,\u201d she adds. Elsewhere, lectures explore the Hello Kitty universe and debunk certain myths. There\u2019s no Hello Kitty chainsaw, but there are Hello Kitty contact lenses. The infamous Hello Kitty vibrator is actually a shoulder \u201cmassager\u201d, I learn, although there seems no doubt about its real purpose. (Hello Kitty\u2019s obsessive focus on \u201ccuteness\u201d can be a thin veil for quite a lot of sexualisation \u2013 many of the costumes on display wouldn\u2019t look out of place at a fetish club.) One of the most popular events is a discussion chaired by Hello Kitty\u2019s keenest male fans, entitled: \u201cGuys Love Hello Kitty, Too\u201d. Although most of the attendees are women, Hello Kitty has no shortage of male admirers. One of them is Tommy Moreno, a 50-year-old make-up artist with a handlebar moustache, pink trousers, a lime-green Hello Kitty sweater and a pink Hello Kitty-shaped bag. He\u2019s been an avid collector since 1978. \u201cWhen I was 21, I used to carry a Hello Kitty bag around. People used to roll their eyes and say: \u201cHere comes Tommy with his Hello Kitty bag!\u2019 I\u2019d say: \u2018Look, I\u2019m not going to be 50 and walking around with my Hello Kitty bag.\u2019 But last weekend was my 50th birthday and I went out for drinks in LA with my friends \u2013 and my Hello Kitty bag!\u201d     Feline groovy: official illustrator Yuko Yamaguchi. Photograph: Barry J Holmes/Observer    Later, I pass Yuko Yamaguchi, the third and current Hello Kitty illustrator. If Hello Kitty is a religion, she is its pope. Fans wait in line as Yuko, who\u2019s surrounded by a phalanx of minders, draws Hello Kitty silhouettes and signs them with a flourish. With her dyed orange hair, trademark buns and bright make-up, she looks like an 80s raver. Through a translator she tells me that London was chosen as Hello Kitty\u2019s birthplace because in the 1970s many young Japanese girls romanticised the city. \u201cShe creates friendship and makes people happy,\u201d says Yuko, when I ask her about the secret of Hello Kitty\u2019s success. \u201cShe\u2019s like a blank canvas, and her fans transcend generation and gender \u2013 people just love everything about Hello Kitty.\u201d Yuko isn\u2019t the only one under protection. On the other side of the hall, I enter a dimly lit room. At the centre, in a glass case, is the first Hello Kitty item ever made: a coin purse from 1974. A security guard has been standing by for seven hours, listening over and over again to the recorded information about the purse. He tells me that he can now recite Hello Kitty\u2019s life story by heart, and that his ears are starting to hurt. I know what he means. It might be time to say goodbye, Kitty. In need of some air, I head over to the food court and wait in line for a bow-shaped bottle of water next to a woman whose Alsatian sports a pink Hello Kitty knitted cap. I can\u2019t help but think that despite the vast and bewildering empire on display here, Hello Kitty\u2019s success is founded on simplicity. Christine Yano, one of the lecturers and a professor at the university of Hawaii, agrees: \u201cThe world is getting complex and hi-tech. Something as simple and low-tech as Hello Kitty seems to speak to a nostalgic impulse to get back to simpler things, simpler times,\u201d she explains. \u201cShe becomes that cute, mute object that accepts you not matter what you do.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Young women have been particularly influential, from the teenage Lolitas of inner Tokyo backstreets who brought a playful, gothic twist to Victorian and rococo-era clothing, to others who adopted \u201ckawaii\u201d or cuteness as a full-blown aesthetic.", "Reinterpretations of punk and goth again took their cues from the streets of Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya."], "tags": ["Australian fashion", "Fashion", "Exhibitions", "Design", "Art and design", "Japan", "Brisbane holidays", "Brisbane", "Culture", "Life and style", "Rei Kawakubo"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-01T01:39:07Z", "title": "Wandering among Japan's wild creations at Future of Beauty exhibition", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/dec/01/looking-back-at-japanese-fashion-at-the-future-of-beauty-exhibition", "article": "In Japan, non-conformity manifests outwardly. Even the eccentrics and rebels find it hard to shirk their exacting social obligations or the prescriptive ritual that pervades language. And so striking departures from the norm are sublimated into street fashion, which for decades now has offered up everyday statements wilder than anything in the west outside of music festivals or other excuses to play dress up. Young women have been particularly influential, from the teenage Lolitas of inner Tokyo backstreets who brought a playful, gothic twist to Victorian and rococo-era clothing, to others who adopted \u201ckawaii\u201d or cuteness as a full-blown aesthetic.      Kawaii girl.    Style tribes like these have been tapped for ideas since Japanese designers took their place at the vanguard of contemporary world fashion in the early 1980s, as Japan itself entered an economic golden age.

They chart a culture\u2019s rise in confidence and influence upon contemporary western culture, even as the nation\u2019s high point of prosperity became a thing of nostalgia. The clothes contain windows into outposts of non-conformity in the so-called \u201cstraitjacket society\u201d, subcultures like the world of manga and misfit social archetypes like otaku (nerds).

The blinkered existence of the hermit-like otaku is given a comic nod by Keisuke Nagami with his \u201choodie\u201d-topped creations. As far as designers have taken their wares into the realms of conceptual art, everything is wearable - even Hiroaki Oya\u2019s books that fold out into garments, triumphs of packaging in limited editions that are now collected by museums. There was an enduring Japanese aesthetic at play when pioneers like Rei Kawakubo and Yoji Yamamoto first made a splash in London and Milan.     Yohji Yamamoto S/S 2014. Photograph: Etienne Laurent/EPA    They drew on the value of the natural and imperfect, emphasised in Junichiro Tanizaki\u2019s 1933 text on aesthetics In Praise of Shadows.  This dovetailed with the punk aesthetic still influential on international catwalks at the time, Goma associate curator Tarun Nagesh says. Critical reactions were worthy of Zoolander in their absence of tact: \u201cfashion as Pearl Harbour\u201d, \u201cbombed to shreds\u201d, \u201cclothes for the end of the world\u201d. Respect would follow.  Kawakubo became known as a distinguished exponent of clothing as sculpture, with a particular interest in how garments create spaces outside the form of the body, Nagesh says.

The futurism of Kumihiko Morinage\u2019s Anrealage collection, which includes a trench coat of laser cut fabrics patched with welded pieces of metal, explores the digital phenomenon of pixilation in every conceivable pattern and texture.  Equally, Japanese traditions like origami, and the bamboo and floral prints of kimono, are a perennial source of material for designers.

Reinterpretations of punk and goth again took their cues from the streets of Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya. It\u2019s a telltale sign that even as modern Japan has slid down the ladder of economic superpowers, its exponents of contemporary culture are increasingly assured about their place in the world. The country\u2019s misfits have played no small part.  Future Beauty runs at Goma, Brisbane until February 15.

Campbell\u2019s work includes a 54-minute film featuring segments of a 1953 French film essay by Chris Marker and Alain Resnais on colonialism and African art, plus a dance routine choreographed by Michael Clark that interprets economic equations from Karl Marx\u2019s Das Kapital. Four artists \u2013 Campbell, Ciara Phillips, James Richards and Tris Vonna-Michell have been nominated for the prize, which is one of the most prestigious and controversial competitions in the art world. It returns to London for its 30th anniversary after last year\u2019s excursion to Northern Ireland for Derry\u2019s term as city of culture.              Campbell is currently favourite to win, according to the UK\u2019s biggest bookmakers Ladbrokes and William Hill, which are both offering odds of 7/4. However, the prize is rarely bestowed upon its favourites, as seen when David Shrigley lost out to surprise winner Laure Prouvost last year.  Three of the four artists are showing film this year, which curator Lizzie Carey-Thomas says is a response to a \u201clack of fixed meaning\u201d in the world around the artists and their work. The predominant use of film is a response to \u201chow we navigate the world increasingly through images\u201d, she said. \u201cThe internet changed the way that we interact with each other. It\u2019s only natural that the artists respond to that.\u201d In total, the film pieces add up to almost two hours of screen time. Tris Vonna-Michell is this year\u2019s bookies rank outsider. His work Finding Chopin: Dans l\u2019Essex (2014) is inspired by a French sound poet who spent part of his life in Essex, close to where the 31-year-old artist grew up. His other work, Postscript II (Berlin) 2014, is a slide installation based on a story about the his mother\u2019s childhood in post-war Germany.

Ciara Phillips is the only nominee not to use film in the exhibition. The Canadian-Irish artist is the first printer to make the shortlist. Her installation Things Shared (2014) features more than 400 individual hand-printed sheets of paper, and the giant three-dimensional letters OK.

I never felt that reading comics was something to be ashamed of \u2013 they are as good as anything else. Osamu Tezuka\u2019s Astro Boy (Tetsuwan Atom) was my favourite artist when I was growing up closely followed by Shigeru Mizuki\u2019s excellent little spooky comics and the incredible Yoshiharu Tsuge.  If you grew up in 1960s Japan, you had to wait patiently for a whole month for the next episode of Astro Boy, serialized in a monthly manga magazine. Osamu Tezuka, the creator of this science fiction masterpiece and several other popular series, was the father of modern manga. A brilliant artist and storyteller, he was so prolific there seemed to be no end to his creativity. His stories ranged from science fiction to historical sagas and medical dramas (Tezuka was a qualified doctor) among many other subjects and he even turned the works of Dostoyevsky and Goethe into graphic novels. He was a Shakespeare who could draw. Later in the 1960s came Shigeru Mizuki. While Tezuka was futuristic and somewhat westernized, Mizuki\u2019s stories were humorous, satirical and folkloric, populated with countless Japanese ghosts and fairies. He had encyclopedic knowledge of the nether world. Those who had passed over in Mizuki\u2019s stories often seemed more real than his living characters. Then came Yoshiharu Tsuge whose short comics, called \u201cNeji-shiki\u201d (The Screw System), completely changed the perception of comics in Japan. He created a surreal enigma in beautiful illustrations and there has been nothing like it before or since. Along with Tatsumi Hijikata, the founder of Butoh Dance, Tsuge was a truly original, innovative artist of 20th century.     Satoshi fell in love with drawing when he was a very small boy, but it didn\u2019t occur to him to make a career out of art straight away. Photograph: PR    I started drawing when I was four or five years old, spending every evening inventing airplanes, cars, machines, monsters or robots. Unless I had filled a piece of paper with pencil lines, I didn\u2019t want to go to bed. Because it was such an everyday part of my life, I never thought about taking my drawing seriously. It never occurred to me to go to art school or make a career out of art.      I was 16 when my brother discovered Winsor McCay in the shelf of an English bookstore in Ginza, Tokyo. He told me exactly where the book was in the shop and urged me to go and have a look. We made many more trips to the shop before we could put our money together and afford to buy Little Nemo in Slumberland http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Nemo. It is more than a century old now, but for me nothing has ever surpassed the beauty of these pages. Having read so many comic books in my youth I was well aware of their storytelling power, but McCay showed me their wider visual possibilities.      When I was 19, my 10-year-old cousin told me that I should have a go at manga. The next day, I bought a small sketchbook and started the first page. I only had a vague idea of the story and improvised page by page. It took me months to complete it, though it only had 22 pages. The finished book didn\u2019t look like a cartoon strip. (Though I still gave my little cousin a photocopy.) It was more like a picture book. When I realized that my first ever story was commonly called a picture book, I got interested in the medium. To cut a long story short, that eventually lead me to where I am today.  Satoshi Kitamura is the author and illustrator of many incredible books including Angry Arthur (written by Hiawyn Oram) and The Comic Adventures of Boots. Satoshi\u2019s latest books Millie\u2019s Marvellous Hat  and The Yes (written by Sarah Bee) are available from The Guardian bookshop.

Revelations from the longest-running trial in Solomon Islands history give a rare insight into the tactics a powerful transnational corporation can use to put pressure on a developing country. Plans to mine the nickel deposit \u2013 according to some estimates one of the largest in the world - on Santa Isabel island have been two decades in the making.  They were interrupted by civil war and then a legal battle which a Solomon Islands high court judge said had left the local people that stood to benefit from the project \u201cno doubt thoroughly confused\u201d. The judge gave a damning assessment of Sumitomo\u2019s bid to gain developer rights to the deposit, saying its top executive in the Solomon Islands lied in dealings with officials and landholders. The spectre of diplomatic pressure wielded by state-backed enterprises looms particularly large for nations such as the Solomon Islands, which rely heavily on aid from foreign governments. Japan is one of the largest donors to the Solomon Islands, where foreign aid averages about 44% of national income, according to the World Bank. Sumitomo subsidiary SMM Solomon Ltd (SMMS), a joint venture with the Japanese government, won a government tender to prospect for the nickel in 2010 but lost the crucial backing of landholders.  The landholders, who wanted a share of profits and have legal veto power over mining projects, instead cut a deal involving a 20% stake in a venture with the Brisbane-based mining minnow Axiom. In a bid to be recognised as the rightful developer, Sumitomo then sued the Solomon Islands government and Axiom. Justice John Brown in the Solomon Islands dismissed the legal action in September as an abuse of process, finding that the company had been devious and needed to \u201creconsider its relationship with the government of Solomon Islands and its people\u201d. Brown found SMMS cultivated sources inside the Solomon Islands government to obtain confidential information and used spurious accusations of corruption to threaten ministers and bureaucrats.  The company also used an offer of an overseas trip to try to coerce the mining minister into signing an agreement, the judge found. Brown also found SMMS\u2019s case that the landholders who spurned them had stolen the land from its rightful owners was \u201ccontrived\u201d.  Court documents show the managing director of SMMS, Yoritoshi Ochi, took instructions from a superior in Tokyo on how to put diplomatic pressure on the Solomon Islands government. Ochi was told in September 2010 to ask the ambassador to tell the then prime minister Danny Philip that Japan would temporarily suspend its aid, including to a hospital in Philip\u2019s home town of Gizo. Ochi replied by email that he had told the ambassador the company had \u201ccornered\u201d the mining minister but needed \u201cdiplomatic pressure on the prime minister\u201d to seal a deal. \u201cDeputy ambassador Iwanade said that it would be best to play the ODA [overseas development aid] card, but instructions from the ministry had not gone that far,\u201d he wrote.  \u201cThe ambassador [Hiroharu Hashi] only said \u2018yeah true\u2019, and did not clearly state that the ODA card would be played.\u201d Ochi\u2019s Tokyo based-boss replied: \u201cI get the sense that [the PM] may not be aware the nickel project is in fact a national project of Japan.\u201d \u201cI wish ambassador Hashi would approach [the PM] with the spirit to go as far as temporarily suspending assistance to [the Solomon Islands]. As this affects the national interests of Solomon, this shouldn\u2019t constitute interference in domestic affairs.\u201d Ochi eventually told a meeting of the Solomon Islands mining officials in March 2013 that Japan had cut foreign aid, sending ripples of concern through the board. Brown found no wrongdoing by Japanese officials who lobbied the Solomon Islands government on Sumitomo\u2019s behalf, seemingly without adopting the threats the company had asked for. However he found the Japanese government\u2019s involvement in SMMS, via a 20% stake held by a state energy company, was relevant to any diplomatic pressure applied.  \u201cWhere [lobbying] has taken place I am sure the Japanese consular representatives have acted in full knowledge and awareness of the commercial nature of SMMS business and the sovereign powers of the Solomon Islands government,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere is no doubt those representatives will continue to honourably represent their country\u2019s interest in the Solomon Islands although it should be pointed out that the Japanese government has an indirect interest in SMMS. \u201cIt consequently behoves the company to reconsider its relationship with the government of the Solomon Islands and its people for by my findings it is apparent the company has acted with obliquity.\u201d SMMS has lodged an appeal to Brown\u2019s findings, which is due to be heard in February.  Axiom in the meantime is exploring the deposit, which the chief executive, Ryan Mount, said would become a pillar of the Solomon Islands\u2019 economy once developed."}, {"sentences": ["It soon becomes clear that the monkey, who\u2019s wearing a mask familiar from Noh drama, works at the restaurant as a waitress \u2013 and though she appears at first to be a high-def simulation she\u2019s a real monkey, who really serves drinks at a Tokyo bar."], "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-04T13:15:06Z", "title": "Pierre Huyghe at Lacma \u2013 a sometimes baffling but always engaging retrospective", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/dec/04/pierre-huyghe-lacma-retrospective", "article": "Los Angeles is a city with no border between reality and artifice. Images here have lives their own. It\u2019s hard to think of a better city in which to encounter the art of Pierre Huyghe \u2013 an artist whose fiction gives rise to reality, whose sometimes baffling, always engaging art turns real life into a dream, and vice versa. At the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Huyghe has just opened his first American retrospective, a festive, unfathomable, profoundly ambitious exhibition that was first seen at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. In his hometown, it defied expectations to become one of the museum\u2019s best attended shows of a living artist in years. It seduces, it beguiles, it obfuscates, it amazes. It challenges the most fundamental assumptions about what a museum show can be. By the end of my first visit I found myself unready to leave; I rushed back the next day, impatient to throw myself again into Huyghe\u2019s universe of monkeys and marine life, ice rinks and steam machines, voyages to Antarctica or the moon. This is a show that rewards, perhaps even requires, repeat visits. It earns them. Huyghe, born in Paris in 1962, is one of the most significant artists of the last quarter-century. He\u2019s a polymath, and his art ranges from dystopian films infused with science fiction elements to gardens full of poisonous plants. But the strength of his art did not guarantee the strength of this retrospective. On the contrary, a Huyghe retrospective is almost a contradiction in terms. One of the critical moves he and his fellow artists made in 1990s France was to shift their emphasis from making discrete artworks to fully composed exhibitions, or experiences in the real space of the gallery. Relational aesthetics, as this tendency was imprecisely christened, was an art of specific encounters and time-based interactions, much harder to preserve than a stable painting or sculpture. How do you re-present those without ossifying them? The answer is through a total redeployment of Huyghe\u2019s art, installed so that works bleed into one another, for an experience that\u2019s partly choreographed and partly left to chance. All the strings are visible, yet it remains cloaked in mystery. There are funny emphases, like an early Super-8 travelogue never seen before, and intentionally gaping holes. Kate Bush\u2019s Wuthering Heights might start blaring from one gallery while you\u2019re contemplating a puppet show featuring a dancing Le Corbusier. Sounds chaotic? It is, in places. But the more accurate word might be alive. Works familiar to those who\u2019ve followed Huyghe\u2019s career reappear here in new forms, or else slip off the screen into the gallery. In 2001, Huyghe turned the illuminated drop ceiling of France\u2019s Venice Biennale pavilion into Atari Light, a giant game of Pong that visitors could play with joysticks. Here it is again, though one of the lights is broken, and tropical plants have sprouted beneath. (I lost, by the way.) A black ice rink that, fifteen years ago, hosted a figure skater carving tracks now has no skater, but globs of tar from the prehistoric La Brea pits outside the museum. A performer wearing a LED-covered mask might walk past you. If he looks familiar, it\u2019s because you just saw him in one of Huyghe\u2019s films, wearing the same getup. There is one drawback to this show, though: it omits many of the videos from the late 1990s that brought the artists to international prominence. These sharp, cold inquiries looked at the effects of mass media on our personal autonomy, psychological character, and social relationships. They used Hollywood cinema as a medium to be refashioned at will, a primary material as basic as paint or clay. Blanche-Neige Lucie (1997) introduced the vocal artist who dubbed Snow White into French, then got sued by Disney for the rights to her own voice. Les Grands Ensembles (2001) depicted the tower blocks of the Parisian banlieue through a TV haze, articulating the moment they passed from utopian housing to periurban ghetto. The Third Memory, his masterpiece from 2000, remade the true-crime film Dog Day Afternoon \u2013 no longer starring Al Pacino, but the actual paroled bank robber whose caper inspired the movie. The robber, whom Huyghe placed on a Parisian soundstage, tries to tell us what really happened, but his recollections are hopelessly tainted by the Hollywood version. He is media now, and so are we. To historians, the LACMA show\u2019s leapfrogging of these key works and others will be a torment. These were the videos by which Huyghe, alongside his colleagues Philippe Parreno and Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, reestablished France as a leader in contemporary art after decades in the shadow of first Germany, then the UK. Huyghe, however \u2013 working with the young curator Jarrett Gregory, one of many talented New Yorkers who have skipped town for LA in recent years \u2013 is playing a bigger game than just a historical recap. The exhibition is itself a medium for the artist. It\u2019s a fractal reproduction of the works it contains. It unfolds in every direction at once, and changes everyday, thanks to performers both human and animal. Videos and light works are on timers: they flicker on and off, stop and restart. It\u2019s as if the exhibition were itself a film that progresses through time, with plot twists and shifts in intensity. Animals, especially, play a central role in Huyghe\u2019s art, and have for decades. They\u2019re on screen (deer, rabbits, a mythical white penguin in Antarctica) and in the galleries (ants crawling on the gallery walls, a hermit crab in a fish tank), no doubt to the delight of the Los Angeles animal welfare authorities. Why the menagerie? Perhaps because, more than human performers, animals fit into Huyghe\u2019s technique of only partially choreographing a situation, and then letting it develop however it may. With no knowledge that they form part of an artwork, the fish in Huyghe\u2019s tanks or the ants tracing lines on the walls allow Huyghe to relax his grip. They\u2019re indifferent to the artist\u2019s desires, and to our gazes too. Perhaps, too, because in Huyghe\u2019s science fictions can sometimes tip into the apocalyptic, and the animals stand a better chance of surviving than us. When we\u2019re gone, the ants and the hermit crabs will still be here, crawling through our ruined museums. At intervals the lights from the Atari game click off, the Le Corbusier video and others go dead, and a single large-format video plays in the largest gallery. Another animal, a monkey this time. We\u2019re in Japan, not far from devastated Fukushima, in a restaurant that might be closed for the night, or might be abandoned forever. It soon becomes clear that the monkey, who\u2019s wearing a mask familiar from Noh drama, works at the restaurant as a waitress \u2013 and though she appears at first to be a high-def simulation she\u2019s a real monkey, who really serves drinks at a Tokyo bar. Just like in his Dog Day Afternoon remake, here the performer is real but the setting is a fiction: a grungy, forsaken place, devoid of other life perhaps forever. Only the monkey survives, waiting for customers, her mask never slipping. Then there is Human, the adorable white dog with one pink leg who saunters through the galleries of this exhibition. She might come up to you while you\u2019re gazing at Huyghe\u2019s fish tanks, or lie down by your side as you watch footage from his Antarctic expedition. On my first visit to the show she was making friends with a young girl, who broke the no-petting-allowed rule. Human is a bona fide Hollywood celebrity now, trailed by museumgoers snapping cameraphone shots \u2013 including me, I\u2019m ashamed to say \u2013 and like any star she can be a little temperamental. Sometimes she\u2019ll walk right out of the show and into the sunlight. Like everything and everyone else in this stunning exhibition, Human the dog slips between herself and a sign of herself, or between life and media. She trots through the galleries, stretching her forelegs or reclining against the white walls. And she is blissfully unaware of any distinction between the gallery and the spaces beyond it: between Pierre Huyghe\u2019s art and the world he knows it cannot contain."}, {"sentences": ["It frequently holds demonstrations, often in parts of cities such as Tokyo and Osaka with large Korean populations."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Race issues", "The far right", "United Nations"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-04T15:29:43Z", "title": "Police in Japan place anti-Korean extremist group Zaitokukai on watchlist", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/04/police-japan-rightwing-anti-korean-extremist-group-zaitokukai-watchlist", "article": "Police in Japan have placed a rightwing extremist group on its watchlist for the first time amid growing international pressure to crack down on a rise in hate speech against the country\u2019s Korean community. In its annual security report published this week, the National Police Agency said Zaitokukai, an ultra-nationalist group that claims it has 15,000 members, should be considered a potential threat to law and order. Zaitokukai calls for the end to welfare and other \u201cprivileges\u201d afforded to about half a million non-naturalised members of Japan\u2019s ethnic Korean community, including the descendants of labourers brought over from the Korean peninsula to work in mines and factories before and during the second world war. It frequently holds demonstrations, often in parts of cities such as Tokyo and Osaka with large Korean populations. Its supporters have described ethnic Koreans as \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201ccockroaches\u201d and called for them to be killed. Police said Zaitokukai and other far-right groups had held more than 100 rallies in the first 10 months of this year. The police agency report \u2013 which usually targets members of Japan\u2019s vast network of yakuza gangs \u2013 warned Zaitokukai was a potential threat to the public due to its \u201cextreme nationalist and xenophobic\u201d ideology. Zaitokukai\u2019s inclusion in the security watch list is unprecedented and comes months after Eriko Yamatani, who as minister for public security is Japan\u2019s most senior police official, failed to publicly condemn the group. Yamatani was invited to distance herself from Zaitokukai this October after a 2009 photograph emerged of her with Shigeo Masuki, then a senior member of the group. She told journalists she did not recall the photograph being taken, adding that it was not appropriate to comment on the policies of individual groups. \u201cJapan has a long history of placing great value on the idea of harmony and respecting the rights of everyone,\u201d she said. In July, a court in Osaka ruled that a Zaitokukai demonstration held near a school in Kyoto with links to a North Korean residents group amounted to racial discrimination. In October, Osaka\u2019s mayor, Toru Hashimoto, confronted Zaitokukai\u2019s then leader, Makoto Sakurai, during a one-on-one debate, labelling him and his supporters racists who were not welcome in the city. The debate ended after just a few minutes, with both men hurling insults at each other and, at one point, appearing on the verge of physical violence. The UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination has called on Japan to address hate speech and incitement to racist violence during demonstrations, and to punish public officials and politicians who disseminate hate speech. This week South Korea\u2019s national assembly adopted a resolution urging Japan to take similar measures."}, {"sentences": ["In a nod towards her newfound favour with more cutting-edge artists, she appeared last month as part of a DJ set from dubstep producers DUB-Russell and (*L_*) for Cart Diggers Live at Womb, a night that was part of the 2014 Red Bull Music Academy and its series of events and workshops in Tokyo.", "The writer\u2019s trip to Tokyo was paid for by RBMA To read more about Cart Diggers live and its documentary Diggin\u2019 In The Carts visit redbullmusicacademy.com/magazine/diggin-in-the-carts"], "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Electronic music", "Music", "Culture", "Technology", "Nicki Minaj", "Lady Gaga", "Pharrell Williams", "David Letterman", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-05T08:00:06Z", "title": "Hatsune Miku: Japan\u2019s holographic pop star might be the future of music", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/05/hatsune-miku-japan-hologram-pop-star", "article": "     Imagine you could design what kind of heinous headgear Harry Styles wears next.

In Japan, this is already a reality for one of its biggest music personalities, Hatsune Miku. She\u2019s the first million-selling android idol \u2013 and the first open-source one, too. Her admirers write her songs and style her looks. The most popular of these make it into her live shows (where she performs, Tupac-style, in holographic form) and into the fan-art expos that take place around the world. Miku was created in 2007 as the distinct avatar of voice synthesiser Vocaloid, software anyone can buy and use to make Miku music. She\u2019s a hit with Japan\u2019s otaku (anime and manga) subcultures, with her larger-than-life eyes, sweeping aquamarine pigtails and upbeat digi-pop ballads that sound like a fairy singing Heal The World. So popular is Vocaloid among Japanese youth, the software is being added to music curriculums in schools. Since the English version of the Vocaloid software launched in 2013, she\u2019s become a global phenomenon, too. Earlier this year, she supported Lady Gaga on her North American tour and headlined her own shows in New York and LA; Pharrell remixed a track she guested on, and she performed on US chatshow The Late Show With David Letterman in October. In a nod towards her newfound favour with more cutting-edge artists, she appeared last month as part of a DJ set from dubstep producers DUB-Russell and (*L_*) for Cart Diggers Live at Womb, a night that was part of the 2014 Red Bull Music Academy and its series of events and workshops in Tokyo. It is, as Jay Kay once said, virtual insanity. Or is it?      In Europe and America, Miku is still seen as a bit of a gimmick, a symbol of Japanese kitschy-kook. However, to the Vocaloid\u2019s fans and her creators, Crypton Future Media, she\u2019s a \u201ccreative tool\u201d, enabling collaboration in a way that\u2019s been unheard of until now. Her songs \u2013 and there are more than 100,000 of them \u2013 have been written by her online community, many of whom work together. and who have never made music before. New York Magazine called it \u201ca wildly new model of pop stardom that\u2019s both participatory and anti-hierarchical\u201d. Speaking through a translator, Hatsune Miku\u2019s producer Wataru Sasaki explains: \u201cIt\u2019s a very organic [project] and it grows through the internetOnce her songs are in the users hands, it\u2019s not for us to control. It\u2019s the users that make the music and once it\u2019s theirs, it\u2019s theirs. That\u2019s what Hatsune Miku is; it\u2019s not just the person, or the animation, but it\u2019s about the internet community and their creativeness.\u201d Hatsune Miku\u2019s tunes may not be on a par with today\u2019s western big hitters just yet but, then again, Sasaki insists \u201cthey never intended to make a pop star\u201d. Perhaps she\u2019ll go death metal next or, more likely, appear on a track from super-cute electronic label PC Music. When the power is in the fans\u2019 hands, anything could become a reality.

Photograph:  Photograph: Carsten Peter/NG/Getty Images    There are plans for a cable car that could carry 1,000 visitors an hour to the world\u2019s largest cave \u2013 the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. The 10.6km route would connect the cave to Vietnam\u2019s Unesco-listed Phong Nha-Ke Bang national park. However, the project has sparked protests, and experts warn the environmental impact could be devastating. It was announced that the resort developer Sun Group would build a $212m (\u00a3135m) cable car system through the national park, which occupies a remote, mountainous swath of central Vietnam. The cave is so large it could house an entire 40-storey building.

Photograph:  Photograph: Rhea Brettell    Frankincense, one of the gifts of the wise men in the Christmas story, has been discovered for the first time in high-status Roman burial sites across Britain. The aromatic resin was discovered in burial containers and residues on skeletal remains dating from the third and early fourth centuries at sites in Dorset, Wiltshire, London and York. Of the 49 burials analysed by researchers, four showed traces of frankincense that had been transported from southern Arabia or eastern Africa, with 10 more containing evidence of resins imported from the Mediterranean region and northern Europe.

The greatest trick consumer capitalism ever played was to convince us that buying stuff would make us happy \u2013 and then, when it didn\u2019t, that we should buy books on getting rid of it, or storage units to keep it in, so we\u2019d have space for new stuff to replace it. This is a strange situation, so it\u2019s unsurprising that decluttering advice also gets pretty strange. That certainly describes Marie Kondo\u2019s recent book, The Life-Changing Magic Of Tidying. Put it this way: Kondo thinks you should treat your socks like tiny people, and that when they\u2019re in your sock drawer, they\u2019re \u201cessentially on holiday\u201d. Let me explain. Kondo is a Tokyo-based \u201ccleaning consultant\u201d whose book caused a splash \u2013 quickly wiped up, I\u2019m sure \u2013 when it reached the UK in spring; now it\u2019s been published in the US. She\u2019s clearly obsessed \u2013 she tells of racing home excitedly, as a girl, to clean her room \u2013 and the result is a mixture of excellent and dubious advice. I can\u2019t get behind her idea of taking each item you own, asking, \u201cDoes this spark joy?\u201d then discarding it if it doesn\u2019t. (The first thing I\u00a0saw when I looked up just now was a joyless box of paperclips. I need them, though!) But among her wise suggestions is tidying by category rather than location: not the bedroom, then the living room, but clothes, then books, etcetera. Easily the most striking part, though, is her insistence that your belongings have feelings, and deserve to be treated like living things. You get the sense that Kondo is never home alone: her world is full of clothes that are happiest when well-folded, and cutlery that enjoys helping her eat. She\u2019s famous for her method of folding clothes so they stand on end (see more at bit.ly/1zruyeB), partly because she thinks stacking\u2019s unfair on those at the bottom. You should designate a place for each possession, because \u201chave you ever thought what it would be like to have no fixed address?\u201d Caring for objects in this fashion \u201cis the best way to motivate them to support you\u201d. Sure, discard things \u2013 but say a proper goodbye first. Yes, this is absurd. Yet if it\u2019s magical thinking, isn\u2019t it only the same magical thinking that permeates the economy? Countless ads encourage us to see objects and brands as things that might fulfil us in the way relationships with humans can. We scoff at traditional peoples for thinking trees had souls \u2013 then yell at the GPS, or tell Siri to schedule a meeting. Hoarding, it\u2019s been argued, can be an attempt to find security in stuff when people can\u2019t find it in other humans. Maybe we should all snap out of treating objects like people. But until then, wouldn\u2019t it be better to do it respectfully, Kondo-style, rather than lusting after things, then kicking them out the moment they fail to thrill? (A person who behaved like that towards other people would be a slimeball.) That\u2019s what I think, anyway. And having consulted them, I\u2019m pleased to report that my socks agree. \u2022 Follow Oliver on Twitter. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo 2020, for example, would expect to be allowed to add baseball and softball to their programme."], "tags": ["Golf", "Football", "Boxing", "Olympic Games", "International Olympic Committee", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-06T11:59:04Z", "title": "The Agenda: Charley Hull ready to make a play for Laura Davies\u2019 legacy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/06/charley-hull-amir-khan-phillip-hughes-australia", "article": "GOLFING GLORY ...

OLYMPIC DECISION ... The full IOC membership meet in Monaco on Monday and Tuesday to make final decisions on the 40 proposals set forth for the future of the Games in the Olympic Agenda 2020 which was revealed in November. Among the changes that may be implemented is allowing hosts to hold events outside the Olympic city or even outside the country - in an attempt to offer smaller nations a chance to hold the Games. It has also been proposed that the bidding process be made more transparent and cheaper, limiting the number of\u00a0 international meetings for presentations. On the sport front, the committee will consider allowing new events, specific to each Games, to maximise their impact in the host country. Tokyo 2020, for example, would expect to be allowed to add baseball and softball to their programme.

Yes, Dalkey is nice, home to U2\u2019s Bono, and maybe (at a stretch) on a par with Richmond upon Thames if it were in Britain. But at \u00a31.2m, it was double the price a similar house would struggle to fetch in Richmond. Bonkers, I thought, as I joined everyone else in saying \u201cthis can\u2019t be sustainable\u201d. Homes in Dublin, on a per-square-foot basis, were selling at a considerable premium to London and New York, with only land in Tokyo priced higher. This, in a country with a population density a fraction of England\u2019s, and which was also engaged in a frenetic construction boom. It was, of course, unsustainable, as we now know, even if the harshest critics had no idea how violent the death of the Celtic Tiger would be. By 2010 almost every bank and building society in the country had collapsed, with the most swaggering property lender, Anglo Irish, leaving quite colossal debts on to the state\u2019s shoulders. But the tiger is roaring again. Ireland now has the world\u2019s frothiest property market, according to global estate agents Knight Frank, with prices rising faster in Dublin than London, New York, or even Shanghai. And as someone who has spent the last 18 months trying to buy a home in Dublin, the figures come as no surprise. Londoners will be wearily familiar with \u201copen days\u201d where estate agents try to create a buzz about a property, hoping that sealed bids will see the home sell for above asking price. In Dublin, it felt like Black Friday every time I turned up at an open day. At one home in Rathgar by the time I arrived there was a long queue of viewers stretching down the garden path, spilling into the road and grabbing at the agent as she went up and down the line handing out the property particulars. I think there were tears when she ran out half way through. I made the schoolboy error of offering the asking price. Sherry Fitzgerald, Dublin\u2019s dominant upmarket estate agency (it could teach Foxtons in London a thing or two about whipping up buyer sentiment) smiled at me benignly. I clearly did not understand the rules of the game. The asking price in the better postcodes of Dublin (ie D4 and D6) is just the starting gun. To have any chance of bagging a decent property, it was made clear that I would have to pay at least 10%, but probably 20% above the asking price. The next few months were spent in fruitless bidding wars for homes across the capital, where each time I dropped out as the bids went to 25% above asking, and then some more. Where the hell was the money coming from, my colleagues in London would ask. Like most Brits, they continue to see Ireland as an economic basket case, dependent on a mix of tax-dodging multinationals and EU bailouts to survive. Their condescension became annoying. While George Osborne brags that Britain has the fastest growing economy among the G7 countries, it\u2019s pygmy-like compared to the other side of the Irish Sea. The most recent economic growth figure for Ireland was an extraordinary 7.7%, the fastest of any country in Europe this year. Yes, some of it is multinationals running their profits through the country to avail themselves of its notorious 12.5% corporation tax rate. The Irish Revenue is plainly guilty of tax theft from other countries in Europe, and if the EU fines it billions for effectively giving illegal state aid to the likes of Apple, then it will be entirely deserved. But the multinationals in Ireland are not just nameplate operations without any substance that you see in some tax havens. Intel, for example, has invested a staggering $12.5bn (\u00a38bn) into its operations in Leixlip on the fringes of Dublin, creating the most technologically advanced industrial location in Europe. In November, more than 20,000 delegates turned up for Dublin\u2019s Web Summit, an annual event that has become the Cannes film festival of the technology world. Is this the start of another Irish economic bubble? While Dublin is buzzing, in parts, the reality is that few people outside the Irish capital will recognise the white-hot economic and property price figures. Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate, though falling, stands at 11.4%, or nearly double that of the UK. The bank bailout has saddled a generation of young Irish \u2013 and the next \u2013 with an unbearable debt burden. Emigration (the UK is the number one destination) remains much higher than immigration. Taxes have risen considerably, with the introduction of water charges the final straw for many, coming after so many other impositions. The rebellion against the political elite, voiced in Britain through Ukip, in Ireland takes the form of an extraordinary surge in the polls for Sinn F\u00e9in. Talk of a property boom will cause wry smiles in the \u201cghost villages\u201d far from the capital, where whole estates were abandoned half-built the day the banks went bust. Next week, the auction house Allsop is aiming to sell one fully built, and 10 other \u201csubstantially completed\u201d three to five-bed houses in Mullingar, 85km west of Dublin. The price? \u00a3630,000, for the lot. Maybe the Dublin boom will seep through to the moribund counties in the midlands, but there are few signs of it yet. Politicans seize upon any hint of news about rising property prices, hoping it will rescue the huge numbers still trapped in negative equity. Their hopes may, though, be dashed by the Central Bank of Ireland. From the new year it is imposing strict new lending multiples, limiting buyers to loans of no more than three and a half times their income \u2013 far more onerous than anything the Bank of England has tried here. Many in Ireland\u2019s property industry fear the lending rules will bring the country\u2019s nascent property boom to an abrupt end. But in Dalkey, the boom times have returned (if they ever really went away). Sherry Fitzgerald is now marketing a lovely six-bed end of terrace Georgian with waterfront views. The price? A snip at just \u20ac12m (\u00a39.4m)."}, {"sentences": ["Zaha Hadid has stoked an international row over her design for Tokyo\u2019s 2020 Olympic and Paralympic stadium by branding eminent Japanese architects who criticised her scheme as hypocrites.", "Speaking at the groundbreaking of her 1000 Museum skyscraper in Miami on Friday, Hadid told Dezeen magazine she was saddened by the attacks which she claimed were motivated by not wanting a foreigner to build in Tokyo.", "\u201cThey don\u2019t want a foreigner to build in Tokyo for a national stadium.", "\u201cThe sight left me in despair,\u201d he wrote, having seen Hadid\u2019s revised scheme at an exhibition at the Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery.", "\u201cIf the stadium gets built the way it is, Tokyo will surely be burdened with a gigantic white elephant.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d said Maki, who designed the National Gymnasium in 1990, over which Hadid\u2019s scheme will loom."], "tags": ["Japan", "Zaha Hadid", "Tokyo Olympic Games 2020", "Architecture", "Art and design", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Olympic Games", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-09T19:28:41Z", "title": "Hadid and Japanese at loggerheads over \u2018turtle-like\u2019 Olympic stadium", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/09/zaha-hadid-japanese-olympic-stadium-controversial-design", "article": "Zaha Hadid has stoked an international row over her design for Tokyo\u2019s 2020 Olympic and Paralympic stadium by branding eminent Japanese architects who criticised her scheme as hypocrites.

The stadium, which Japanese architect Arata Isozaki said looked \u201clike a turtle waiting for Japan to sink so that it can swim away\u201d, has been highly controversial in Japan, partly because of its huge form rising 70 metres above the low rise buildings close to the historic Meiji shrine, but also because of its \u00a31.8bn budget which was slashed by the government last year to \u00a3970m. Pritzker prize-winning architect Fumihiko Maki, 86, organised a symposium to protest against the scheme, and was joined by fellow leading Japanese architects Toyo Ito, Kengo Kuma and Sou Fujimoto. A petition calling for the project to be scrapped has gained 33,000 signatures of support. Speaking at the groundbreaking of her 1000 Museum skyscraper in Miami on Friday, Hadid told Dezeen magazine she was saddened by the attacks which she claimed were motivated by not wanting a foreigner to build in Tokyo. Hadid designed the aquatics centre for the London 2012 Olympics and has designed the Al Wakrah stadium for the football World Cup in Qatar in 2022. \u201cI think it\u2019s embarrassing for them,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of them were friends of mine, actually the ones which I supported before like Toyo Ito, who I worked with on a project in London. I\u2019ve known him for a long time. \u201cI understand it\u2019s their town. But they\u2019re hypocrites because if they are against the idea of doing a stadium on that site, I don\u2019t think they should have entered the competition. The fact that they lost is their problem. \u201cThey don\u2019t want a foreigner to build in Tokyo for a national stadium. On the other hand, they all have work abroad. Whether it\u2019s Sejima, Toyo Ito, or Maki or Isozaki or Kengo Kuma.\u201d Last month Isozaki, 83, wrote an open letter to the Japan Sports Council, the government body in charge of plans for the 2020 Games, in which he attacked the \u201cdistorted\u201d process that has led to \u201ca dull, slow form\u201d. \u201cThe sight left me in despair,\u201d he wrote, having seen Hadid\u2019s revised scheme at an exhibition at the Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery. \u201cIf the stadium gets built the way it is, Tokyo will surely be burdened with a gigantic white elephant.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d said Maki, who designed the National Gymnasium in 1990, over which Hadid\u2019s scheme will loom. \u201cWe are raising our voices, but they don\u2019t listen.

It said: \u201cGiven a total floor space double to triple the past main Olympics venues such as London and Athens, we are also concerned about its costs for safety, maintenance and management.\u201d Several Japanese architects were among the 11 finalists in the competition to design the stadium, including Toyo Ito, SANAA with Nikken Sekkei, Azusa Sekkei, and Mitsuru Man Senda and Environment Design Institute. Leading Japanese architect Tadao Ando led the judging panel that selected Hadid in 2012. At the time he said the \u201cdynamic and futuristic design embodies the messages Japan would like to convey to the rest of the world\u201d.

The National Center for Health Statistics just released its latest data brief summarising the bleak news.  There were only 3.9m births in the US in 2013, according to the report, down about 1% from 2012. The general fertility rate also declined 1% in 2013 to another record low: 62.5 per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344.  The truth is, birth numbers have been in decline for six straight years, dropping 9% from its peak in 2007, according to the report.  If a slow economy is bad news for the birth rate, it also works the other way: declining fertility and birth rates are bad for the economy. Shrinking labor forces, weaker social security, and other consequences soon follow.  Baby diapers are an important economic indicator     Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe waves amid a crowd of voters during the lower house election campaign rally at a train station in Tokyo. Photograph: Christopher Jue/EPA    There\u2019s another reason we need more babies: to balance out the aging population.  As a good cautionary tale, look at Japan: in 2014, more adult diapers were sold in Japan than baby diapers.  Japan\u2019s median age is 45, indicating an ageing population. Perhaps not coincidentally, the country has also unexpectedly slipped back into recession.  Last year, IMF economist Patrick Imam published a working paper studying age and economies. According to Imam, young people are more dependent on credit, take out loans, and are active consumers while older people have less debt, and rely on savings, and bonds instead of the stock market.  In an older population, then, bailouts of the financial system don\u2019t work as well. Quantitative easing, which lowered interest rates to zero here, affect an ageing population less because older people don\u2019t depend on debt.  So the dropping fertility rate is bad. How do we get it to increase? Economists are (as you might expect) at a loss for explanations, much less solutions. Here are some of the theories.  1. Freddie and Fannie killed the storks Remember 2007? Houses were cheap, unemployment numbers were low and the fertility rate was at its highest. When the music stopped, so did the optimism \u2013 and the babies.   A 2011 study conducted by economists Melissa Kearney and Lisa Dettling, showed that every 10% rise in home prices led to a 1% decline in child birth rates among non-homeowners in metropolitan areas between 1990 and 2006.  Fannie Mae\u2019s November Housing Survey reflected Americans continued disdain for the housing market and projects a slow recovery in 2015. That doesn\u2019t bode well for babymaking.  2. How MTV helped bring down the teen birth rate     Ellen Page in the movie Juno. Teen pregnancy numbers have been declining since 1991. Photograph: Fox Searchlight/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar    According to the NCHS data, teenagers giving birth dipped to an all time low in 2013, dropping 10% to 26.5 per 1,000, bringing down the overall rate. Melissa Kearney and Phillip Levine\u2019s research titled \u201cThe Impact of MTV\u2019s 16 and Pregnant on Teen Childbearing\u201d evoked controversy earlier this year for suggesting that reality TV shows about teen mothers contributed to a decline in teenagers giving birth.  The economists studied social media activity and research patterns on the internet after the show\u2019s airing, and observe that it may have caused a 5.7% drop in babies born to teen mothers. Tweets on birth control increased by 23% on the day after each new episode of 16 and Pregnant, according to the paper\u2019s authors. Is that enough to affect the national birthrate? There\u2019s no way to know.  3. Why paid family leave may save the economy     Marissa Mayer at Google headquarters in 2009. Mayer famously moved her newborn\u2019s nursery to her office. Other American women aren\u2019t so lucky at the workplace. Photograph: Noah Berger/Reuters    Children require a lot of time and money and, not surprisingly, workers who don\u2019t have either tend to forego having children.  Wendy Chavkin, a professor of population and family health at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, says fertility rates rose in Scandinavian nations after better workplace policies such as paid maternity leave and flexible work timings.  We should have paid family leave in the US, says Chavkin, if we are to fix the declining fertility rate over the long term. Unpaid leave is not very useful, she says, especially in harder economic climates. \u201cThe US is not interested in this sort of supportive social welfare policies that have tended to typify Europe,\u201d she says.  4. Blame Netflix? Easy access to all seven seasons of Breaking Bad may be one reason why a country\u2019s birth rate falls, if several studies are to be believed. Stanford academic Martin Lewis writes about the research of Robert Jensen and Emily Oster\u2019s studies of India to explain declining birth rates.  Jensen and Oster\u2019s study noted that in India, while female literacy co-related highly to lower fertility, it was not the only factor. The introduction of cable television trumped rates of urbanization, even general economic and social development in its alignment with fertility rates in Indian states. Lewis also quotes the work of Eliana La Ferrara, Alberto Chong, and Suzanne Duryea on the relationship between telenovelas or soap operas in Brazil and fertility. \u201cWe find that women living in areas covered by the Globo signal have significantly lower fertility.\u201d The researchers say that telenovelas represent smaller families, in turn promoting the same to its viewers. The effect of television on fertility is a popular area of study in demographics studies, often focused on developing economies. 5. The Immigrants aren\u2019t helping Immigrants \u2013 who have more children than the general US population \u2013 are having fewer children.  The general fertility rate has declined for all race and origin groups from 2007 to 2013, according to the NCHS data brief, indicating that immigrant birth rates are also falling.  You may have heard that immigrants are not feeling welcome in the US lately. And if US policies discourage immigrants from having children, then a lower birthrate is to be expected. \u201cGenerally most people want to have children,\u201d Chavkin said."}, {"sentences": ["Of course, as usual, daylilies and hostas excel with \u2018Romeo is Bleeding\u2019 and \u2018Spoons for Escargot\u2019 daylilies along with \u2018Tokyo Smog\u2019 and \u2018Rosedale Tractor Seat\u2019 hostas."], "tags": ["Gardens", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-11T09:10:18Z", "title": "\u2018Spoons for Escargot\u2019 and other odd plant names | Graham Rice", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2014/dec/11/spoons-for-escargot-and-other-odd-plant-names", "article": "I was working recently on a piece for Amateur Gardening magazine about plants with names suited to special occasions.

Prior to its first opening, in\u00a01748, classical music had been performed in churches, royal courts and artistocratic houses. But the\u00a0emerging middle classes needed something more: they were making music at home but wanted to hear it in\u00a0public spaces, to meet like-minded people and to put their cultural tastes on show. Societies of music lovers sprang up in major cities with the purpose of setting up orchestras and building concert halls. In 1813, the newly formed Royal Philharmonic Society of London commissioned the\u00a0architect John Nash to renovate the\u00a0Argyll Rooms opposite what is now\u00a0the\u00a0Apple Store on Regent Street, London, and created a concert hall. Similar societies in Leipzig, Vienna and\u00a0Liverpool were responsible for the\u00a0building of new halls for music. As the industrial revolution progressed, the concert halls got bigger, with venues such as Birmingham\u2019s Greek temple-style town hall of 1834 and steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie\u2019s famous \u00a01891 concert hall in New York, becoming symbols of civic pride and industrial new money. More recently, concert halls have been conceived with broader social purposes in mind. The Royal Festival Hall was built as part of the Festival of\u00a0Britain to raise spirits after the war; Birmingham\u2019s 1991 Symphony Hall was seen as crucial to the regeneration of an economically depressed city and Sage Gateshead opened in 2004, providing a world-class concert hall and a focal point for community music and education in the north-east of England. The latest concert hall project with far-reaching social ambitions is the Philharmonie de Paris, which will open next month on the eastern edge of the French capital.     An exterior view of the Philharmonie de Paris. Photograph: Atelier Jean Nouvel    The Philharmonie is a huge, organic structure rising up in the Parc de la Villette, the arts and science park built just inside the boulevard p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique on the site of the old Paris meat market and abattoirs. It is the latest and, sadly, possibly the last major manifestation of the energy and willpower of Pierre Boulez, composer, conductor and the godfather of music in France. For more than half a century, Boulez has used his influence to get concert halls built, ensembles founded and music research centres established. At 89, he is now in\u00a0poor health, but his spirit is everywhere throughout this project. The neighbouring Cit\u00e9 de la Musique (which will come under the management of the Philharmonie and will be renamed Philharmonie 2) opened in 1995 and realised Boulez\u2019s dream for a flexible concert hall fit for the 21st century: wired for electronic sound, capable of changing shape and layout to accommodate contemporary works such as his own spatial masterpiece, Repons, and incorporating a museum and education spaces. But, with 900 seats, the Cit\u00e9 was too small for big symphony orchestras, and Boulez was\u00a0soon planning a bigger version.     \u2018Godfather of music\u2019 \u2026 Pierre Boulez. Photograph: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images    Its construction has sparked controversy \u2013 over the location and, especially, the escalating costs to the city of Paris and the French government. Priced at an estimated \u20ac381m (\u00a3303m), it will rank among the most expensive concert halls in the world. And even before its opening, the Philharmonie\u2019s artistic lineup is\u00a0attracting complaints both of elitism and of dumbing down. But the venue is a glamorous architectural statement, designed by French star architect Jean Nouvel, whose credits include the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly and the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris as well as concert halls in\u00a0Lucerne and Copenhagen. From a\u00a0distance, it looks like a great, geological mound, as if some seismic event had created a mountain. Move nearer and you can see its external walls, billowing like folds of cloth. From yet another angle, the building looks like a huge bird that has landed on the park - and Nouvel continues the avian theme by cladding many of the outside surfaces, underfoot and on walls, with\u00a0200,000 tiles in the shape of flying birds in what must be 50 shades of grey aluminium. But most classical music lovers will tell you that it\u2019s the inside of a concert hall that counts: the great halls are the ones with great acoustics. It\u2019s all highly subjective, but the top three acoustics are generally agreed to be the Musikverein in Vienna, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and Symphony Hall in Boston. All three were built during the second half of the 19th century, the first building boom for purpose built concert halls when cities saw them as a source of civic pride. In those days, acoustics was still one of the dark arts rather than a precise science, but these halls have in common the shoebox shape, a long rectangle in which the performers are positioned at one end and where straight, high walls reflect and blend the sound.     Berlin Philharmonie. Photograph: Dennis Gilbert/View Pictures    By the mid 20th century, architects believed that the formal, hierarchical layouts of these concert halls were outdated, reflecting the social order of their times. In the ruins of postwar Berlin, Hans Scharoun built the Berlin Philharmonie (opened in 1963) to reflect a more democratic ideal, a \u201cnew society\u201d in Scharoun\u2019s words: the performers are in the centre and the audience encircle them in sloping terraces, an arrangement that came to be known as\u00a0the vineyard model. Scharoun employed the latest acoustic science to ensure that the Berlin hall sounds as glorious as it looks, and its vineyard design became the inspiration for many new halls around the world: from Disney Hall in LA to Manchester\u2019s Bridgewater Hall, Suntory Hall in Tokyo and the long delayed and still unopened Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg. Simon Rattle insisted on the 19th-century shoebox shape for Symphony Hall in Birmingham, built in 1990 when\u00a0he was in charge of the City of\u00a0Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. The\u00a0Philharmonie de Paris has the best\u00a0of both worlds. The basic design is\u00a0vineyard, but some very sexy technology means that banks of seating can disappear into walls to create a shoebox, or a standing venue for rock and pop concerts. As with the Philharmonie in Berlin, the acoustic is enhanced by floating \u201cclouds\u201d, wooden acoustic reflectors that control the sound in the space. And there is an ingenious solution to one of the key tensions in concert hall design: the need for a large volume of space for the sound to resonate, while allowing the audience to be close to the action. The Philharmonie\u2019s banks of seating are nested inside the much larger shell of\u00a0the hall, floating free of its walls, making for an intimate experience in a\u00a0large space: \u201cno audience member will be more than 32 metres away from the performers,\u201d says chief executive Laurent Bayle, \u201cbut the room is large enough to be very resonant.\u201d But the new building must fulfil a social as well as a musical function, and when visiting I am reminded that the p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique is more than a traffic artery. It is a social barrier: on one side, the Haussmann boulevards and creamy beige limestone of the ancient centre of Paris, home to cultural institutions and wealthy urbanites; on the other, the banlieues, the edgier, poorer, multicultural suburbs French politicians are trying to bridge this divide with a vision of \u201cGrand Paris\u201d, an integrated city with more equality of opportunity. The new tramline that weaves its way in and out of the suburbs and has a stop outside the new concert hall is symbolic of this ambition, and so, too, is the Philharmonie de Paris.     Sage Gateshead. Photograph: Mark Pinder    The views from the roof terrace, 37 metres above street level \u2013 whether of the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur and central Paris to the west, or of the suburbs and the hills to the east \u2013 offer a reminder of Bayle\u2019s desire to embrace new horizons. \u201cThis is a new vision for a concert hall \u2013 and one of the most important things about it is the location. Classical music has been concentrated in the west of the city, which is wealthy; the Salle Pleyel, Radio France [which has itself just opened a new concert hall], the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs Elys\u00e9es. From this place, we can reach out to a whole new audience \u2013 we can unite the suburbs and the city centre \u2013 it\u2019s Grand Paris,\u201d he says. The East wall of the building quite literally does reach out to the suburbs: a giant, digital screen will project images and words across the Peripherique towards the banlieu of Pantin. In the brochure for the opening season, Bayle opposes the idea that classical music should be linked to social class. He wants to \u201cbreak down the barriers, shake up the ritual of the concert, prioritise education programmes for young people and make links between musical genres\u201d. To do all this, he will have at his disposal a\u00a02,200-seat concert hall, rehearsal rooms with public galleries, extensive workshop spaces which can take school groups and staff who can look after children while parents attend a concert. There will also be a gallery space, whose first exhibition will be the V&amp;A\u2019s David Bowie show, as\u00a0well as cafes and restaurants. But what of the music? It will be a\u00a0more diverse mix than is usual in French musical institutions. Classical will dominate, with the Orchestre de Paris and Ensemble InterContemporain in residence, and it will provide a Paris venue for visiting European orchestras such as the LSO, the Royal Concertgebouw of Amsterdam, the Berlin Philharmonic, as well as the New York Philharmonic, the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Orchestra of Venezuela or the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra. But weekends will also be themed on topics such as New York, Bowie, science fiction, the human voice, amateur music and love stories, exploring ideas across all genres of music in concerts, workshops and talks.     Orchestre de Paris. Photograph Jean Baptiste Pellerin    If all this seems familiar to British audiences already au fait with eclectic programming of Southbank Centre, the Barbican, Sage Gateshead, Birmingham or Glasgow Concert Halls, it represents a radical step in France, where classical culture has enjoyed far higher state support and its importance has gone largely unchallenged. Last month, a study from the University of Limoges found that the average age of classical concertgoers in France has risen from\u00a036 in 1981 to 61 today: Bayle\u2019s desire to shake things up\u00a0is timely.

There is a good reason for this: storytelling and myth-making are how brands conjure up their halo effect of desirability. What has changed in the 68 years since Christian Dior founded his atelier is that the story now needs to reach customers living many thousands of miles from the Avenue Montaigne. And so, in pursuit of the pot of gold at the end of the luxury rainbow, Christian Dior travelled from Paris to Tokyo to stage a catwalk show for 1,200 guests at Japan\u2019s national sumo wrestling arena on Thursday night, billed as a celebration of Dior\u2019s historic links with Japan. But Raf Simons, the 46-year-old Belgian designer who has been at the helm of Dior for two years, put an unexpected twist in the familiar Dior-in-Japan plot with the collection he unveiled in Tokyo. There is no place in Simons\u2019s vision of Dior for cherry blossom or kimonos. In fact, Simons told the Guardian during an interview at his hotel the day before the show, \u201cThere is no literal Japanese reference in this collection at all. To do a Japanese collection in Japan... that just isn\u2019t interesting to me. We have moved on from that. The world is not so insular. Women in Japan look to European fashion, and I am fascinated by Japanese fashion. It is that tension that is interesting to me.\u201d Instead, Simons took Tokyo to stand for a \u201cfuturistic, urban environment. When I think about Japan, I think about the fashion activity on the street. The mix of people, the urban energy. A life that happens partly outside. Blade Runner is a strong reference for this collection.\u201d A Raf Simons collection is never simple to unravel, but you can guarantee a great deal of thought in every detail; it is not too much of a stretch to suppose the black sequins glued to models\u2019 eyelids were a reference to the idea of \u201ccapillary dilation\u201d in Ridley Scott\u2019s film \u2013 a test, ultimately, of humanity.     A creation by Simons in Tokyo \u2013 the black sequins are perhaps a reference to \u2018capillary dilation\u2019 in Ridley Scott\u2019s Blade Runner. Photograph: Toru Hanai/Reuters    The Dior element underpinning this collection was the bar, the exaggerated hip which Christian Dior himself used on a jacket, here translated into waxed, zipped-up coats. The central message which Simons wants the Tokyo event to project is, he said, \u201cto communicate that there is a lot of reality to this brand. That it is not only about clothes for special occasions, that it can be connected to real life \u2013 to the weather.\u201d In leather boots and calf-length coats, the Dior models were dressed for the snowstorm that rained down on the catwalk; the sequin polo-necks they wore underneath leant catwalk-worthy glamour. Fair Isle knits were given a graphic, Manga reworking; the Lady Dior bag was supersized \u2013 the days when all it needed to hold was lipstick are long gone. The show was staged on an enormous square catwalk, with an audience seated all around and models criss-crossing the space in all directions, at a clip. As a format for people-watching, it called to mind not the salons of the Avenue Montaigne but the Shibuya crossing in Tokyo, an intersection at which the throng of pedestrians traversing in all directions when the traffic stops has become a tourist spectacle and featured in another Tokyo film, Lost In Translation. The phenomenon of Shibuya crossing \u2013 urban life as awesome spectacle \u2013 fits with a collection which Simons described as \u201cutilitarian glamour\u201d. The choice of the Kokugikan Sumo stadium served a dual purpose. It physically locates the brand in a venue which references not only Japan\u2019s traditions, but its future: the stadium will host the boxing contests in the 2020 Olympics. But for Simons, the essential appeal was that the cavernous space could be made to feel almost roofless. \u201cIdeally I would have loved to have this show happen outside, in the street,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was the closest we could get, an abstraction of that.\u201d     A model on the catwalk in Tokyo. The days when all a bag needed to hold was lipstick are long gone. Photograph: Toru Hanai/Reuters    Christian Dior himself was a pioneer of his time, adds Simons. \u201cHe was moving over borders, exploring different places in the world.\u201d The couturier\u2019s fascination with a Japanese aesthetic began as a child when his mother, Madeleine \u2013 influenced, like many fashionable Parisiennes at the turn of the 20th century, by the oriental pavilions at the Universal Exposition \u2013 had the ground floor of the family home decorated with Japanese-style frescoes of white egrets against a blue sky. When Christian became a couturier, Japanese motifs, including cherry blossom embroidery, were a recurring theme. In 1955, French Vogue ran a feature on Dior\u2019s Japanese influences, highlighting a black evening gown with an obi-style belt. That year, dancers from the Azuma Kabuki troupe attended the Paris Dior haute couture show. The catwalk show, along with a multimedia exhibition about the history of Dior, forms the centrepiece of a Dior charm offensive in Japan. The exhibition takes care to foreground historic ties between Dior and Japan, such as the three bridal outfits the house made for the wedding in 1959 of Princess Michiko; Simone Noir, a senior employee of the Paris haute couture studio, accompanied the dresses to Tokyo. Noir reported back to Paris that when the princess put on the dress, \u201cshe had a glowing complexion, scarlet lips, gleaming hair held in a headband. She looked like the heroine of a fairytale.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["Shinzo Abe (in white coat) at a rally in Tokyo during his election campaign.", "Michael Cucek, an adjunct fellow at Temple University in Tokyo, can be relied upon for clear, concise \u2013 and occasionally acerbic \u2013 insights at his Shisaku blog."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-12T14:34:36Z", "title": "Shinzo Abe and the Japanese election \u2013 the Guardian briefing", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/12/-sp-shinzo-abe-japan-election-guardian-briefing", "article": "What\u2019s the story? Japan goes to the polls on Sunday after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, called a snap election he hopes will give his Liberal Democratic party (LDP) a greater mandate for economic reforms. The election caught almost everyone by surprise, not least voters and the opposition parties. Surveys show that most people question the need to go to the polls again, just two years after Abe and the LDP were elected by a landslide. They have good reason to be skeptical. The LDP, along with its much smaller junior coalition partner, Komeito, now controls both houses of parliament, ending the legislative deadlock that frustrated previous administrations. How this happened After a decade that saw leaders come and go in quick succession, Abe has managed to close the revolving door to the prime minister\u2019s office and secure some semblance of stability. That said, the resignations of two cabinet ministers in September were uncomfortable reminders of his first term as leader - for a year from autumn 2006 \u2013 when he was forced out following a string of scandals involving senior colleagues. Abe\u2019s approval ratings are at their lowest since he took office in December 2012, but he still had two years left in his current term to complete his economic programme and try to win over voters. Victory on Sunday would buy Abe valuable time \u2013 perhaps as many as four more years \u2013 and allow him to claim a fresh mandate for his deflation-busting economic policy.     Shinzo Abe (in white coat) at a rally in Tokyo during his election campaign. Photograph: YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP/Getty Images    Put crudely, this is about self-preservation for Abe. He called the election immediately after GDP data for the third quarter showed that Japan had slipped back into recession. The cabinet office said this week that the third-quarter contraction had been even deeper than previously thought. Abe has simply cut and run while he still has the chance. The issues  The economy  Abe\u2019s answer to Japan\u2019s economic woes is Abenomics - a three-pronged policy of monetary easing, public spending and structural reform. LDP candidates believe they are submitting themselves to voters\u2019 mid-term verdict on both these policies and Abe\u2019s decision, on the same day he called the snap poll, to put off until 2017 a rise in the sales tax originally planned for next year. An increase in sales tax in April battered consumer spending, a big factor in Japan\u2019s return to recession. In postponing the rise, Abe defied fiscal hawks in his own party who want to prioritise raising revenue to meet rising social security costs for the elderly and to start paying off the country\u2019s huge public debt. He has described Sunday\u2019s vote as a de facto referendum on his economic policy. Nuclear power Abe is expected early next year to give final approval to the restart of two nuclear reactors. Japan\u2019s atomic plants have been largely idle since the March 2011 disaster at Fukushima Daiichi. While most people in Japan oppose restarts, Abe believes nuclear must be part of the energy mix in resource-poor Japan, which has been forced to import record quantities of fossil fuels from overseas. That has worsened Japan\u2019s trade deficit and raised doubts about its ability to meet climate change commitments. Military policy Victory on Sunday will boost attempts by Abe and his fellow conservatives to further loosen the political shackles on Japan\u2019s self-defence forces \u2013 actually a highly trained, well-equipped army, navy and air force. Japan\u2019s conservative leader has abandoned \u2013 for now \u2013 his quest to revise the US-authored constitution, which restricts Japan\u2019s military to a strictly defensive role. Instead, he is expected to introduce legislation that will re-interpret the war-renouncing clause of the constitution to lift the postwar ban on collective self-defence. In practical terms, that would allow troops to come to the aid of an ally under attack \u2013 most likely the US \u2013 and fight on foreign soil for the first time since the end of the second world war. Is an election upset on the cards? No. Barring a catastrophic scandal in which the prime minister himself is implicated, the election result is a foregone conclusion. Some polls are predicting that the LDP-Komeito coalition will easily retain its two-thirds \u201csuper majority\u201d, so the political landscape is unlikely to change. The main opposition, the left-of-centre Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), is still in disarray after a tumultuous three years in office that ended in December 2012. Senior DPJ officials have conceded that the party still has a long way to go to rebuild its shattered support base. The only significant change would be if the LDP secures a two-thirds majority in the 475-seat lower house without help from Komeito. That would embolden Abe in his quest to alter Japan\u2019s defence posture, as his party would no longer be reliant on votes from its more dovish coalition partner in the upper house. The view from the neighbours China and South Korea appear more interested in the election than poll-weary Japanese voters. Japan\u2019s relations with Beijing and Seoul have worsened since Abe became prime minister. The bitter territorial row with China over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands predates Abe\u2019s 2012 victory, but his revisionist impulses have only added to the mutual suspicion and mistrust clouding regional diplomacy. Japan\u2019s neighbours will respond cautiously to any change in its defence posture. They will also keep a close watch on Abe\u2019s official statements to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war in the Pacific next August. Historical revisionists \u2013 including Abe \u2013 have angered South Korea by undermining the widely accepted narrative of the \u201ccomfort women\u201d: tens of thousands of mainly Asian women who were forced to work in Japanese military brothels in the 1930s and 40s. While Abe has stopped short of watering down an official 1993 apology to the surviving victims, he claims there is no evidence they were coerced. How can I find out more? The online English-language editions of Japan\u2019s major newspapers \u2013 the Yomiuri, Mainichi, Asahi and Nikkei \u2013 are covering the election, as is the global service of public broadcaster NHK. Michael Cucek, an adjunct fellow at Temple University in Tokyo, can be relied upon for clear, concise \u2013 and occasionally acerbic \u2013 insights at his Shisaku blog. Cucek appears alongside Insideline editor in chief, Takao Toshikawa \u2013 who has a solid reputation for correctly predicting Japanese election results \u2013 in a recent discussion about Abe\u2019s post-election prospects. The Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Japan has continued its tradition of inviting senior party officials to put their case before the international media. Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP heavyweight and now leader of the People\u2019s Life party, appeared last week, followed by Kazuo Shii, leader of the Japanese Communist party. The LDP and Komeito, alas, were \u201ctoo busy\u201d to send representatives."}, {"sentences": ["Shinzo Abe (R) exchanges high fives with voters during an election campaign after speaking in Urawa, Saitama Prefecture, north of Tokyo, Japan."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-13T05:00:01Z", "title": "Ten things Japanese people are worrying about before the snap election", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardianwitness-blog/2014/dec/13/ten-things-japanese-people-are-worrying-about-ahead-of-the-snap-election", "article": "This Sunday sees a snap election in Japan, as Shinzo Abe attempts to shore up a mandate for his Liberal Democratic party\u2019s economic reforms.  We asked our readers to tell us the mood in Japan ahead of the election. The responses we received suggest concern for Japan\u2019s economic and social direction, alongside apathy and frustration at the political process. Here are ten key themes that emerged. 1) Voter apathy Voter turnout dropped to a postwar low in 2012, and is expected to be even lower for Sunday\u2019s poll. Our readers were particularly worried about apathy among young voters. Hana Kobayashi, a student in her twenties, said: \u201cYoung people still tend not to go and cast votes. They believe they don\u2019t have power to change society therefore it is waste of time.\u201d \u201cPeople who are born after the bubble economy of the 1980s haven\u2019t experienced a period of prosperity and growth, so they don\u2019t trust the government or politicians, said Tomofumi Nagahara.  \u201cBut it is very dangerous. The younger generation is a minority in Japan now. A quarter of people are over 65. Politicians cannot suggest policies that are future-oriented. I think Japan is standing on the edge, so the younger generation should take action. The first step is to go and vote.\u201d\u201cElderly people tend to like Abe\u2019s ideas,\u201d said Hiroshi Kaneko. \u201cYounger people are not very interested in voting.\u201d 2) Abenomics According to prime minister Abe, the election is little more than a referendum on Abenomics, the premier\u2019s flagship economic policies of fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reform. But with Japan back in recession, and April\u2019s rise in the national sales tax impacting on fragile consumer confidence, our readers were united in worry for the nation\u2019s economic prospects. \u201cIf [the lack of spending caused by tax rises] continues, the market is going to go through a deflation cycle and eventually will collapse,\u201d said Yuki Okada. \u201cThere are voices that express how Japan is more stable with Abe, but at the same time, there is a possible chance of the Japan\u2019s economy collapsing.\u201d \u201cMany people in Japan are fed up with neoliberal economic policy, said Yoshiko Matsuda. \u201cOne little hope is many candidates from LDP are not happy with Abe administration\u2019s economic policy, and would hold up the structural reform Abe is aiming at.\u201d\u201cMr. Abe had to postpone raising consumption tax to 10% because he was afraid this would create an economic crisis in Japan,\u201d says Mika Oohara. \u201cThere is the additional problem about the devaluation of the Yen because this makes imported products more expensive and this makes daily groceries go up. In turn, this puts a burden on people\u2019s budgets and consumption decreases.\u201d 3) Limited political choice The main opposition, the comparatively left-of-centre Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), is yet to recover from its troubled three years in office, which ended in December 2012. Abe\u2019s snap election is seen as a means to take advantage of such a weak opposition despite the country\u2019s economic troubles, but our readers described their frustration at the lack of a coherent alternative. \u201cThe LDP is not politically diverse anymore,\u201d says Kosuke Moriwaki. It used to have both conservatives and liberals within it, but liberals in the party are powerless and almost dying out\u201d   \u201cDo we have any parties to choose?\u201d asked Sayuri Hirao. \u201cI am one of the voter who don\u2019t know which I should vote for.\u201d \u201cThe DPJ\u2019s failure in the past government still remains deep in our minds,\u201d said Akira Inatsugu. \u201cIf there was another party that was conservative in economic and diplomatic terms like Abe, but more to the left in social and cultural issues. I\u2019d vote for them,\u201d says Kota Ishii. \u201cBut no such party [exists].\u201d  4) Nuclear power Abe hopes to restart operations at two nuclear power plants early next year, a very controversial move in a country still demanding answers over the Fukushima disaster. Japan\u2019s lack of natural resources, and increasing reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports, mean the government feels it has no choice, despite the majority opposing nuclear power.  \u201cAbe said Fukushiima is under control, but the situation gets worse and worse,\u201d says Ayaka Kimura. \u201cNonetheless, the LDP decided to restart nuclear power plants all over Japan. This is not democracy.\u201d 5) The secrecy law The Specially Designated Secrets Act came into force earlier this week, a matter of days before the election. Under the new law, citizens - including, potentially, whistleblowers and journalists - can be jailed for up to 10 years for revealing state secrets. Critics say the law is ripe for misuse, and could be used to curtail press freedom. Reporters Without Borders called the new law \u201can unprecedented threat to freedom of information\u201d.  \u201cThe notorious secrecy law is starting today. I\u2019m afraid freedom of expression is being obstructed,\u201d said one pseudonymous reader.      Shinzo Abe (R) exchanges high fives with voters during an election campaign after speaking in Urawa, Saitama Prefecture, north of Tokyo, Japan. Photograph: KIMIMASA MAYAMA/EPA    6) The role of the media Beyond the specifics of the secrecy law, many respondents mentioned their frustration with Japan\u2019s mass media, particularly its television networks, which were said by many to be too soft on - or, worse, too close to - the government.  \u201cThe main factor preventing TV stations from having more freedom is a business licence issued by the government, argued Mr Samuka, from Hokkaido. \u201cUnlike the BBC, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) has an unique structure that the government can easily put political pressure on. \u201cJust before the election, LDP distributed a request to various publications for \u201cneutral reporting\u201d. While many people suspect the content of this request violates editorial rights, most of the mass media did not show any objection.\u201d \u201cNHK talks about the students in Hong Kong every day, but doesn\u2019t care a bit about Japanese students,\u201d said Nobuko Hamamoto. \u201cSure, there are fewer than in Hong Kong, but still more than 2000 protested against the operation of the Secret Infomation Protection Act.\u201d  7) The pacifist constitution \u201cThe Abe administration introduced the right of collective self-defense that ignores the constitution,\u201d said Daisuke Shirado, referring to plans to introduce legislation to re-interpret Japan\u2019s unique pacifist constitution, to allow Japan\u2019s Defence Force to fight overseas if an ally - realistically, the US - were to come under attack. \u201cThe right of Collective Defense violates our Constitution,\u201d says Ayaka Kimura. \u201cPrime minister Abe says we need the right for our peace, [but] many Japanese people know our peace has been kept by not attacking any countries. \u201cIf politicians can violate the constitution, why does it exist?\u201d 8) Okinawa There are ongoing tensions over the future of the United States\u2019 military bases on Okinawa, particularly over the controversial move of a marine base to an off-shore site. \u201cFierce electoral campaigns for seats in the parliament are taking places all over Okinawa,\u201d says \u201cThose who support ruling party says that economy is the only issue of the election, says Michiharu Honda. \u201cThose who oppose emphasise U.S. Military bases in Okinawa.  \u201cOkinawa only consist 0.6% of land in Japan, but Okinawa has 74% U.S. bases in Japan. Unemployment rate is the highest in Japan. The divorce rate is high, and there are so many single mothers. I think both economy and US base are the issue here.\u201d 9) Equal rights Abe\u2019s vow to increase the number of women represented in public and corporate life seems to have fallen by the wayside in the lead up to the election, a point that did not go unnoticed by our readers. \u201cThe media don\u2019t pay enough attention to Abe\u2019s human rights policy, said Kazuyoshi Kawasaka. \u201cAt the same time, LDP is the only party in Japan which claims sexual minorities\u2019 rights are not part of human rights.\u201d Same-sex unions are still not recognised by Japanese law. \u201cThere is still strong sexism rooted deep in our culture even though we have equal rights for both sexes,\u201d says another reader. \u201cIllegal working styles have become nothing out of the ordinary as companies don\u2019t follow the labour law.\u201d 10) The rise of nationalism Abe\u2019s time in power has been marked by an increased belligerence in foreign policy and a revisionist approach to Japan\u2019s wartime past. Our readers who responded were, on the whole, deeply concerned about the direction of travel of the past few years. \u201cJapan is treading a conservative, militarist path,\u201d said Hana Kobayash.  \u201cThey are calling attention to the economic situation, but in fact this is a birth of a government that oppress the people,\u201d said Satoshi Murata.  \u201cWe have a government in power who is bent on turning back the clock,\u201d said Kazue Nakamura-Hube. \u201cThey are really dreaming of becoming the military/industrial country.\u201d \u201cI have to be optimistic, because young generations are very concerned about the future we are going to have with the leadership of the current Abe regime.  \u201cWe are determined not to go back in our history and make the same mistakes.\u201d Translation work by Yuki Shirota"}, {"sentences": ["I\u2019m in Tokyo at the end of one of the music scene\u2019s biggest months for international gigs.", "But as the city is throbbing to the beat of these musicians, I\u2019m more interested in which of Tokyo\u2019s 88,000 restaurants (plus more Michelin stars than any other city \u2013 sorry, Paris) the bands and DJs are going to be eating in.", "\u201cWhen you only have a night or two in Tokyo, we want to show artists why this is the best city in the world for food,\u201d says Tokyo-raised, London-based Hiroki Shirasuka, of Giant Men Management.", "\u201cThis is the first restaurant I always come to in Tokyo,\u201d he says, \u201cand the one that all the bands want to go to as well \u2013 Mount Kimbie love it here.", "Jon is happy he\u2019s had a good feast for his last night in Tokyo.", "We\u2019re off to Ramen Nagi, an eight-seater restaurant said to sell the best ramen in Tokyo.", "Essentials Laura Martin flew to Tokyo with Virgin Atlantic (from \u00a3550, virgin-atlantic.com).She stayed in a four-bed apartment, \u00a3120 a night (airbnb.com)."], "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Food and drink", "Japan holidays", "Asia", "Travel", "Japanese food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-14T07:00:06Z", "title": "Eat to the beat: a music insider\u2019s guide to dining out in Tokyo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/dec/14/music-insiders-guide-eating-out-tokyo-japan", "article": "I\u2019m in Tokyo at the end of one of the music scene\u2019s biggest months for international gigs.

But as the city is throbbing to the beat of these musicians, I\u2019m more interested in which of Tokyo\u2019s 88,000 restaurants (plus more Michelin stars than any other city \u2013 sorry, Paris) the bands and DJs are going to be eating in. Local music promoters are famed for showing off the city in one perfect meal, in places well away from the regular tourist trail. \u201cWhen you only have a night or two in Tokyo, we want to show artists why this is the best city in the world for food,\u201d says Tokyo-raised, London-based Hiroki Shirasuka, of Giant Men Management.

It\u2019s really relaxed and welcoming for the first night.\u201d We are led through the busy izakaya (a casual bar and kitchen) to a table and handed the menu, obviously all in Japanese. Translating it is a problem I thankfully don\u2019t have to face. Hiroki orders for us, and, washing it down with beers and umeshu \u2013 plum liqueur \u2013 we work our way through the menu. We are served the freshest sashimi, picked up just hours ago at the fish market across the city. Delicate, panko-fried oysters burst with an intense rich and salty flavour. Even the raw jellyfish with plum is worth trying \u2013 though its strange cartilagey texture might not be to most tastes. The bill comes and it\u2019s less than \u00a325 per person for a meal that would have cost \u00a3100 a head back home.     Raw horse meat at Joumon    Next, we head to a yakitori place, Joumon, which specialises in all things chicken, skewered and grilled. A yakitori meal is really sociable \u2013 perfect for musicians and locals who haven\u2019t met before to hit it off \u2013 and to prove it we\u2019re joined by the Mercury Prize-nominated DJ and producer Jon Hopkins, who is in Japan for a festival appearance. Asked to remove our shoes, we pad through the lively grill area which is billowing out sweet, meaty smoke. \u201cIt\u2019s like Japanese tapas,\u201d says Hiroki, as we take our floor-level table. \u201cIf it\u2019s good, you just order it again.\u201d This is done by banging the tables with your fists and yelling \u201cSumimasen!\u201d to get passing waiters\u2019 attention.

Entrance to the famous ramen restaurant in Golden Gai    The Golden Gai area in Shinjuku is not usually frequented by tourists. Our insider guides us through the maze of alleyways, crammed with more than 200 five-seater bars, all on top of each other. There\u2019s every theme imaginable: a Matthew Barney bar, a venue filled with gurning toy trolls and a horror-movie hangout. We\u2019re off to Ramen Nagi, an eight-seater restaurant said to sell the best ramen in Tokyo. Hiroki has previously taken artist Untold here, after it was recommended by a local producer called Albino Sound. \u201cYou spot this place by the queue outside,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter a night drinking at the experimental noise bar a few doors up, this place is so good.\u201d Tickets are bought from the machine outside, punching in whether you want the ramen topped with pork, spring onion, seaweed or eggs, then you collect the slip to take inside. It\u2019s silent when we enter, apart from the slurping of the rich, fish-based broth with unusual flat noodles \u2013 so we join in the orchestra by swilling, gulping and splashing. At the start of the trip I was told by a promoter that it\u2019s almost impossible to get a bad meal in this city. He was right. Perhaps it\u2019s finally time to become \u201cbig in Japan\u201d and get that tour locked down \u2013 anything to keep eating all the incredible food on offer.

Slice open a regal Baumkuchen, or tree cake, and you\u2019ll find a pale, golden interior marked by dozens of concentric circles, much like the rings of an evergreen. Although popular, the Baumkuchen can be tricky to find.

She describes the confection as \u201cextremely labour-intensive, but absolutely delicious\u201d. Producing one of these beauties requires a special oven and up to four hours of constant supervision. Unlike other cakes, these are spit-roasted over an open fire. A baker carefully paints or pours on a thin layer of eggy batter, allows it to caramelise, then adds another.

The format is simple: celebrities are teamed up with professional dancers and perform in front of a panel of experts. The votes of the judges and viewers are combined and the two couples with the least votes have to compete in a dance-off to see who remains in the contest. As yet, there is no Strictly for central bankers, although it might not be a bad idea. Are those in charge of setting interest rates improving as time goes by or do they still look as if they\u2019ve got two left feet? Is their timing a bit off? Does a pleasant manner and some pancake make-up cover a multitude of sins? So let\u2019s play central bank Strictly. The first one safely through to the next round is the US Federal Reserve. Always confident and assured, the Fed presides over an economy that is growing at 3% a year and creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs every year. The judges were impressed at the elegant way it is planning to start raising rates next year. Also through to the next round is the Bank of England. Threadneedle Street\u2019s very own Anton du Beke, Mark Carney, has refused to be panicked into an early increase in interest rates and has been rewarded with a combination of robust growth, falling inflation and a cooling housing market. The Bank of Japan is also through. In previous rounds, the judges have been critical of the BoJ\u2019s hesitant performances and said Tokyo needed to start \u201cgoing for it\u201d. The improvement since the BoJ embraced aggressive quantitative easing has been obvious, although there is plenty of work still to be done. Now for the first bank in this week\u2019s dance-off: the central bank of Russia. Clearly, it has not been a good week for Moscow. The oil price is collapsing, and because energy accounts for 70% of Russia\u2019s exports, that\u2019s led to a dramatic fall in the rouble. A lower rouble means higher inflation and the threat of capital flight. The judges\u2019 problem with the CBR is that it appears to be trying to do two dances at once: it can\u2019t make up its mind whether it should be supporting the rouble or not. So it pushed up interest rates last week, but only by a percentage point; not enough to hold up the exchange rate. The upshot will be higher inflation and weaker growth: a dance disaster. The other central bank in this week\u2019s bottom two is the European Central Bank. Unlike the central bank of Russia, the ECB has been in the dance-off many times and is still struggling with its familiar problem: keeping time with the music. Week after week, the judges call for the ECB to raise the tempo, and their low scores reflect the fact that Frankfurt has yet to show it can jive as well as waltz. Up until now, the ECB has been kept in the process because the viewers clearly like Mario Draghi. They go for his easy charm and are seduced by his promise that the ECB is practising new moves. By hinting that the ECB is about to embark on its own QE programme, Draghi has proved what you can do with a flash of leg. But it\u2019s all too little, too late. The eurozone is not growing and deflation looms. An election in Greece that brings to power the anti-austerity Syriza party threatens to reignite the euro crisis, and next time it could be terminal. By the time the ECB gets around to QE \u2013 assuming it ever does \u2013 bond yields in Greece, Italy and Portugal may well be going through the roof. The judges always say on Strictly that any one can be taught to dance. The ECB proves them wrong. Hacking can only get worse The hack of Sony Pictures gets worse and worse, in publicity terms. One day it\u2019s the revelation of gender pay gaps; another it\u2019s the awful internal presentations used to discuss film marketing; on another, emails between studio executives deriding Barack Obama. It\u2019s a PR car crash from which the company might never recover. It\u2019s easy to think that Sony has somehow brought this on itself; that the foibles of its parent are the root cause, after it blocked attempts to make its PlayStation console easier for enthusiasts to program, and in 2005 went as far as silently installing software on PCs of people who tried to \u201crip\u201d Sony-BMG CDs to their digital collections. But the real lesson of the Sony hack is that it could happen to any company that doesn\u2019t focus heavily on its security. And the effects can be destructive. News organisations (including the FT, Daily Telegraph, Associated Press, Washington Post and, yes, this one) have been embarrassed by the antics of the hacker group Syrian Electronic Army; but the harm only extended to social media reputations, which were soon cleared up. The threat that Sony is waking up to is that a hacker systematically worked through the entire organisation\u2019s computer network with untrammelled access, and is now \u2013 either as a prelude to extortion, or revenge \u2013 releasing the contents. \u201cThey\u2019re shooting the hostages,\u201d as Sean Sullivan of the online security company F-Secure puts it. Security companies themselves don\u2019t assume they\u2019re safe. \u201cI assume someday we will be hacked,\u201d commented Rich Mogull, of security company Securosis, on Twitter. \u201cAlso, not perfect, but [I] try and only write [in email] what I\u2019d tell someone to their face.\u201d What security companies call the \u201cthreat landscape\u201d is very different now even from a couple of years ago. The FBI reckons that the Sony attack would have been hard for even a government to defend. Sony\u2019s staff took the radical step of using pen and paper when their computer network was wrecked. Perhaps the future of internal corporate communication lies beyond email \u2013 in apps like Slack, secure messaging, and so on. Or \u2013 more radically \u2013 perhaps people will start talking to each other more often. But whichever it is, the reality is that the hackers are not going away. Sony won\u2019t be the last to suffer. Delays in the post Last year it was the weather that blew fashion retailers\u2019 hopes for a happy Christmas off course, as they were forced to make discounts after a warm autumn, and then storms disrupted the last-minute rush. This year the weather has been against them again with a Halloween heatwave, but there have been other last-minute problems to spook retail bosses. Now the seasonal chill has arrived to help lift sales, clothing stores face a fresh difficulty. Online shopping has surged in popularity so quickly that many have been unprepared for all the home deliveries and \u201cclick &amp; collect\u201d shipments to stores. Those who get it right will be grabbing sales; those who get it wrong are likely to be among the losers when the scores are revealed in January. Debenhams admitted its poor online delivery services hurt it last year. This year it may pay for disappointing shoppers again \u2013 but M&amp;S, Argos and Yodel\u2019s many retail clients will also be feeling the chill."}, {"sentences": ["But if we want to negotiate from a position of strength, we should seal the deal with Japan first, getting Tokyo on board with our high standards of consumer, environmental and safety regulations.", "With that in the bag, Brussels \u2013 and Tokyo \u2013 would have powerful leverage over Washington to ensure a TTIP agreement shaped in our interests and reflecting our concerns.Glyn Ford Former MEP and member of the international trade committee  \u2022 Some 340 cases are known to have gone to arbitration under existing trade and investment agreements with ISDS, a model in which decisions are made by arbitrators who are not accountable to anyone, under a process in which civil society has no right to know who has given evidence, what that evidence was, or what arguments were made, and has no right of appeal."], "tags": ["International trade", "Economics", "Global economy", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-15T21:00:11Z", "title": "Letters: TTIP could negate government policy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/15/ttip-could-negate-government-policy", "article": "Ian Traynor (Report, 9 December) makes some powerful points for and against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership being negotiated between Washington and Brussels. There is some difficult negotiating ahead and ultimately a rough ride during the ratification process in the European parliament, since the Lisbon treaty gave the parliament the final say over all trade agreements. The Europeans surely will want some say over the limits of US companies tax avoidance manoeuvres in Europe. Equally, there will be a major stand-off between US and European-style regulation. They will need to be harmonised to bring the full benefits to both sides, but at the moment they are poles apart. Exactly where the compromise ends up matters. Globally TTIP is one leg of a triangle of deals. There are the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations between the US and 11 Asian Pacific countries, but dominated by Japan-US bilateral trade, and the EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement now in the final phase of negotiations. But if we want to negotiate from a position of strength, we should seal the deal with Japan first, getting Tokyo on board with our high standards of consumer, environmental and safety regulations. The EU-Japan deal would be the world\u2019s biggest trade agreement, with only the TTIP as a potentially bigger deal. With that in the bag, Brussels \u2013 and Tokyo \u2013 would have powerful leverage over Washington to ensure a TTIP agreement shaped in our interests and reflecting our concerns.Glyn Ford Former MEP and member of the international trade committee  \u2022 Some 340 cases are known to have gone to arbitration under existing trade and investment agreements with ISDS, a model in which decisions are made by arbitrators who are not accountable to anyone, under a process in which civil society has no right to know who has given evidence, what that evidence was, or what arguments were made, and has no right of appeal. Hence in a dispute between a company and a government, the decision may negate democratic government policy. Jenny ParsonsCottingham, East Yorkshire \u2022 Contrary to your report, the investor-state dispute settlement provisions in the proposed TTIP could well give corporations more powers over national sovereignty. The government\u2019s own report on ISDS, by LSE Enterprise, found that the analogous Nafta pact permitted US corporations to mount 34 compensation claims in 15 years against Canada over corporate business exclusion because of state restrictions, such as health and environmental regulations. These claims amounted to $5bn at an average cost and even when unsuccessful, cost $4m to the defending party. Under TTIP the amount of cases and costs would probably be higher because of the greater volume of business between the US and UK. So it is incorrect to dub European fears \u201cnot necessarily rational\u201d. They could be, for example, a significant financial deterrent to any \u201cde-privatisation\u201d of the NHS.Bryn JonesBath \u2022 You say governments could \u201cforce firms vying for public contracts to pay a living wage\u201d. But already, under a treaty between France and Egypt including ISDS, French multinational Veolia is suing the Egyptian government for compensation after it dared to raise the minimum wage. The Guardian has an immense power for good when you throw its full weight into a campaign, as you have done admirably over NSA and GCHQ. But you\u2019ve done little to publicise the TTIP, which is a far greater long-term threat to democracy. Please join the fight against TTIP and ISDS before it\u2019s too late.John HeawoodYork "}, {"sentences": ["A performance stands or falls on the title role, so it\u2019s worth putting up with flickers, murky visuals, and a Japanese commentary and surtitles to hear and see rare footage of the great Leonie Rysanek in action in Tokyo in 1980."], "tags": ["Classical music", "Opera", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-16T09:00:14Z", "title": "Tim Ashley's opera guide: sex", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/16/tim-ashley-opera-guide-sex", "article": "The infinite variety of sexual experience, behaviour and attitudes has been a central preoccupation of opera composers since the genre\u2019s beginnings. Music, with its patterns of excitement, tension, rhythm and climax is innately predisposed to erotic depiction and expression. Operatic psychology understood both the mechanics of desire and repression long before Freud and the psychoanalytic movement, and the moral and social responses to this most insistent of forces within our lives.  Monteverdi: l\u2019Incoronazione di Poppea            Conducted by Ren\u00e9 Jacobs, Michael Hampe\u2019s production of Monteverdi\u2019s last extant opera was filmed at the 1993 Schwetzingen festival. Hampe is particularly good at examining the intersection between sex, politics and metaphysics. Nero\u2019s Rome has overtones both of Renaissance Italy and a modern dictatorship, and the maps of the world, and later of the sky, on which \u2013 and in front of which \u2013 the drama is enacted, are a constant reminder that the opera plays itself out on a scale at once imperial and cosmic. Tremendous performances from Richard Croft as Nero and Patricia Schuman as Poppea capture both the physicality and the delirium of a passion that gradually becomes impervious to reason, and makes casualties of Kathleen Kuhlman\u2019s proud Ottavia and Jeffrey Gall\u2019s hapless, handsome Ottone. The final, unforgettable, image says it all.  Mozart: Don Giovanni             Each age, they say, reinvents Don Giovanni in its image, an idea taken literally in Robert Carsen\u2019s 2011 La Scala production, which opens with Peter Mattei\u2019s Don prowling in front of an enormous mirror that reflects the auditorium back on itself, and goes on to use theatrical imagery and alienation effects to present a coolly erotic portrait of a moneyed society at once self-divided and hypocritical. Carsen is very good on the personal dramas of conflicted emotion the Don leaves in his wake, while Mattei admirably conveys the fixity of purpose of a man prepared to lose his soul rather than betray his sense of his own integrity. It\u2019s finely conducted, in a big-boned way, by Daniel Barenboim. For a more traditional staging \u2013 and a remarkable musical experience \u2013 try Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler\u2019s 1954 Salzburg performance. And, for something completely different, seek out Kasper Holten\u2019s film Juan based on the opera. It will alarm purists \u2013 Holten takes liberties with the score, but it\u2019s a formidable piece of cinema, and Christopher Maltman bares body and soul in an extraordinary central performance. The trailer is here: you need to get the DVD to see it complete. Bizet: Carmen             Carmen is, in some respects, Don Giovanni\u2019s female counterpart. Both operas are about the emotional havoc wrought by a self-determining figure aware of their own amorality; and both central characters are prepared to pay what is perceived, in each opera\u2019s world, as the ultimate price for their sexual integrity. Where Giovanni risks his soul, Carmen defiantly braves death at the hands of the obsessive psychopath she has rejected and to whom she now refuses ever to submit. A powerful operatic statement, Bizet\u2019s opera has become so familiar that we all too easily tend to forget that its first audiences in 1875 found it baffling and brutal, even obscene. Choosing a single upload isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019ve opted for David McVicar\u2019s 2002 Glyndebourne staging, partly because McVicar treats the opera as a piece of French naturalism (which is is), rather than a kind of Spanish travelogue; and partly because Anne Sofie von Otter is admirable in her characterisation of Carmen as a self-assured, independent woman. If you prefer the grand manner approach, then watch Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s 1978 Vienna staging, conducted like one possessed by Carlos Kleiber, though Elena Obraztsova\u2019s matronly Carmen won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s taste. For something altogether more avant-garde try Emma Dante\u2019s 2009 La Scala production, conducted by Daniel Barenboim: the downside is a tobacco factory that appears to be full of nuns: its great advantage is Jonas Kaufmann as a compelling, iconic, leather-clad Jos\u00e9. Strauss: Salome             Based on Oscar Wilde, and arguably the most extreme of operas, Salome deals with a sexual awakening so traumatic it assumes necrophiliac implications, an experience its heroine repeatedly defines as love in a world so corrupt that no one else dare speak its name. A performance stands or falls on the title role, so it\u2019s worth putting up with flickers, murky visuals, and a Japanese commentary and surtitles to hear and see rare footage of the great Leonie Rysanek in action in Tokyo in 1980. Strauss imagined Salome as 15: Rysanek was in her 50s when this was filmed. But it\u2019s all there, astonishingly acted, and sung with an engulfing sound that tears you in two. For other outstanding interpreters of the role watch extracts of Ljuba Welitsch, Karita Mattila and, most recently, Alex Penda (who, be warned, leaves little to the imagination). Here you can also watch the extraordinary 1923 Hollywood film of Wilde\u2019s play, with Alla Nazimova as Salome, designed by her lover Natacha Rambova, who was also Rudolf Valentino\u2019s wife. Berg: Lulu          Act I     This 2010 Salzburg festival production of Berg\u2019s Lulu was the work of Vera Nemirowa, the Bulgarian-born, German-based director, and one of the few women ever to have staged the piece. It\u2019s an extraordinary interpretation, both thoughtful and in-your-face-explicit. Patricia Petibon\u2019s Lulu is at once the waif-like femme fatale who is all things to all straight men, and the angry, traumatised victim of the exploitative world in which she moves but is rarely able to control. A succession of powerhouse male singers \u2013 Pavol Breslik, Michael Volle, Franz Grundheber and Thomas Johannes Mayer \u2013 are the sensual yet disquieting predators and prey in her life.         Act II     Like Robert Carsen in his production of Don Giovanni, Nemirowa implicates the audience in the opera\u2019s world, on this occasion by locating the Act III gambling house scene in the auditorium rather than on stage: look out for composer Wolfgang Rihm being accosted by cast members at one point! The Vienna Philharmonic is beautifully conducted by Marc Albrecht. It all makes for brave, provocative music theatre, but be warned that Nemirowa\u2019s unflinching take on the final scene is very disturbing indeed.

Yeah, I know, that\u2019s what everyone asks: Dior in ... Tokyo? Not Paris? Huh? And then they shake their heads in a fashion-people-are-crazy kind of a way. No. There is method in this madness, and shrewdness in this extravagance. Dior\u2019s Tokyo pre-fall event represents an emerging strategy by the great Parisian fashion houses to retain status by detaching themselves from the decline of France, and reposition themselves as global brands. The phenomenon of the catwalk show on tour \u2013 just a week earlier, Chanel staged one in Salzburg, Austria, and has previously shown in Dubai \u2013 is a\u00a0ploy by which the aristocracy of the fashion industry, who for generations ruled the seas of style unchallenged, intend to maintain their supremacy in a globalised economy.      Photograph: Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images for Dior    The most striking part of the Tokyo show was that the Dior collection was not Japanese in any obvious way. There were no wide sleeves or obi belts to be seen. Instead, it was steeped in the essence of Tokyo as a modern, even futuristic, city; one that has produced some of fashion\u2019s greatest innovators. \u201cBeneath the surface softness, Christian Dior\u2019s work was very architectural,\u201d Raf Simons, Dior\u2019s creative director, told me the day before the show. \u201cThere is a strong connection there with Yohji Yamamoto, Rei Kawakubo, Issey Miyake. When I\u00a0examine pieces in the Dior archives, it is astonishing how architectural the construction is, for such a feminine look.\u201d Sequinned silver turtleneck sweaters were worn under sleeveless wool dresses with sculpted hips, a\u00a0supremely glamorous version of the tight \u201cbase layer\u201d as a strategy for cosy but sleek cold-weather urban dressing, a look hugely popular in Japan. (Uniqlo, temple of heat-tech turtleneck sweaters, has a 10-storey flagship in Tokyo\u2019s Ginza district.) Coats had an anorak-shine that was weatherproof and flashy; wide-legged trousers were worn with cosy Fair Isle knits. The show was held in Kokugikan, the national sumo wrestling stadium. Simons chose it for the scale \u2013 it seats 10,000, so with an audience of 1,200 it felt so huge that one almost forgot the roof was there, and could imagine the snow to be real. The stadium venue reminded me of something else, though: Will and Kate meeting Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9 at the Barclays Center in Manhattan a few days previously. This, for Dior, was almost a state visit to Japan. And \u2013 like Kate and Wills meeting the Carters \u2013 one that cast the royal visitors in a flatteringly modern, pop-cultural-savvy light. The Tokyo event follows a Dior catwalk show in Brooklyn back in May, and so far this strategy seems to be working: figures released last month showed a 13% rise in revenues for the most recent quarter, to \u20ac417m (\u00a3331m).     The Christian Dior Cruise 2015 show in Brooklyn. Photograph: JP Yim/Getty Images    Social media and streetstyle have done much to democratise the traditional fashion-week circuit. A small-scale designer in London, New York, Paris or Milan who can get influencers interested can create real buzz without cash. But he or she cannot stage a multimillion-pound event in Tokyo. In this way \u2013 just as the super-rich have left the rest of the world\u2019s population behind \u2013 the most powerful luxury houses have created a new superstratum of international glamour, with which smaller names cannot hope to compete. Each house has its own strategy. Chanel uses its annual M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art show to display the artistry of the haute couture ateliers \u2013 the finesse of the most accomplished embroiderers in the world, the humbling exactitude of ateliers that make only buttons, or specialise in the placement and stitching of different types of feathers. If knowledge is power, M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art is Chanel\u2019s opportunity to parade their golden key. For Christian Dior, on the other hand, the message is more about demonstrating relevance. This collection \u201cisn\u2019t about being inside a\u00a0boutique, or a cocktail party, it\u2019s about being in the world,\u201d Simons said.\u00a0\u201cThis is a dialogue. I want to be talking with everyone who is interested in the idea of Dior.\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["It has become a fashion favourite, with its fate sealed last week at Christian Dior\u2019s Tokyo show, where almost all models wore polo necks.", "Don\u2019t think of your polo as merely a jumper     Sparkly polo necks at the Dior show in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Christian Dior", "Kim Kardashian West", "C\u00e9line", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-17T11:57:45Z", "title": "From Kim Kardashian to Dior: the new polo neck rules", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/dec/17/polo-necks-fashion-favourite-dior-kim-kardashian-celine", "article": "The polo neck used to be a utility item, the kind of thing your mum made you wear on a particularly chilly February school day. No longer. It has become a fashion favourite, with its fate sealed last week at Christian Dior\u2019s Tokyo show, where almost all models wore polo necks. These ones probably wouldn\u2019t be mum-approved, though \u2013 they were silver, covered in sequins and the the subject of fashion editors\u2019 how-can-I-find-one-now obsession. Here are five tips on wearing a fashionable polo neck this winter. Don\u2019t think of your polo as merely a jumper     Sparkly polo necks at the Dior show in Tokyo. Photograph: Dior    It is actually a layering device. At the Dior show, they were worn under coats and dresses, and this is how they look the most fashion. Especially if, as we\u2019ve mentioned, they come with sparkles. Add lipstick     Lucia Pica, global creative makeup and colour designer for Chanel, in a polo neck and lipstick. Photograph: Karim Sadli/Chanel    The hair up or hair down debate rages on in the brave new world of of the fashion polo, but one thing is universally acknowledged \u2013 they look great with lipstick. See Lucia Pita, Chanel\u2019s new global creative makeup and colour designer, whose official portrait shows her in a black polo and plum lipstick. Tuck your hair in     Celine\u2019s Phoebe Philo with her hair tuck. Photograph: Eric Ryan/Getty Images    The hair tuck is an alpha fashion detail first adopted with coats by street-style mavens. It is adaptable to the polo neck and has been seen on front-row fixtures such as Olivia Palermo, and by designer Phoebe Philo. A word of warning: the polo is one of those things in your wardrobe most responsible for overheating, so may be one to save for outdoor activities. Go bodycon a la Kim Kardashian     Kim Kardashian in her bodycon polo neck. Photograph: ANTOINE CAU/SIPA/REX    Not all Kardashian\u2019s looks can be adopted wholesale and in real life, but her pencil skirt and polo uniform is an easy one to hack. A little bit mannequin, especially when worn in camel, the over-the-knee hemline and polo are the kind of minimal details that fashion people highly prize. And \u2013 bonus! \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be on the Givenchy front row to wear it.

The floral tributes are overflowing their boundaries as Australians pay their respects to Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson, the hostages who died in the Lindt cafe. Tony Abbott announced to media that Man Haron Monis had a gun licence, and a government review would look into how he obtained it.

The Copenhagen-born, Berlin-based artist, known for his enormous, immersive installations \u2013 he once installed a gigantic, glowing sun at Tate Modern \u2013 included simple instructions: residents of the crumbling Albanian capital, which was recovering from the end of communist rule in 1990, were to construct their visions for the city\u2019s future out of Lego. \u201cBuilding a stable society,\u201d Eliasson said, \u201cis only possible with the involvement and co-operation of each individual.\u201d As the days passed, everyone from kids to adults, passers-by to committed users, gradually turned the plastic rubble into a glistening white Lego metropolis. Part art installation, part crowdsourced sculpture, part urban intervention, the success of the Collectivity Project was a sign, perhaps, of our desire to become more involved in imagining the possibilities for our cities, even if our bricks-and-plastic creations will eventually be taken apart and packed up in a box. But it also signals the Lego Group\u2019s desire for its products to be thought of as more than a child\u2019s building blocks. In little more than a decade, the Danish company has gone from a $300m loss to overtake Mattel, the makers of Barbie, as the world\u2019s largest toy-maker. It has achieved this through a canny mixture of movie franchising (The Hobbit, Star Wars, Harry Potter and, of course, The Lego Movie), an ever-expanding universe of video games (including Lego City for Nintendo) and even a forthcoming CBeebies TV show in 2016 based on its long-running Lego City line \u2013 featuring sets such as Lego City Museum Break-In and Lego City Prisoner Transport.     MIT CityScope: Beta testers use CityScope to explore the feasibility of placing new buildings in Kendall Square (Cambridge, Massachusetts). Photograph: MIT Media Lab    But Lego has also made an effort for the bricks to travel from the playroom to the boardroom, with the company appealing to artists, architects and other creative professionals to use their product as the building blocks for innovation. The Lego City video game may be just that, a game; but the company also donated 1m bricks to Dutch architect Winy Maas, who created 676 scale-model skyscrapers for the 2012 Venice Biennale. (They also gave Eliasson those three tonnes of bricks.) This October, the Lego Group held a workshop in Copenhagen, ahead of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that tasked close to 700 children with building ideas for a sustainable future out of their products. Then there\u2019s the recently released Lego Architecture Studio, a \u00a3149 instruction-free kit of white blocks that lets AFOLs (adult fans of Lego) play Frank Gehry and create their own architectural masterpieces. Lego even sponsors an urban planning project at MIT in the hopes that city planners, like architects before them, might use the bricks as tools to solve issues such as transportation and walkability. It\u2019s at this point that one could be forgiven for raising an eyebrow. Urban areas are bigger, denser, more complex and more reliant on technology than ever before. Can this most analogue of toys \u2013 dreamed up by an entrepreneurial carpenter in Billund in 1932 \u2013 really teach us how to build better cities? Or is this just a smart extension of the Lego brand, to persuade well-heeled parents that an expensive Lego City Monster Truck is a serious educational toy? Surely urban planners themselves, laden with degrees and sophisticated insights into the ebb and flow of urban life, aren\u2019t actually plotting our cities using Lego City Train Station? The answer might be found in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where MIT\u2019s CityScope has created what managing director Ryan Chin calls an \u201curban observatory\u201d. It\u2019s a 30x60in Lego model of the city\u2019s Kendall Square, on to which research scientists project digital data. For example, geolocated Twitter feeds from people working and studying in the real Kendall Square are mapped on to buildings; traffic information is projected on the brick roads. The idea, explains Chin, is to get a sense of how people live and work in the city. \u201cWe can look at flows of traffic, goods and people, and flows of energy,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat are the passive solar gains on a building? What are the shadows cast from a building on to a roadway?\u201d Details about household sizes, population numbers and walkability can be programmed to provide, as he puts it, \u201ca finely grained geospatial view of where things are happening in cities\u201d. In fact, software like this already exists: Autodesk or Esri CityEngine allow planners to map all kinds of data on to virtual 3D models of buildings and cities. Urban areas are intricate, shapeshifting ecosystems that presumably can\u2019t be clicked together in an afternoon. Common sense suggests that a plastic city is too pixellated and limited to help planners design resilient cities that can adapt to climate change or find solutions to demographic changes and land use. Chin argues, however, that it is precisely a lack of refinement that makes Lego useful as a design tool. He\u2019s a fan of the malleability, interactivity and three-dimensional properties of the Lego model at CityScope. A former architect who has worked in automobile design, Chin sees flaws in traditional photorealistic renderings, which are often \u201cPhotoshopped to death\u201d, he says. \u201cYou can hire the best photographer to make a house look beautiful, and you can hire the best 3D-renderers to make a model look beautiful.\u201d     MIT Media Lab\u2019s CityScope merges tangible models with digital information    Lego, on the other hand, he describes as \u201cpre-architecture\u201d. The featureless bricks represent a city in progress, rather than a finished metropolis. By relocating a Lego office tower a few streets over or, say, widening a Lego road, they can instantly test the consequences of planning ideas. The addition of a sports stadium may affect the location of a bus stop or subway station; moving building X in front of building Y may disrupt traffic. Virtual reality technology such as Google Glass offers visualisations but not the same group interactivity, he says. And while 3D printing, touted as the future of design, could eventually offer both the interactivity and benefits of rapid prototyping, it is still out of reach: a resin maquette of San Francisco made earlier this year took two months to construct, cost $20,000 and you can\u2019t move the Golden Gate Bridge. But outside the lab, are any urban planners actually sitting around their offices with piles of blocks? Just as it is hard to imagine Zaha Hadid whipping out a Lego set when dreaming up her Dongdaemun Design Plaza for Seoul, it\u2019s difficult to picture planners in London or Paris or Tokyo sitting crosslegged on the floor, mapping out a new business district from plastic plates, tiles and minifigs. This is where you suspect it could all be a clever move on the part of Lego: an extension of the brand that fits perfectly with how a company devoted to the concept of constructivist play wants itself to be seen. \u201cOne of Lego\u2019s strengths is its impermanence,\u201d says Paul Bailey of the London brand consultancy 1977 Design. \u201cIt\u2019s being used in things like urban planning because, at its core, Lego is about building and innovation. It was never about making toys that looked exactly like a spaceship.\u201d A partnership with a group like MIT strengthens that image of innovation and creativity, and reconnects the company to its original identity, back in the days before the film franchising and the brand partnerships. \u201cI think what Lego is potentially doing here is reiterate, \u2018We are a creative platform.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s that accessibility that gives Lego a bit of credibility in urban planning. Chin at MIT admits the blocks are most valuable to use in participatory design, rather than for their technical specifications. The CityScope team was just hired to create an interactive Lego model for a new transit system in Boston, designed to show residents and other stakeholders how the new transit will affect their community, such as its impact on commuting time and land value.

Photograph: Olafur Eliasson    Other planners have also used Lego to bring regular people into the planning process. Earlier this year, a workshop in London used the Lego Architecture Studio kits to get participants aged four to 84 to create a city from scratch. \u201cIt was a fascinating exercise,\u201d says Finn Williams, who led the event. \u201cOver six hours you could almost see the classic stages of the evolution of a city.\u201d Williams, an instructor at the Royal College of Art\u2019s School of Architecture and a self-confessed \u201cLego fundamentalist\u201d \u2013 he jokes that he took the Lego consultant gig because they paid him in bricks \u2013 started his career working for architects such as Rem Koolhaas, but switched to planning because he saw an opportunity to influence not only buildings but neighbourhoods. \u201cI felt like there was something going wrong in the system before architects picked up a commission,\u201d he says. \u201cThe wrong questions were being asked in briefs.\u201d Part of the solution to poor planning decisions, he explains, is to involve the people who will be affected. Lego is just one piece of the puzzle \u2013 or brick in the wall \u2013 but he believes it allows local residents to see first-hand the implications of design decisions. \u201cNot many mediums allow people to engage on level platforms in such an engaging and satisfying way.\u201d He is a fan of Eliasson\u2019s Connectivity Project for that very reason: \u201cWhere Lego is most successful in urbanism is when is starts a conversation about the bigger issues of planning.\u201d In this sense, it doesn\u2019t matter that Lego can\u2019t accurately model cities. The professional \u201cLego builder\u201d Warren Elsmore, who organised the Brick 2014 Lego conference in London last month and has created everything from St Pancras Station to Amsterdam canal houses, told me the realism of his models relies on the same kinds of tromp l\u2019oeil effects you see in the castles at Disneyland.  Indeed, there is something uncanny about the way Lego can mirror our real cities. At his workshop in London, Williams gave the participants a few rules, a level playing field and then set them loose to create their cities from scratch. Yet a pattern quickly emerged. \u201cThere were large, flat Lego baseplates that immediately took up all the space in the city and left no public realm,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe swiftly had to remove all these big plates so people would be forced to think about their building in relation to the other people\u2019s, instead of building as much as they possibly could.\u201d Eventually, the participants began to demolish structures that didn\u2019t fit the emerging cityscape. They had faced the same perils, possibilities and problems in their Lego city as they might if working on a real one."}, {"sentences": ["If he walks down a street in Tokyo, some people might recognise him and come up but most will leave him alone."], "tags": ["Unbroken", "Film", "Culture", "Angelina Jolie", "Japan", "Second world war"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-18T23:00:01Z", "title": "The \u2018samurai guitarist\u2019 headhunted by Angelina Jolie for Unbroken", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/18/miyavi-angelina-jolie-unbroken-samurai-guitarist", "article": "If you had a mental image of a sadistic Japanese prison-camp guard, chances are it would not resemble Miyavi. He looks more like a male model, fresh off the catwalk \u2013 tall, handsome, flawless skin, dressed today in what you could describe as haute-couture goth: an immaculate, all-black ensemble of flowing tailoring and silky textures. His hair is equally silky. Even the tattoos on his hands and arms are stylish black script, both Japanese and Latin. And yet this is the man Angelina Jolie cast as the sadistic tormentor-in-chief in her war movie Unbroken. Miyavi is as surprised as anyone to find himself in a high-profile Hollywood movie. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really looking. It just happened out of the blue,\u201d he says, scratching his bare ankle. It\u2019s almost a relief to catch a glimpse of ankle sock straying over the top of one of his spotless black-suede, gold-buckled loafers. He\u2019s not even an actor; he\u2019s a\u00a0musician. And even if he sometimes calls himself the \u201csamurai guitarist\u201d, he\u2019s definitely more an artist than a warrior. That turned out to be what Jolie was after: someone with presence, \u201csomeone who can walk on stage and own it\u201d. She checked out one of Miyavi\u2019s gigs, and he fit the bill.              Unbroken, based on Laura Hillenbrand\u2019s book, tells the incredible-but-true story of Louis Zamperini, an Italian-American immigrant and former Olympic athlete, whose part in the second world war was cut short when his bomber crashed into the Pacific in 1943. He and the pilot survived on a life raft for 47 days, only to be rescued by the Japanese navy and thrown into prison camps for the rest of the war. Which is how he encountered camp commandant Mutsuhiro Watanabe, nicknamed the Bird \u2013 Miyavi\u2019s character. The Bird takes a perverse shine to Zamperini, played by British actor Jack O\u2019Connell. He beats him with his belt buckle, orders the other prisoners to line up and punch him in the face, forces the weakened Zamperini to hold a railway sleeper above his head for an agonising length of time, and yet there\u2019s an almost sexual edge to their relationship. In her book, Hillenbrand describes the Bird as \u201ca beautifully crafted monster\u201d. Looking at Miyavi, the casting makes sense. \u201cI was hesitant to tackle this role because I had no experience as an actor, and the story is really controversial,\u201d he says. \u201cThe war is still a\u00a0sensitive issue. The book isn\u2019t even translated in Japan. I didn\u2019t want to represent any negative side of the country I\u00a0was born and raised in. So I wasn\u2019t sure if I was capable, or if I\u00a0wanted to do this. It might ruin my career.\u201d Jolie told him she wanted to create \u201csomething which could be a bridge between Japan and America\u201d. Miyavi\u2019s reservations were justified, though. The nationalist contingent is still powerful in Japan, and their position on wartime history often verges on revisionism. The premier, Shinzo Abe, has regularly downplayed the extent of Japan\u2019s war atrocities and pushed for a more patriotic tone to school textbooks. Nationalists have already condemned Unbroken as racist and \u201cpure fabrication\u201d, and called for it to be banned. \u201cI\u2019m not on any side,\u201d Miyavi says. \u201cThe war is difficult for everyone. Throughout the film, no one is happy. There are no winners.\u201d Unbroken at least built a personal bridge between Miyavi and Jolie, it seems. He describes her as \u201cdetermined, passionate and professional\u201d and praises her for guiding him through what was often a harrowing process. He cites the pivotal scene where the Bird forces Zamperini to hold a railway sleeper above his head. \u201cIt was lot of pressure. The big film climax. If I ruin it, everything collapses. I had no experience as an actor, so I couldn\u2019t control myself. I\u00a0kept crying, crying, crying, crying, even while people were changing the cameras on set. Even backstage. It was crazy! Then, after I stopped crying, I\u00a0threw up. I had nothing. But Angie came over to me and said: \u2018Just take your time. Be yourself. Accept yourself.\u2019 It was hard!\u201d Off-screen, it was a different story. Like Jolie and Brad Pitt, Miyavi, 33, is one half of a celebrity couple. His wife Melody is a former pop star and TV presenter, now a fashion designer. They have two young daughters, Lovelie and Jewelie. While shooting in Australia, the two families spent a\u00a0night camping together in Sydney Zoo to celebrate one of Jolie\u2019s children\u2019s birthdays. \u201cEveryone was wearing animal onesies, even the adults,\u201d Miyavi says. \u201cI was a\u00a0penguin, Brad was an alligator, Angie a zebra. It was a fun moment. They\u2019re celebrities but they\u2019re great parents, so natural, down to earth, taking care of their kids a lot.\u201d Less natural was the media circus following the Jolie-Pitts\u2019 every move, with paparazzi and selfie-seekers around every corner. \u201cThey can\u2019t even go out and get a pizza. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d It\u2019s not nearly so bad in Japan, Miyavi says. If he walks down a street in Tokyo, some people might recognise him and come up but most will leave him alone.     Miyavi at O2 Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, London in March 2014. Photograph: Chiaki Nozu/WireImage    Miyavi (his real name is Takamasa Ishihara \u2013 Miyavi is a derivation of one of the characters of his surname) isn\u2019t a\u00a0household name in Japan but he\u2019s been a successful musician for more than a decade, and an accomplished one at that. He emerged in the genre\u00a0known as \u201cvisual kei\u201d \u2013 a\u00a0kind of glam-punk-pop style where androgyny, elaborate costume and heavy makeup are the norm. He taught himself guitar aged 15, and developed a singular lightning-fast style, combining elements from shamisen (music made on a\u00a0three-stringed instrument similar to a banjo), delta blues and slap bass players like Sly and the Family Stone\u2019s Larry Graham. His current sound tends towards polished funk-metal in a\u00a0Lenny Kravitz/Red Hot Chili Peppers vein, though his nearest western equivalent could be Jack White. Like White, he is a charismatic, energetic performer, with a guitar sound so full, he is often only accompanied by a drummer. \u201cWhen I first played guitar, I was able to imagine myself playing in front of huge crowd under the spotlights. I\u00a0thought that it was my destiny to rock the people,\u201d he says, half-jokingly. \u201cIt\u2019s all about emotion. It doesn\u2019t have to be loud, it doesn\u2019t have to be physical. The most important thing is what you want to deliver to the audience. I did the same with my acting.\u201d But Miyavi really does rock the people, and you get the sense he wants to rock more of them. In 2006, he stopped recording to live in LA and study English. He mostly sings in English now. There\u2019s a translator in the room with us but Miyavi barely needs her, though he admits he couldn\u2019t understand a word of Jack O\u2019Connell\u2019s Derbyshire accent. Only when O\u2019Connell spoke in Zamperini\u2019s American accent did he make sense to Miyavi. Whereas even third-tier indie bands can expect to be treated like the Beatles if they play in Japan, Miyavi knows the prospects of a\u00a0Japanese musician overcoming western musical prejudices are slim. But through constant touring, he\u2019s steadily building a global fanbase. The irony is that Miyavi could become better known for this single movie role than his long music career. Japanese actors do occasionally cross over to Hollywood \u2013 think of Ken Watanabe, Hiroyuki Sanada or Rinko Kikuchi \u2013 but more often than not, western movies only engage with Japan through the second world war. That mental image of a stereotypically ruthless Japanese prison-camp commandant has been hammered home over the years. It probably started with David Lean\u2019s Bridge on the River Kwai, and continued in the 1980s with the likes of Nagisa Oshima\u2019s Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence, Spielberg\u2019s Empire of the Sun, and even the TV series Tenko (whose the Japanese oppressor-in-chief was played by Anglo-Chinese actor Burt Kwouk). Earlier this year, we had The Railway Man, in which Colin Firth plays a former Royals Signals officer revisiting his wartime Japanese tormentor, while Hugh Jackman bonded with his prison-camp guard in last year\u2019s The Wolverine. Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence is particularly relevant to Unbroken. It was also based on a\u00a0western memoir (in that case by Laurens van der Post), and represented an international breakthrough for both Takeshi Kitano and Ryuichi Sakamoto \u2013 another musician-turned-actor playing a commandant with homoerotic feelings for one of his captives. Does that say more about Japanese militarism or western perspectives on it?     Ryuichi Sakamoto and David Bowie in Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence. Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar    Miyavi\u2019s relatives had little experience of the war, he says. His grandparents were Korean, and came to Japan after the war to look for work. For his generation, it\u2019s a distant memory, he says, which is both good and bad. \u201cWe are lucky. We are having peaceful and convenient lives, but it\u2019s all on their sacrifices. We need to pass that experience on to the next generation.\u201d That\u2019s ultimately why he took on the Unbroken role. \u201cTo deliver this message, I would do anything. It\u2019s not just an entertainment film, its a tribute and testament. We can\u2019t forget.\u201d Mutsuhiro Watanabe, the real-life Bird, was not captured when the war ended. He hid out in the mountains for seven years until the US occupation ended, after which he became a\u00a0life-insurance salesman. Zamperini struggled with post traumatic stress on his return to the US, and became an evangelical Christian. He personally forgave his captors, but the Bird refused to meet him, even when he came to Japan. Zamperini did at least meet Miyavi and his family, shortly before his death in July, which represented some kind of symbolic closure. \u201cIt was such a precious moment,\u201d says Miyavi. \u201cHe was funny, charming, sharp, cracking jokes, talking a lot about his experiences, playing with my daughters. I felt that forgiveness was real.\u201d \u2022 Unbroken opens in the UK on 26 December"}, {"sentences": ["Executives at Sony in Tokyo have yet to speak publicly about the controversy while authorities in the US are still conducting their investigation.", "Eiichi Katayama, a research analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, believes that total losses from The Interview \u2019s withdrawal are likely to be in the range of \u201cseveral billion yen\u201d.", "\u201cThat has still got to be his priority, since he and his people in Tokyo can\u2019t repair the damage done in Hollywood."], "tags": ["The Interview", "Sony", "Sony Pictures", "Japan", "Technology", "Business", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-20T05:32:23Z", "title": "The Interview: just one subplot in Sony's troubled big picture", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/20/the-interview-just-one-subplot-in-sonys-troubled-big-picture", "article": "On the day that Sony Pictures decided to cancel the release of The Interview \u2013 a comedy about the fictional assassination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un \u2013 the firm\u2019s employees were advised to cover their keyboard with a cloth when logging into email \u201cso that hackers can\u2019t see what you are typing\u201d. The instruction came via a spoof Twitter account using the name of the parent company\u2019s Japanese chief executive, Kazuo Hirai. Yet given the ignominy Sony has suffered in the fortnight since it was hacked, allegedly by a group connected to North Korea, parody is beginning to mirror reality. The schadenfreude that followed the leak of compromising emails by Sony Pictures executives, as well as withering reviews of The Interview by South Korean employees, are unlikely to worry Sony\u2019s CEO as much as the fiasco\u2019s financial impact and the damage it has inflicted on the firm\u2019s reputation. While executives in Los Angeles handle the immediate fallout, Hirai, who replaced Welsh-born Sir Howard Stringer almost three years ago, is contemplating a bill that could run into hundreds of millions of dollars when the cost of withdrawing the movie is added to the technology bill to repair the hacking damage. Executives at Sony in Tokyo have yet to speak publicly about the controversy while authorities in the US are still conducting their investigation. The firm\u2019s headquarters declined to respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. In The Interview, which had been due for release in the US on Christmas Day, Rogen and James Franco play celebrity TV journalists who secure an exclusive interview with Kim but are then recruited by the CIA to assassinate him. The cost of its cancellation, which came after the advertising and marketing campaigns were in full flow, could hit US$80m, according to one estimate. Variety, meanwhile, quoted insiders as saying the firm stands to lose $75m, including $44m dollars it spent producing the film and $30m in promotional costs. Some analysts said the financial costs of the movie\u2019s cancellation would not match the hit that Sony took in 2011 when hackers leaked the personal information of 100 million users of PlayStation Network. That incident cost the company 10 billion yen ($83m). Eiichi Katayama, a research analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, believes that total losses from The Interview \u2019s withdrawal are likely to be in the range of \u201cseveral billion yen\u201d. Katayama added: \u201cUncontrollable incidents like this are clearly negative for the share price. However cancellation of the movie\u2019s release is likely a step towards resolution of the incident. Even in terms of costs, this case does not approach the scale of the [PlayStation Network] event, and we think profit will recover strongly in 2015.\u201d The hacked emails and in-house bickering over the film\u2019s artistic merits are a far cry from the \u201cOne Sony\u201d vision Hirai espoused when he became chief executive in April 2012. Hacked emails reveal that he was concerned about the film\u2019s treatment of Kim months ago but his requests for the content to be toned down met with resistance from the co-director and Seth Rogen, one of the stars. And there were other very explicit warning signs. Pyongyang reacted angrily when The Interview\u2019s plot first became public and promised a \u201cresolute and merciless\u201d response if it went ahead. The North Korean ambassador to the UN, Ja Song-nam, called the movie \u201cthe most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war\u201d in a letter to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. The saga that has unfolded since is an unwanted addition to Hirai\u2019s already packed in-tray. While Sony spent years dabbling in non-traditional areas as diverse as financial services and, for a while, chemicals, its rivals played to their innovative strengths. Samsung is now the world leader in high-end TVs, and despite giving the world the Walkman, Sony never came close to producing a music player to rival the iPod. The Japanese conglomerate is heading for its fifth net loss in six years, prompting calls for the firm to ditch under-performing businesses, including its TV manufacturing unit. The firm has failed in its attempt to become the third-largest mobile phone maker after Apple and Samsung, and recently said it would abandon plans to make handsets exclusively for the Chinese market. Its struggling mobile phone business resulted in a net loss of 136 billion yen for the three months to September, although that figure was smaller than analysts had predicted. \u201cWhen this whole Interview thing started Hirai was otherwise occupied getting Sony\u2019s core businesses back on track,\u201d said film reviewer and expert on Japanese cinema Mark Schilling. \u201cThat has still got to be his priority, since he and his people in Tokyo can\u2019t repair the damage done in Hollywood. Sony made the decision many years ago to be hands off vis-a-vis Sony Pictures and I don\u2019t see that changing much. The big question is whether Sony Pictures will become a Sony asset or a liability. One thing Hirai definitely does not need is another money-losing division.\u201d While Sony Pictures handles the fallout from The Interview, the parent company\u2019s focus remains on achieving Hirai\u2019s goal of returning its electronics business to profit by the end of March 2016 following years of painful restructuring involving thousands of job losses. But it remains a dominant force in the game console market. The PlayStation 4 has easily outsold Microsoft\u2019s Xbox. The Sony console broke even within a year of its release in late 2013, a feat that took its predecessor, the PlayStation 3, four years to achieve. For the time being, though, any bright spots will be blotted out by the catastrophe surrounding The Interview \u2013 and the feat of the hackers, whom Sony accused of seeking to \u201cdestroy our spirit and our morale, all apparently to thwart the release of a movie they did not like\u201d. While Sony claims to have been the victim of a sophisticated cyber attack that many firms would have struggled to prevent, the damage to its reputation could be lasting, said Schilling. \u201cThe public doesn\u2019t care what studio label is on a film, but Hollywood talent and the people who represent them do care about who they\u2019re dealing with, and Sony Pictures has abused their trust, to put it mildly,\u201d he said. \u201cSome valuable properties and important relationships have been damaged and even though Sony was a victim, it was also responsible. How soon can it again become a studio people want to work with?\u201d"}, {"sentences": ["I had been in Tokyo for about a week.", "Because I was travelling alone, staying in Tokyo for a romantic Christmas wasn\u2019t all that appealing."], "tags": ["Kyoto holidays", "Christmas and New Year holidays", "Japan holidays", "Travel", "Asia"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-20T06:59:02Z", "title": "Christmas in Japan: time for a geisha makeover in Kyoto", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/dec/20/christmas-japan-kyoto-geisha-transformation", "article": "The Japanese have developed their own style of Christmas, despite being largely a non-Christian people.

Because I was travelling alone, staying in Tokyo for a romantic Christmas wasn\u2019t all that appealing. I decided to try something completely different. I took the bullet train to Kyoto. There, I stared in wonder at the Kinkaku-ji golden temple, its reflection shimmering gloriously on the frozen pond beside it.

An old woman bowed, wished me \u201cMeri Kurisumasu\u201d and waved me upstairs. Two trainee geisha \u2013 maiko \u2013 greeted me and, with little ceremony, peeled off my clothes. Moments later I was shivering in a thin slip. A thick white paste was adeptly applied to my face and neck \u2013 I was thankful that modern geishas no longer use nightingale guano to whiten their faces. Two hours later, I emerged transformed, though bewildered and barely able to breathe or walk. The white paste had hardened like a mask, my torso was as tightly bound as an Egyptian mummy, and I was draped in an extraordinarily heavy silk kimono. On my head was an enormous, unwieldy wig-cum-helmet, complete with braids and baubles. I couldn\u2019t have looked more festive. (Then, over a decade ago, I was lucky to have a friend with connections: to be allowed into the world of the geisha for a day was a chance of a lifetime. Now, a \u201ctransformation experience\u201d can be booked online.) Later that evening, my face scrubbed and breathing easier back in my own clothes, I joined the throng at KFC for another modern Japanese tradition: Christmas Day fried chicken.

It has been claimed that several of these emails reveal that at least two US government officials gave a rough cut of the film their blessing. It has been suggested that the US thinks such a film could indeed inspire North Koreans to rise up against their leader. True or not, this surely needs examination? Surely the call by George Clooney et al to withstand \u201cterror\u201d threats against the film in the name of artistic freedom, while correct in principle, are picking on an inappropriate target as far as attempted artistic censorship is concerned.

In the 1930s, to continue doing business in Germany after Hitler\u2019s accession to power, Hollywood studios agreed not to make films that attacked the Nazis or condemned Germany\u2019s persecution of Jews. This bargain involved the heads of every major Hollywood studio. The studios dealt directly with the German government\u2019s representatives and, in particular, the German consul in Los Angeles.

Calling the country a \u201ccesspool of terrorism\u201d, officials accused Washington of being directly involved with the film plot and threatened retaliation.  \u201cThe army and people of the DPRK are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the US in all war spaces, including cyber warfare to blow up those citadels,\u201d said a statement on the KCNA, the country\u2019s official news channel.  The Interview was cancelled by Sony Pictures last week after hackers calling themselves Guardians of Peace made threats against potential cinema audiences. Last month the company suffered a serious cyberbreach, which the US has blamed on North Korea. Pyongyang has praised the cyber attack but denies it was responsible, calling the White House \u201creckless\u201d for saying it was.  So, could a such juvenile film be the start of world war three? Unlikely, according to those familiar with North Korea who doubt Pyongyang\u2019s capacity to follow through on such threats. The country is well practiced in the art of brinkmanship, using threatening, often Shakespearean language, against its key antagonists, Tokyo, Seoul and Washington, and beyond. We take a look at who they lashed out at in 2014 and why.  The neighbours The North\u2019s immediate neighbours are a popular target for attacks, with the South, who are within the boundary of short-and medium-range missiles, bearing the brunt. In November, upset about a UN decision to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court over its human rights record, KCNA put out a series of eight bellicose articles in which they threatened to nuke South Korea\u2019s Blue House. They also called Japan a \u201cpolitical pygmy\u201d and threatened to send the country to the bottom of the sea.  Political leaders Sometimes the threats got personal. In May, after an official US visit to Seoul, North Korea called the South Korean president a \u201ccrafty prostitute\u201d in thrall to her \u201cpimp\u201d Barack Obama who, in a related editorial, was called a \u201cwicked black monkey\u201d. In August North Korea lashed out at John Kerry calling him \u201ca wolf with a hideous lantern jaw\u201d after the US and South Korea carried out joint military drills. They said they were also unhappy about Kerry\u2019s comments on North Korea\u2019s human rights record.  The UN International organisations did not escape. The North threatened a nuclear attack ahead of a UN vote on whether to to refer the country to the ICC. After the vote was passed the North declared the motion \u201cgrave political provocation\u201d orchestrated by the US, although it was drafted by the UN and the European Union. Pyongyang then organised mass protests in Kim Il-sung square, accusing the UN of relying on trumped-up allegations by defectors backed by the US and other countries seeking to overthrow its ruling regime.     A state organised mass protest against the UN in Kim Il-sung square, Pyongyang. Photograph: KCNA/EPA    Earlier in the year North Korea released its own rosy report on human rights claiming that they were enjoyed by the popular masses. In a sprawling document it again took aim at the US and its allies, accusing them in being \u201csteeped in repugnancy toward the DPRK\u201d. Defectors were called \u201chuman scum who betrayed their homeland and people\u201d. In an earlier editorial Michael Kirby, the chair of UN Commission Inquiry into human rights, was attacked over his sexuality. Plants A Christmas tree also became diplomatic sore spot, as plans by a South Korean Christian group to rebuild an illuminated installation, three miles from the atheist North\u2019s border, were shelved. North Korea had called it a \u201csymbol of frantic anti-North confrontation rackets\u201d aimed at aggravating \u201cextreme tension\u201d between the two Koreas.

Photograph: Bill Cooper    Last Saturday, while dancing Kitri in Don Quixote, Natalia Osipova slipped and fell. The Russian ballerina recovered herself quickly, flashing the audience a rueful grin, and completed the first act with her partner, Matthew Golding. During the interval it was announced that she had hurt herself too badly to continue, and that she would be replaced by first soloist Akane Takada. The Royal has a tradition of rising to the occasion in a crisis, and so it proved last week. Takada is a very different Kitri to Osipova. Where the former Bolshoi star gives us soaring leaps and show-stopping virtuosity, Tokyo-born Takada is all spun-gold precision, teasing out the music\u2019s grace notes and framing her fiercely determined gaze with the subtle flow of her arms. Act 2 was a joy. The ensemble dancing is now well bedded-in, and Takada\u2019s sparkle was beautifully complemented by Francesca Hayward\u2019s dragonfly vividness as Amor, and Claire Calvert\u2019s bountiful Queen of the Dryads. In Act 3, elegantly and attentively partnered by Golding, Takada crowned the grand pas de deux with two glorious balances that will linger long in the memory of those who witnessed them.     \u2018Giving her audience all of herself, every time\u2019: Natalia Osipova in the role of Kitri with Matthew Golding. Photograph: Bill Cooper    But in all of this we should not forget Osipova. What it cost her to complete Act 1, urchin smile gamely in place, we will never know. Ballet is a high-risk activity, and a slippery patch of stage or a split-second\u2019s inattention in a leap can spell serious injury and months of rehabilitation. Alina Cojocaru almost broke her neck in rehearsals here, Ivan Putrov had to be carried offstage with a torn Achilles tendon, and Claire Calvert returned this season from a year\u2019s lay-off following a severe knee injury. Lauren Cuthbertson has suffered a string of mishaps, most recently a badly twisted foot sustained while rehearsing the notorious \u201cslide\u201d in Act 1 of Manon. This step, an accelerated, feet-first skid to the ground, has injured Cuthbertson, Alina Cojocaru, Sylvie Guillem, Sarah Lamb, Cynthia Harvey and Tamara Rojo. It is a known and wretched hazard which clearly should be modified. But ballet is ruthlessly Darwinian, and one dancer\u2019s injury is another\u2019s chance for triumph. When the Manon skid claimed Cojocaru, Jamie Tapper raced to Covent Garden from her flat, where she had been decorating, and completed the ballet with visible streaks of white paint on her hands. At the age of 19, Marianela Nu\u00f1ez replaced the injured Leanne Benjamin as Don Quixote\u2019s Kitri, propelling herself to the Royal\u2019s front rank. The Covent Garden crowd has always loved these last-minute heroine narratives, and cheered Takada home. Osipova, meanwhile, will be reflecting on the price of giving her audience all of herself, every time. She could play it safe, but she wouldn\u2019t be Osipova if she did. We wish her a swift recovery.

Our favourite night is Wednesdays, when it has cheap wine and free delicious cheese. As a band, we cannot eat enough cheese, so it\u2019s a win-win situation. We even have a (now not-so) secret whine &amp; wine club where we meet every Wednesday, when we\u2019re not on tour. \u2022 kaffibarinn.is Chosen by Samaris Badaboum, Paris We like this club more than others for several reasons: it used to be a concert hall called La Sc\u00e8ne Bastille and now it\u2019s a mix between concerts and DJ sets, but always tasteful music, nothing mainstream. The place is really cool because it has different rooms with their own ambiences: you begin next to the entrance with a room with tables and sofas where you can have very good cocktails chilling with your friends. This is not common in Paris, it means you can have a break without loud music and have a real conversation. Then you have a dancefloor that\u2019s not too big but enough to dance without feeling like sardines, and good music. When it\u2019s the DJs playing, you can listen to the finest techno and underground electronic music from all around the world, with international guests and small local DJs. It\u2019s the same thing when bands are playing: the lineups are interesting, and the sound system works perfectly without smashing your ears. The last room, upstairs on the first floor, looks like a living room of a small house, with wood everywhere, and old arcade video games. \u2022 badaboum-paris.com Chosen by Montmartre Yoyo, Paris          This place has the same concept as Le Badaboum, so you have both concerts and DJ sets, but a bit more electro. It\u2019s under the Palais de Tokyo, one of the largest sites of European contemporary art. When you are inside, you have a kind of large balcony over your head reminding you the old function of the place - a French cin\u00e9math\u00e8que. With urban decoration and graffs on the walls, you really find the underground feeling in this place. When it\u2019s DJ time, you can have the best of techno/deep house, nu-disco, electro and indie dance music. Sometimes there are special events based on art, with visual concepts behind the performers \u2013 so you\u2019re clubbing but it\u2019s art! We have good memories there because the energy is really great: people are open to new things and happy to be here. People are cool, the drinks are a bit expensive, but we recommend this club for all art lovers.\u2022 yoyo-paris.comChosen by Montmartre Concrete, Paris          From the outside, Concrete is a frighteningly huge boat in the 12th arrondissement with a top terrace where people chill out, have drinks and smoke cigarettes. But once you walk into the boat, you step into a techno-rave den. It started off as an after-hours party running from Sunday to Monday, but became so popular that it has taken over entire weekends. The DJ booth is most impressive in Paris, it\u2019s a square and has the crowd raving all around the DJ. You have to fight your way through the tons of sweaty dancers if you want to catch a glimpse of who\u2019s playing. House rules include, no pictures, no selfies, no filming, only good vibes. Every weekend, techno lovers, music geeks, young ravers and groups of curious middle-aged people cross paths on the boat\u2019s dancefloor. Sunday mornings see a scattered crowd of zombies coming to the end of their rave-marathon, but by 6pm new blood fills up the boat again and a new party begins. There\u2019s nothing scene-y about this place: the focus is on the music, and it\u2019s just all about dancing as much as you can. \u2022 concreteparis.fr Chosen by Girls Girls Girls  Cross Club, Prague      Cross Club is amazing, unique and rather strange. It\u2019s near the centre of Prague and you would hardly believe such a place existed. Created by Franti\u0161ek Chmel\u00edk and his friends, the design and decoration has a clear steampunk influence; with an incredible layout of waste metal, wood and even ceramic, recycled for the occasion. The main room and the beautiful wall light behind the DJ booth make the club even more fantastic. The sound is great, the audience actually know how to dance and the events are all quality.\u2022 crossclub.cz Chosen by Bambounou Salon des amateurs, Dusseldorf This is a modern art museum cafe by day, and one of the most forward-thinking clubs by night. I\u2019ve seen people dance to the most weirdo experimental music here, and the scene around it is a very special one. A lot of kids who grew up in this place listening to the most underground stuff have since started their own amazing projects and bands, which is what a club should be all about. It should inspire. \u2022 salondesamateurs.de Chosen by Young Marco Kaiku, Helsinki If I designed a club it would look like this one. A big wooden box, a great sound system, a Rotary mixer in the booth and working turntables (which is not a given these days, unfortunately). Combine that with a very open-minded crowd and great programming and you have Kaiku. The people behind this place are in it for all the right reasons and pure love of music \u2013 and you will notice it when you\u2019re there. \u2022 clubkaiku.fiChosen by Young Marco Propaganda, Moscow          The booker at Propaganda in Moscow owned one of the first record stores in the city, and has been on the scene for over 20 years. He\u2019s a true music lover and puts a lot of care into the bookings and club; the last time I played he met me in St Petersburg with his wife to come to my show, and we all took the train back to Moscow together. The clubbers arrive early and they come for the music. There is a proper stage for live sets, the sound is good, and I always have a great time. \u2022 propagandamoscow.com Chosen by Kate Simko SOUTHERN EUROPE DC10, Ibiza  DC10 is the stuff of legend \u2013 an Ibiza saga that\u2019s still going strong after heavy pressure from the Guardia Civil to close its doors. I like to arrive late in the afternoon on a Monday for Circo Loco, arguably the island\u2019s best party, and see it through to the small hours. There\u2019s an amazing dark room as you walk in which I love to play, but head out to the legendary terrace for the real freaks. It\u2019s a club where anything goes: skint 18-year-olds dance alongside A-list celebs, without a VIP table in sight. Expect nothing but underground house, techno and the most Balearic clubbing experience possible. \u2022 Facebook page  Chosen by Hot Since 82, whose mix compilation, Knee Deep In Sound, is out now on Knee Deep In Sound/Ultra Music Elrow, Barcelona          This is definitely the Spanish equivalent of Berlin\u2019s Panorama. It\u2019s revered and is one of those real after-hours style clubs \u2013 seriously going all day and night. It does a night out in Ibiza but the Barcelona club, just outside the city close to the airport, has been created by one family (all the generations are involved to a certain extent), which gives the club a great community vibe. The crowd at Elrow are serious freaks: they party in style. Think Cirque du Soleil, drag queens, confetti \u2026 I hate that kind of showbiz style night but they do it so well and with so much detail that it feels incredibly decadent. The sun is beating down, it\u2019s the middle of the day and everybody is going crazy. It\u2019s simply exciting (and I don\u2019t use that word very often!). Not all countries know how to party but Spain certainly does.\u2022 row14.es. Chosen by Tiga CDLC (Carpe Diem Lounge Club), Barcelona Barcelona is one of my favorite cities to play in Europe, in particular CDLC. It\u2019s on the main promenade, and by day you can sip cocktails on the terrace with beautiful views of the Mediterranean. After sunset you can enjoy amazing sushi, steak and seafood. The service, staff, quality of food and ambience are on point. At 11pm the tables are cleared away and the dining area is transformed into a dance floor. It\u2019s one of the only places where I can still play Soulful House and dig deep for forgotten classics. From diners to clubbers the transition is smooth. I always feel like I could play another five hours after the lights come up.\u2022 cdlcbarcelona.comChosen by Sam Divine Nitsa Club, Barcelona          Nitsa has been my second home for the past five years. I spent most Fridays and Saturdays here before starting to play regularly in clubs, listening to the best artists of the moment and learning how to construct a DJ set by focusing on my favourite artists. The most special moment of a night here was always the closing sets, played amazingly by the resident DJs, especially DJ Fra (aka Ferenc) and DJ De Mierda (aka Marc Pi\u00f1ol). The best music I\u2019ve heard in a club has been in those sets, always after 6am. I remember many nights, but perhaps my two favourite ones were Jacques Lu Cont and Erol Alkan in 2004, when the crowd invaded the DJ booth and security were not able to contain all the people; and Michael Mayer and Reinhard Voigt in 2005, where Mayer signed some vinyl for me and Voigt gifted me his T-shirt during his live show! What makes Nitsa special is its eclecticism. During the same month you could hear artists from IDM to techno, from house to electro, from indie pop to drum\u2019n\u2019bass. \u2022 nitsa.com Chosen by Coyu Big Bang, Rome This venue is in a large converted house on a street that looks like a Tarantino vision of Babylon. There are late-night bars and clubs in converted buildings and medieval- looking warehouses everywhere. You get the sense that all the sins of the city have been brushed away from the tourists to this place, and this is where the real Rome underground lives. On Friday nights Big Bang becomes the Big Bang Reggae Yard and Trojan Sound play a night there called BaBaBoom Time, the best reggae party in Italy. The crowd know and feel their music and reggae speaks to them in a deep, almost spiritual way. The club has a vibe a bit like a house party, with one main room for the music and various other rooms downstairs and upstairs for people to hang out in. The club\u2019s also a big favourite of Trojan Sound System friend Coleen \u201cCosmo\u201d Murphy who also loves playing host at the venue\u2019s loft-style parties, which she tells us happen without the hype that plagues most club nights and DJs today. \u2022 bigbangroma.org Chosen by Trojan Sound System Goa, Rome          What I love about this club is the effort it regularly puts into creating a special decor. It feels like a cross between a dark cabaret and a David Lynch film, with tons of oddly framed paintings all over the walls and strange objects hanging around. The sound is tight and the booth is surrounded by people. It\u2019s a cosy personal affair and I always really enjoy playing there. \u2022 goaclub.comChosen by Magda  Casablanca Soul, Santorini, Greece In the centre of this small volcanic island, Casablanca Soul has been pioneering underground music since the early 1980s. Now it\u2019s a musical landmark and one of the biggest bookers of international DJs in the Greek islands. Santorini isn\u2019t as well-known for dance music as islands such as Mykonos, but this bar has the spirit of the music. Unlike most club and bars in Greece, this one is about the music, people and vibe. With a capacity of about 120, it\u2019s tight, to say the least, but the energy is always full-on and the luxury of having no curfew means you can play until the sun comes up. I\u2019ve moved to this island partly because of the love I have for this bar. Bliss! \u2022 casablancasoul.comChosen by osunlade Lux, Lisbon       Photograph: Alamy    Lux is widely regarded as Lisbon\u2019s top club, and with good reason. It has an amazing sound system (what bass-head doesn\u2019t have a love for Funktion Ones?), wooden dancefloors, a big terrace, and varied lineups with lots of different club nights \u2013 including our own, the bimonthly Hard Ass Sessions. The design inside is always pretty crazy. I think it regularly commissions visual artists to design pieces for the club or just have a say in the decorations and it also has these video and light installations that keep changing. It recently added some stuffed polar bears, which actually freaked me out the first time I saw them. It has also been a traditionally gay-friendly environment. It\u2019s a fun and weird place. Slightly posh but still pretty open to anyone, slightly artsy and brainy but you can still hear anything from zouk bass to heavy techno, and when you leave the club in the morning you can enjoy a drunken view of the river, which is nice. Oh, and it basically gave life to an area of Lisbon, opening the club, restaurants, a record shop and art gallery where previously there was nothing. . \u2022 luxfragil.comChosen by Jo\u00e3o Pedro Silva, Enchufada Records iBoat, Bordeaux I\u2019ve only played at iBoat once so far, but it was an instant favourite. The club is in the basement of a docked boat, with a great restaurant upstairs. The time I played there with Prosumer, and we had a nice relaxed dinner and wine, we were shocked to see the mayhem downstairs by the time we finished. People were already hanging from the rafters and it was packed. I played a live audio-visual set there and loved the fact that it had a nice LED board. It\u2019s a proper all-round club, and the booking curation is impressive.\u2022 iboat.euChosen by Kate Simko Barbarellas Discoteque, Tisno, Croatia     Photograph: Khris Cowely/Facebook    Barbarellas is run by the guys behind The Garden Festival (which hosts its final edition in summer 2015) in Tisno \u2013 also home to a Soundwave, Electric Elephant and Stop Making Sense. At the old Garden site in Petr\u010dane, Barbarellas was an indoor club with retro-1970s decor, but now it has moved it\u2019s an outdoor club that runs until 6am. The Barbarellas after-parties are legendary: DJing to a great crowd under the stars and watching the sun rise over the stunning Dalmatian coast. It\u2019s definitely one of my favourite clubs in the world, with a unique atmosphere, and I can\u2019t wait to be back there this summer.\u2022 watchthegardengrow.euChosen by DJ Gilla, First Word Records "}, {"sentences": ["This was the fourth international criminal tribunal in history, after the Nuremberg trial of Nazi war crimes, its counterpart in Tokyo, then more recently the Hague tribunal for crimes committed in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s."], "tags": ["Tanzania", "Rwanda", "Africa", "United Nations", "World news", "Human rights", "Law"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-29T10:00:02Z", "title": "Tanzanian town builds for the future after Rwanda tribunal concludes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/29/arusha-tanzania-rwanda-tribunal-conclusion", "article": "The pioneers of the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda arrived in Arusha, Tanzania in 1996. They were destined to spend the following 18 years prosecuting those accused of responsibility in the Rwandan genocide. The lepers on the potholed avenue leading to the courthouse, who used to reach out in the hope of a gift from the rich muzungu (whites in Swahili), have vanished. And the last judges and prosecutors of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda were to have left by the end of 2014. \u201cFor the tribunal\u2019s very first hearing they had to place buckets in the courtroom to catch the leaks during the rainy season,\u201d a lawyer recalls. The steady drip set the cadence for proceedings as Georges Rutaganda, former leader of the Interahamwe militia, who brutally slaughtered the Tutsi with machetes, pleaded not guilty before Judge Laity Kama, of Senegal. This was the fourth international criminal tribunal in history, after the Nuremberg trial of Nazi war crimes, its counterpart in Tokyo, then more recently the Hague tribunal for crimes committed in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. For many years, Arusha was just a base camp for safaris into the surrounding savannah. Its new role came by default: all other potential hosts declined the offer, so Tanzania was left to accommodate the tribunal. In the course of its stay, the court tried 71 suspects: army officers, ministers, politicians, militia, priests and purveyors of propaganda. All in all it performed its duties well, though there are some grounds for the accusation that it dispensed \u201cvictor\u2019s justice\u201d. It did not bring to trial any of the former Rwandan rebels, who resorted to terror tactics, too, in their drive to end the genocide. Close to the Maasai homeland, Arusha has long attracted flocks of tourists. Some tour operators even gave them the opportunity to view the big game in the dock at the international tribunal between two safari outings. En route for Kilimanjaro, they would traipse through the public gallery in their T-shirts and sandals before transferring to the aerodrome across the road from the prison. But some 3,000 witnesses from Rwanda came here, too.     Inside the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda, in Arusha, Tanzania, a wanted poster with portraits of those accused of perpetrating genocide. Photograph: Christophe Calais/Corbis    Originally people in Arusha only spoke Swahili. Water was in short supply and an out-of-date copy of Le Monde, gleaned by street sellers from the daily flight from Amsterdam, would cost you $5. On return flights, the cargo was generally a consignment of roses. But the aircraft did not only carry flowers. Jean Kambanda, who led the government formed a few hours after President Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana\u2019s plane was shot down in 1994 (the occasion for the start of the killing in Rwanda), was flown back to The Hague and imprisoned alongside alleged Yugoslav war criminals, after pleading guilty in 1998. There this austere former banker was taught to play poker by Mladen Naletili\u0107, a militia leader from Mostar, Bosnia. Today Arusha has daily flights and 4G connections. In less than 20 years the city has been transformed. In the bar of the New Safari Hotel, Akayesu, as he is known, orders a Kilimanjaro, the local beer. The estate agent owes his nickname to Jean-Paul Akayesu, the first person ever to be convicted on charges of genocide. When the violence first started in Rwanda, in 1994, this local council leader tried to stop the slaughter, but finally gave in and joined the killers. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. What is currently troubling the estate agent is the likely drop in house prices when the court finally closes. In contrast Modest Akida, a local barrister, is delighted. \u201cWe went to the same shops, rented the same houses and all the prices soared. So it\u2019s really very good news that they\u2019re leaving at last,\u201d he says. According to a 2004 survey, ICTR staff injected more than $2.5m a month into the local economy. The court employed some 200 Tanzanian nationals. According to Kosic, a UN guard who came here from former Yugoslavia, the town is \u201ca black hole, halfway between Cape Town and Cairo\u201d. He thinks Arusha owes its prosperity to the court, \u201cbut now it has grown up and can stand on its own two feet\u201d. The ICTR attracted investors and the East African Community established its headquarters in a brand-new building next door to the court. Now the African Court on Human and People\u2019s Rights has moved in and peace talks have been held here. Arusha is beginning to see itself as Africa\u2019s Geneva. In Kijenge neighbourhood, Alfred Lotuno, an elderly Maasai, voices his concerns. \u201cTanzania has acted like a saint in Africa. We have tried to help Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan, Darfur and Somalia,\u201d he says. \u201cTanzania has become the policeman of Africa and everyone says: \u2018Tanzania, Tanzania!\u2019 But now we have al-Shabaab in Arusha and bombs are going off. So I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d In recent months the town has suffered several attacks allegedly perpetrated by the Somali Islamists, though some say it has more to do with local politics.

Felicity Jones takes her role, and handles it just as beautifully; James Marsh is as rigorous with the facts as he was on the Oscar-winning documentary Man on Wire. 2 January (all release dates below UK only).  2) Birdman Michael Keaton gives us a career best with his performance as Riggan, an actor who became rich and famous playing a superhero called Birdman but is now trying for artistic credibility by starring in his own self-produced Broadway play. As his personal and professional life unravels, Riggan is haunted by the derisive voice of Birdman, his alter ego, telling him to forget this art nonsense and return to making commercial movies for the masses. 2 January. 3) Enemy Jake Gyllenhaal vies with Jake Gyllenhaal for top billing in the Dostoevskian tale of a man (Gyllenhaal) who meets and exploits his exact double (Gyllenhaal). Prisoners director Denis Villeneuve adapts Nobel prize-winner Jos\u00e9 Saramago\u2019s posthumously published novel into a sickly story of paranoia and fatigue. Gyllenhaal(s) have rarely been better. 2 January.     Liam Neeson in Taken 3.    4) Taken 3 Using his very particular set of skills, Liam Neeson cranks it up once again for another go-round of the French-produced, Hollywood-inspired hostage drama. Originally a flag waver for the geri-action phenomenon, the first Taken\u2019s surprise success in 2008 turned the now 62-year-old Neeson into an improbable thug grappler. Judging by its trailer, Taken 3 has more of the same, with Neeson\u2019s ex-special ops guy Bryan Mills pursued by every law enforcement agency known to man after he\u2019s arrested for the murder of his wife. 8 January. 5) Foxcatcher An extraordinary but still little-known true story is at the heart of this movie about toxic maleness. Steve Carell gives a superb and deadly serious performance as John DuPont, a spoiled billionaire who, in the 80s, decided to bankroll the training facilities for the US Olympic wrestling team \u2014 and tried to befriend the sport\u2019s top stars, the Schultz brothers - Mark and Dave - played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo. The atmosphere of warped mentoring and competition is compelling. 9 January.            6) Into the Woods Stephen Sondheim\u2019s musical smash has now been adapted into a Disney movie starring Meryl Streep, Anna Kendrick, Johnny Depp and Emily Blunt. The drama explores and reinvents the myths and legends of the Grimm Brothers\u2019 universe, with echoes of Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel and Cinderella. A childless couple are forced to venture into the woods to confront the witch who has cursed their attempts to have children. 9 January. 7) Whiplash A talented young drummer (Miles Teller) shreds sticks and nerves under the monstrous tutelage of Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons), his abusive music teacher. Dubbed Full Metal Juilliard on the festival circuit, Whiplash is a beats, not bombs war movie. When the kid fouls up, the general throws a cymbal at his head. Frantic, relentless, punky and fun, Whiplash is at our tempo. 16 January. 8) American Sniper At 84, Clint Eastwood is in no mood to slow down. His new film is based on the autobiography of Navy Seal Chris Kyle, the self-proclaimed \u201cmost lethal sniper in US military history\u201d. Bradley Cooper stars as Kyle himself, who later achieved celebrity in a civilian life that became as dramatic and extraordinary as anything on the field of battle. 16 January.            9) Testament of Youth Thirty-five years after the BBC series based on Vera Brittain\u2019s first world war memoirs comes another adaptation by Auntie: this one gorgeous and swooning, much more Euro-movie than Brit flick with Alicia Vikander as the headstrong Oxford hopeful Vera. Dominic West and Emily Watson are ma and pa and Game of Thrones\u2019s Kit Harington is among the young men Vera knows who are dispatched to the trenches. 16 January.     Reese Witherspoon stars in Wild.    10) Wild Cheryl Strayed\u2019s best-selling memoir about hiking 1,100 miles to deal with the death of her mum is taken off into the wilderness by screenwriter Nick Hornby and director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e (Dallas Buyers Club). Wild is a tough road movie, a two-hour hallucinatory montage of sight and song as Cheryl (Oscar-tipped Reese Witherspoon) stamps her way to redemption. 16 January. 11) Beyond Clueless Film essayist Charlie Lyne goes back to school with a coy examination of the 90s and 00s teen movie scenes. From exposing the frat boy comedy Euro Trip as a homoerotic odyssey, to pilloring Josie and the Pussycats as a rallying cry for consumerism, Lyne revels in analysing silliness with thoughtful sincerity. 23 January. 12) La Maison de la Radio France\u2019s gentlest, most compassionate documentarian returns a few years after N\u00e9nette (about an orangutan in Paris\u2019s botanical gardens\u2019 zoo) and a dozen after his best-known work, Etre et Avoir, with this peek behind the scenes of France\u2019s national radio. He shot over 24 hours inside the beehive of Radio France, as music was played and fiction was created, news broke and pundits jabbered. Unique and inspired stuff. 23 January.            13) Mortdecai Johnny Depp channels his inner Englishman once again for a comedy based on Kyril Bonfiglioli\u2019s Charlie Mortdecai novels, about a top-hole art dealer with a penchant for getting mixed up in unpleasant crimes. Exuding an Austin Powers meets PG Wodehouse vibe, this looks pretty funny, even if no actual English chap appears to have got anywhere near the principal credits. 23 January. 14) The Gambler Devotees of tough, murky 70s American cinema will fondly recall The Gambler, James Toback\u2019s fictionalised account of his years of addiction. Now the film has been remade with Mark Wahlberg in the old James Caan role as the jittery English professor mired in debt and menaced by hoodlums. Salvation or disaster is just a dice throw away. 23 January. 15) A Most Violent Year Sidney Lumet may be dead, but his spirit lives on in the form of talented writer-director JC Chandor. A Most Violent Year is a pungent, potent tale of early 80s New York, riddled with crime and crusted with snow. Oscar Isaac shines as the ambitious immigrant entrepreneur, Jessica Chastain rides shotgun as a Brooklyn Lady Macbeth. 23 January.     Colin Firth in Kingsman.    16) Kingsman: The Secret Service You wait all year for an ironic take on the bowler-hatted 60s, and two come along at once. Following hard on the heels of Mortdecai comes this deconstruction of the Ian Fleming-style gentleman spy, with Colin Firth as the veteran agent attempting to instruct his wayward nephew (Taron Egerton) in the arts of the great game. This reunites the team behind Kick-Ass - director Matthew Vaughn, screenwriter Jane Goldman, comic-book writer Mark Millar \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason to suggest this won\u2019t be a repeat of the earlier film\u2019s high entertainment value. 29 January.            17) Big Hero 6 How do you follow up a generation-defining event like Frozen? Having stolen the thunder from its sister company Pixar, Disney is now set to horn in on its hipster-superhero territory by exploiting the properties of yet another company it recently bought: Marvel. A kid called Hiro, living in a futureworld amalgam of San Francisco and Tokyo  and his balloon-like robot chum Baymax thwart a conspiracy with the help of a gang of friends with superpower suits. This beat Interstellar on its opening day in the US, so the portents are good. 30 January. 18) Son of a Gun Former Home and Awayer Brendon Thwaites is the petty criminal offered a Faustian pact in jail from Ewan McGregor\u2019s hardened robber: protection for a favour on the outside. The stage is set for a mix of mentor-mentee bust-ups, gold-oriented heist action, and steamy romance with Sweden\u2019s Alicia Vikander. 30 January. 19) Inherent Vice If you can remember the 60s, you weren\u2019t actually there. And if you can explain Inherent Vice, you\u2019ve surely been watching it wrong. Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s new film is a ramshackle joy, full of double agents, shifty hippies and renegade cops. Our guide through the revels is Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s stoner PI, but he\u2019s so glazed and befuddled that he\u2019s shooting at shadows. Your best advice: tune in, turn on and enjoy the trip while it lasts. 30 January.            20) Trash Those on the lookout for the next Slumdog Millionaire should keep their eyes on this boisterous, sentimental tour of the developing world, directed by Stephen Daldry from a Richard Curtis script. Trash spotlights a trio of teenage foragers on the rubbish dumps of an unnamed South American city. A mysterious wallet may just provide their ticket out of the ruins. 30 January.  21) Selma Selma is about the 1965 US civil-rights marches led by Martin Luther King that set off from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital of Montgomery to protest against the insidious obstruction of voter registration for black Americans. The 600 marchers were attacked with clubs and tear gas by police. David Oyelowo plays King; Carmen Ejogo plays Coretta Scott King and Tom Wilkinson plays President Lyndon Johnson. 6 February.     Chiara D\u2019Anna in The Duke of Burgundy.    22) The Duke of Burgundy Excitement levels are high and the temperature is boiling ahead of the arrival of The Duke of Burgundy, in which a libidinous lepidopterist makes the housemaid her mistress. Director Peter Strickland burnishes his credentials as one of the UK\u2019s most distinctive film-makers with a playful, teasing slice of erotica that aims to fire the mind as well as the loins. 6 February.              23) Jupiter Ascending One minute Mila Kunis is playing a down-on-her-luck caretaker with no prospects. The next (apparently) she has met a genetically modified strongman (Channing Tatum) and been told she\u2019s the intergalactic heir to the planet Earth. You can never accuse the Wachowskis of setting their sights low. Jupiter Ascending is their $200m space opera, tipped as a gaudy, ambitious marriage of Star Wars and The Matrix. 6 February. 24) Love is Strange Ira Sachs\u2019s snuggles-only old-age romance won a restrictive \u201cR\u201d rating from the US censors, presumably because the long-term couple it depicts are men. Still, US audiences have flocked to this very moving story of New York couple John Lithgow and Alfred Molina who get married after decades together, only to find themselves forced to live apart when the Catholic school at which Molina teaches fires him for coming out. 6 February.            25) Shaun the Sheep: The Movie Shaun the Sheep has come a long way from a throwaway gag in A Close Shave. Having evolved into a highly successful kids TV series, the feisty ovine now gets his own feature film, proving there\u2019s life post-Wallace and Gromit in the Aardman stop-motion stable. There\u2019s a Pig in the City kind of thing going on, with Shaun and his woolly chums heading off to the big smoke to track down the hapless Farmer. 6 February. 26) Fifty Shades of Grey \u201cMr Grey will see you now,\u201d runs the tagline. And you, no doubt, will see a fair bit of Mr Grey. Sam Taylor-Johnson\u2019s take on EL James\u2019s bonkbuster has The Fall star Jamie Dornan on kit-off duty. He plays the mysterious business type whose relationship with a young college graduate (Dakota Fanning) heads into sexy, slappy territory. 13 February. 27) The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Ol Parker\u2019s grey-pound cash cow opens its doors once more. Most of the old faithfuls are still checked in \u2013 Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith, Celia Imrie and Penelope Wilton \u2013 leaving two newcomers to squabble over the only spare room. These fresh prospective residents at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful are, rather weirdly, Richard Gere and Tamsin Greig. 27 February.     Robot evolution in Chappie.    28) Chappie District 9 director Neill Blomkamp reunites with actor Sharlto Copley for the third time in this artificial intelligence sci-fi yarn, in which Copley provides the voice for the newly minted robot of the title. With a name like that, it ought to be a comedy, but first glimpses suggest there\u2019s a seriousness of intent here, as Chappie grows and learns in a human-like fashion. Hugh Jackman and Dev Patel are along for the ride. 6 March.            29) Still Alice Julianne Moore is a dead cert for the best actress Oscar for her role in this drama about a neurology professor with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a devastating, immaculate performance that blows the competition out of the water. There\u2019s strong support from Alec Baldwin as her husband, torn between caring for his wife and furthering his career, and Kristen Stewart as their apparently irresponsible offspring, who winds up saving the day. 6 March. 30) The Face of an Angel Michael Winterbottom handles hot potato material \u2013 the murder of Meredith Kercher and subsequent trial of Amanda Knox \u2013 with deft fingers. His approach is to turn the focus inwards, exploring why a young director (played by Daniel Br\u00fchl) might find the case so interesting, and how the gathered international press (in particular Kate Beckinsale\u2019s glam hack) feed off the story \u2013 and each other. 6 March. 31) Jane Got a Gun Natalie Portman stars as a woman defending her home against a gang of no-good cowboys in Gavin O\u2019Connor\u2019s western. A rocky production saw the saloon doors hit Lynne Ramsay on the way out. Jude Law left town with her, before Ewan McGregor climbed into the saddle. Let\u2019s see what state the film\u2019s in now the smoke\u2019s cleared. 6 March. 32) Suite Fran\u00e7aise Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky\u2019s novel of the same name had a belated publication: the manuscript was discovered by her daughters in 1998, 56 years after she died at Auschwitz. Its path to the screen since publication in 2002 has been fairly swift, then: Michelle Williams stars as the married woman in occupied France who becomes attracted to a German officer (played by Matthias Schoenaerts). Saul Dibb directs, and Kristin Scott Thomas is Williams\u2019s formidable mother-in-law. 13 March.            33) In the Heart of the Sea The Essex was a US whaling ship that was sunk by its quarry, leaving its starving survivors adrift in the ocean. Now up sails director Ron Howard, adapting the bestseller by Nathaniel Philbrick, to dredge this tragic nugget of history up from the depths. We\u2019re seeing this one as Moby Dick meets Alive. 13 March. 34) Top Five Chris Rock writes, directs and stars in this romcom about a washed-up comedy action star (Rock) engaged to a ghastly reality-TV star and making a bid for serious artistry with a 12 Years a Slave-style flick about the Haitian revolution. Rosario Dawson\u2019s New York Times reporter tags along with him for the day, with predictable \u2013 but uproariously funny and irreverent \u2013 results. 20 March. 35) Wild Tales \u201cI see violence all over the place,\u201d says one character in this extraordinary portmanteau movie from Argentina. This is a collection of wild tales: angry, crazy, untamed. A fashion model on a plane makes a bizarre discovery about her passengers and there is calamity. A waitress recognising a nasty customer leads to bloody mayhem. A road-rage incident culminates in bizarre farce. And lots more. 27 March. 36) Furious 7 Make vrrrrroom for chunky Vin Diesel and beefy Dwayne Johnson as they squeeze into sports cars to put the Fast and Furious franchise\u2019s pedal to the metal once more. They\u2019ve gained a baddie (Jason Statham playing the terrifying-sounding \u201cIan Shaw\u201d), but must lose a friend. Co-star Paul Walker died in a high-speed car crash while Furious 7 was being filmed. 3 April. ART AND DESIGN 37) Represent: 200 Years of African-American Art Philadelphia has one of the best collections anywhere of black American painting, photography and applied arts, and this show of more than 100 artists will insist on both the breadth of the black experience and its centrality to US art history. Decorative arts from the 19th century by both free and enslaved African Americans form the starting point for a pluralist showcase that takes in academic painting and folk art, street photography and textiles. Rather than isolate abstract black painters and sculptors from politically engaged artists such as Glenn Ligon and Lorna Simpson, the show articulates a vibrant, unified tradition. From 10 January to 5 April, Philadelphia Museum of Art.     Peter Paul Rubens\u2019s Pan and Syrinx, 1617. Photograph: Museumslandschaft Hessen Kassel, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister/Ute Brunzel    38) Rubens and His Legacy The swirling energy of Rubens makes his art a feast of colour, violence, eroticism and history that entranced the rulers who paid him to decorate palaces across early 17th-century Europe, and has fascinated artists ever since. From the French Romantic painter Delacroix, whose fierce chromatic fireworks owe Rubens everything, to Picasso, who claimed to loathe Rubens but was manifestly influenced by him, this promises to be a truly stupendous celebration of a cultural giant. From 24 January to 10 April, Royal Academy, London. 39) Marlene Dumas: The Image as Burden In a retrospective that blurs painting and drawing, the personal and the public, Dumas portrays people with exceptional tenderness and vulnerability, humour and sadness, from sexy, bare-all watercolours to portraits of the living and the dead. Pasolini and Phil Spector, Osama bin Laden and Alan Turing are among her roll call of heroes and villains. From 5 February to 10 May, Tate Modern, London.     History is Now: a work by Victor Burgin.    40) History Is Now: 7 Artists Take On Britain John Akomfrah, Simon Fujiwara, Roger Hiorns, Hannah Starkey, Richard Wentworth and Jane &amp; Louise Wilson each curate a section of a spiky show that takes British society from 1945 to the present, touching on everything from the CND movement to the BSE outbreak, urban planning and reality TV. Expect icons and iconoclasm. From 10 February to 26 April, Hayward Gallery, London.  41) Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester Signalling Manchester\u2019s growing importance as a centre for the visual arts, the Whitworth\u2019s \u00a315m expansion opens with multiple exhibitions and displays, including key works and new commissions by Cornelia Parker, the beautiful watercolours of Thomas Sch\u00fctte, and a 45-metre-long gunpowder drawing by Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang. Opening 14 February.     The sky garden at 20 Fenchurch Street.    42) Walkie Talkie sky garden Guy de Maupassant said his favourite place to dine was the Eiffel tower, because it was the only place in Paris where he couldn\u2019t see it. So Londoners will be relieved to hear that the panoramic \u201csky garden\u201d of the Walkie Talkie tower will open from spring, serving overpriced refreshments out of the glare of its death ray. 20 Fenchurch Street, London. 43) Architecture of Independence: African ModernismHeroic concrete archways, daring domes and enigmatic pyramid structures will feature in what promises to be a fascinating German show of African modernist architecture from the 1950s and 60s \u2013 a little-known period of bold experimentation following many central and sub-Saharan countries\u2019 independence. Curated by Manuel Hertz, with photographs by Iwan Baan, the exhibition will chart more than 50 public buildings in countries such as Kenya, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Zambia, Ghana and Senegal.From 20 February to 22 May, Vitra Design Museum, Weil-am-Rhein, Germany.     Live like an artist in A House for Essex. Photograph: Grayson Perry/FAT Architecture    44) A house for Essex, by FAT and Grayson Perry Looking like a souped-up gingerbread house crossed with a Thai temple, this fairytale holiday home in the Essex countryside designed by Grayson Perry and FAT architects will open for bookings in spring. Prospective Hansels and Gretels will be able to dine beneath a motorbike chandelier and sleep tucked up in a nest of gaudy tapestries. 45) All of This Belongs to You One of the first exhibitions produced by the V&amp;A\u2019s new contemporary architecture and design department, this provocative show will infiltrate the rambling pile in London\u2019s South Kensington with a series of specially commissioned interventions from the likes of Muf and James Bridle, exploring civic issues from technology and security to citizenship and democracy, to tie in with the general election. From 1 April to 19 July, Victoria and Albert Museum, London.      West coast kitsch \u2026 Jason Rhoades: Four Roads.    46) Jason Rhoades: Four Roads First museum survey of the late LA artist Jason Rhoades, whose labyrinthine installations combine everything from industrial machinery, power tools, salmon eggs, neon, dirty words and US west coast kitsch. There\u2019s horror and zany politics, autobiography and poetic overload, and a lot of craziness to unpack. From 20 February to 31 May, BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead.  47) Tate Britain Commission 2015: Christina Mackie Taking on the Duveen Galleries in an installation inspired by her interest in pigments and colour, Mackie\u2019s complex tableaux mix materials and processes, the found and the made in a rich multilayered meditation on the world around us. Call it painting without paintings, sculpture without sculptures. From 24 March to 18 October, Tate Britain, London.  48) Sargent It\u2019s quite the thing in the art world to \u201crediscover\u201d artists whose works are dismissed as a bit slight. So often, such exercises by curators or critics are unconvincing. John Singer Sargent is the exception \u2013 a truly brilliant painter whose work is infinitely more serious and provocative than it might seem at a cursory glance. This American artist who worked in Britain and Europe was the painter par excellence of the wealthy world in the age of Henry James (one of his portrait sitters). Yet he was also au fait with French impressionism and friends with Monet. His subtle, silvery, seductive portraits are not just swaggering; they are disconcertingly truthful, uneasily modern and full of glittering irony. The golden bowl is cracked. From 12 February to 26 May, National Portrait Gallery, London.      Strange visions \u2026 The Old Maids, 1947, by Leonora Carrington Photograph: Estate of Leonora Carrington/DACS London 2014    49) Leonora Carrington This British surrealist who died in 2011 had a spectacularly adventurous life in which she married Max Ernst, fled the Nazis, was institutionalised after a mental breakdown and finally settled in Mexico. This exhibition is a fascinating opportunity to see how her art lives up to her life. From 6 March to 31 May, Tate Liverpool. 50) Bj\u00f6rk The Icelandic experimental pop star gets a full-scale exhibition, organised by puckish curator Klaus Biesenbach. Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s albums, from Debut to Biophilia, are just one part of her accomplishment; she pioneered the coextensivity of art and pop, often through bold collaborations with directors (Michel Gondry), designers (Alexander McQueen) and visual artists (Matthew Barney, her ex). And it would be surprising not to see that swan dress. The museum is promising a new \u201cmusic and film experience\u201d commissioned especially for MoMA. From 7 March to 7 June, Museum of Modern Art, New York.     Subversive \u2026 Alexander McQueen\u2019s creations at the V&amp;A.    51) Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty Was the late fashion designer a great British artist? His surreal imagination and appetite for shock made him the sartorial contemporary of the Young British Art generation. His designs still have the surbversive quality many of them have lost. From 14 March to 19 July, Victoria and Albert Museum, London. 52) Defining Beauty: The Body in Ancient Greek Art Sculptures from the Parthenon in the British Museum collection will be displayed alongside loans from all over the world in what promises to be an unprecedented opportunity to understand one of the great moments in art. Around the start of the 5th century BC, the stiff archaic forms of Greek sculpture escaped their fetters and the dynamism and realism known as the \u201cclassical\u201d style was unleashed. At its heart was a completely new lifelikeness in images of the human body. The Greek body beautiful is the theme of this epic, sexy encounter with some of humanity\u2019s highest achievements. From 26 March to 5 July, British Museum, London.     Under the Wave, off Kanagawa by Katsushika Hokusai, 1823-29. Photograph: Trustees of the British Museum    53) Hokusai Boston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts has the best collection of Japanese art outside Japan \u2013 and the biggest cache anywhere of prints by the first Japanese artist to achieve international fame. Alongside his indelible prints of the Great Wave or Mount Fuji, this huge deal of a show, spanning seven decades of Hokusai\u2019s career and accompanied by two different publications, will present lesser-known pieces such as screen paintings, dioramas and delicate illustrations done on paper lanterns. From 5 April to 9 August, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. 54) Whitney Museum of American Art Just what the world needs: another museum designed by Renzo Piano. Yet for all the grumbling that has accompanied the Whitney\u2019s departure from its beloved Brutalist home in uptown New York, the new building \u2013 beside the Hudson River, at the foot of the packed-to-capacity High Line park \u2013 will offer its curators unprecedented space for exhibitions, as well as a swanky waterfront theatre for performance art. The inaugural exhibition will draw exclusively from the Whitney\u2019s permanent collection; the old Whitney building will be handed off to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who will use it as a satellite location. From 1 May, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. PHOTOGRAPHY     Completing management training at a stock brokerage firm, Ikebukuro, Tokyo 1961, by Shigeichi Nagano. Photograph: Shigeichi Nagano    55) Metamorphosis of Japan After the War Featuring more than 100 black and white images by 11 leading postwar Japanese photographers, this show is divided into three sections: The Aftermath of the War; Between Tradition and Modernity; and Towards a New Japan. Featuring work by Shomei Tomatsu, Ken Domon and Yasuhiro Ishimoto, it traces one of the most dramatic periods of change any society has undergone. From 22 January to 26 April, Open Eye Gallery, Liverpool. 56) Human Rights Human Wrongs Featuring more than 250 prints from the Black Star agency archive and curated by Mark Sealy from Autograph APB, this show explores the role images play in helping to raise awareness about conflict and human rights. It includes images of the civil rights movement in the US, independence movements in Africa, Middle Eastern and south American uprisings, the Vietnam war and key social unrest protests in Europe. From 6 February, the Photographers\u2019 Gallery, London.     Dominic Hawgood\u2019s series Under the Influence.    57) Dominic Hawgood: Under the Influence The first London show for Dominic Hawgood, the young British photographer who recently won the BJP\u2019s international photography award for his ambitious series, Under the Influence. It looks at African evangelical Christian churches in London through a mixture of the staged and the real, using lighting design and CGI as well as film and stills. From 19 February to 7 March, TJ Boulting, London. 58) Taryn Simon and Florence Henri An intriguing double bill that contrasts an overlooked pioneer of European avant-garde photography with a contemporary American artist whose work merges art and documentary. Simon\u2019s best known project is An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar, in which she gained access to secret sites including a nuclear storage facility, a quarantine site and the rooms that hold the CIA\u2019s art collection. From 24 February to 17 May, Jeu de Paume, Paris.     Cantini\u00e8re, 1855: an image by British photography pioneer Roger Fenton, from Salt and Silver at Tate Britain.    59) Salt and Silver A homage to one of the oldest and rarest forms of photography: salted paper prints. Invented by William Henry Fox Talbot in 1839, the technique \u2013 applying household salt to paper before coating it in silver nitrate solution \u2013 created a new, richer and more detailed visual language, transforming still lifes, portraits and landscapes. The few salt prints that survive are seldom seen due to their fragility so this is a rare chance to enjoy them. From 25 February, Tate Britain, London. 60) Format Photofestival, Derby The theme for this year\u2019s Format Festival is Evidence \u2013 how the idea of the photograph as an \u201cevidential document\u201d has changed over the years. The main group exhibition is entitled Beyond Evidence \u2013 An incomplete narrative of photographic truths, and includes new work by Natasha Caruana, Edmund Clark, Mishka Henner and Cristina De Middel. From 13 March to 12 April, various venues, Derby.  61) Revelations: Experiments in Photography Originally planned as Media Space\u2019s opening show in 2013, this ambitious exhibition examines the influence of early scientific photography on modern and contemporary art. It will showcase pioneering examples of scientific photography by the like of William Henry Fox Talbot, Eadweard Muybridge and Harold Edgerton alongside works by contemporary artists including Hiroshi Sugimoto. From 20 March to 13 September, Science Museum Media Space, London.     Intriguing \u2026 the Chinese Photobook. Photograph: London: Archive of Modern Conflict, 2013    62) The Chinese Photobook Curated by Martin Parr and mischievous photographic duo WassinkLundgren, The Chinese Photobook was one of the big crowd-pullers at the 2014 Arles photography festival. A visual history of Chinese culture with highlights that range from the picturesque - Peking the Beautiful (1927) - to the propagandist - Impressions of Chairman Mao: Recent Photographs of the Great Leader of the Chinese People (1945). From 17 April, the Photographers\u2019 Gallery, London. 63) Christopher Williams: The Production Line of Happiness The first British survey show, spanning 35 years, for an American artist whose work subverts the techniques of advertising and challenges the conventions of photographic representation. Williams studied under John Baldesarri in the early 1970s and his work is deeply conceptual, unapologetically cerebral and often wilfully elusive. From 29 April to 21 June, Whitechapel Gallery, London. 64) The Deutsche B\u00f6rse Photography Prize 2015 Another much-debated shortlist for the annual prize for groundbreaking contemporary photography. Vivienne Sassen\u2019s bright geometric images from her Umbra series must make her the people\u2019s favourite, but South African photographer Mikhael Subotzky must be in contention also for his hugely ambitious project, Ponte City, made in the tallest tower-block in Johannesburg. From 17 April to 7 June, Photographers\u2019 Gallery, London. MUSIC     Witty folk-pop from the Decemberists. Photograph: Autumn De Wilde    65) The Decemberists The Oregon-based quintet return in January with their seventh album, What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World, which goes easy on the prog-folk-metal concept pieces and plays to their strengths: witty, involved, literary, semi-acoustic folk pop with intriguing twists and turns. A UK tour follows in February. Rough Trade, January. 66) Queen and Adam Lambert Replacing flamboyant Freddie Mercury with dour Paul Rodgers was a failure, but the former American talent-show contestant has proved to be a better fit for the Queen live show \u2013 a good enough fit that their UK tour has extended to more arena dates. Tour begins in Newcastle on 13 January.            67) Charli XCX Sucker is the follow up to 2013\u2019s True Romance and sees Charli XCX working with Rivers Cuomo and Vampire Weekend\u2019s Rostam Batmanglij on what, from the sounds of Break the Rules and summer smash Boom Clap, promises to be an album of glossy pop with a rebellious streak. Atlantic, January.     Welcome comeback \u2026 Sleater-Kinney.    68) Sleater-Kinney The lauded US punk trio announced their reformation in suitably low-key style, with a 7in single of a new song, stamped with the release date of new album No Cities To Love and slipped into this year\u2019s career retrospective box set, causing a certain kind of music fan to go nuts with anticipation. Sub Pop, January. 69) Adele The non-appearance of Adele\u2019s third album in 2014 was blamed for a fall in label XL\u2019s turnover and profits. Now it\u2019s rumoured to be on course for January 2015: the only solid fact about its contents seems to be that Phil Collins isn\u2019t on it after Adele rejected a song he wrote for her.            70) The Charlatans Their 11th album, Modern Nature \u2013 the first following the death of drummer Jon Brookes \u2013 boasts a soul influence and features guest appearances from New Order\u2019s Stephen Morris and Big Jim Paterson of Dexys, among others. BMG, January. 71) Alt-J The eclectic, Mercury-winning art rockers have graduated to headlining the arenas in the wake of their second No 1 album This Is All Yours, with a show at the O2 Arena in London. 24 January. 72) Bob Dylan Hot on the heels of the 960-page edition of his lyrics \u2013 a signed copy is yours for $5,000 \u2013 comes Shadows in the Night. Released in early February, it\u2019s rumoured to be largely comprised of covers along the lines of the teaser track Full Moon and Empty Arms, most famously performed by Frank Sinatra. Sony/Columbia, February.     Public Service Broadcasting join the space race. Photograph: Iain Duncan    73) Public Service Broadcasting The faux fuddy-duddy duo became an unexpected hit with a debut album that combined drones and samples of old public information films. February\u2019s follow-up is called The Race for Space, suggesting they may have moved continents and decades for source material. But the question remains: how do you develop an aesthetic so definite from its inception? Test Card Recordings, February. 74) Frank Turner The former punk turned perma-gigging folkie has described his forthcoming sixth album as \u201cupbeat\u201d, and also as \u201cstill about the long dark night of the soul\u201d, which certainly makes for a challenging juxtaposition. Said harrowing party album should be with us in February. Xtra Mile. 75) Noel Gallagher and High Flying Birds The joke is irrestistible: have you heard Noel Gallagher\u2019s putting out an album to promote his latest round of interviews? The halcyon days may have passed, but the elder Gallagher remains bullish enough to dismiss the possibility of Oasis reforming for Glastonbury, ploughing on with a new High Flying Birds album, Chasing Yesterday. Sour Mash, March.     Tobias Jesso Jr graduates to bigger rooms.    76) Tobias Jesso Jr This extraordinary young musician is a lo-fi Harry Nilsson \u2013 his first recordings were released on limited-edition flexidisc singles \u2013 creating heartfelt piano ballads that drip with melancholy. Expect the editions to become less limited, the formats less esoteric and his gigs to move from living rooms to big rooms this spring, as Matador release his debut album, Goon. Matador, March. 77) McBusted With their portmanteau novelty value having now faded, the combined forces of McFly and Busted are out to prove that they have legs with a series of UK enormo-dates in March and April. There will be a new album out by that time, too, although we\u2019re not entirely sure who goes to a McBusted gig hoping to hear new material. Tour begins 12 March in Glasgow.     McBusted: no longer just a novelty act.    78) Ludacris It will be five years since we last had an album from Ludacris, and in all that time the best title he could come up with was Ludaversal. Still, the Neptunes are on production duties and the rapper promises that it will be his \u201cmost personal album to date\u201d. Def Jam, March. 79) Simple Minds The past couple of years have seen Simple Minds\u2019 reputation fully restored, as groups old and young hail the groundbreaking chilly experimentalism of their first few albums, and good reviews for their new effort Big Music. So maybe don\u2019t expect them to be concentrating on Don\u2019t You Forget About Me and Alive and Kicking on their jaunt round the UK in March and April. After touring Europe, the UK leg begins in Grimsby on 27 March. 80) Nick Cave The veteran gothic-blues balladeer promised to make a \u201cunique show \u2013 something special and out of the ordinary\u201d for his April and May dates. So it\u2019s being billed as a rare solo world tour, despite the fact he\u2019s taking a band comprising four present or past members of the Bad Seeds. He\u2019s rarely less than compelling, but how unique this will be remains to be seen. Tour begins in Glasgow on 26 April. 81) Public Access TV Polydor are pouring money into this New York-based quartet, which is eyebrow raising, for they sound like nothing so much as a skinny-tied new wave group from 1979. On the plus side, they\u2019ve found a niche no one else has colonised. On the negative side, maybe no one has colonised it because the public aren\u2019t interested. We\u2019ll see as they start raising their profile in early 2015.               Juce. Photograph: Sarah Lee/Guardian    82) Juce Finally, a juice craze that doesn\u2019t involve curly kale. Georgia, Chalin and Cherish make up the buzziest band in London right now, with their smart take on 90s dance and R&amp;B coming with a series of great videos \u2013 and even greater synchronised dance moves, if you\u2019ve got the courage to copy them. 83) Raury Still in his teens, Raury isn\u2019t about to get tied down to any one genre. Or even 100 genres: much of his music defies simple categorisation, and that\u2019s down to his ability to dance in the divides between folk, psychedelia, soul and the left-field hip-hop of his native Atlanta. No wonder Kanye West is a fan. 84) Drake Not an awful lot is known about Drake\u2019s fourth album, Views From the 6, although we do know that \u201cthe 6\u201d in question is the Canadian rapper\u2019s nickname for his native Toronto. Drake says it\u2019s still being written, but the three songs he put online in October \u2013 including a rap-influenced club track and a blissed-out ballad with maudlin lyrics \u2013 suggest it might be business as usual. JAZZ     Wynton Marsalis, right, leads the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. Photograph: Erika Goldring/Getty Images    85) Wynton Marsalis/Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra - Duke, Dizzy, Trane &amp; Mingus: Jazz Titans World-music of the 20th century traced through jazz by Marsalis and his JLCO, via the most eclectic works of Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, John Coltrane and Charles Mingus - including Ellington\u2019s Latin American Suite, Coltrane\u2019s Ole Coltrane and Africa Brass, and Mingus\u2019s Tijuana Moods. From 29-31 January, Rose Theater, Lincoln Center, New York.      Blues roots \u2026 Dr John.    86) Dr John &amp; The Nite Trippers New Orleans star Dr John has lately been paying heartfelt tribute to the most famous New Orleans star of all: Louis Armstrong, who he\u2019s currently celebrating with the music from his Ske-Dat-De-Dat: The Spirit of Satch album. These Frith Street shows are a rare chance to hear this blues-rooted original up close and personal. From 13-14 March, Ronnie Scott\u2019s Jazz Club, London. 87) David Sanborn/John Scofield/Jon Cleary Saxist Sanborn\u2019s soul-power and funkiness have made James Brown and David Bowie his employers over the decades, but he\u2019s always driven a searing jazz spontaneity through the blues licks and grooves. He shares this show with the duo of guitarist John Scofield and pianist/singer Jon Cleary, viewing New Orleans music through a 21st century prism. On 11 April, Barbican, London. CLASSICAL     The space-age interior of the Philharmonie de Paris, designed by Jean Nouvel.    88) Opening of the Philharmonie de Paris  It may have taken decades of planning, vastly over-budget construction, and internecine Parisian arguments, but Paris\u2019s new concert hall, designed by Jean Nouvel, is finally ready to open its doors. The Galas d\u2019ouverture start with the Orchestre de Paris, followed closely by concerts by the Philharmonie\u2019s other resident ensembles, Williams Christie\u2019s baroque specialists Les Arts Florissants, and the new music virtuosos of the Ensemble Intercontemporain. Opens 14 January, Philharmonie de Paris. 89) Iolanta and Bluebeard\u2019s Castle in New York Valery Gergiev\u2019s performances may have become increasingly uneven, but the Russian operatic repertory still brings the best out of him, and Tchaikovsky\u2019s final opera has long been one of his specialities. In this new Met double bill, Iolanta is paired with Bart\u00f3k\u2019s one-act masterpiece, in productions by the Polish director Mariusz Trelinski that promise to be influenced by 1940s film noir. In rep from 26 January to 21 February, Lincoln Center, New York.     Barbara Hannigan premieres two works composed for her.    90) Barbara Hannigan in London and Rome The Canadian soprano is one of the hottest properties in new music today, and two works specially composed for her get their premieres in the first few months of the new year. Hannigan joins Vladimir Jurowski and the London Philharmonic to introduce Magnus Lindberg\u2019s new piece, while it\u2019s Antonio Pappano and the Orchestra of Santa Cecilia in Rome that will partner her for Salvatore Sciarrino\u2019s Orpheus-inspired scena. On 28 January, Royal Festival Hall, London; 28 March, Auditorium Parco della Musica, Rome. 91) Berliner Philharmoniker\u2019s London residency  Simon Rattle brings his Berliners to London for a two-centre showcase; surely the last chance to savour this partnership with such intensity in the UK before Rattle leaves Berlin in 2018. In London, they present a complete Sibelius cycle on three consecutive nights at the Barbican, and Mahler and Lachenmann at the Royal Festival Hall. From 10-15 February, Barbican and Southbank Centre, London.     MusikFabrik play one of Harry Partch\u2019s instrument creations. Photograph: Murdo Macleod/Guardian    92) Harry Partch with MusikFabrik  On tour in Munich, Salzburg and Frankfurt, the German ensemble MusikFabrik present music by the American visionary and musical original Harry Partch: his And on the Seventh Day Petals Fell in Petaluma. It\u2019s music that revels in the unique sounds, sights, and sensualities of Partch\u2019s invented instrumentarium. Musikfabrik have recreated Partch\u2019s astonishing instruments - from the Cloud Chamber Bowls to the Crychord and the Bloboy; don\u2019t miss the chance to hear them live if you can.  On 21 February, Muffathalle, Munich; 6 March, Republic, Salzburg, Austria; 21 March, Alte Oper, Frankfurt. 93) Kurt Weill\u2019s Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny A new production of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht\u2019s opera at Covent Garden from the Royal Opera\u2019s associate director of Opera John Fulljames has a lot at stake: to do justice to the work\u2019s acerbic, lacerating, and irresistible satire, and to signal the success of the company\u2019s current artistic ambitions. Mark Wigglesworth conducts what will be a highly charged show. From 10 March to 4 April, Royal Opera House, London. 94) Parsifal Berlin The glitzy centrepiece of the Berlin Staatsoper\u2019s 2015 Festtage is a new production of Wagner\u2019s B\u00fchnenweihfestspiel, conducted by Daniel Barenboim with Andreas Schager, Anja Kampe and Ren\u00e9 Pape heading the cast and the production entrusted to the utterly unpredictable Dmitri Tcherniakov. From 28 March to 18 April, Schiller Theater, Berlin. FESTIVALS 95) All Ears, Oslo A festival of improvised jazz, noise and other things that sound like something going badly wrong in a cement factory, curated by one of the world\u2019s best drummers, Paal Nilsson-Love. Lasse Marhaug, Okkyung Lee and Spencer Yeh will cleave pure noise from guitar and cello strings, while Sunn O)))\u2019s Stephen O\u2019Malley gets abraded by Steve Noble\u2019s drum flurries. From 9-11 January, various venues, Oslo, Norway.         Milk! by Ben Mallaby, at the London short film festival.    96) London short film festival The eighth year of this fest, taking place at the ICA and Hackney Picturehouse, is the selection box it\u2019s OK to gorge on after Christmas. Tens of short films are screened, grouped under thematic umbrellas like Funny Shit, Teenage Girls Go Crazy!, and Youth of Today. Highlights include the Stephen Mangan-narrated Guinea Pig, and Exchange &amp; Mart, starring Ewen Bremner. From 9-18 January, ICA and Hackney Picturehouse, London. 97) CTM festival, Berlin Brave the scorchingly cold Berlin winter for this equally chilly selection of underground electronic music: the organisers promise \u201cacerbic grindcore hallucinations, psychedelic drone freakouts, numbing consumer-trash beats, and future-punk ecstasies.\u201d Highlights include chaotic Cairo electro from EEK, mournful rap from Suicideyear and Yung Lean, and Evian Christ\u2019s astonishing new A/V show. From 23 January to 1 February, various venues, Berlin, Germany. 98) Bloc Weekend Their last attempt at a festival may have ended in overcrowding and swift cancellation, but Bloc\u2019s return is a staggeringly strong conference of the world\u2019s techno grandmasters. Jeff Mills, Autechre and Ben Klock cater for the austere; Clark, Helena Hauff and Cut Hands for the industrially-minded; Hudson Mohawke, Moodymann and ESG for the funky, plus over 80 more. From 13-15 March, Butlins Resort, Minehead, Somerset. THEATRE     Jake Gyllenhaal and Ruth Wilson star in Constellations in New York    99) Constellations Jake Gyllenhaal makes his Broadway debut as beekeeper Roland alongside Ruth Wilson as quantum physicist Marianne in Nick Payne\u2019s metaphysical love story. A wonderful, giddy two-hander about the infinite possibilities of love and having no time, yet all the time in the world. From 13 January to 15 March, Samuel J Friedman theater, New York. 100) The Hard Problem It\u2019s almost a decade since Tom Stoppard\u2019s last play, Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll. There has been talk of writer\u2019s block. No longer, as Nicholas Hytner directs the world premiere of a piece that examines consciousness, faith, psychology and biology and asks, What is it that makes us really human, and will the mind ever give up its secrets to the MRI scanner and the computer? From 21 January to 16 April, Dorfman, London. 101) Sarah Kane Season Major retrospective of the dark, funny and heartfelt plays of Sarah Kane, with performances of them all, from Blasted to 4:48 Psychosis, the last play she wrote before her death at 28. All the plays plus discussions and talks and a screening of her short film, Skin. Richard Wilson will direct a play that helped change the face of British theatre, Blasted, and Daniel Evans, who appeared in two of Kane\u2019s plays, tackles Phaedra\u2019s Love and Cleansed. From 4 February to 21 March, Sheffield theatres.     Caroline Quentin stars in The Life and Times of Fanny Hill at Bristol Old Vic. Photograph: Amanda Harman    102) The Life and Times of Fanny Hill Since she sprung from the pages of John Cleland\u2019s 1748 novel, Fanny Hill has been a notorious woman. April de Angelis\u2019s new adaptation explores infamy, desire, pleasure and sexual politics in a production in which Caroline Quentin heads up a six-strong ensemble. Pete Flood of folk ensemble Bellowhead provides an original score. From 5 February to 7 March, Bristol Old Vic. 103) Death of a Comedian How much does it cost to be funny? Steve Johnston is a standup who may be about to hit the big time. But can a Faustian bargain ever be a bargain, and does success only come at a price? Following Johnston across four gigs, this co-production between Dublin\u2019s Abbey and London\u2019s Soho theatre is a world premiere from on-a-roll Belfast playwright Owen McCafferty. From 7 February to 1 March, Lyric, Belfast.     Beautiful: The Carole King Musical. Photograph: Joan Marcus/AP    104) Beautiful: the Carole King Musical It wasn\u2019t much loved by the critics, but this jukebox show inspired by the life and music of the writer behind hits such as Take Good Care of My Baby, Locomotion and You\u2019ve Got a Friend has been a real word of mouth hit on Broadway. There\u2019s no reason why it shouldn\u2019t do as well in London, which has taken biomusicals such as Jersey Boys and Sunny Afternoon to its heart. From 10 February, Aldwych, London. 105) The Giants The biggest show ever to hit Australia, Royal de Luxe\u2019s extraordinary outdoor show is the highlight of this year\u2019s Perth festival. It\u2019s a specially tailored Australian version of a performance called Sea Odyssey that was in Liverpool in 2012. With its 30ft puppets, it\u2019s a real crowd-pleaser from the ingenious company whose previous shows include The Sultan\u2019s Elephant, which brought central London to a standstill in 2006 when millions came out on the streets to watch. From 13 February to 7 March, Perth festival.     Ralph Fiennes stars in Man and Superman. Photograph: Juergen Teller    106) Man and Superman How should we live? Radical thinker Jack Tanner is a man who is wrestling with that and other ideas. But soon he finds himself in a debate about independence with both his ward, Ann, and the devil. Ralph Fiennes stars for London\u2019s National Theatre in a revival of Bernard Shaw\u2019s comedy in a production directed by Simon Godwin, a director very much making his mark with classic revivals. From 17 February to 17 May, Lyttelton, London.     Crouch, Touch, Pause, Engage dramatises the story of Welsh rugby star Gareth Thomas.    107) Crouch, Touch, Pause, Engage Welsh rugby legend Gareth Thomas was on the eve of one of the most important games in his career when he was tipped off that a tabloid was going to \u201cout\u201d him as gay. National Theatre Wales and Out of Joint combine forces to tell a story about sport and politics, living lies and being determined to tell the truth in a show that asks why it\u2019s still so hard to be a prominent gay sportsman in 21st-century Britain. From 19 February to 7 March, Sherman, Cardiff.     Juliette Binoche stars in Antigone.    108) Antigone Love, duty and principled rebellion are at the core of Sophocles\u2019 great tragedy. Juliette Binoche returns to the London stage to play the sister who defies her uncle Kreon, the king, in order to bury the body of her slaughtered brother who has been declared a traitor against the state. Europe\u2019s hottest director, Ivo van Hove, is at the helm with TS Eliot prize-winning poet Anne Carson providing a new translation.  From 4-28 March, Barbican, London. 109) Skylight Bill Nighy and Carey Mulligan reprise their roles as successful businessman Tom and committed teacher Kyra who had an affair and meet again a year after Tom\u2019s wife\u2019s death. But it\u2019s less a meeting of minds than a clash of values and ideologies in Stephen Daldry\u2019s nuanced revival of David Hare\u2019s drama. From 16 March to 21 June, John Golden theatre, New York. 110) Wolf Hall, Parts One and Two It\u2019s been described as the \u201cmother of all costume dramas\u201d, and Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies, charting the life and times of Henry VIII\u2019s adviser Thomas Cromwell, is certainly epic theatre in Jeremy Herrin\u2019s Royal Shakespeare Company production. If Broadway audiences are up for the intricacies of Tudor politics, this is entertaining, old-fashioned narrative theatre. From 20 March to 5 July, Winter Garden theatre, New York.     Antony Sher.    111) Death of a Salesman How\u2019s this for great casting? Antony Sher plays Willy Loman who finds that life doesn\u2019t measure up to his dreams and Harriet Walter is his hard-pressed loyal wife, Linda. Add to that Alex Hassell (who recently played Prince Hal to Sher\u2019s Falstaff in Henry 1V) and Gregory Doran\u2019s revival of Arthur Miller\u2019s great play looks as if it could be a dream come true for the RSC. From 26 March to 2 May, Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. 112) Sweeney Todd Emma Thompson may be playing Mrs Lovett, who claims to make the worst and then the best pies in London. But will the English National Opera\u2019s production of Sondheim\u2019s dark, brooding musical melodrama be the best, particularly when London has seen so many good chamber versions in recent years? Still, with Bryn Terfel as Sweeney and Philip Quast as Judge Turpin, this should be a tasty treat. From 30 March to 12 April, London Coliseum. 113) The Audience We can\u2019t get enough of either Kristin Scott Thomas (recently seen as Electra) or Peter Morgan\u2019s play about a series of meetings between the monarch and her PMs between 1952 and the Diamond Jubilee in 2012. Scott Thomas will be claiming the crown in this new version of the play \u2013 possibly including a meeting with Tony Blair \u2013 which is also opening on Broadway this season with Helen Mirren reprising her role as HM. From 21 April to 25 July, Apollo theatre, London. DANCE     Richard Alston Dance Company meet hip-hop choreographer Ajani Johnson-Goffe at Sadler\u2019s Wells. Photograph: Chris Nash    114) Richard Alston Dance Company For 45 years Richard Alston has been working his own pure seam of dance making: but for his latest work, Nomadic, he heads off on a startling tangent collaborating with Ajani Johnson-Goffe, the UK hip-hop dancer and choreographer. It\u2019s a dialogue of contemporary and street dance, experience and youth and is set to music by the urban Gypsy band, the Shukar Collective. Live music is key to this special performance \u2013 which celebrates the 20th anniversary of Alston\u2019s own company and includes his setting of the Britten score Rejoice in the Lamb and Martin Lawrance\u2019s Madcap, whose Julia Wolfe score is played by the new music ensemble Icebreaker. From 26-27 January, Sadler\u2019s Wells, London. 115) The Associates  This promises to be a cracking triple bill, bringing together three of Sadler\u2019s Wells\u2019s impressive army of associate choreographers. Crystal Pite\u2019s A Picture of You Falling deploys her talent for poetic image making in a tug of war of atavistic emotional patterns; Hofesh Shechter\u2019s The Barbarians in Love finds passion within the mathematical precision of its baroque inspired score; and completing the programme is Smile, a new collaboration between Kate Prince and Tommy Franz\u00e9n, which explores the man behind the comic mask of Charlie Chaplin. From 5-8 February, Sadler\u2019s Wells, London. 116) Romeo and Juliet: Northern Ballet Jean-Christophe Maillot is one of the busiest choreographers in Europe, best known for his sharp, distinctive take on familiar classics, like his new Taming of the Shrew for the Bolshoi Ballet. No British company has performed his work and it\u2019s a coup for Northern Ballet to have acquired his version of Romeo and Juliet which focuses more on the complex adolescent intensities of the two lovers, than on the political feuding of their families. From 26-28 February, Edinburgh festival theatre; 4-12 March, Grand Theatre, Leeds. 117) Sleeping Beauty: American Ballet Theatre Alexei Ratmansky, a choreographer with one of the liveliest and best informed takes in ballet history, creates his first production of The Sleeping Beauty. Based on the original Petipa choreography, its designs are inspired by the gorgeous (if ruinously expensive) production that L\u00e9on Bakst created for Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes in 1921. From 3-8 March, Segerstrom Center for the Arts, Costa Mesa, California; 29 May to 13 June, Metropolitan Opera, New York.     Sydney Dance Company\u2019s Frame of Mind.    118) Frame of Mind: Sydney Dance Company Under Rafael Bonachela\u2019s direction, SDC have acquired a new international gravitas, marked this season by their performance of William Forsythe\u2019s searing masterpiece Quintett. It\u2019s the first ever showing of this work in Australia, and it\u2019s programmed with Frame of Mind, a new piece by Bonachela himself that explores parallel themes of beauty, transience and loss, set to music by Bryce Dessner (guitarist with US indie band the National) in a recording by the Kronos Quartet. From 6-21 March, Sydney theatre, New South Wales, then touring.  119) Bayad\u00e8re \u2013 The Ninth Life: Shobana Jeyasingh In 1877 Marius Petipa choreographed his Indian-themed ballet La Bayad\u00e8re as pure exotic fantasy. Now in a thrilling act of reclamation, Mumbai-born choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh reimagines that fantasy in her own terms, exploring the roots of the original story that was used by Petipa alongside the experiences of real Indian dancers when they first performed in Europe in the 19th century. Preview 18 March, Mac, Birmingham; then 25-28 March, Linbury Studio Theatre, London, and touring. 120) FLEXN Director Peter Sellars is all about the flex dancing. Having entranced opera audiences with his recent casting of the Brooklyn dancer Banks in The Gospel According to the Other Mary, Sellars is due to premiere an entire flex production at New York\u2019s Park Avenue Armory. Created with Reggie \u201cRegg Roc\u201d Gray , a pioneer of this extreme, rhythmic and highly expressive form of street dance FLEXN is a mediation on the US juvenile justice system, with an ensemble of 18 dancers images by photographer Richard Ross, and live music from DJ Epic. From 25 March to 4 April, Park Avenue Armory, New York. 121) Triple bill: Royal Ballet Ballet companies are busy fishing in the deep pool of contemporary dance, and this season London\u2019s Royal Ballet has commissioned Hofesh Shechter to create a new work that tests their dancers with his dark, visceral and gravity-bound style. The new Shechter is programmed alongside George Balanchine\u2019s The Four Temperaments - nearly 60 years old, but still one of the most modern ballets on the stage \u2013 and with Kenneth MacMillan\u2019s moving, monumental setting of Mahler\u2019s Song of the Earth. From 27 March to 14 April, Royal Opera House, London.     Unusual moves from Russian ballerina Diana Vishneva. Photograph: Maxime Ruiz    122) Diana Vishneva: On the Edge The great Russian ballerina has long displayed a curiosity about the world outside the classical repertory and in this programme of specially composed works she tests her range against two very different European choreographers. Jean-Christophe Maillot\u2019s Switch is a trio set to the film music of Danny Eifman, performed with Bernice Coppieters and Ga\u00ebtan Morlotti. Carolyn Carlson\u2019s solo Woman in a Room is a meditation on a life\u2019s journey, inspired by the intense inwardness of Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s cinema and set to music by Italian minimalist Giovanni Sollima. On 14/16/18 April, Coliseum, London. 123) Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch Since Pina Bausch\u2019s death in 2009, her company have been replenishing the repertory with little known works from her early career. This season they stage two productions never before seen in the UK. Auf dem Gebirge hat man ein Geschrei geh\u00f6rt (On the Mountain a Cry Was Heard) was created in 1984, and while recalling Bausch\u2019s earlier Rite of Spring in its earth-covered stage, it features a more emolliently eclectic range of music (Billie Holiday, Edith Piaf and Henry Purcell) in its accompanying score. This is followed by the 1987 production Ahnen, in which the dancers\u2019 search for love and meaning is framed by a stageful of enormous cacti. Classic Bausch. From 15-18 April and 23-26 April, Sadler\u2019s Wells, London. COMEDY     Josie Long looks at affairs of the heart, Count Arthur Strong is still cantankerous, and Billy Connolly heads to Australia.    124) Josie Long One of the hit shows of the 2014 Edinburgh fringe, Josie Long\u2019s latest outing focuses for the first time on family life and affairs of the heart. All that\u2019s best about Long \u2013 her excitability, her politics, her overbrimming imagination \u2013 is prominent in this account of heartbreak and hope on the precipice of middle age.From 19-31 January, Soho theatre, London, then touring. 125) SF Sketchfest One of America\u2019s best-loved comedy festivals returns this spring, for the 14th year running, with a yet-to-be-announced lineup likely to include the brightest stars in US comedy. Last year\u2019s jamboree featured Eugene Mirman, Kurt Braunohler, Amy Schumer and Jack Black, among many others. From 22 January to 8 February, various venues, San Francisco, California. 126) Billy Connolly The indefatigable Billy Connolly follows up his recent tour of Scotland with a 12-date tour of Australia, in cheerful defiance of his Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 not to mention his recent recovery from surgery for prostate cancer. The Scottish shows revealed the Big Yin\u2019s comic powers to be scarcely diminished: Australia has a treat in store. From 27 January, Deakin\u2019s Costa Hall, Geelong, Victoria, then touring.      Kim Noble.    127) Kim Noble Not strictly comedy - not strictly anything - the performance artist and former 50% of Noble + Silver brings his troubling, tender show to London\u2019s Soho after an Edinburgh fringe debut. Bulldozing its way through ethics, good taste and other people\u2019s privacy, You\u2019re Not Alone dramatises Noble\u2019s search for connection in a lonely world. From 3 February to 7 March, Soho Theatre, London.  128) Count Arthur Strong Opinion was divided over the merits of Count Arthur Strong\u2019s BBC sitcom, of which a new series is in the pipeline. But there\u2019s no denying the character\u2019s clout, or the brilliance of Steve Delaney\u2019s performance, when the cantankerous old thesp takes to the stage. His new tour, Somebody Up There Licks Me, starts in February. From 5 February, Norwich Playhouse, then touring.  129) Dylan Moran Since he last brought a new show to the British Isles, the wine-bibbing Irishman and Black Books star has toured to Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia and Ukraine. This spring, his new set, Off the Hook, finds the shambling, lyrical ex-Perrier champ playing 54 dates, including London\u2019s Hammersmith Apollo and the Mareel arts centre in Lerwick, Shetland.From 4 March, Caird Hall, Dundee, then touring.  130) SXSW Comedy \u201cThe ever-expanding mash-up of music, culture, technology and buzz,\u201d says the New York Times, which is Austin\u2019s South by Southwest festival, is also a highlight on the US comedy calendar. Last year\u2019s acts included Todd Barry, Upright Citizens Brigade and a pre-scandal Bill Cosby. An announcement on the 2015 lineup is due soon. From 14-21 March, various venues, Austin, Texas.  TV     Epic dramas: Nikesh Patel in Indian Summers, Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l in Fortitude, Aiden Turner in Poldark.    131) Indian Summers Most known for contemporary drama, Channel 4 goes period in a big way with what has the feel of a latter-day companion piece to a 1984 British TV classic: Granada\u2019s The Jewel in the Crown. This new drama about the British occupation of India, starting in Poona in 1932, has a cast that includes both superstars (Julie Walters) and newcomers (Ash Nair). Unusually in these TV times, it\u2019s a 10-parter, but producer Charles Pattinson has impressive long-form legs from Our Friends in the North. Channel 4. 132) Poldark Even more of a retro-drama \u2013 a remake of a BBC1 hit that ran from 1975-77 \u2013 is this adaptation of Winston Graham\u2019s sequence of novels that starts with the return of Ross Poldark, a soldier who has been fighting in the American wars of independence, to his Cornish home. He discovers his fiancee is about to marry a rival \u2013 always a good spring for fiction \u2013 and begins his fightback by becoming a tin-mine tycoon. All TV dramas these days are expected to have long-haul potential, and there are 12 Poldark novels to mine if they want them. BBC1.            133) Broadchurch Rock bands concerned about \u201cdifficult second-album syndrome\u201d have nothing to worry about in comparison with the difficult second series of a super-smash-hit TV crime drama that seemed to have reached a natural conclusion at the end of the first run. The most tempting narrative for commentators will be that season two fails to live up to its remarkable first year. But it will be fascinating to see what writer Chris Chibnall gives returning leads David Tennant and Olivia Colman to do. Teaser previews \u2013 with the slogan: The end is where it begins \u2013 suggest some kind of continuing plot, although may alternatively refer to a geographical setting such as Land\u2019s End. ITV. 134) Stonemouth  The multitalented novelist Iain Banks (1954-2013) is still mourned by his readers, but they get some consolation in this much-anticipated BBC Scotland adaptation of Stonemouth, his penultimate non-sci-fi novel. It begins with a homecoming: Stewart Gilmour (Christian Cooke) is lured back by a family funeral to the Scottish village he left after a sex scandal. A story with a backdrop of gang wars has drawn a cast including one of the UK\u2019s most magnetic screen actors, Peter Mullan. BBC1 Scotland/BBC2. 135) Better Call Saul  Fans of Breaking Bad await Better Call Saul with excitement and dread. First mooted as a half-hour comedy starring Bob Odenkirk as slippery lawyer Saul Goodman, the show has since transformed into a more familiar hour-long drama. We assume it\u2019ll trace Goodman\u2019s gradual corruption. We\u2019ve heard the country song written about him. And we really hope it won\u2019t be another Joey. Netflix.            136) Fortitude  Stanley Tucci. Christopher Eccleston. Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l. Michael Gambon. You\u2019d watch Fortitude for the cast alone, but the fact that it\u2019s a hard-hitting Scandi-esque crime drama written by the creator of Low Winter Sun doesn\u2019t hurt either. Very few upcoming shows can match Fortitude for sheer potential. Sky Atlantic. 137) Mad Men Although it\u2019s no longer the best show on television \u2013 it\u2019s not even the best show on its US network \u2013 the last series of Mad Men hit enough transcendental flourishes to assure viewers that it would go out with a bang next year. Don\u2019s redemption. Peggy\u2019s rise. Pete\u2019s hairline. This is going to be unmissable. Sky Atlantic. 138) Cucumber, Banana and Tofu Perhaps the most ambitious thing that Channel 4 has ever attempted. Cucumber, a series about modern gay life, marks Russell T Davies\u2019s return to adult drama. Banana is E4\u2019s companion piece, riffing on Cucumber\u2019s themes. Tofu is a series of online documentaries on the same subject. If it can avoid the stench of corporate synergy, this could be very good indeed. Channel 4            139) Togetherness  Indie circuit favourites the Duplass brothers (Transparent, Safety Not Guaranteed and Jeff, Who Lives at Home) have created their first series, a \u201ctragically comic\u201d eight-parter for HBO. Set on the fringes of Los Angeles, it follows unhappy couple Brett and Michelle, played by Mark Duplass and Melanie Lynskey, whose life becomes more dysfunctional when Brett\u2019s friend (Steve Zissiz) and Michelle\u2019s sister (Amanda Peet) move in with them. Sky Atlantic.  140) Bloodline  Though it\u2019s heavily trailing historical drama Marco Polo, Bloodline looks as if it will be the next original Netflix commission to make a splash. Friday Night Lights\u2019 Kyle Chandler stars with Sissy Spacek and Sam Shepard in the Florida Keys-set drama, which promises a noirish exploration of family secrets following the return of a black-sheep son. Netflix  BOOKS 141) The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload by Daniel J Levitin Turning to non-fiction, in the book we\u2019ll all be needing as we grapple with our Christmas haul of novelty gadgets, the neuroscientist uses the latest brain science to demonstrate why some people are better than others at handling the unprecedented deluge of data in the modern world, and explaining how even the klutziest of us can follow their example. Published by Viking, January \u2013 all dates UK only.      142) A Spool of Blue Thread by Anne Tyler The Pulitzer prize-winning author and peerless observer of domestic life returns with a novel spanning three generations of the Whitshank family, from the sunny afternoon in 1959 when Abby and Red fell in love, to the day their their children and grandchildren gather to decide how to look after them in their old age. Chatto &amp; Windus, February. 143) How Good We Can Be \u2026 by Will Hutton Twenty years after his politically influential The State We\u2019re in, Hutton returns to investigate the state of the nation and finds it in worse health than he could have predicted. He analyses the challenges posed by growing inequality and shrinking opportunity in an attempt to come up with a formula for making things better. Little, Brown, February.      144) Girls Will Be Girls by Emer O\u2019Toole  The blogger and columnist, who is emerging as one of the leading lights of the new feminism, uses anecdotes from her own life \u2013 from \u201ccross-dressing to pube-growing and full-body waxing\u201d \u2013 to illuminate some of the the dos and don\u2019ts for women trying to set themself free from gender stereotypes. Orion, February. 145) Accidence Will Happen: The Non-Pedantic Guide to English Usage by Oliver Kamm  In a refreshing counterblast to the sticklers who have taken over the grammar debate, this self-professed \u201creformed pedant\u201d celebrates the elasticity of the English language and demonstrates how, far from spoiling literature, improper usage has enriched it over the centuries. Weidenfeld, February.      146) Second Life by SJ Watson  A second psychological thriller from the author of Before I Go to Sleep, which was the slow-burning hit of 2011. Again Watson centres on a female protagonist, this time a mother living two lives \u2013 one of domestic contentment as herself, the other surfing on a dangerous obsession as she impersonates her murdered sister. Transworld, February. 147) The Buried Giant by Kazuo Ishiguro In the wilderness years after the death of King Arthur, an elderly husband and wife set off for their son\u2019s village across a land riven with suspicion and tribal feuding. Along the way they encounter monsters, ogres, corrupt monks and an elderly knight still pursuing the Arthurian dream through the ruins of civilisation. Faber, March.      148) Dancing in the Dark: My Struggle Book 4, by Karl Ove Knausgaard The man hailed as \u201cNorway\u2019s Proust\u201d continues his fictionalised autopsy of his own life with a look at his teenage self. In book 4, translated by Don Bartlett, he takes refuge from a dysfunctional family in a remote fisherman\u2019s cottage, looks back on his conquests and failures, and discovers that early acclaim doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a stable writing career. Harvill Secker, March. 149) Landmarks by Robert Macfarlane The award-winning nature writer uses his decade of travels from the northern tip of Scotland to the southern toe of Cornwall as a springboard for an exploration of the relationship between landscape and language, exploring the literature of place and revealing the \u201cword hoard\u201d he has accumulated along the way. Hamish Hamilton, March. 150) The Wolf Border by Sarah Hall  Since her striking 2002 debut Haweswater, Hall has got better with each of her four novels and last year carried off the BBC short story award. Her latest novel, set against a background of Scottish independence, land reform and power struggles, investigates the nature of wilderness and wildness, both animal and human. Faber, April.

For much of that period, members of the Murai family, who live in Ishikawa prefecture on the Japan Sea coast, thought they were maintaining the last resting place of a man named Philip Ward. In fact, the grave belongs to Bernard George Littlewood, who came to Japan to teach English in 1870, just as the country was beginning to modernise.  Littlewood taught English at a school in what is now the city of Kaga, but died of smallpox the following year, aged just 30, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Local officials erected a tombstone for Littlewood at a Buddhist temple, but months later, when feudal domains were replaced with prefectures, no one was given responsibility for its upkeep. The Murai family, who lived nearby, decided to clean and weed the area themselves, a routine they continued throughout the second world war. Years later, the family received a letter from the British embassy thanking them for tending what was believed to be Ward\u2019s grave. It was not until Susumu Koyata, a volunteer who promotes international exchange in the city, researched the grave\u2019s history that its occupant\u2019s true identity emerged. Koyata attributed the confusion to the tombstone\u2019s engraving, which was etched in Kanji characters, making it difficult to pronounce. Earlier this month, Kumiko Murai received a second letter of thanks from the British embassy thanking her for her family\u2019s modest tribute to a forgotten expatriate. Murai, 81, told the Asahi she had been \u201cspeechless\u201d when the letter arrived from the current UK ambassador to Tokyo, Timothy Hitchens, who thanked her family for their kindness and for contributing to friendly ties between Japan and Britain. The job was not without controversy, however. Murai recalled her father-in-law saying that the family had had a \u201chard time\u201d during the war due to their insistence on maintaining the grave of a citizen of Japan\u2019s then enemy. Her 58-year-old son, Yasushi, will carry on the family tradition, she told the paper."}, {"sentences": ["Not so Zaha Hadid, who, after facing calls for her Tokyo Olympic stadium to be scrapped \u2013 following a petition of 32,000 signatures and an open letter of opposition from a host of eminent Japanese architects \u2013 simply accused the locals of jealousy."], "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture", "Design", "Zaha Hadid", "Frank Gehry", "Norman Foster", "Regeneration", "Communities", "Society", "Heritage", "Housing", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-31T12:00:02Z", "title": "New year's resolutions for architects in 2015", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/dec/31/new-years-resolution-architects-2015-smart-cities-poor-doors", "article": "Listen to the locals If nearly every venerable architect in the host country slams your proposed design for a building as a \u201cmonumental mistake\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace to future generations\u201d, it\u2019s probably a good idea to reconsider.

Forget facets     Shardenfreude \u2026 62 Buckingham Gate in Victoria, London, by Pelli Clarke Pelli architects. Photograph: Land Securities    Since the Shard broke on to the London skyline as a dazzling crystal spear, many have been the lesser buildings that have tried to emulate its fractured facets with the odd bit of wonky glass hung askew. The city is now littered with crumpled glazing and angular floor-plates terminating in useless acute angles. These are not \u201curban jewels\u201d, nor do they \u201creflect a vision of a multi-faceted world\u201d. They\u2019re ugly hulks with shoddy details \u2013 those ambitious multi-angled joints usually bodged with a splurge of mastic \u2013 and the result just looks like something went wrong with a Sketch-Up computer model, the whole thing triangulated to oblivion. If in doubt, keep it orthogonal in 2015. Say no to facadectomies     Death mask \u2026 Lilian Knowles House in Spitalfields, London. Photograph: Oliver Wainwright    Here\u2019s an idea for a makeover. Why not flay the skin off a supermodel and stretch it over your own body? You might have difficulty seeing, given that your eye-holes probably won\u2019t match up, and you might not be able to breathe through that misplaced mouth, but no matter. You\u2019ll look great. And you can apply the same idea to your buildings. The six-storey 300-room student accommodation block you\u2019re planning might not fit behind that nice four-storey Victorian brick frontage, but what the hell. You can squeeze it in. They\u2019re only students. They won\u2019t realise that their windows look out on to a blank brick wall and that they can\u2019t fully open their front door. And the conservation officer will give you extra Brownie points for retaining a beloved heritage asset. Win win. Make entrances equal     Left, the luxury lobby of One Commercial Street in Aldgate, marketed to wealthy City workers. Right, the side-alley entrance reserved for affordable housing tenants. Photograph: Photographs: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    Time was when the lord of the manor went in through the front door and his lesser servant-serfs went in round the back. But the chances are that the apartment block you\u2019re designing isn\u2019t the new set of Downton Abbey, so there\u2019s really no excuse for specifying a \u201cpoor door\u201d. If your housing association client insists on the affordable housing units having a separate entrance for maintenance reasons, then at least design it on equal terms as the market-rate housing and don\u2019t hide it down a service alley next to the bins. Design dumb cities     Do smart cities make dumb citizens? Photograph: Mmdi/Getty    The all-seeing mod-cons of our \u201csmart cities\u201d have revolutionised urban management and streamlined the provision of municipal services, filling our streets with brave battalions of crime-fighting lampposts and fleets of eavesdropping dustbins. But does the smart city really empower the citizen to be any more than a passive consumer of services and generator of data, to be harvested and redeployed in the name of urban efficiency? And when the mechanics of urban governance may be subcontracted to Siemens and Cisco, what happens to the principle of democratic accountability? It simply goes the same way as the outsourced \u201ceasyCouncil\u201d in Barnet \u2013 where no matter who the locals vote for in the next elections, they will get Capita. So keep your cities lo-fi in 2015. Don\u2019t design with Lego     This is what happens when architects design with Lego. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris for the Guardian    The Danish click-together brick has long been hailed as a source of inspiration for budding architects, providing children with the means to develop their megalomaniacal tendencies and construct miniature universes on the sitting room floor. But Lego is a cunning brand, and has recently sought to monetise the increasingly the lucrative Afol (adult fans of Lego) market, with the launch of the Lego Architecture Studio, an expensive set of all-white bricks aimed at architect grownups. It might be a fun desk toy, but it is not a design tool \u2013 and it will only serve to continue the wretched trend of clunky \u201cpixelated\u201d buildings propagated by certain Dutch practices and their cutester offspring. Build better towers     From left: the Helix by Make, the Quill by Sparrc; the Odalisk by CZWG. Photograph: PR    London\u2019s recent spate of high-rise buildings has prompted a vociferous anti-tower backlash, seeing the Observer and the Architect\u2019s Journal launch a skyline campaign to protect the city\u2019s precious silhouette. Truth is, skylines are not to be preserved in aspic, nor is London\u2019s horizon a particularly magnificent example: the hallowed dome of St Paul\u2019s has long been crowded out by a motley collection of lumps and stumps. The truly alarming thing is just how bad the current clutch of high-rise design proposals is, each trying harder than the next to outshine its neighbours with ever more elaborate peaks and kaleidoscopic cladding treatments, with no idea how to meet the ground or create a meaningful urban street. 2015 will only see more towers, so make sure they make elegant and intelligent contributions to the city. Defend the meaning of public space     The square beneath Richard Rogers\u2019 Leadenhall Building, AKA the Cheesegrater tower, is managed by Broadgate Estates, the company that evicted protesters from Paternoster Square. Photograph: Sonja Horsman    What could be a better symbol of civic life than a nice public space? In planning terms, it is held up a de facto good, the ameliorating salve between the closed footprints of private development. Yet, increasingly, it is no such thing. It is more often an extension of the private realm \u2013 an office lobby without walls, a mall atrium without a roof \u2013 owned by a private developer and managed solely in their interests. Even publicly-owned urban space is now mostly controlled by private agencies: the relentless growth of business improvement districts (BIDs) sees public funds from Section 106 agreements syphoned off and spent by the unaccountable boards of local businesses. If trees and benches prevent the flow of people into the shops and encourage anti-social loitering then, in the eyes of the BID, it\u2019s better not to have them. Reclaim the idea of truly civic space in 2015. More gardens and bridges \u2026 but not a garden bridge     The garden bridge \u2026 \u2018neither a garden nor a bridge\u2019. Photograph: Arup/EPA    What\u2019s not to like about a garden on a bridge?

Well, there\u2019s the fact that it is another private-public space, that it is being built with \u00a360m of public money; that it will be inaccessible to unregistered groups, cyclists and closed at night. Or that long-cherished views will be blocked; that there will be unbearable crowds along the South Bank at peak times; or that the planning permission has been questioned by the barristers of Middle Temple. Or perhaps that we might be paying for the upkeep of this private attraction for years to come.

The New Year celebrations had barely ended when it became embroiled in a bizarre row with China over the toxic legacy of its wartime conduct in mainland Asia. The 26 December 2013 visit by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to Yasukuni \u2013 a Shinto shrine in Tokyo that honours the country\u2019s war-dead, including 14 class A war criminals \u2013 prompted China\u2019s ambassador to the UK to use the pages of the Daily Telegraph to charge its former enemy with revisiting its militaristic past like a \u201chaunting Voldemort\u201d. The Harry Potter symbolism continued days later when his Japanese counterpart accused China of using coercion to push its claims to the Senkaku, a chain of uninhabited islets in the East China Sea (known as the Diaoyu in Chinese) at the centre of a bilateral territorial dispute. China, he said, could either observe the rule of law or \u201cplay the role of Voldemort in the region by letting loose the evil of an arms race and escalation of tensions\u201d. With some observers predicting a conflict that could easily draw in Japan\u2019s main ally, the US, Tokyo and Beijing ended the year on marginally better terms when Abe held brief talks for the first time with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the Apec summit in November. Xi\u2019s grimace as the leaders shook hands suggested, however, that tension over the Senkaku will continue to cast a shadow in 2015. At home, Abe celebrated early successes in his quest to revive the world\u2019s third-biggest economy \u2013 a weaker yen brought relief to exporters and share prices soared \u2013 only for Japan\u2019s notoriously cautious consumers to refuse to stay on-message. A controversial rise in the sales tax in April that Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic party had agreed to while in opposition battered consumer spending and, by November, sent the economy back into recession for the first time since 2012. Abe promptly postponed a second planned rise in the sales tax until 2017, and called a snap early election, in which he won a comfortable majority. While Abe described the election as a referendum on his decision to focus on growth rather than Japan\u2019s huge public debt and rising welfare costs, others spied an attempt to secure four more years in office before even more bad economic news filters through. Early in 2015 Abe is expected to give the final go-ahead for the restart of two nuclear reactors in the country\u2019s south-west, despite opinion polls showing that most voters, still traumatised by the March 2011 Fukushima accident, are opposed. He is likely to court controversy again later in the year with plans to re-interpret Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution to allow troops to fight alongside allies overseas for the first time since 1945. Having abandoned outright revision of the US-authored constitution, Abe insists that there is room for legislation that would lift the country\u2019s self-imposed ban on collective self-defence, or coming to the aid of an ally under attack. A more robust military posture, coupled with a significant rise in defence spending, fuelled concerns that Japan has embarked on an unstoppable lurch to the right. Geopolitics aside, there was plenty else to exercise the country\u2019s embattled liberals. This month saw the enactment of a state secrets act that its supporters say will enable Japan to safely share intelligence with the US amid rising regional tensions. Under the new law, public officials and private citizens who leak \u201cspecial state secrets\u201d face prison terms of up to 10 years, while journalists who seek to obtain the classified information could be jailed for up to five years. Critics say the law will be abused to prevent disclosure of potentially embarrassing information, including any hiccups in the decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The release, in March, of Iwao Hakamada, who spent 45 years on death row for a crime he did not commit, was a reminder that Japan is one of a shrinking number of countries that enthusiastically impose the death penalty. Japan is set to defy international opinion on another contentious practice: the slaughter of whales in the Antarctic. Months after the international court of justice in the Hague halted its \u201cscientific\u201d whaling programme, Japan has unveiled a revised programme that could see its whaling fleet return to the Southern Ocean in pursuit of minke whales as early as the end of 2015. The coming 12 months are likely to be marred by continued tensions between Japan and its neighbours. Abe has still not held a summit with the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, amid a row over Japan\u2019s use of tens of thousands of mainly Korean sex slaves before and during the second world war. Abe has stopped short of revising an official apology issued in 1993, but he and his conservative allies in politics, the media and academia deny there is any evidence that the women were coerced by Japanese imperial forces. Relations between Tokyo and Washington will be complicated by the fraught relocation of a US marine air base in the centre of a densely populated city in Okinawa to a more remote location on the island\u2019s unspoiled north-east coast. The relocation was thrown into doubt in November when voters in Okinawa elected a new governor who has vowed to block the move. Abe is expected to issue a \u201cforward-looking\u201d statement next August to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war. Depending on how he addresses Japan\u2019s conduct on the Asian mainland in the first half of the 20th century, the statement could either herald an era of regional detente or send relations with Beijing and Seoul back into the diplomatic deep freeze."}], "docs": 586}
