And it was, dramatically, the real thing: a tautly directed cracker. Plays within plays are hard to pull off on radio, where you only have voices to guide you to who&apos;s who, and Stoppard&apos;s includes an extra trick, filling it full of characters not quite telling the truth, especially to themselves. Harriet Walter as Charlotte, starring in her husband&apos;s play about adultery, was especially impressive in the clashes in the play-within-the-play with her co-star, Max, played by Roger Allam. Max finds Charlotte&apos;s passport at their house, and so realises she isn&apos;t abroad on a business trip. He had found it at home once before, when she claimed to be in Amsterdam. &quot;I must say, I take my hat off to you, coming home with Rembrandt placemats for your mother,&quot; he says, spitting each word out. &quot;It&apos;s those touches that lift adultery out of the moral arena and make it a matter of style.&quot;", "sentences": ["He had found it at home once before, when she claimed to be in Amsterdam."], "title": "Radio by Elisabeth Mahoney", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/01/tvandradio.radio1", "tags": ["Radio industry", "Media", "Radio", "Culture", "Television & radio"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-01-03T15:44:57Z", "article": "They&apos;re out and proud, are you?... Harry Potter fans in Amsterdam. Photograph: Marco Okhuizen/AFP/Getty Do you have a guilty read? According to a new survey, 85% of us have an author we greedily enjoy in private, but whom we&apos;re far less willing to praise in public. Stephen King emerged as the number one illicit pleasure, with scores of us apparently scuttling home to break open Carrie under cover of darkness. But King was joined on the list by romance novelists and fantasists, by political novelists and children&apos;s authors. So what exactly makes a guilty read?  Of all the guilt-inducing genres, the thriller appeared to come top. Red-faced readers not only whispered the name of King, but also put Dan Brown and John Grisham in joint third place. We can&apos;t seem to resist the page-turning power of these writers, nor their willingness to get their characters&apos; hands dirty. For me, King of the Thrillers has to be Ian Rankin, whose Rebus novels I finish and discard in a huff, before guiltily and rapidly ordering another. While some get their guilty kicks from dismemberment, others take it in the commingling of souls. Barbara Cartland, surprisingly, placed nowhere, but Catherine Cookson and Danielle Steel split fourth place between them. And although she didn&apos;t make the list, Jilly Cooper&apos;s unique brand of sexual horseplay features in many of my acquaintances&apos; private libraries. As with other secretly hoarded authors, readers occasionally claim that Cooper actually possesses more than meets the eye; as one friend told me recently, &quot;Jilly Cooper is really like Thomas Hardy.&quot; Sandwiched between King and Brown-Grisham in second place was JK Rowling, whose Potter books are the undisputed champions of the third most popular escape genre, the fantasy. Despite their length, sequences such as The Lord of the Rings felt like mere commercial warm-ups for Potter, whose all-conquering adventures have reintroduced hundreds of thousands to guilty reading. The publishers even acknowledged the issue by releasing editions of the books with grown-up covers, to tempt readers who are unhappy with Harry&apos;s eager cartoon face staring out from their public read. This feels like cheating in some way, though no one can deny the canniness - or the success - of the move. While Harry skips along the shifting boundary between children&apos;s and adult fiction, many of the most popular guilty reads are out and out children&apos;s books. Tintin crops up frequently, as does Asterix (they&apos;re just so beautifully produced), and one person I questioned confessed to tiptoeing back to Enid Blyton after a bad day. These books are the reverse of page-turners, and are there to be lingered over. Memories spill back along with the moles, Roman soldiers, pirates, talking spoons, or whoever it is who&apos;s having the adventure, and even guilt is lost for a while among the yellowing pages. So guilty reads can apparently be anything, from an underworld thriller to a wizard&apos;s yarn, from a French cartoon to a horsey romp. Do you have a guilty read?

The basis of such schemes is pretty simple: you pick up a bike, usually painted a bright white or yellow, then leave it where you are going for someone else to use. Predictably, as these wonderful- sounding free schemes rely on the users&apos; honesty to return the bike, they struggle against theft. Bikes from the Amsterdam scheme have been found as far away as Moscow and the US. And in one brave attempt at free community bicycles in Cambridge in 1993, all 300 bicycles were stolen on the first day ... Halfords stumbled with a similar programme this year, when it placed 10 orange bicycles around London for anyone to use. The bikes were supposed to publicise the health benefits of cycling and, once the six-week scheme was over, to be sent to Africa for charity. Sadly not one of the \u00a3160 bicycles were returned at the end of the experiment. So free bicycle schemes now tend to require a deposit and bikes are kept locked at destinations. OYBike in London lets you hire a bike for free for 30 minutes, after paying an initial \u00a310 registration fee. Using your mobile you phone the OYBike call centre to get the code to unlock the bike at locations such as Hammersmith, Fulham and West Kensington. Velo&apos;v in Lyon, France&apos;s second-largest city, has 1,500 bikes available for use by 15,000 registered users. But unlike the ill-fated Cambridge scheme, there are deterrents to stop people nicking their velo.

The executive vice president at the granddaddy of American advertising firms, J. Walter Thompson (JWT) - and one of the world&apos;s leading &quot;trendspotters&quot; or &quot;futurists&quot; - was running so late when she left her Connecticut commuter-belt home that she did not have time to get dressed properly. As we walk through JWT&apos;s vast warehouse-style HQ on Manhattan&apos;s Upper East Side, where even the pooches sport designer labels, I tease her that I am going to put this in my article. &quot;We&apos;ll negotiate that later,&quot; she replies, only half-joking. Salzman radiates enough energy, one suspects, to power a small town and looks as if she has just stepped off the set of Sex and the City. She speaks at fire-cracker speed as she discusses popular culture and the geo-political issues of our age, sprinkling her conversation with faintly irritating buzzwords and phrases like &quot;fertility soup&quot;, &quot;boomerang parents&quot; and &quot;Millennial Moms&quot;. She has been credited with pinpointing a number of western societal trends and - let&apos;s face it - marketing opportunities, such as &quot;wiggers&quot; (white suburban teens who mimic the street-style and language of young urban African Americans), as well as &quot;singletons&quot; and &quot;metrosexuals&quot; (usually heterosexual city-dwelling men who adopt the shopping and personal grooming habits of women and gay men). Although it was the British writer Mark Simpson who first used the last term in print in 1994, it is Salzman who has come to be identified with it. So much so, it seems, that she has plainly tired of journalists quoting it back to her. &quot;People have asked me why I have written my latest book and I reply that it is to prevent it saying on my tombstone &apos;She popularised metrosexual&apos;,&quot; she groans. Next Now: Trends for the Future, co-authored with leading brand consultant Ira Matathia, covers big subjects such as &quot;the age of anxiety&quot; (terrorism, pandemics and loss of faith in institutions) as well as how the future belongs to &quot;Chindia&quot; (a toe-curlingly awful word coined by an Indian economist) and how we have all become &quot;brand sluts&quot;, but I am more interested in another question: what does the futurist think about the future of newspapers? &quot;I don&apos;t think newspapers are about to go away,&quot; she replies comfortingly. &quot;There&apos;s no doubt in my mind that the New York Times and the Washington Post will offer a printed format - among other formats - in ten years&apos; time. But the definition of &apos;a newspaper&apos; is changing. I read the Times online every day, and the industry hasn&apos;t yet calibrated the ways to monetise that.&quot; So what are the options? &quot;One option is that if you get me to read the Thursday Style section of the Times online, and I read about a restaurant, then I click through and make a reservation, all of a sudden the New York Times just got a $3 booking fee. Or I can read about a bag I want to give to my brother-in-law for Christmas and it costs $175, I click through and the same thing happens. Newspapers can serve as the redirect for the retailer.&quot; We also need to change our definition of the word &quot;advertising&quot;, continues Salzman. &quot;The conventional &apos;quarter page&apos;, &apos;full page&apos;, &apos;Sunday inserts&apos; haven&apos;t quite gone away yet, but for 15 years we&apos;ve been predicting that they are going to go away. The next business model I believe we are going to see is &apos;premium zip-code&apos; [post-code] advertising. In Manhattan the richest zip-codes are on the Upper East Side and possibly SoHo. It is conceivable, if I were the New York Times, that I would provide free newspapers to those zip-codes sponsored by Platinum American Express. Or that a wrapper would be created for the newspaper for the Gordon Ramsay restaurant opening, which will target people who live on, say, 68th street or the subscribers of Gourmet Magazine. &quot;So the whole role of advertising in newspapers might change. I think in the future it&apos;s going to be a very different, very customised, very personalised, very intellectually robust relationship between media partner, advertiser and consumer. Advertising will be much more about &quot;narrowcasting&quot; - how I sell directly to you - because demographics are dead.&quot; How so? &quot;Well, today you can&apos;t tell how old someone is by the way they look or dress, you don&apos;t know when they&apos;re going to start families or even where they are going to live, because the trend right now is people coming back to the city from the suburbs once their kids have grown up. When I came into this business &quot;a senior&quot; was someone who was 50-plus and we wouldn&apos;t sell cars to them. Today, old is 80-plus and from the ages of 65 to 80, many people are just starting to wind down. Our whole sense of longevity has changed.&quot; It would be hard to envisage Salzman, for one, winding down much before her 80th birthday. She put herself through Brown and Harvard universities by working as a maid and waitress and, when just 30, went on to found the world&apos;s first online market research company Cyberdialogue. She carved out a niche for herself as a futurist when she joined Chiat/Day in 1993 (before it merged with TBWA), and subsequently at TBWA International, where she was based in Amsterdam and held the impressive-sounding title of worldwide director, Department of the Future. Stints at Young &amp; Rubicam and Euro RSCG Worldwide eventually led her to JWT. How, I ask, is &quot;metrosexual man&quot; faring as we enter 2007? Not too well apparently. &quot;Gender blurring is really the big phenomenon right now,&quot; she explains. &quot;By that I mean men adopting female traits and behaviours and vice versa. And the flipside is that you are now seeing young women coming out of Yale saying &apos;I want to get married and stay home and raise my children&apos; and you&apos;re seeing young men saying that they want go out once a week on a boys&apos; night out and be a guy&apos;s guy. So &apos;metrosexual&apos; is burnt out right now, but there are aspects of &apos;metrosexuality&apos; which will live on forever. A man will never again be &apos;queer&apos; for doing his nails.&quot; Buzzwords like &quot;metrosexuality&quot; may intrigue the media, but isn&apos;t their real purpose to allow marketers to target their subjects more precisely? &quot;Yes, before 2000 we used to assume that men never cared about how their hair looked after they washed it, it was simply a hygiene thing. But actually male hair is entirely different from female hair, which means we need male products. So where there are differences, we need to market to those differences, but where there&apos;s convergence we need to embrace that convergence and not keep clustering the two genders.&quot; She takes a quick gulp of air. &quot;The kitchen&apos;s a place where there are real similarities. Cookery television is on the rise for both men and women. High end cooking products are really on the rise ... But then there are also times when guys just want to be guys, when they say &apos;I just want to eat junk-food, I&apos;m hungry&apos;. At times trendspotting can seem like quackery masquerading as a quasi-science. In one breath Salzman appears to be saying the genders have converged in a frenzy of shopping and eyebrow-plucking, but simultaneously she admits that guys also sometimes just want to play poker and eat burgers. Aren&apos;t they contradictory? &quot;No, if you think of most trends having a yin and a yang, it&apos;s the opposite side of gender blurring. If the blurring is everyone going to Banana Republic or The Gap, then the opposite is: &apos;She is going to embrace knitting, while he&apos;s going to embrace let lads just be lads today&apos;. But it&apos;s also why people are critical of trendspotting. They&apos;ll say &apos;Well you just said it&apos;s X then you&apos;ve contradicted yourself&apos;. Right, I just have, but you can have a trend and a counter-trend.&quot; Asked to explain the somewhat mysterious art of trendspotting, Salzman replies: &quot;I&apos;ve been doing it for so long it&apos;s almost hard to explain. A large part of it is pattern recognition.&quot; What does that mean in practice? &quot;At JWT for the US we have an 80,000 household panel and we&apos;ll do a sample of about 1,000 households to try to understand a specific topic. I also have a small team of trendspotters who work for me here. I&apos;ve just been personally supervising a huge project for Estee Lauder, where we&apos;ve been out in the US, UK, France, Korea and Japan doing qualitative and quantitative research and interviews with executives, customers and people who work in department stores.&quot; She laughs: &quot;At this point, I know far more about how Japanese women feel about scent than I ever intended to ... &quot; Salzman reveals that JWT is also about to embark upon the first ever study of the Muslim market in the US and the UK, under her supervision. &quot;This is the biggest single issue we face as marketers,&quot; she says. &quot;3.5% of Americans are Muslims. They are young and we don&apos;t understand them at all. Part of the American Dream was becoming like your neighbour, but Muslims have a code of law which they respect which impacts every dimension of their world including consumerism and media consumption.&quot; But doesn&apos;t that make them an unlikely market Tellingly she replies: &quot;They are not anti-consumerist. There are things they want. We know they value home and family. But we have not figured out yet how to invent desire [among the Muslim community].&quot; She leans forward. &quot;This is the first thing I&apos;ve been really excited about since the day I installed an AOL disk back in 1992.&quot;", "sentences": ["She carved out a niche for herself as a futurist when she joined Chiat/Day in 1993 (before it merged with TBWA), and subsequently at TBWA International, where she was based in Amsterdam and held the impressive-sounding title of worldwide director, Department of the Future."], "title": "Interview with Marian Salzman", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/08/mondaymediasection3", "tags": ["Media"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-01-08T15:14:37Z", "article": "Lawyers will today begin preparing the ground for one of the largest class actions heard in the UK over 400 tonnes of allegedly highly toxic waste dumped in the Ivory Coast from a cargo ship chartered by a London-based company.

Yes, the stealthy Swede, who famously fended off rumours linking him with a move to Chelsea by strolling into Roman Abramovich&apos;s gaff in full view of Fleet Street photographers, today finds himself engulfed in controversy in France following the sort of tactless display that even seasoned streakers would be embarrassed by. Amid intense speculation linking Eriksson to the job of Marseille manager - what with Jack Kachkar, the clearly clueless Canadian bidding to take over the club, reportedly having made the Swede his top target - Eriksson deftly played down the gossip by turning up to watch yesterday&apos;s friendly between Marseille and Lazio in Dubai. And ostentatiously taking notes throughout the game. After OM chairman Pape Diouf vented his fury at what he said was a brazen attempt to pile pressure on current manager Albert Emon, the ever-convincing Swede, who famously underlined his commitment to keeping his professional and private life separate by banging his colleagues&apos; secretary, innocently pleaded: &quot;I&apos;m here on holiday, that&apos;s all ... I haven&apos;t even thought about going to Olympique Marseille.&quot; Perhaps. But an offer of \u00a34m-a-season will soon change his mind. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Rafa Benitez will solve his goalkeeping, defensive and attacking problems in one fell swoop with a \u00a39m bid for footballing Swiss Army knife Phil Jagielka. Lee Hendrie could soon be splitting pantomime villain duties with Craig Bellamy at Villa Park ... ... especially if Jose Mourinho carries through with his inexplicable plan to take Milan Baros off Martin O&apos;Neill&apos;s hands. Not content with having at least four times more hair than Silvio Berlusconi, Massimo Moratti will continue his quest to prove he is Milan&apos;s most virile football club owner by hooking up with Andriy Shevchenko.

Angela Merkel said the decision was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;destroys trust&quot; after Russia stopped crude exports through the Druzhba (friendship) line, halting supplies to Poland, Germany and several central European countries. Moscow said it had been forced to act, alleging that Belarus was illegally siphoning off oil. The European commission and Germany, which currently holds the EU presidency, said it was unacceptable for Russia and Belarus to act without consultation. &quot;It is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such actions,&quot; Ms Merkel said. &quot;That always destroys trust, and no trusting, undisturbed cooperation can be built on that.&quot; The chancellor said she planned to tell both Russia and Belarus that such discussions were a &quot;minimum&quot; need in the event of disputes over energy. Russia&apos;s decision to close the line raised new fears about European dependence on Russian energy sources, a year after oil supplies were disrupted in a similar dispute between Russia and Ukraine. &quot;While there is no immediate risk to supply ... of course this is a matter for concern,&quot; the European commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, said. Ms Merkel is due to travel to Moscow for talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, later this month. Today&apos;s comments came as an opinion poll showed a large majority of Germans believe their country is too heavily dependent on Russian oil and gas. Moscow and Belarus today held talks in an attempt to settle the dispute ovwer the 2,500-mile pipeline, which has two branches. One runs to Poland and Germany and the other through Ukraine to Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. &quot;The dispute between Belarus and Russia should act as a wake up call to the EU commission,&quot; Robert Amsterdam, a defence lawyer to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former oil tycoon now in a Siberian jail for fraud and tax evasion, said. &quot;It cannot allow Russia to retain its stranglehold over Europe&apos;s energy supplies without any transparent agreement to legal principles.&quot; Russia and Belarus were once close allies, with Moscow relying on Minsk as a military buffer between it and Nato. In the mid-90s, the countries signed a loose political union, but the Kremlin has grown impatient at supporting the authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko&apos;s regime while receiving little in return. The current dispute stems from Moscow&apos;s recent decisions to impose duties on oil sales to its neighbour, double gas prices and ban sugar imports. Belarus retaliated last week by slapping a $45 (\u00a323) per tonne transit fee on Russian oil pumped via the country. It comes days after Belarus and Russia reached an agreement on gas prices, with the deal avoiding a new year cut-off of natural gas for Belarusian consumers and averting potential supply shortages in western Europe. Belarus grudgingly accepted a doubling of the price it pays for imports of Russian natural gas, on which it depends for industry and home heating. However, the two countries are arguing over oil duties, with Russia determined to stop Belarus from re-exporting petroleum products made from processing Russian oil bought cheaply under the previous duty-free regime.", "sentences": ["&quot;The dispute between Belarus and Russia should act as a wake up call to the EU commission,&quot; Robert Amsterdam, a defence lawyer to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former oil tycoon now in a Siberian jail for fraud and tax evasion, said."], "title": "Merkel hits out at Russian oil pipeline closure", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/09/russia.business", "tags": ["Russia", "World news", "Business", "Oil", "Germany", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-01-13T23:56:25Z", "article": "An enigmatic Russian composer and passionate associate of Shostakovich, she stood outside fashion A degree of mystery surrounded the life of the Russian composer Galina Ustvolskaya, who has died at the age of 87. Foremost among her early admirers, both as a person and an artist, was her fellow composer Dmitri Shostakovich. In the post-Soviet era there grew an international following for her distinctive musical voice, her reclusiveness notwithstanding. Born in what until 1924 was Petrograd, she began her studies in 1937 at a college attached to the Leningrad Conservatory, transferring to the parent institution in 1939. Her training was interrupted by a period of war service, working in a military hospital. In 1947, she embarked on postgraduate studies, as well as accepting a teaching position at the conservatory, where her pupils included Boris Tishchenko. She retired from it in 1975. Although she undoubtedly ploughed her own personal and artistic furrow, she was not ignored by the Soviet regime. Her Violin Sonata (1952) was performed frequently, notwithstanding its modernity of style. It was even played before a visiting delegation of American musicians in 1958. The distinguished composer Roy Harris deemed it &quot;dissonant from beginning to end&quot; and &quot;kind of ugly&quot;. Like many of her compatriots, including Prokofiev and Shostakovich, she did produce overtly patriotic pieces with titles such as Hail Youth, Young Pioneers and The Hero&apos;s Exploit, although she rejected these vehemently in later life. No less forceful were her protestations over her apparently passionate affair with Shostakovich, one of her teachers at the conservatory, though there is no doubt that a special relationship grew up between them. It was rumoured that Shostakovich proposed marriage to her during the 1950s. He certainly held her in great artistic esteem, once referring to her as his &quot;musical conscience&quot; and often showing her his scores for approval. He even quoted from a work of hers, the Clarinet Trio of 1949, in both his Fifth String Quartet (1952) and Suite on Verses by Michelangelo for bass and orchestra (1974). Whatever passed between them, certainly Ustvolskaya became intensely embittered and was quoted as saying that &quot;a seemingly eminent figure such as Shostakovich, to me is not eminent at all. On the contrary, he burdened my life and killed my best feelings.&quot; Ustvolskaya&apos;s surviving output is small, but highly personal and idiosyncratic. It includes five single-movement symphonies and six piano sonatas - the fifth containing the nervewracking dynamic marking &quot;ffffff&quot;. Little surprise that she was once dubbed &quot;the lady with the hammer&quot; by a Dutch critic. She possessed a phenomenal ear for unusual instrumental sonorities, as witnessed by the scoring of pieces such as the Octet for two oboes, four violins, timpani and piano (1949-50); the Composition No 3, Benedictus, Qui Venit, for four flutes, four bassoons and piano (1974-75); or the Symphony No 4, Prayer, for mezzo-soprano, trumpet, tam-tam and piano (1985-87). The religious subtitles point to her liking for church performances of her work. Many of her pieces are relatively short, yet such was her search for fastidious perfection that they could take up to seven or eight years of compositional work to complete. The result is violent, fragmented, spiritual and brutally austere. Yet there is an unmistakable power, sincerity and profound integrity, all delivered through a fiercely individual mode of expression. Ustvolskaya spent much of her life as a somewhat enigmatic figure in Leningrad (now again St Petersburg), refusing even to attend the funeral of her sister. As she said at the time: &quot;I hate bad news.&quot; To everyone&apos;s astonishment, in 1966 she married, taking a jazz-playing student 30 years her junior as her husband. It was usually through him that she made her rare contacts with the outside world, invariably to demand that the Soviet authorities destroy all recordings of her music. Tim McDonald  Peter Grahame Woolf writes: My attention was first drawn to Galina Ustvolskaya in 1990 when I saw some simple-looking pages scattered on the Basle studio floor of the pianist Marianne Schroeder. She was excited by their originality and soon became the first to record the six piano sonatas. Not until 1994 did I experience the overwhelming impact in performance of Ustvolskaya&apos;s music, at the British premiere of Symphony No 5, Amen (1989-90), given by London Musici at St John&apos;s, Smith Square. The stark tone and religious basis of this uncompromising vision, with its spare instrumentation (voice, oboe, trumpet, tuba, violin and percussion), made a profound impression, and I went into a degree of shock. The fifth was the last of the works she called &quot;symphony&quot;, though only the first three use orchestras rather than chamber groups. They are all cast in single movements, some quite short, proceeding at an unvarying, steady tempo, often with relentless percussive thuds. Each is a ritual, with a voice declaiming fragments of text, either biblical or in short groups of holy invocations - in the words of music writer Franz Lemaire, &quot;murmured complaint or insistent supplication, as opposed to the cosmic indifference of the music&quot;. Exploring Ustvolskaya&apos;s solo piano music at the keyboard and comparing the 11 CDs then available for International Piano Quarterly (November 1999) became an exhilarating, yet draining, experience. The piano is central in Ustvolskaya&apos;s oeuvre, and her writing for it instantly recognisable. She does not use barlines and combines polyphony with powerful rhythmic drive. Terraced dynamics juxtapose &quot;ffffff&quot; and &quot;pppppp&quot; in extreme keyboard registers. She stands outside fashion, past or present. Hallmarks of her style are unswerving severity and seriousness, presented in a predominantly harsh, hard-edged sound spectrum, eschewing the tonal gradations and pedalling subtleties of the best-loved piano music. It is bleak and compelling, neither typically avant garde nor minimalist; cathartic but never comfortable. In 1995, film director Jos\u00e9e Voormans persuaded this reclusive, frail but indomitable, camera-shy composer to go to Amsterdam to hear her music rehearsed and performed, and to give what may well be her only interview recorded on film. As A Cry in the Universe, it was shown last October at the festival Dancing on a Tightrope - Beyond Shostakovich at London&apos;s South Bank Centre. There followed another VPRO Netherlands TV production, Odette Toeset&apos;s filming of a studio performance of Ustvolskaya&apos;s Symphony No 2 (True and Eternal Bliss) by the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra, directed from the piano by Reinbert de Leeuw. One of the best films of an orchestral performance ever made, it uses camera images to enhance the impact of the music to a quite extraordinary degree. \u00b7 Galina Ivanova Ustvolskaya, composer, born June 17 1919; died December 22 2006", "sentences": ["In 1995, film director Jos\u00e9e Voormans persuaded this reclusive, frail but indomitable, camera-shy composer to go to Amsterdam to hear her music rehearsed and performed, and to give what may well be her only interview recorded on film."], "title": "Obituary: Galina Ustvolskaya", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jan/13/guardianobituaries.musicnews", "tags": ["Russia", "World news", "Music", "Culture", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-01-14T00:09:03Z", "article": "Marc steps outside the squat and hunches his shoulders against the rain blasted down the narrow street by the North Sea wind. A group of Russian tourists stops in front of him and the graffiti-daubed front of the five-floor townhouse on Amsterdam&apos;s central Spuistraat. The tourists want their photograph taken next to the striking 6ft 6in squatter. &apos;The house is a monument,&apos; said Marc, 34, a musician and part-time film-maker. But if right-wing politicians have their way, it will not be for much longer. Holland is in turmoil after an inconclusive election in November and, if the conservatives bolster their hold on government through a new coalition, squatting is likely to be made illegal. &apos;We have to wait and see, but it doesn&apos;t look good,&apos; said Lotte, 25, a squatter &apos;by political choice&apos; who works in a bookshop. &apos;There are people who are very keen to push the law through, and it won&apos;t be hard for them to do so.&apos; Squatting, for so long a feature of cities proud of their &apos;ultra-tolerant&apos; reputation, is one of several key symbols of urban Dutch liberalism to come under attack in recent years. There have been moves to reduce the size of Amsterdam&apos;s extensive red-light district. Famously lax drugs laws have been tightened. A generous immigration policy has been the centre of fierce debate and criticism. &apos;It is all a symptom of a general movement back towards law and order in Dutch society and politics,&apos; said Bas Heijne, a respected Dutch commentator. &apos;It is a trend towards certainty and away from pragmatic compromise and tolerance.&apos; The new law, which has already been passed as a parliamentary motion, will make almost all squatting illegal. At present squatters just need to install a bed, a chair and a table in a property that has been vacant for more than a year and call the police to make an official declaration. It is then up to the landlord to get them out; a long, difficult and costly process. This has led to a recent boom in another activity that will be hit by the new law - &apos;anti-squatting&apos;. Joost Koenders, director of the nationwide anti-squatting agency Anti-Kraak, has more than 400 properties on his books. The tenants are people who need cheap housing, have no deposit and do not mind the fact that they can be given two weeks&apos; notice to leave. The landlords want their property occupied so that it can&apos;t be squatted legally. &apos;It&apos;s straight supply and demand, 100 per cent free- market,&apos; Koenders explained. One such tenant is Denis, 27, a market trader who is paying around \u20ac100 a month to share with five other tenants a 24,000 sq m office block that is scheduled for demolition. &apos;It&apos;s OK,&apos; he said. &apos;It is better than nothing.&apos; Critics of anti-squatting, which is set to come to the UK with the expansion of Dutch companies to London, say it is &apos;exploitative&apos;. &apos;It neither eases Amsterdam&apos;s chronic housing shortage nor usefully employs some of the city&apos;s huge number of empty properties,&apos; said one campaigner. Critics also point out that anti-squatters miss out on the cultural scene that goes with long-established squats, many of which run cafes, workshops, theatre groups, discussion forums and even newspapers. As coalition talks continued last week, Holland&apos;s estimated 50,000 squatters remained defiant.

They\u2019re a colourful key to unlocking local cultures and can make for a fantastic travel experience. Many travellers have their own special memories of spectacular events they have attended, whether it\u2019s a long-planned visit to Spain\u2019s Fiesta de San Fermin, or a stumbled-upon saint\u2019s-day procession in a dusty town in southern Italy. Covering nearly 200 festivals and events, the new World Party: The Rough Guide to the World\u2019s Best Festivals shows you how the world likes to party. In this extract, you\u2019ll find high-energy inspiration for a year of party-led globetrotting. Ati Atihan, Kalibo, The Philippines Mid-January, for two weeks At Ati Atihan, you\u2019ll find all the elements for a spectacular carnival parade \u2013 extravagant costumes, lavishly decorated floats and a legion of up-for-it participants \u2013 but absolutely none of the organisation. Nor will you find a distinction between spectators and parading dancers. In Kalibo, wherever you are, you\u2019ll be in the thick of it. You\u2019ll be hauled on to a float by a bunch of mermaids and forced to drink ludicrous quantities of rum until you can barely stand. The whole shindig rages until sunrise, by which time you will be totally disoriented and wondering what on earth you\u2019re doing there. But hell, what better way to start the year? Rio Carnival, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In Feburary/March for five days Carnival celebrations are hardly unique to Rio de Janeiro, but, without doubt, the city boasts the world\u2019s wildest, glitziest and largest of them all. Drawing participants from all over the globe, this is the world\u2019s best party \u2013 full stop. Partying at the Rio carnival is something you definitely won\u2019t forget so leave your inhibitions at the airport and get ready to party. And don\u2019t worry that you can\u2019t dance samba in the sexy, shuffling way the locals do; there are worse things in life than being taught how to samba by a Brazilian guiding the movements of your hips. Holi, primarily in north India but also in various other states In February/March for about four days Holi is one of the most vibrant Indian festivals. It has its origins in Hinduism, but revelers today span the entire country, regardless of their religion, caste or class. Although it is a springtime festival, and hence a celebration of the arrival of the harvest season, Holi is essentially about colour, and everyone gets involved, showering friends, family and passers-by with multi-coloured powders, and assaulting complete strangers with water balloons and spray guns. Colour may be the common feature of Holi, but each region adds its own unique touch to the spectacle \u2013 from Mathura\u2019s mock battles between the sexes to Phalen\u2019s full-moon bonfire. Queen\u2019s Day, Amsterdam, The Netherlands For one day on April 30 (unless this falls on a Sunday, in which case April 29) Queen\u2019s Day is the wildest possible time to visit Amsterdam. The queen in question isn\u2019t one of the flamboyant transvestites hanging around Rembrandtplein but Holland\u2019s reigning monarch, Queen Beatrix, whose official birthday is celebrated throughout the country on April 30. The ensuing fiesta is Amsterdam\u2019s Mardi Gras and Oktoberfest all rolled into one. In a city famed for its easy-going, fun-loving population, it still manages to crank the party volume a few notches higher as the citizens of Amsterdam reclaim the streets, parks, squares and canals of the town from tourists, motorists and officialdom for one glorious party. There are just two rules to observe; you must dress as ridiculously as possible, in orange \u2013 the Dutch national colour, and you must drink enough beer not to care. Bun Bang Fai, Vientiane, Laos In May for one day On the full moon in May, it\u2019s time to light the fuse and stand well clear throughout Laos, as rocket fever grips the nation, and countless homemade contraptions are launched skywards to ensure good rain and a healthy crop as part of the Bun Bang Fai Festival. Vientiane is the place to be, although you\u2019ll find smaller events going on all over the country. Buddhist monks are the most expert rocket scientists, using bamboo tubes \u2013 up to five metres in length \u2013 stuffed with gunpowder, decked in coloured ribbons and capped by a paper dragon\u2019s head. There\u2019s much bawdy singing and dancing through the day, and come the evening everyone assembles in raucous crowds by the Mekong river to watch the launchings.  Gnawa and World Music Festival, Essaouira, Morocco In June for four days The music of the Gnawas (or Gnaouas), a spiritual brotherhood that has its origins in sub-Saharan Africa and melds animist, Berber and Arab influences, is mysterious, hypnotic, trance-inducing stuff that can send the musicians spinning (literally) into another plane. Essaouira makes for a beautiful setting. Its picturesque lanes and squares, sparkling light and tranquil atmosphere have attracted many painters, woodcarvers and other artisans over the years. During the festival, the pounding rhythms of drums, reed pipes and castanet-like garagabs ringing out from Place Prince Moulay el Hassan, deep inside the city\u2019s medina, or old town, only add to the atmosphere. Il Palio, Siena, Italy On July 2 and August 16 for two to four days, including associated festivities Siena\u2019s legendary bareback horserace \u2013 Il Palio \u2013 is a highly charged, death-defying two-minute dash around the boundary of the city\u2019s majestic and equally famous Piazza del Campo. Twice every summer, riders elected by each of the city\u2019s ancient districts compete in a bid to win the much-prized palio, or banner, that gives its name to the event. Following the race, the winning jockey is feted, and the residents of his district sing, dance and ferociously celebrate his victory into the small hours. The vibrancy of the costumes, grand architecture, stifling heat, and huge crowds all create a frenetic mood to go alongside the shocking potential for brutality and behind-the-scenes sleaze. Esala Perahera, Kandy, Sri Lanka  For the last ten days of the Buddhist lunar month of Esala (usually late July and early August)  In terms of noise, colour and crowds, there\u2019s nothing else on earth quite like Kandy\u2019s Esala Perahera, a 10-day extravaganza dating back to the fourth century and the early days of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Forget Ibiza\u2019s club scene, for truly all-out sensory assault, this is hard to beat. Held to honour the Buddha\u2019s tooth, the festival is based around a series of increasingly lengthy and spectacular nighttime parades involving drummers, dancers, torch-bearers, whip-crackers, fire-eaters and, most spectacularly, over 100 costumed elephants. The final parade is the best part of a kilometre long, and can take several hours to wind its way around the city streets. Burning Man, Black Rock City, Nevada, USA The week before Labor Day (first Monday in September), for eight days Picture a nudist miniature golf course, an advanced pole-dancing workshop, a motorised magic-carpet vehicle and a bunch of neon-painted bodies glowing in the night. Now you may be getting close to imagining what the legendary Burning Man is all about. Every year during the last week of August, several thousand geeks, pyrotechnics, Goths, hippies and hip yuppies descend on the Nevada desert for a week to burn a 50ft effigy of a man, constructed from wood and neon, and stuffed with fireworks. It\u2019s not the ideal place to party \u2013 temperatures can exceed 38C (100F) by day \u2013 but the thousands of anarchists, deviants, mad scientists, techno-heads, dancers and freakish performance artists that arrive here from all over the world certainly give it their best shot. Fantasy Fest, Florida, USA From the penultimate Friday to the last Sunday in October, for 10 days Fantasy Fest is a music-and-rum-fuelled party that reaches its zenith with a massive themed costume parade. It\u2019s a camp affair all right, but whatever your sexual orientation, the mood is so exuberant that it\u2019s hard not to get drawn in. There\u2019s a Headdress Ball on Tuesday; an outrageous Beach Party and a Pet Masquerade and Parade on Wednesday (featuring cross-dressing animals and their lookalike owners); and a fancy-dress party on Thursday. There\u2019s also the notorious Toga Party, where you\u2019ll see some of the skimpiest togas ever worn, and, on Friday, the Caribbean Street Fair bursts on to the scene with feathered masks and tons of frivolous exotica on offer. Just before sunset on Friday, the Fairvilla Megastore Masquerade March winds its way through the fair, with the emphasis on \u2013 what else? \u2013 fantasy. Day of the Dead, Mexico November 1 and 2, for two days It\u2019s not every day you get to party with the dead, but on the first two days in November, all of Mexico does just that, as everything stops for the most distinctive festival on the calendar, a nationwide communion with the departed, known as the D\u00eda de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead. Sound a touch morbid? It\u2019s actually a more joyful occasion than you might expect, as it\u2019s both a time for the remembrance of loved ones and a celebration of the eternal cycle of life \u2013 a carnival of welcome, if you like, for the spiritual return of the dead. For days in advance, favourite dishes are prepared and placed on flower-decked altars, along with some beloved tequila. Come nightfall, graveyards quickly start to resemble Mexican roadside restaurants, as picnic tables and chairs are set around graves, tortillas are fried, and substantial quantities of tequila are consumed in memory of the deceased. Junkanoo, Nassau, New Providence Island, The Bahamas Two all-night parties, from the early hours of December 26 and again on New Year\u2019s Day The Bahamas\u2019 most important and spectacular party, Junkanoo is a blast to the senses. Parades flood the streets of Nassau in a whirling, reeling mass of singing and dancing chaos, as competing groups or \u201ccrews\u201d rush out to meet the dawn, moving toward one another from all directions, rather than following each other in the semi-organised fashion of the modern parade. Various groups and societies compete to be the biggest and loudest floats, which means you\u2019ll see stilt-dancers, clowns, acrobats, go-go girls, goatskin-drum players, and conch and cowbell ringers, all blaring out their tunes in an awesome celebration of life that can only have originated in the Caribbean. \u201cWorld Party: The Rough Guide to the World\u2019s Best Festivals (\u00a316.99), covering all of the above and 200 other events, is published this month.

My Latvian taxi driver has been regaling me with improbable tales of &quot;byootifool vimmin&quot; in Riga nightclubs outnumbering the men by 40 to 10. It was a noble attempt to cheer me up as I prepared for another night covering the farce that is England&apos;s tour, but things went downhill after that as I tried to explain the logic of three teams playing each other four times to determine who will face Australia in the final. He looked blank, then resumed his tales of Baltic lust and derring-do. Still, tonight England are playing New Zealand in Hobart, which means their chances of a first win since September - even if it is against a team that palpably isn&apos;t Australia - are roughly 50-50. They would have been 60-40 had Kevin Pietersen not broken a rib, but he did, and they aren&apos;t. His replacement is Ed Joyce, who has already attracted support. &quot;Hope Ed Joyce does the trick and brings some honour back to England,&quot; says Brian Martin in Paris, who then reiterates his support. &quot;Go on Ed!&quot; Toss etc New Zealand have won it and will bat at the same venue where Australia made 289 for 6 against them two days ago. No team news as yet, it being a subject of the utmost secrecy as far as England are concerned. The &quot;etc&quot; part of &quot;Toss etc&quot; doesn&apos;t really pull its weight, does it... Ed Joyce (pictured) has really sparked your interest. &quot;I know I&apos;m an XY instead of an XX,&quot; begins Sean Boiling, &quot;but, if Kate McDonald comes back to the OBO today (Kate was judging the spunkiness of the players on Friday), I reckon she could do a lot worse than spunk-a-licous Ed Joyce. He&apos;s got the looks, and plays the hooks.&quot; That&apos;s awful. No excuses. Teams New Zealand have gone with the same team that lost by 100-odd runs to Australia the other day, which means Ross Taylor is fit. Look out for him in the middle order. England have simply brought in Joyce for Pietersen. So that&apos;s an attack of Jimmy Anderson, Jon Lewis, Andrew Flintoff, Monty Panesar, Jamie Dalrymple and a bit of Paul Collingwood. &quot;Tonight&apos;s game needs a bit a spice to liven it up don&apos;t you think?&quot; says the inevitable Gary Naylor. &quot;As England&apos;s openers arrive in the middle, couldn&apos;t Kiwi guest Twelfth Man, Tana Umaga, lead the NZ team in the Haka, before picking up Michael Vaughan and planting him head first into the ground like an extra stump? Even Harmy would be roused by that sort of thing.&quot; Wisdom from Beefy: &quot;England have got to start winning.&quot; 1st over: New Zealand 12-0 (McCullum 12, Astle 0) Jon Lewis gets the first over and he will be relieved that his first ball wasn&apos;t charged by a man in bottle green and deposited into the stands. Instead, his second ball is charged by a man in black and deposited into the stands. I kid you not. Well, strictly, Brendon McCullum didn&apos;t charge that, he just freed his arms at a wide one and sent the ball over cover for six. What a shot! Two balls later McCullum flicks it off his pads, Anderson misreads the spin and the ball bounces humiliatingly away for four. The last ball is helped over square-leg for two and England have plumbed village depths already. 2nd over: New Zealand 13-0 (McCullum 12, Astle 1) Anderson gets an immediate chance to make amends for his fielding howler and that&apos;s not the worst over against Nathan Astle. There was a bit of width early on but the fifth ball cut back to rap Astle on the pad and only the quickest of off-side singles off the last ball sullied what would have been a maiden. 3rd over: New Zealand 17-0 (McCullum 12, Astle 5) Hobart, incidentally, is the venue which Australia would like to add to the Ashes rota in 2010-11, thus giving them the chance to record the first 6-0 whitewash in Test history. I hope England tell them where to go. Meanwhile, Astle is telling Lewis precisely that, slapping his second ball - a wide piece of dross - through the covers for four. But the rest of the over was better. Which is a relief. 4th over: New Zealand 21-0 (McCullum 16, Astle 5) Anderson beats McCullum with an 89mph beauty that swings late and bounces. Boycott&apos;s stick of rhubarb would have got no way near that. This is good bowling from Anderson, who fools McCullum with an inswinger when he was hoping to free his arms outside off. But McCullum then undoes the good work by stepping across his stumps to whip the last ball to the deep square-leg fence. Oh. 5th over: New Zealand 25-0 (McCullum 16, Astle 9) Astle uses his feet to biff Lewis over long-off for a one-bounce four, prompting Paul Nixon to stand up to the stumps. This is comfortably the highest partnership between these two in six attempts. If it&apos;s not one thing it&apos;s another. &quot;Heh, heh, here we go again,&quot; says Clare Davies, who I assume is talking about the cricket. &quot;At least this time under the cover of darkness, which may well be a shame as there is a marginal chance of respectability. Or not. Not overly-optimistic here, but if it gets too ugly, I can raise the tone by flicking to live streaming of the ever-enlightening Celebrity Big Brother. A programme about as ill-titled as BBC&apos;s Cricket Highlights.&quot; WICKET! McCullum c Vaughan b Anderson 16 (26-1) The ball after a leg-side wide, Anderson suckers McCullum into a tame loft to mid-off, where Michael Vaughan does the rest. England needed that, if that isn&apos;t to plumb Beefyesque depths of obviousness. &quot;In case you&apos;re wondering what result Aussies will be cheering for, the answer is simple,&quot; says Will Sinclair, setting up the inevitable gloat. &quot;We&apos;ll be cheering for rain. It is still possible to send both the Kiwis and Poms home without winning a game this summer!&quot; Er, I wasn&apos;t aware your team were playing tonight, Will. Aussies are banned. 6th over: New Zealand 28-1 (Astle 9, Fleming 1) Anderson settles Stephen Fleming in with a leg-side wide, then swings a couple into his pads. A mixed over but a successful one. &quot;Who would be your pick for the winner if the entire England team was put in Celebrity Big Brother?&quot; asks Abhi Punshi. &quot;Maybe it would be Liam Plunkett as he would stay silent and anonymous throughout.&quot; Yes, but the audience might tire of his laconicness. I&apos;d go for KP - they&apos;d love his hilarious cod philosophy. And he&apos;d love the cameras. 7th over: New Zealand 30-1 (Astle 9, Fleming 3) Fleming cracks Lewis past the off-side infield for two, and this all feels very far away from the Ashes and all that. Was never much fussed about any of it anyway, truth be told. This is what real cricket is all about. Wayne Allen clearly doesn&apos;t realise Australians are banned from the OBO tonight. &quot;It&apos;s nice to have a match this summer with the outside chance that either team could win,&quot; he cackles, slapping himself on the back in recognition of the full extent of his comic genius. &quot;What would be especially novel is if we could get to about the 5th over of the morning and still not know who was going to win...after all, I have a full day at work to fill in.&quot; Stop it, Wayne! I&apos;ve only just eaten! 8th over: New Zealand 35-1 (Astle 14, Fleming 3) Anderson drops short and Astle pulls him over midwicket for four. It&apos;s hard to tell who&apos;s more out of form here, but it&apos;s fun trying to work it out! &quot;Reading Botham&apos;s autobiog - &quot;Don&apos;t tell Kath!&quot; - one can see where England have gone wrong this series,&quot; says Ian Forth. &quot;The way to raise team morale, for example, is for the captain to soak his players with a &quot;massive&quot; water pistol. To get his own back a player might, for example, set fire to his captain&apos;s newspaper while his captain is reading it. Following these guidelines we would surely have won in Adelaide, and forced a draw in Perth.&quot; 9th over: New Zealand 42-1 (Astle 20, Fleming 3) Lewis begins his fifth over with a leg-side wide and is then plonked back over his head for six by Astle, who I once saw hit 222 off 150-something balls in a Test at Christchurch. I don&apos;t think I will ever see a cleaner exhibition of hitting. I think he hit Andy Caddick for six sixes in seven balls. His second hundred came up off 39. Those were indeed the days. &quot;What does Lewis offer that Hoggy doesn&apos;t?&quot; asks Gary Naylor. &quot;Except the nous that comes from taking 235 Test wickets. And an off-cutter.&quot; I think enthusiasm for the one-day game counts quite highly, doesn&apos;t it? 10th over: New Zealand 43-1 (Astle 20, Fleming 3) Another leg-side wide from England, but Anderson almost gets Fleming soon after with a ball that swings onto Fleming&apos;s toes - but would probably have missed leg. Cracking delivery. Fleming is looking a little scratchy right now: just the wide off the over and England have fought back pretty well after Lewis&apos;s opening shocker. 11th over: New Zealand 44-1 (Astle 20, Fleming 3) Vaughan immediately employs the second powerplay and brings Andrew Flintoff on for Lewis (5-0-29-0). Astle charges his second ball, but he misses and ends up looking about as threatening as Glendenning on the prowl. Astle can&apos;t get Flintoff away, until a leg-bye eases the pressure. A good opening over from Fred. &quot;Anyone miss having a Cairns on show for the Kiwis?&quot; asks you-know-who Naylor. &quot;Both Chris and his dad Lance were very fine players with bat and ball, who often looked like they had just arrived from a long weekend in Amsterdam. If either of them were coached, I doubt that they were listening.&quot; 12th over: New Zealand 49-1 (Astle 21, Fleming 7) Astle digs out an Anderson yorker and scampers a single to cover, before Fleming finally gets hold of a big one and swivel-pulls handsomely for four. That&apos;s his shot and it was almost six. &quot;I won&apos;t even try to be clever here, so shall cut to the chase,&quot; says Jonathan Cosgrove. &quot;Jon Lewis is rubbish and I don&apos;t understand what the selectors are playing at in picking him. He offers nothing good whatsoever. I had the misfortune to be at Friday&apos;s thrashing in Melbourne - Jon Lewis was, comfortably, our worst performer by an English country mile. Please no more Jon Lewis PLEASE.&quot; It&apos;s a touch harsh, Jonathan. It wasn&apos;t all that long ago that Lewis was taking 2 for 11 off eight overs against Pakistan. I&apos;d like to see him given a crack at the World Cup. 13th over: New Zealand 54-1 (Astle 23, Fleming 10) Astle brings up the 50 with a scurried single to a deepish mid-on before Fleming cracks three through the covers. The applause barely qualifies as a smattering. The MCG on Boxing Day this ain&apos;t. &quot;Winning all the time isn&apos;t all it&apos;s cracked up to be,&quot; says Geoff Arnold, who comes from... hang on... Australia! &quot;Though since you&apos;re English you&apos;ll have to take my word for that.&quot; Bah. WICKET! Fleming b Anderson 12 (61-2) Fleming has not looked at home all innings and drags a half-volley onto his stumps. It was a poor ball and a worse shot. And England - dare I say it? - are fractionally on top. &quot;Well, TMS have resorted to discussing cyclists&apos; behaviour on the mountain stages of the TdF,&quot; says abbreviation-happy Clare Davies. &quot;Quite frankly, I&apos;d rather be watching that now, except that it&apos;d probably be a stage that came down to a sprint finish and Robbie McEwan would win proving to the Aussie OBOers that Australia Rules All Sport!&quot; 15th over: New Zealand 67-2 (Astle 33, Taylor 1) I&apos;ve never seen Ross Taylor bat, so this could be interesting. He played very well by all accounts here against Australia the other day, but for the time being Astle stands and delivers a clumping four through extra-cover off Flintoff. He does like playing against England. WICKET! Taylor c Vaughan b Anderson 1 (67-3) A huge wicket for England as Taylor tries to pull a ball that was too close to him and skies it into the off-side, where Vaughan takes the catch above his head without watching the ball into his hands. Three wickets for Anderson and England - whisper it - are on top. 16th over: New Zealand 68-3 (Astle 33, Fulton 1) Peter Fulton is the new batsman for those of you who have overdosed on the other team in this competition over the last couple of months and he gets going by clipping Anderson&apos;s slower ball into the leg-side for a single. He&apos;s a big man, Fulton. Just mentioning it in passing. 17th over: New Zealand 70-3 (Astle 33, Fulton 3) Fulton looks like a porky fast bowler rather than a middle-order batsman, but he clips Flintoff&apos;s first ball through midwicket for two. Meanwhile, we&apos;re getting plenty of replays of Vaughan&apos;s catch to get rid of Taylor. He held on to it slightly behind his head and above his cap - in other words, in a complete blind spot. That could have been very embarrassing. &quot;I think you Poms are kidding yourself about the win today,&quot; says Claire &quot;Miss P&quot; Portek. &quot;The closest contest is surely the PHWOAR match between the dashing Vettori and the delicious Joyce... If only I had visuals!&quot; Steady. 18th over: New Zealand 75-3 (Astle 37, Fulton 4) Anderson retires with the slightly flattering figures of 3 for 27 off eight overs, and is replaced by Lewis, whose first ball is dabbed to fine third man for two by Astle. They are Astle&apos;s first runs for four overs, which shows how England have tightened things up in recent overs. One more wicket now and New Zealand might struggle to make a game of it. Jonathan Cosgrove responds to my defence of Lewis after his attack. &quot;Ah, but that was then,&quot; he says (see 12th over). &quot;This is now. He&apos;s terrible - and must be dropped. Ultimately though, it&apos;s Lewis&apos;s hair that&apos;s topping it off for me. He flounces - that&apos;s the only word for it. No decent cricketers from the modern era have long hair - get a haircut or go home, I say.&quot; So that&apos;s the basis of it? His hair?  19th over: New Zealand 82-3 (Astle 41, Fulton 4) Astle tries to dance down the wicket to Flintoff, but finds a bouncer rushing past his ears, as he does two balls later. Good, aggressive bowling and Beefy, for one, is impressed. And just as I write that Astle paddles Flintoff over square-leg for four. Like I said, poor, anodyne bowling. A wide and two leg-byes complete a decent over for the Kiwis. &quot;I bet an Australian has never been to space!&quot; says Paul. &quot;An Englishman has.&quot; This is getting silly. 20th over: New Zealand 88-3 (Astle 41, Fulton 10) Lewis continues and Fulton picks up two with an uppish off-drive that bounces a yard in front of Flintoff and skids awkwardly away for two. Fulton then completes the over with a whip for four - that leg-stump half-volley got the treatment it deserved. &quot;As an Australian I was trying to figure out who the hell to support out of worse and worser,&quot; says Lucy Stow, blithely flouting my illegal ban on all things Australian. &quot;Anyway all XY&apos;s will be glad to hear Ed Joyce has tipped my support your way England though Daniel Vettori nearly made New Zealand too pretty to pass up.&quot; Well that&apos;s a relief. 21st over: New Zealand 89-3 (Astle 42, Fulton 10) On comes Monty Panesar for Flintoff (5-1-18-0), which makes sense: the powerplays are all out of the way and Panesar can now have a bit of protection on the boundary. New Zealand haven&apos;t faced him before and Astle defends his first ball as if it was about to sprout wings. He sweeps the second for a single, before Fulton is beaten first ball outside off. A lot depends on Astle now, especially as Daniel Vettori is batting as high as No7. A very good first over for Panesar, who will be delighted if New Zealand keep using their feet as little as they did in that over. 22nd over: New Zealand 92-3 (Astle 44, Fulton 11) Paul Collingwood is into the attack, which is partly a reflection of Lewis&apos;s looseness (7-0-40-0) and partly a reflection of one of the slower pitches in Australia. Astle cuts his first ball for a single, before Fulton tucks him for another to wide mid-on. Astle cuts for one more, but the game&apos;s gone quiet. Which will suit England more than New Zealand. &quot;I tested the heart strings this morning to gauge if my loyalties would be torn,&quot; says Kathy Stodart, who lives in NZ but has a hankering for England. &quot;They&apos;re not - I still want England to win, and not just because they need the win more. My home team have never made me lose sleep or my appetite like England have.&quot;  23rd over: New Zealand 94-3 (Astle 45, Fulton 12) Astle cuts Panesar for a single but Fulton is struggling for scoring options, as a rather desperate attempt at a paddle-sweep suggests. A single finally arrives off the fifth ball to deepish mid-off, but that&apos;s just six singles off the last three overs now. &quot;Jonathan Cosgrove&apos;s attack on Lewis&apos; hair being the only uncropped barnet in modern cricket is totally unfounded,&quot; says Colin Gerrard. &quot;Malinga has if anything a fuller head of hair.&quot; WICKET! Astle b Collingwood 45 (97-4) A tame wicket but a vital one as Astle drags a nothing-ball onto his off-stump. New Zealand are finding some great ways to get out here. &quot;Given the comments already about Ed Joyce who is yet even to field a ball, can we expect him to get a shock \u00a31m, a week move to LA Galaxy tomorrow?&quot; asks... Gary Naylor. 24th over: New Zealand 97-4 (Fulton 15, McMillan 0) England are right on top here, and I make no apologies to all the OBOers who believe that my words invariably presage precisely the opposite outcome. Chaos theory gone haywire, is that.  25th over: New Zealand 101-4 (Fulton 18, McMillan 1) Fulton finally shows some initiative against Panesar, late-cutting a short ball for three to bring up New Zealand&apos;s hundred. It&apos;s turned into a right old slog.  26th over: New Zealand 105-4 (Fulton 18, McMillan 5) Craig McMillan can&apos;t get the first four balls of the square against Collingwood before tucking into a wide pie and slashing four runs through the covers. But without width, these Kiwis look strokeless. &quot;Sorry to disappoint Paul (Over 19),&quot; says Pat Colreavy. &quot;However there have been three Australians in space: Andy Thomas, Paul Scully-Power and Philip Chapman. So the score there is 3-1 to Australia. At least it is not 5-0. Has New Zealand had a sheep in space?&quot;  27th over: New Zealand 109-4 (Fulton 20, McMillan 7) One more wicket and England are into Vettori, who - in spite of his revelatory batting form in 2006 - is still a place too high to worry the bowlers. Four singles off that Panesar over as Atherton pleads with Vaughan to bring the field in. &quot;Look, this has to stop,&quot; says Alan Synnott with regards to the drool-fest over Ed Joyce. &quot;It&apos;s bad enough that you stole Ireland&apos;s best player just in time for us to get paddled in our first World Cup, but you don&apos;t have to rub our noses in it by having him win &quot;Spunkiest In Show&quot; for England. Bah!&quot; 28th over: New Zealand 111-4 (Fulton 22, McMillan 8) New Zealand are going to have to push singles for a few overs yet because of the extravagances of their top order. It&apos;s the perfect time for Colly to get through a few overs. Remember, this is the only man ever to score a hundred and take six wickets in the same ODI. Not that it&apos;s strictly relevant. Yet. Two singles off a claustrophobic over. &quot;A friend, Heather, considers young Daniel rather dishy,&quot; says Sunil, before issuing this withering conclusion: &quot;I think she needs specs like his.&quot; 29th over: New Zealand 115-4 (Fulton 24, McMillan 9) Another quiet over as Panesar keeps it on a string outside off. Fulton does get a cut away for two, but only four off it and Monty is bowling very well indeed. &quot;Three Australians in space,&quot; muses Mark Putt. &quot;Suppose it&apos;s asking too much for the rest of them to follow?&quot;  30th over: New Zealand 118-4 (Fulton 24, McMillan 10) Collingwood is keeping it tight: this is his sort of wicket. A bit slow and low and with every chance of a sickening inside edge onto the stumps. Clever, pace-varying stuff. &quot;Lawrence, you&apos;ve misrepresented my views on Lewis&apos;s hair here,&quot; complains Jonathan Cosgrove, who continues to be fascinated by a topic that is boring everyone else. Including me. &quot;I was more alluding to the fact that Lewis&apos;s haircut was like a very mouldy cherry on top of a cake (Lewis himself) that brings nothing to the dining table as it is so terribly uneatable. Do you see what I&apos;m getting at?&quot; Would it shut you up if I said that I saw exactly what you were getting at? 31st over: New Zealand 124-4 (Fulton 25, McMillan 15) Panesar drops short and wide and at last McMillan has something to hit, cutting hard through backward point for a rare boundary. Gower and Beefy would like more close fielders and they have a point: a bat-pad is not out of the question here. &quot;Regarding Sean Boiling&apos;s love affair with Ed Joyce,&quot; says Kate McDonald, &quot;I&apos;ll bow to the words of one of England&apos;s greatest yet least well-known Test cricketers, Miss Jane Austen. &apos;He is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me&apos;. I&apos;ll stick to checking out the spunk-a-licious sheep-shaggers, Sean. Daniel Vettori is still in the lead as I have yet to see what Ross Taylor looks like without a helmet. Perhaps it might be better if he keeps it on.&quot; 32nd over: New Zealand 127-4 (Fulton 28, McMillan 16) Fulton loses his patience against the parsimonious Collingwood and tries to go inside out over cover. The shot doesn&apos;t work properly, but the ball plops safely into no-man&apos;s land for a single. McMillan is then granted one by a Dalrymple overthrow. Three off the over and England are bossing this. &quot;Ah, but I do believe an Englishwoman went into space and so we lead there 1-0,&quot; says Paul. &quot;No Sheilas have been, have they? The Kiwis can&apos;t go to space they&apos;re too busy watching sheep get sheared on prime time TV over here - they are very proud of their sheep shearers.&quot; WICKET! Fulton c Vaughan b Flintoff 28 (127-5) Back comes Flintoff and he strikes with his first ball as Fulton clips an average delivery straight to Vaughan at short midwicket. Vaughan now has three catches in this innings. Some sort of record? 33rd over: New Zealand 128-5 (McMillan 16, Vettori 0) I reckon par on this pitch is 220-230, which is 60-70 fewer than Australia managed the other day. But this is New Zealand we&apos;re talking about. And if we&apos;re brutally honest, that total could well make England do more than sweat, if you&apos;ll forgive the potentially unpleasant nature of that image. Flintoff concedes an off-side wide to Daniel Vettori, but that&apos;s New Zealand&apos;s lot for the over. 34th over: New Zealand 132-5 (McMillan 18, Vettori 2) Collingwood is fiddling through a very tight spell here, despite two singles in that over for both batsmen. This is more than a bonus for England: Collingwood is very much the sixth bowler. 35th over: New Zealand 139-5 (McMillan 19, Vettori 8) England have positioned a gully and a backward point for Vettori, but he clears both with an upper-cut for four. Anderson can&apos;t cut it off on the fence and earns the ire of Beefy for not diving properly. A single to deep backward point follows - Vettori can be a dangerous off-side scyther, a kind of poor man&apos;s Sourav Ganguly - before McMillan cuts hard and late for one more. &quot;If an infinite amount of monkeys were given an infinite amount of time with an infinite number of typewriters they would complete the works of William Shakespeare without any errors,&quot; says Marc Denholm, a propos of sod all. &quot;The question is would an infinite amount of monkeys complete the work of any great Australian literature? The answer is an emphatic no because there is no such thing as great Australian literature. The monkeys would of course complete the entire script from beginning to end of Neighbours.&quot;  36th over: New Zealand 142-5 (McMillan 20, Vettori 10) Collingwood continues to prove strangely unhittable. Vettori pushes him just wide of mid-off, but McMillan plays out three full-length dot balls before cutting a ball of some width for a single. Vettori keeps the strike with an off-side dab. He&apos;s looked a lot more interested in quick singles than most of his top-order colleagues. &quot;I&apos;m ready to take bets that England will finally win a game on Australian soil,&quot; says Kate McDonald, who is obviously not an England supporter. &quot;The only thing that could prevent them winning this game is a major batting collapse...&quot; WICKET! Vettori lbw b Panesar 11 (144-6) Panesar wins the battle of the left-arm spinners thanks to a generous leg-before decision by Asad Rauf. Vettori tried to sweep a ball that was too close to him but I reckon there was every chance that was missing leg. Vettori doesn&apos;t look happy and New Zealand are in deep trouble. &quot;Neighbours actually is written by monkeys,&quot; points out Celia Ujvari. 37th over: New Zealand 146-6 (McMillan 22, Franklin 1) At last Vaughan goes on the attack - a silly point and a leg-slip to James Franklin, who gets off the mark first ball. Hawkeye has the Panesar lbw appeal missing leg. WICKET! McMillan c and b Collingwood 22 (146-7) McMillan plays too early at a slower ball from Collingwood and provides him with an easy return catch at knee height just to his left. New Zealand are in tatters: if they reach 200 here they will be thrilled. 38th over: New Zealand 146-7 (Franklin 1, Bond 0) New Zealand&apos;s task now is to bat out the overs. If they do, they might get 190. If they don&apos;t, surely - surely! - even England can&apos;t lose this one. &quot;Yes, I can confirm that this is the most catches ever made by Vaughan... in an ODI against NZ in Australia,&quot; arf arfs Ian Gibson. A wicket maiden. 39th over: New Zealand 151-7 (Franklin 6, Bond 0) Franklin steals a pair of twos off Panesar, the first of them thanks for a Flintoff overthrow from widish mid-on. Five off the over represents riches for New Zealand. &quot;Why didn&apos;t one of those three astronauts take our prime minister into space with them and dock him in perpetuity on the International Space Station?&quot; wonders Kate McDonald. 40th over: New Zealand 153-7 (Franklin 7, Bond 1) Collingwood begins his 10th and final over with figures of 2 for 23 - an analysis of which Glenn McGrath would be proud. Worth an MBE, perhaps? While Her Maj chews over that one, Franklin nurdles his first ball to third man for a single and it&apos;s noticeable that Collingwood is limping slightly. Please tell me he isn&apos;t injured too? He completes the over, which suggests it can&apos;t be anything too serious, but you never know with this England side and this tour. Shane Bond finally gets off the mark with an edgy single into the leg-side and Collingwood finishes with figures of 10-1-25-2. Superb stuff. 41st over: New Zealand 154-7 (Franklin 7, Bond 2) Panesar continues, and I wonder whether we&apos;ll see a few overs for James Dalrymple, especially as Lewis has been expensive in a low-scorer. Bond collects a quick single, but Franklin is struggling to get the ball away. It&apos;s been the story of a stodgy New Zealand innings. How therapeutic this must be after all those maulings at the hands of you-know-who. 42nd over: New Zealand 160-7 (Franklin 12, Bond 2) And here comes Dalrymple. Just call me Michael Vaughan. I think the only error the real Vaughan - in case you were getting confused - has made all day was to give Lewis a short second spell instead of bringing Dalrymple on. A lack of pace on the ball has proved hard to get away so far. Bond takes a leg-bye before Franklin again picks up another pair of twos and keeps the strike with a sweep for one. 43rd over: New Zealand 167-7 (Franklin 13, Bond 3) A loose over to end Panesar&apos;s spell: a leg-side wide that is converted into three by the batsmen and two leg-side leg-byes. Still, he would have taken 1 for 36 off 10. &quot;Hate to get all factual on you,&quot; says Liam Padden in Sydney, &quot;but both Neigbours and Home and Away first have their ridiculous storylines thought up by a committee, then their inane dialogue written by young writers on a per episode basis. I know this cos a couple of people I know do the odd Home and Away or Neighbours episode (the inane dialogue part). As for Aussie literature, didn&apos;t Peter Carey win a couple of your Booker prizes?&quot; 44th over: New Zealand 169-7 (Franklin 14, Bond 4) Back comes Lewis, which shows what I know (see the blatherings in 42nd over). England don&apos;t want New Zealand to get 200 here - that could be quite a challenging total on this pitch. Lewis starts with a 70mph off-cutter, which shows he&apos;s thinking. And - hang on! - is that a limp from Vaughan as he fields that Bond push for one into the covers. Is it the left knee? Should we be worried? I am. &quot;I captain Thorndon CC here in Wellington,&quot; says Colin Gerrard. &quot;At what point does it become safe for me &amp; my fellow &apos;Englisher&apos; to start baiting our Kiwi teammates? Tomorrow?&quot; Two off the over - but a real scare for Vaughan. 45th over: New Zealand 172-7 (Franklin 17, Bond 4) Flintoff returns but Franklin, who has a Test hundred to his name, cuts his first ball hard for two. This has turned into the definitive pesky partnership as far as England are concerned. There has been a lack of killer instinct in the last few overs. No more news on Vaughan yet, although my guess is that England will play the hobbling down. Five overs left. Can New Zealand get 200? If they do, they can make a game of it. Here&apos;s Paul, a little prematurely: &quot;Helen Clark, Richie McCaw, Colin Meads, Peter Snell, Tana Umaga, Paul Holmes, Edmund Hillary, Wayne Shelford, Richard Hadlee are you watching? Your boys are taking a hell of a beating.&quot; 46th over: New Zealand 181-7 (Franklin 20, Bond 10) New Zealand are playing this sensibly, which sounds mad when they&apos;ve only got 170-odd on the board. But they&apos;re a strong fielding side and England&apos;s confidence is low. And there&apos;s four more as Bond hits Lewis inside-out: nine off the over! The Aussies, all of whom are barred from taking part in this OBO, are furious at Marc Denholm&apos;s jibe about their literature. &quot;He must not have heard of Patrick White (well, let&apos;s face it - who has?) the Australian author and recipient of the 1973 Nobel Prize for Literature,&quot; says Peter Byrne. &quot;Also, does anyone still keep count of how many Australians win the Booker Prize? I believe Aussie Peter Carey is the only author to win it twice.&quot; WICKET! Franklin c Collingwood b Flintoff 20 (185-8) The highest stand of the innings ends when Franklin hits Flintoff inside-out to Collingwood at a very deep and wide mid-off. Just to warn you in advance that Rob Smyth will be covering the England reply, so save all your witticisms for him: rob.smyth@theguardian.com.  47th over: New Zealand 186-8 (Bond 14, Gillespie 0) Two-hundred will be a big psychological boost for New Zealand after being 146-7. I can&apos;t help feeling England have let them off the hook. 48th over: New Zealand 196-8 (Bond 15, Gillespie 9) Back comes Anderson, who sends down two horrible short balls to Mark Gillespie. The result: a mow for two followed by a mow for four. Gillespie then plays the ramp shot over the non-existent slips for two more and New Zealand are finishing this innings on a high, which is more than can be said for Anderson: 10 off it. &quot;To continue with Marc Denholm&apos;s fascination with cliches, I think the term &apos;clutching at straws&apos; is appropriate,&quot; says Kate McDonald. &quot;By the way, if there aren&apos;t many XY OBOers of Australian extraction in correspondence, that&apos;s probably because Maria Sharapova is currently taking a trot around the tennis court, another game that we are better than you at.&quot; I thought I&apos;d told you you were banned. 49th over: New Zealand 200-8 (Bond 18, Gillespie 9) Up comes New Zealand&apos;s 200, but it was a good over by Flintoff, who finishes with 2 for 37 off 10. But - and I can&apos;t quite get rid of this nagging feeling - are New Zealand back in the game? &quot;Marc Denholm should be careful denigrating Neighbours with Celebrity Big Brother on most of the channels I can get,&quot; points out Gary Naylor. WICKET! Gillespie b Anderson 9 (205-9) Well, that total is still below par as Gillespie misses a mow off the last ball of the innings to give Anderson his fourth wicket, but it&apos;s a lot more than New Zealand were expecting at 146 for 7. I reckon it&apos;s 70-30 England right now. If Australia were batting it would be 97-3.

But this time, instead of taking a guidebook, I was going to rely entirely on the recommendations of people I had met only on the internet. Instead of using what was already there, I wanted to instigate a set of conversations so that I could tailor my itinerary. And so, in mid-November, I set about the task.  First I needed a hotel. My posting on the Lonely Planet&apos;s Thorn Tree (thorntree.lonelyplanet.com) yielded plenty of useful suggestions, but the Lloyd Hotel (lloydhotel.com) stood out because it has five different grades of room (from \u00a362 for a one-star room to \u00a3295 for a five-star suite) combined with a communal dining area and a three-storey library and arts space open to all.  Next, I wanted to sample a local delicacy. After posting on the forums of travellersconnected.com, native Amsterdammer Dalexander came back with a seasonal dish called oliebollen, basically a sugary, bread-like donut that is eaten on New Year&apos;s Eve.  While you tend to get a lot of random advice, you soon sense whose information you&apos;re likely to trust. I liked the detail of the oliebollen so emailed Dalexander for more tips. He came back quickly with advice about Indonesian restaurants in the city, so I added them to my list. The first, Sama Sebo (samasebo.nl) was shut for Christmas, but Puri Mas (purimas.nl) turned out to be lovely - I can recommend the seafood rijsttafel, a multi-storey feast of curry, satay and rice.  But where to spend New Year&apos;s Eve? On virtualtourist.com, one user enthused about the Supper Club (supperclub.nl), but that was fully booked. Dam Square was also mentioned, but that felt too obvious. Then another user promised a midnight maelstrom of Disney-like fireworks and noise in the Neiuwmart, which is where I ended up. More fireworks than I care to remember but the sound of the claxons heralding the new year from ships out in the harbour will live long in the memory.  So how good was my first user- generated holiday? Pretty good. But here are three tips of my own if you&apos;re thinking about planning a trip this way. First, cast a wide net by using more than one site and posting at different times; second, ask questions and try to turn your posts into conversation; and third, don&apos;t cram too much in. One of my best afternoons was when I left my user-generated plans in my pocket and let Amsterdam take me where it pleased.  \u00b7 Eurostar (eurostar.com, 08705 186186) Waterloo-Amsterdam via Brussels from \u00a369 return. sean.dodson@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["I wanted to go to Amsterdam for New Year&apos;s Eve.", "After posting on the forums of travellersconnected.com, native Amsterdammer Dalexander came back with a seasonal dish called oliebollen, basically a sugary, bread-like donut that is eaten on New Year&apos;s Eve.", "One of my best afternoons was when I left my user-generated plans in my pocket and let Amsterdam take me where it pleased.", "\u00b7 Eurostar (eurostar.com, 08705 186186) Waterloo-Amsterdam via Brussels from \u00a369 return."], "title": "Best of the net", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/jan/20/saturday.shortbreaks.amsterdam", "tags": ["Best of the net", "Travel", "Short breaks", "Amsterdam holidays", "Travel websites"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-01-21T12:13:53Z", "article": "The paint is thickly caked on the canvas, just as the dirt appears to be heavily layered on the arms and the collar of the pilgrim&apos;s cloak, yet this impoverished Saint James is likely to fetch more than \u00a312m when he is sold at auction on Thursday in New York. The portrait by Rembrandt, dated 1661, comes from the final decade of the painter&apos;s life, when he was facing penury in Amsterdam. It is one of a mysterious group of works that has intrigued art historians for many years. They are all sensitive character studies of predominantly New Testament figures, but it has remained unclear why they were painted. This portrayal of Saint James the Greater is the only one of Rembrandt&apos;s late religious pictures to remain in private hands and, during preparation for its sale as the jewel in the crown of Sotheby&apos;s Old Masters auction, the close study of its surface has shed new light on both the life of its creator and on the group of paintings to which it belongs. Restoration has also stripped away the grey varnish that had been applied many years after the work was finished to reveal the rich brown hues that Rembrandt had intended. &apos;The overall effect is very brown, but when you look more closely the browns are actually all composed of a variety of colours placed side by side,&apos; said George Gordon, of Sotheby&apos;s, one of the experts who has been working on the painting with Rembrandt restorer Martin Bijl. &apos;Rembrandt understood, just as the Impressionists would later, exactly how to use colours together to build up another colour, but he used it to different effect.&apos; During the examination of the canvas it became clear from the evidence of a small hole in one corner of the work that the paint had originally been applied while the canvas was pulled flat by ropes, a method common in Rembrandt&apos;s day. Gordon now believes the painting did not go on to be placed on a conventional wooden &apos;stretcher&apos; before eventually being framed. He argues instead that it was probably destined to fill a space in a panelled wall in a private home, along with four or five other portraits of apostles Rembrandt completed in this period. Such a religious commission would have been a last-ditch attempt to get his finances back in order after official bankruptcy and the general decline in his reputation as his work fell out of favour. Rembrandt&apos;s previous commission, for a series of works to line the walls of a town hall, had just been rejected. How different things are now. Gordon believes private collectors will compete for the picture, which is now one of the most admired of Rembrandt&apos;s later works. For Gordon, the saint&apos;s hands, clearly hands which know hard work and poverty, make this a remarkably real picture of the disciple. &apos;The hands were intended to be the focal point of the painting.&apos; The hands are the key to the painting of a holy man who is leading a life of self-denial. &apos;This Saint James is filthy. You can see he probably stank to high heaven,&apos; said Gordon. Arthur Wheelock, the curator of a recent Washington exhibition of Rembrandt&apos;s late religious figures, agrees: &apos;He depicted these biblical figures as real people, not as idealised heroes, but as men and women who walked the earth with passions and beliefs, with fears and anxieties similar to those felt by the rest of humanity.&apos;", "sentences": ["The portrait by Rembrandt, dated 1661, comes from the final decade of the painter&apos;s life, when he was facing penury in Amsterdam."], "title": "Bidders fight for mystery Rembrandt", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/21/artnews.art", "tags": ["UK news", "Art", "Culture", "Art and design", "Rembrandt"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-01-24T09:00:00Z", "article": "&quot;Amsterdam ain&apos;t a nice place off your face&quot;, as the inimitable Mike Skinner once said. I quite agree, and would add Hebron to the list - off or on your face, it just ain&apos;t a nice place, full stop. Settlers to the left of me, militiamen to my right, here I was, stuck in the middle with Alex. We met the group in Jerusalem, boarded the coach, took our seats and sized up the other passengers. I could have described them with my eyes closed - a fairly predictable mix of the denizens of left-wing liberalism sat perched on the cushioned seats. Long haired, kipa sporting Israeli men, middle-aged Scandinavian women with accusing eyes, older, sager grandparents with weather beaten faces and young girls with heavily pierced visages, dripping with beads and sequins. My choice of a tracksuit made me look like some kind of escapee from JD Sports, and firmly marked me as one of the outsiders. As I settled back for a relaxing iPod session, the PA crackled into life and the grating tones of an Israeli speaking broken English assaulted my eardrums. Yehuda, a founding member of Breaking The Silence - the group leading the tour - wasted no time in giving us a detailed history of the troubled city of Hebron. An ex-commander of a combat unit stationed in Hebron, Yehuda had formed Breaking The Silence as a means of exposing the harsh realities of the local Palestinians&apos; lives under military occupation. A genial bloke, with a long ponytail, beard and kipa, he kindled hope within me that leopards can change their spots. It was apparent that his current guise as apologist was a form of self-help for a soldier who&apos;d seen and done too much, too young. His speech was akin to hearing a reformed wife-beater narrating a slide show of some of the more savage injuries he&apos;d inflicted on his spouse. As we traversed the countryside between Jerusalem and Hebron, we passed the checkpoint by Bet Jalla where I had spent a month during my own tour of duty. An over-eager peace protestor had daubed &quot;Apartheid Wall of Shame&quot; on an overhanging stretch of concrete alongside the road. Noble sentiments indeed - pity it was only a bus shelter that found itself on the receiving end of the confused vandal&apos;s wrath. A more sombre experience however, was watching Arab workers constructing the real security barrier as we got deeper into the West Bank - I couldn&apos;t help likening the image to that of Jews being forced to dig their own graves in some clearing of a Polish forest 60 years ago ... I was recently accused by a reader of falsedichotomies of being more concerned about Israel&apos;s image than I was about the plight of the Palestinians. She was half right. I like to think my pathos for any victim of abuse ranks higher than my shame at Israel&apos;s reputation, but at the same time I suffer greatly on days like today. As in Al-Nueman, I found myself looking around at the non-Jewish, non-Israeli faces and quoting another Streets song: &quot;Has it come to this?&quot; Again, here we were in the Middle East safari park, watching the creatures in their native environs, tutting at the bullying tactics of the mighty Israelis as they subjugated the cowering Palestinians. It hurts me - and I&apos;m glad it does. Until the day that Israel can hold its head up high and be the &quot;light unto the nations&quot; that our billboards proclaim we are, then I&apos;ll still be taking trips like these and shifting uncomfortably in my seat as the world wags its finger. Once through the settlement of Kiryat Arba and into Hebron proper, we alighted and spent the rest of the tour on foot. Everything was perfect - the sun blazed away in a cloudless sky, the border police monkeys dragged their knuckles noisily along the gravel as they accompanied our group and the settler zealots stared menacingly at us as we weaved our way round the city. The place seemed like a ghost town - as usual - boarded up shops, demolished blocks of flats and not a car on the streets. The only other pedestrians were the aforementioned mobs of settlers swaggering around with their ancient rifles acting like Orangemen in Drumcree, and the occasional couple of Palestinian residents sidling up the alleyways. Yehuda took the opportunity every 30 metres or so to halt our progress and recite another anecdote of Jew-on-Arab violence, interspersed with a few acknowledgments of Palestinian atrocities that had also taken place. I tuned out after the first few sorry tales - I&apos;d heard it all before, and don&apos;t see the value in sifting through the minutiae of every incident in gory detail. The whole thing could be far easier summarised thus: Settlers run riot, the army turns a blind eye, the Palestinians react, the army comes down on them like a ton of bricks, the world keeps turning. Trite, but that&apos;s Hebron in a nutshell. More important is the issue of where do we go from here? And the answer is not immediately obvious - to this observer, at least. Yehuda&apos;s use of the word pogrom to describe the regular rampages of the settlers through the Arab market evoked uncomfortable images of pre-war Eastern Europe - though I suppose that was his point. However, I was more put out by the plain ignorance of our group - banal, glaringly obvious questions were de rigueur, as well as an obsession for taking pictures of soldiers interrogating the local Palestinians. A picture may tell a thousand words, but the problem here was that the tour group had no idea what it was like to be a scared, young soldier confronted with potentially mortal danger every minute they were out on patrol. It is all too easy to take a photo of the paramilitary thug harassing the poor Palestinian and flaunt it as evidence to all your mates back in Switzerland, but the soldier&apos;s only doing his job. The real issue is the blanket refusal by the government to rein in their expansionist plans for the settlements, which gives carte blanche to the right wing nationalists to continue their daily incitement of the other side. Not that the photo of the soldier isn&apos;t linked to the government&apos;s West Bank policy, but I feel that people don&apos;t see the wood for the trees if they concentrate too hard on the street-level imagery. We wound up in the garden of a hospitable Palestinian family who evidently are old hands at recounting their plight to Breaking The Silence groups. Whilst taking their testimony with the required pinch of salt, I was dismayed to learn we wouldn&apos;t be meeting with their settler counterparts. In the name of balance, I felt it wrong that we only heard one side of the story, but perhaps it was for the best that we didn&apos;t get some religious headcase launching a vitriolic verbal attack on his non-Jewish neighbours. Yehuda then surprised us all and gave an eloquent final address, speaking of his own personal experience of defending the land of our forefathers. It was a moving testimony, and left us with plenty of food for thought. Which was great, but food for my stomach was a far more pressing need at that point - man does not live by one early morning bareka alone, and it was now gone three. So it was off to eat, drink and give thanks that the safari park of Hebron is just that - an educational day out, and not representative of the rest of Israel&apos;s more sedate cities.", "sentences": ["&quot;Amsterdam ain&apos;t a nice place off your face&quot;, as the inimitable Mike Skinner once said."], "title": "Uncomfortable truths", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/24/hebronawayboys", "tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-01-25T02:05:42Z", "article": "Heikki Kovalainen is yet to make his formula one debut but Renault are pinning their hopes for the future on the young Finn following the world champion Fernando Alonso&apos;s move to McLaren.

What began in 1974 when seven student instrumentalists got together with their teacher, Reinbert de Leeuw, to perform Schoenberg&apos;s Pierrot Lunaire has steadily diversified. At first, the group concentrated on the music of the Second Viennese School, but gradually its scope expanded: now the Schoenberg Ensemble has a core lineup of 14 musicians and a repertoire that stretches from the beginning of the 20th century to the present day. This mammoth retrospective set is a treasure trove of the ensemble&apos;s performances from the last 20 years, as well as an endlessly fascinating journey through the music of the 20th century. Many of the tracks derive from live recordings made by Dutch radio, others are studio sessions rescued from discs that have either been deleted after a brief life in the catalogue, or were never commercially released. The playing is fiercely concentrated and precise; De Leeuw conducts most of the performances in his typically no-nonsense way, but Oliver Knussen takes charge of the concert performance of Henze&apos;s opera Elegy for Young Lovers, as well as works by Percy Grainger and Ruth Crawford Seeger. For some works that require a larger band, the Ensemble joins forces with their fellow Amsterdamers of the Asko Ensemble. The collection begins where the ensemble began, with works from the mainspring of modernism - Schoenberg&apos;s First Chamber Symphony and Pierrot Lunaire (a performance from 1988 with the marvellous German actress Barbara Sukowa as reciter), as well as a collection of Webern&apos;s songs with soprano Dorothy Dorow. There follow discs devoted to Mahler and Zemlinsky, Janacek, Stravinsky and Milhaud (works from the 1920s), as well as Knussen&apos;s quirky mixture of Crawford Seeger and Grainger. Then it&apos;s on to the second half of the century with Boulez, Stockhausen, Kurtag (including his extraordinary Beckett setting What is the Word?), Rihm, an all-Italian disc and a Ligeti collection that includes Melodien and the Violin Concerto. De Leeuw&apos;s own enthusiasms show up in discs of Ustvolskaya, Gubaidulina, Isang Yun, and Louis Andriessen&apos;s superbly austere setting of St Augustine, De Tijd. The final disc is devoted to contemporary Dutch composers including Michel Van der Aa and Elmer Schoenberger, who has also written the magnificent 628-page book, bilingual in Dutch and English, that accompanies the set. There are three DVDs too. One of them, Claude Vivier&apos;s R\u00eaves de Marco Polo, exactly duplicates an Opus Arte release from last year, but another is devoted to a production by Herbert Wernicke of Mauricio Kagel&apos;s &quot;lieder opera in 25 pictures&quot; Aus Deutschland, in which the imagery of the German romantic poets is woven into a sequence of tableaux that seems simultaneously indebted to the 19th-century lieder tradition and something quite separate. It makes an interesting comparison with De Leeuw&apos;s own Im Wundersch\u00f6nen Monat Mai, a reworking with a minimal staging of 21 Schubert and Schumann songs into a dramatic vehicle for the compelling Barbara Sukowa, who sings, yells and declaims the texts while the ensemble mulls over the original melodies and accompaniments.

But as I pressed my hand against the MiSense scanner at Heathrow, I reflected that I had been fingerprinted at the US border a couple of times already. That biometric data is being held indefinitely. This record, I was assured, would be destroyed at the end of the MiSense Plus trial. After signing a form that gave the Home Office permission to search the national police computer for evidence of any wrongdoing, my passport was inspected and the photo page copied, my irises scanned (twice, because the first attempt failed) my fingerprints read and my face photographed and digitised. Within a minute, I had a card containing all 13 pieces of biometric data. Apart from the lack of a visible mugshot, it was an ID card in all but name. The first string of numbers and letters began &quot;IDGBR&quot;, followed by an identity number, my date of birth, a number from my passport and my name in machine-readable format. It would be activated as soon as the police computer had cleared me and, were I planning to fly Emirates to Dubai or Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong, would enable me to bypass the immigration queue on my return. Instead of queuing to have their passport inspected by an immigration officer, MiSense passengers insert their card into a gate similar to a tube barrier, and then press their right index finger against a pad. This, Stephen Challis of the British Airports Authority told me, is sophisticated enough to detect a pulse and detect a false latex fingertip or - it has been known - a finger that has been permanently separated from its original owner. That should make forging a fingertip using existing techniques extremely difficult. Producing a fake biometric card is, Huw Farmer of the UK Immigration Service admits, &quot;probably not impossible&quot;. But the biometrics industry is, he says, in a state of &quot;continuous evolution&quot;. &quot;We&apos;re not in the business of creating holey sieves,&quot; adds Challis. But why the need to collect so many biometrics, when the MiSense barriers only require a scan of the right index finger? &quot;We are testing equipment reliability, customer experience and staff operation,&quot; says Challis. &quot;Taking all 13 biometrics at the time of enrolment also paves the way - obviously subject to agreements between governments and participants - for some kind of international inter-operability.&quot; That phrase reveals what makes MiSense much more interesting to airports, airlines and immigration authorities. Offering travellers a faster passage through the airport in return for their biometric details is not new: Schiphol airport, in Amsterdam, has been doing it for years, and charging them an annual fee for the privilege. Right now, MiSense is only available on a couple of regular flights from Terminal 3, and so is of little use to the vast majority of travellers, though it does grant you fast-track immigration clearance at Hong Kong international airport. But the next stage, MiSense AllClear, will pave the way for advance passenger information (API) to be shared between the immigration services before a passenger&apos;s flight takes off. Criminal conviction In theory, this would mean that, say, US border control would be able to access biometric and other data about an individual as soon as he or she checked in at Heathrow and scanned their MiSense card and fingerprint. The same would apply for a foreign passenger checking in to fly to Britain. It is not hard to imagine why governments would be keen on a system that screened would-be visitors before they even stepped foot on the air bridge. It is also worth noting that no one with a criminal conviction, no matter how minor, is issued with a MiSense Plus card. That would certainly appeal to countries like the US, which make a clean record a condition of visa-free entry. Collecting all 13 biometrics also means that if Australia wants iris scans and Canada the left index finger, travelling Britons will be able to meet all the possible demands. MiSense, in other words, is not just a useful testing-ground for the forthcoming ID card and ePassport, or even merely a fast track through Heathrow. It is a foretaste of much more stringent, biometrically-driven border controls which, if they work, will make it far harder for a suspect to borrow another traveller&apos;s passport in order to flee the country. Challis compares the scheme to a &quot;powerful magnet&quot; that enables border control staff to find the needles lurking in the haystack while sweeping away law-abiding, low-risk travellers. If an American Airlines and an Air India flight landed at virtually the same time, for example, US passengers armed with their biometric data would no longer have to tap their feet impatiently while the higher-risk Indian passengers were scrutinised by immigration staff. They could pass through immigration without even having to speak to an officer. The MiSense pilot is not the first biometric trial to have taken place at Heathrow. The airport has already experimented with iris scanners, with mixed results. A Home Office report on the pilot quietly filed in the House of Commons library last December reveals that the biometric rejection rate - the percentage of passengers rejected - was well above the target of less than 2%. At the beginning of the trial, the scanners were failing to recognise more than one traveller in every 20, though the software suppliers contended that some of those people might not be signed up to the scheme and could have tried to use the barrier by mistake. Nonetheless, the government announced earlier this month that the first-generation identity card, due to be issued to foreign nationals living in the UK in 2008, will not use iris scanning.", "sentences": ["Offering travellers a faster passage through the airport in return for their biometric details is not new: Schiphol airport, in Amsterdam, has been doing it for years, and charging them an annual fee for the privilege."], "title": "The world at your fingertips", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jan/26/businesssense.businesssense8", "tags": ["Technology", "Biometrics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-01-26T23:53:19Z", "article": "Imagine sending your child to a school with only 13 students, from six different countries, where teachers speak English and French and where pupils undertake physical education on stage before thousands of people every night. Welcome to the Cirque du Soleil school. The school is currently housed on the second floor of the Royal Albert Hall in London, the location for the presentation of Alegria, one of several touring shows of the Cirque du Soleil. If the school is less than typical, so is its classroom. The high ceilings, the red tapestry and a statue sitting on the window bench are far from the d\u00e9cor you would find in your average British classroom. Look out the window and you have an incredible view over Hyde Park. Such opulent surroundings are not the norm for these students - four are artists in the show and the other nine are performers&apos; children who follow their parents on the world tour - who are more used to attending lessons in a caravan. Cirque du Soleil tour shows are often called &quot;villages on wheels&quot;. They are self-contained encampments, with their own kitchen, offices and school that, over the past 12 years the show has been on the road, have pitched up in more than 50 cities. Usually the crew erects a huge blue and yellow tent on an available space and parks its 60 trailers carrying 800 tons of equipment on site. The tour even has its own power source. The three teachers who accompany the show share the tasks of teaching the usual curriculum subjects, such as English, mathematics and science. The main difference is that they educate students of different ages - from six to 19 - at different levels of ability. &quot;Our students are very independent learners. They know that we cannot spend a full hour with them so what we do is we will teach them, at a very early age, how to be independent,&quot; explains Muriel Barret, a teacher who has been on tour with the circus for the past eight years. &quot;We work for maybe 15 minutes with the grade one students and then they have activities to do by themselves. We can then switch to the other group of students.&quot; As Cirque du Soleil is a product from the Canadian province of Quebec, the education programme from that region is taught to students, in either French or English, according to the parental choice. The education system in Quebec is similar to that in the UK. Normally students have completed high school, after a series of national exams, by the age of 16 or 17, which would be the equivalent of passing GCSEs. Teenagers can then go on to college for two or three years and continue on to university level if they wish. As this is not a &quot;regular&quot; school, it has an agreement with the \u00c9cole National de Cirque (National Circus School) in Canada that handles student enrolments and qualification certificates. Teachers attend regular conferences to keep their skills up to date. The school hours are also different from regular schools. Classes start at noon and finish at 6pm. And there are no long summer holidays for these 13 students. Instead, the school year is spread across 12 months, with 184 teaching days as required by the Quebec education system, and follows the tour plan schedule. Field trips are also a little less ordinary. A history class on the second world war was given in Anne Frank&apos;s house when the tour stopped in Amsterdam. While in London, the students plan to visit the Globe Theatre. &quot;We try to use the people around us because we don&apos;t have as many resources as the ones we have in Montreal. For home economics, [students] may do some cooking in the kitchen of the circus. They are also going to do some woodwork and electricity course with the technicians,&quot; says Ms Barret. She says the small class sizes and school format means she has a privileged relationship with her students. &quot;I think we are quite close to the children because we sometimes have them for several years as our students. We sometimes even live at the same place. We go to the premiere parties together and we know the parents quite well. So it is quite different than a regular school,&quot; she explains. Such a relationship between teachers and students is often hard to develop when there is an average of 25 students for every teacher in Quebec. Maria Silaeva, a student and Russian artist who has been with the show for the past six years, agrees. &quot;I enjoy circus school because it&apos;s more fun. I have time to talk to teachers, even about personal stuff. In a regular school, you can&apos;t really talk to teachers.&quot; She does, however, admit that performing and studying for exams is sometimes a bit of a juggling act. The 19-year-old will graduate from high school next month and a special ceremony is being planed to mark the achievement. The Cirque du Soleil school does not provide further education courses, but offers career advice and its teachers are available to give as much support as they can. Ms Silaeva plans to take six to 12 months off when she&apos;s finished high school, but she is considering taking a long-distance course to train to become an interior designer. As for Ms Barret, returning to teach in a regular school is not in her immediate plans. &quot;I don&apos;t think I will be fit to go back to a normal school. I&apos;m used to this school and I like it. I really like the multicultural aspect of it and I enjoy the travelling,&quot; she says with a laugh. \u00b7 Alegria runs at the Royal Hall until February 11.", "sentences": ["A history class on the second world war was given in Anne Frank&apos;s house when the tour stopped in Amsterdam."], "title": "When the circus comes to town", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jan/26/schools.uk", "tags": ["Schools", "Education", "UK news", "Cirque du Soleil"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-01-27T23:57:29Z", "article": "My husband and I have always been keen travellers, and since having two children we have travelled around the UK much more - enjoying seeking out those remote, out-of-the-way places. Until last year, we divided the roles along sexist lines: he drove, I navigated. I developed a reputation as the supreme navigator - getting us out of long traffic jams by long and winding alternatives. However, things changed last year when I decided to follow my heart and buy a VW camper van. I drive it all the time and now really enjoy taking the family on trips to far-flung campsites. My husband is happy to be relieved of his driving role but has not whole-heartedly embraced that of the navigator. So much so that he has offered to buy me a satellite navigation system for my birthday. But which one? I&apos;d like something simple to operate; easy to take out of the van to reduce theft; that has good coverage of the UK and possibly Europe, and, if it needs to be computer-connected to upgrade maps, one that works with a Mac.Jo Sweeney, Greenford, Middx I so know what you mean! When I drive I provide supreme navigating skills (believe it or not I am a trained military navigator), giving clear instructions well in advance, warning of turnings to come as we get closer, etc. My boyfriend is a great driver but a completely rubbish navigator. &quot;Turn left,&quot; he says as we are at the actual turn. So I too got a sat nav. To buy a good one you need to spend at least \u00a3200. The really top models are \u00a3399 and only you can really answer if all the functions they provide are useful to you. These vary from Bluetooth technology, so you can use your mobile through them, to also doubling up as an MP3 player. My advice would be to just get what you need and not be seduced by all the extras. Like with all electronic &quot;toys&quot;, great advances are made and in a few years you may want to update when you have more of an idea of what you need/how you use the sat nav. Two, some of the extra options aren&apos;t quite as great as they sound. For example, a sat nav that is also an MP3 player for example, isn&apos;t going to sound as great as a dedicated MP3 player. Which? magazine did a report this month on sat navs and the two makes that came out top are also the two you should concentrate on: Garmin (0808 238 0000) and TomTom (+31 (0)20-850 0800). TomTom machines are Mac- and PC-friendly; Garmin in-car sat navs are currently not Mac-friendly. That said, I&apos;ve always had problems updating my TomTom via the web on my Mac (you&apos;re meant to be able to update the maps periodically, as they get updated by the map supplier, but I&apos;ve never been able to do this), and I&apos;ve found the customer support useless - the customer-service department is in Amsterdam for a start, so you even have to pay for the privilege of calling. Garmin didn&apos;t use to allow you to search for an address by postcode (essential I think), which made its sat navs second runners (in my opinion) to TomToms, but that has now been rectified. So which to go for? If you really think you&apos;ll be touring Europe then you&apos;d be mad not to get those complete maps (not just the major roads of Europe, which some have) pre-installed as it&apos;s cheaper to do it at the time of purchase, otherwise you&apos;re looking at least \u00a360-\u00a3150 to have them added on. In which case, look at the TomTom Go 710, \u00a3349 (the next one up, the 910, also has maps of the USA and Canada, in case you plan to go even further and they only cost an extra \u00a350 at \u00a3399). If touring mainland Europe is less likely in the next few years then I&apos;d go for the cheapest model, the TomTom One Regional, \u00a3199, which has complete maps of the UK and Ireland. TomTom does have a very useful extra function in that it can navigate you to &quot;points of interest&quot; - petrol stations (a godsend in certain situations), parks, post offices, etc. It&apos;s by no means exhaustive, however. In the Garmin range, the N\u00fcvi 660 is the top of the range, \u00a3399.99, and has maps of the UK and Europe. It also has speed-camera locations built in and warns you (by &quot;speaking&quot; to you) about when they are coming up, and it has a real-time traffic receiver so it can tell you of jams as you near them. The cheapest in the range is the C510, \u00a3200, which is a basic model that has only the UK and Ireland pre-loaded. All the models mentioned are easy to take out of the car and take with you. In terms of function, it&apos;ll probably come down to which you find most useful and which you like the look of. Whichever you go for, please don&apos;t ever rely solely on a sat-nav system! Especially in out-of-the-way places, where they can get confused.

But then it&apos;s not every farmer who is also a supreme interpreter of JS Bach, and sometimes there&apos;s simply no time to change from one identity to another. Besides, Sir John Eliot Gardiner wouldn&apos;t see that the roles are necessarily separate. For him, farming is as much in his blood as Cantata BWV 167 or the works of Rameau, Purcell or Mozart. Settling back in his chair in the kitchen at Gore Farm in loveliest Dorset, it is immediately obvious that this is where he is happiest. This is home. This is where he draws breath before the next great project, and where he comes to find peace, inspiration and the reassuring comfort of the changing seasons. It&apos;s also where he comes to roll up his sleeves and get stuck in. There are 650 acres out there that need attention, and while he simply hasn&apos;t time to run the farm first-hand, he keeps as close an eye on the day-to-day business of agriculture as he does on the intonation of the second altos. &apos;I can be walking down Park Avenue in New York and get a call about steers escaping or lambs with pasteurella&apos;, he says. &apos;It&apos;s deeply frustrating not to have more time here. When we are abroad with the choir [the Monteverdi Choir, which he established while at Cambridge in the Sixties and which is regarded as one of the world&apos;s finest] or, say, the London Symphony Orchestra, we&apos;re lucky to get even the occasional weekend here. The woods and the farm are such a replenishment.&apos; And what woods they are. We are looking out through the French windows to a fine stand of beech, oak, ash and sycamore, resplendent in their autumnal red and gold. Out in the meadow, fat sheep graze contentedly, while up on the wilder downs horned cattle make noble silhouettes against a glowering, stormy sky. He&apos;s particularly proud of these cattle. They&apos;re French Aubracs, a breed found in Aveyron-Loz\u00e8re, but unique in this country. He has 85 pedigree animals and another 40 crossbreeds - mostly &apos;shorbracs&apos;: shorthorn and Aubrac crosses. They&apos;re gorgeous to look at with their distinctive horns, creamy brown hides and big, film-star eyes. John Eliot gave two to the Prince of Wales as a birthday present, and when he came to be knighted, Charles (standing in for the Queen) leant forward and, as he dubbed him on each shoulder, whispered: &apos;Thanks for the cows.&apos; John Eliot warms to his theme. &apos;The breed doesn&apos;t seem to have caught on here; maybe its because of their horns. We like to keep them on; it helps them establish their pecking order.&apos; He began in 1994, buying 12 heifers and a bullock from France, and then a farmer in Norfolk sold him 15 heifers and a bull. &apos;We&apos;ve built it up gradually, introducing new bloodlines and breeding carefully. They look so good in this landscape. Up on the downs around the Iron Age forts they look magnificent, as though they have always been here.&apos; The Gardiner family feel as though they have always been here, too. &apos;My father was one of the first truly organic farmers and a founder member of the Soil Association. He started in 1927 down the vale two miles away, embarking on land reclamation in Cranborne Chase after much of it had been felled for shipbuilding and the railways. &apos;It was a broken-down landscape of scree and brambles, gorse and rabbits. With my great-uncle [the composer] Henry Balfour Gardiner, he established four million trees over the next 30 years. Initially, he employed up to 30 men who were glad to have the work in forestry when agriculture was so depressed in the Twenties. &apos;Forestry is about the long term; you are talking about 80 years before you see the true benefits, so it was selfless work in some ways: they were never going to see the real results which we see today. They planted oak, ash, beech and sycamore, protected by evergreens from the sometimes harsh conditions up here. We are between 750-900ft and the wind really blows hard.&apos; In 1968, his father gave him 20 acres of farmland and 15 acres of woodland, but later the farm itself was left to his elder brother, who changed it from a pioneering organic farm to an orthodox enterprise and then sold it. John Eliot has made a tremendous effort to buy as much of it back as he can and return it to its organic origins. He now has his 650 acres, which he shares with the National Trust and the Dorset Wildlife Trust. As well as the cattle there are 1,000 ewes and 25 rams producing about 850 lambs a year . &apos;The cattle enterprise is almost completely self-sufficient; we make enough silage and haylage to feed them as well as growing barley, oats, spring beans and milling wheat for bread Our biggest expense is diesel for the tractors. We&apos;ve even used carthorses in the woods in the past . &apos;Clover is the fuel of the whole system, though we have to be careful with red clover as it can interfere with the ewes&apos; fertility, but a careful grazing management can avoid this; in fact, keeping the grassland in top condition is essential.&apos; He has just two full-timers to help him: Stockman Kevin, who gets in extra help at lambing, and George who does everything arable; ploughing and running the combine harvester. &apos;I&apos;m confined to cash flow and cropping schedules these days, but I used to do everything. I would sometimes return from the Festival Hall and go straight out to the lambing sheds in my tails.&apos; While we have been chatting, John Eliot&apos;s lovely Italian wife Isabella has been preparing lunch, talking about the farm and about music. She runs SDG, the successful record label that Gardiner set up after Deutsche Grammophon pulled out halfway through his recording of all 198 surviving Bach cantatas. We are to have venison, which reminds Isabella of the time she found a tiny, sick fawn abandoned in the woods and brought it back to the kitchen in an attempt to save its life. Their retrievers, Biscuit and Cracker, immediately adopted the frail creature, but it died nonetheless. At the time she was editing their Pilgrimage to Santiago album (hailed as the record of the 2006). &apos;I can&apos;t listen to that music now without thinking of that poor little fawn,&apos; she says. A casserole of beef from the farm is also bubbling quietly in the oven. The venison, culled from the wood, has been specially prepared to a favourite recipe of John Eliot&apos;s. Steeped for 24 hours in a marinade of wine, juniper berries and herbs, it was cooked for 15 minutes on the top of the oven and then left overnight wrapped in foil in the Aga. Served with leek au gratin, it was simply delicious, as was the dense, strong and sensationally tender Aubrac beef. Over lunch, conversation turned to the farmer&apos;s lot in the 21st century. John Eliot despairs for the future of agriculture as supermarkets squeeze margins to a minimum and consumers become divorced from the process of food production. &apos;Unless we all support the rural community the nation will become one huge foodstuff importer, and family farms will go. Expertise is already being lost on the land. We have to deregulate to allow the local butcher, the local baker, to flourish and we have to loosen the monopoly control of the big chains,&apos; he said. I ask him about his great-uncle, Henry Balfour Gardiner, still popular with singers today for his dramatic anthem Te Lucis Ante Terminum. He was a generous patron and music supporter, organising seasons at London&apos;s old Queen&apos;s Hall, and most notably the first performance of Gustav Holst&apos;s new piece The Planets in 1918. Balfour&apos;s happiest memory of that event was not the concert itself, triumph though it was, but the afternoon rehearsal, when the cleaners at the Queen&apos;s Hall stopped work and danced with their mops to the irresistible jauntiness of Jupiter For all his talent, Balfour felt his own music was becoming irrelevant to the 20th century. Tragically, he burnt most of it, turning instead to architecture, forestry and farming. &apos;I have such fond memories of him,&apos; said John Eliot. &apos;He wore a tweed suit, always had champagne on ice and thought music began with Beethoven and ended with Wagner. Through him I met Percy Grainger and Arnold Bax when I was a boy - a wonderful experience.&apos; His ashes were buried here in the woods he established, and tracts of the forest are still named after his composer friends - Gustav&apos;s Folly and Percy&apos;s Piece. Conversation ranges over the merits of English music (Isabella can&apos;t stomach Vaughan Williams, Walton or Tippett); finding a decent restaurant after giving a concert (Amsterdam is so provincial, nowhere stays open late; the Germans aren&apos;t much better); concert etiquette (Americans make so much noise) and concert dress for musicians (&apos;I prefer white tie and tails for players and singers. It bestows an anonymity and just lets the music do the work.&apos;) Up in the roof he has built a writing room, a tranquil eyrie from which he can look out over the hills towards the Isle of Purbeck. It is made entirely of timber taken from his forests, all held together the traditional way, not with screws and nails, but with pegs. Here he labours over what many believe will be a definitive work on the life and music of JS Bach. &apos;It&apos;s a mug&apos;s game, frankly,&apos; he says with disarming modesty. &apos;Writing about music is a challenge at the best of times, but there is so little to go on when discussing Bach. We have the music, of course, thank God, but we have so little source material and we really don&apos;t know how his music was received at the time.&apos; Lunch over, Biscuit and Cracker jump into the Jeep and off we go to see the cattle as the grey light begins to fade over Hardy&apos;s Wessex. In a pleasant, airy, German-designed barn jokingly named Benvenuto Cellini (a season conducting the Berlioz opera paid for it) and in the neighbouring Merry Widow (similar story) we find the beautiful Aubrac cattle. John Eliot jumps over the fence with practised ease and poses with the cows for the photographer, stroking their noses and offering salt lick for their big strong tongues. He takes me across the yard to see his handsome bulls; massive beasts with staring eyes named Artiste, Egyptian, Troubadour and Vulcan. They snort and bellow a greeting as he approaches, saluting their owner who confides that, fearsome as they look, they are easier to handle than some singers. We talk about the relationship between the land and music. &apos;For me, music is as much a part of the seasons as farming. I have vivid childhood memories of music at home punctuating the year much as the seasons punctuate the way we farm. It&apos;s all one, really.&apos; As if to underscore that relationship, the distinguished organ builder Robin Jennings has his workshop just across the yard from the lowing cattle, using timber cut from John Eliot&apos;s forests. So music can truly be said to be springing from the land. And there&apos;s another nice touch. The workshop was converted from the former home of a Silesian friend who, during the second world war, sent to Dorset a 1748 portrait of Bach - a picture that intrigued and captivated the young John Eliot and set him on his course to greatness. \u00b7 To order John Eliot Gardiner&apos;s Pilgrimage to Santiago (rrp \u00a313.25) for \u00a311.25 go to monteverdiproductions.co.uk/shop, discount code SDGOBS107 Isabella Gardiner&apos;s marinated venison Serves 6 1 haunch or a saddle of venison 3 onions 1 carrot 1 stick celery 1 clove garlic thinly sliced 10 juniper berries, half crushed, half whole sage leaves sprig rosemary 1 bottle red wine 140g lardons 140g chicken livers (optional) spoonful redcurrant jelly Heat a couple of spoonfuls of olive oil in a thick-bottomed pan, then add the chopped vegetables (retaining one onion), stir, cover the pan and leave the vegetables to sweat on low heat until soft (at least 15 minutes).

It throws out a seething mass of water so fast that you get the sensation of riding a real wave when actually the depth is only two inches. My fledgling surf brotherhood largely consists of teenagers, but there is one other dad - and, honestly, we don&apos;t disgrace ourselves. In fact, we get a few pats on the back from the instructor, who in the space of an hour has us kneeling up on our boogie boards with arms outstretched like a crucifix, and even doing 360-degree sideways body twists.  We assemble quite a crowd for the latter manoeuvre - not least because, it turns out, that males in skimpy Speedos have a tendency to lose their trunks in the process. Luckily, after the first flasher, I and the other dad have time to tighten the drawstrings of our shorts and are spared the white cheeks of embarrassment.  While I live out my surf fantasies, my two boys, Eddie, three, and Finn, one, potter happily in the toddler pool with my wife, Jane, while outside the tropically heated dome, the fat snowflakes fall.  The decision to come here had seemed like the perfect compromise: we wanted a short winter break, without the hassle of flying, which would offer plenty of activities for the children and perhaps a dose of culture and sightseeing for the grown-ups. The holiday started as soon as we boarded Stena&apos;s superfast HSS ferry at Harwich. After a quick lunch, the boys settled down to watch a magic show with the onboard entertainer, Adrian. He kept them enthralled for a whole hour with his magic tricks. The crossing took only three and a half hours, and the boys promptly fell asleep for another 90-minute drive on smooth Dutch roads from the Hook of Holland to the park. Check-in ran like clockwork and after unpacking, we bimbled off to the cycle centre, hired two bikes and a kiddy trailer for the boys and set off to get our bearings. De Eemhof is one of the company&apos;s original sites. The Dutch Center Parcs are run along similar lines to their UK counterparts: rows of neat, low cottages set around wooded glades and ponds and, at the centre of the site, the swimming complex. Smoke and steam rising from chimneys and central heating flues added to the cosy atmosphere. Our accommodation was a deluxe three-bed &apos;kindercottage&apos;, compact and welcoming with an open fireplace for a real log fire, multi-channel TV (with plenty of programmes in English with Dutch or German subtitles) and lots of toys laid on for the children, including a huge pull-along box of Lego that Finn loved, blackboard and chalks and a full-size Punch and Judy puppet theatre in Ed&apos;s room.  The brochure encourages visitors to sign up for culinary packages that combine take-aways and theme nights in the site&apos;s restaurants - which ranged from pancake house to Tex-Mex diner. But for us they had limited appeal, and the buffet-style cafe we tried on the first evening was a bit of a Euro mish-mash. But on the plus side everywhere welcomed children, which took one of our biggest holiday stresses away right from the start. We mixed it up a bit: a couple of meals out, breakfast and lunches in, experimenting with the continental treats - pancakes spread with thick apple jam, pea soup, hot dogs - that we came across in the well-stocked supermarket. Jane and I got a babysitter one night and went out to the smartest restaurant, Safraan, for an adult meal.  A relaxed regime meant we could take everything at our own pace. There was an impressive menu of activities, but no pressure from staff to join in at all costs. We might have a quiet morning playing in and around the cottage, or a bike ride, or a game of 10-pin bowling, then after lunch head for a splash in Aqua mundo. De Eemhof is only 30 miles from Amsterdam, so on our last full day we headed for the city. Forget any stories of having to fight to be let out of camp; we were cheerfully given directions to the nearest train station at Almere, 20 minutes&apos; drive away. From there it was only 15 minutes by rail to Centraal Station. What you attempt when you get there is up to you. With very small children in tow, we opted to leave the museums alone and didn&apos;t venture far: a spot of lunch, an hour&apos;s canal excursion, coffee and cake watching the trams go by.  Even so, it was great to feel the buzz of the city. A grown-up treat in among all the other treats of our five-day whirl. We&apos;d ridden the wild wave, seen the boys play to their hearts&apos; content, and chilled out in the snow. We&apos;d ticked all the boxes.

Photograph: \u00a9 Rijksmuseum Museum Last week Jonathan Jones asked whether it matters if art treasures stay in Britain. Would it be so bad if some of the UK&apos;s great paintings went to collections overseas, he asked. Earlier that same week the issue came into sharp focus when The Art Fund - an independent charity dedicated to securing art for UK public collections - launched a public campaign to save JMW Turner&apos;s magnificent watercolour, The Blue Rigi, for the Tate gallery. The watercolour was sold in the summer to a private collector abroad, but the government stepped in to allow a gallery in this country time to raise the money to buy it. The Art Fund pledged \u00a3500,000 and Tate has committed \u00a32m, so the race is now on to raise the rest of the money (\u00a32.45m) before March 20. But would it really be such a disaster if The Blue Rigi went overseas? Does the Tate need another Turner to add to its bequest? There&apos;s no question that the UK already has plenty of works by the artist, but The Blue Rigi represents the very pinnacle of his achievement in watercolour - the medium of which he was perhaps the greatest master. It is a truly extraordinary work, and it&apos;s not just us that think so - members of the public have already pledged more than \u00a370,000 to the campaign. Is it chauvinistic to &quot;save&quot; great works of art from going abroad? Is it preferable for a magnificent work to go to a public collection overseas rather than languishing behind closed doors in the UK? The questions are hard, but another case in point is the hotly debated 17th-century Rembrandt portrait, privately owned in Wales for 150 years, which the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam is hoping to buy. Should we stop the painting from leaving our shores? After all, Rembrandt is one of the greatest Dutch artists. The interesting point of the story is that the Rijksmuseum may be helped by a special grant from the Dutch government. That is just what Jones suggests our own National Gallery ought to get - &quot;money to shop around aggressively and hungrily, for art all over the world&quot;. Jones is pessimistic about the likelihood of our government taking such an initiative. Yet, although more generous public funding does not look likely, there are other ways in which the government can help museums enrich their collections. By introducing appropriate corporate and personal tax incentives, many private collectors might be persuaded to give works of art to public collections. It works in many other countries, so why not try it here?", "sentences": ["The questions are hard, but another case in point is the hotly debated 17th-century Rembrandt portrait, privately owned in Wales for 150 years, which the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam is hoping to buy."], "title": "The dilemmas of saving national treasures", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/jan/31/whosenationaltreasureisit", "tags": ["Art and design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-02T09:20:34Z", "article": "Ever since France and the Netherlands rejected the European Union&apos;s proposed constitutional treaty, EU leaders have been busy pointing fingers at each other, or blaming French and Dutch citizens for misunderstanding the question they had been asked. But no amount of finger-pointing can obscure the fact that, 50 years after the European Community&apos;s creation, Europe badly needs a new political framework, if not a new project, to shore up its unity. To be sure, French and Dutch citizens did not respond to the question that they were supposed to answer. Their vote was a protest against globalisation, a rejection of the contemporary world, with its distant and incomprehensible governing mechanisms. Like the anti-globalisation movement, the new anti-Europeanism can be regarded as a demand for a &quot;different world&quot; - in this case, an &quot;alter-Europeanism&quot;. The two world wars and the cold war shaped European integration as a project of peace, defence of the west&apos;s fundamental values, and common economic prosperity. But the collapse of communism in 1989, and the chance to overcome the continent&apos;s historical divisions, now required a redefinition of the European project. The treaties of Maastricht (1992) and Amsterdam (1997) created a new organisational structure for the EU and laid the foundations for political institutions equal to Europe&apos;s economic power. The treaty of Nice (2000) was the result of a rather poor compromise. Declarations by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country assumed the EU&apos;s rotating six-month presidency at the beginning of 2007, are unambiguous: the period of reflection, approved by the European commission in 2005, has ended. The German presidency will seek to implement the constitutional treaty resolutions, and the Berlin declaration of March 25 2007 - timed to mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome - will offer a vision of the EU&apos;s future. The aim is to leave to Germany&apos;s successors in the EU presidency - Slovenia, Portugal, and France - a roadmap for future reform. In the past, when politicians debated the EU&apos;s future, they spoke of a definitive formula for European integration, as defined in a famous lecture in 2000 by Germany&apos;s then foreign minister Joschka Fischer. The accompanying intellectual debate, inaugurated by the philosophers J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida, defined the nature of European identity, above all against the foil of the United States, but also in terms of the challenges posed by globalisation. A similar debate addressing key questions concerning the EU&apos;s future should be launched now. First, how should relations between national and common European interests be defined? At issue is not only the allocation of competencies, but also the more fundamental matter of when to rely on national governments&apos; agreement and when to turn to common EU institutions, namely the European commission and the European parliament. The second question concerns the EU&apos;s scope. Europe is a peculiar combination of geography and history, but the EU&apos;s boundaries - and thus the prospects for its further enlargement - are determined as much by its capacity to integrate candidate countries as by these countries&apos; own adaptive abilities. After the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the EU has 27 members, with Turkey and Croatia, but also the other Balkan states, as well as Ukraine and Georgia, waiting in line. Is enlargement the only effective policy for stabilisation and peace, or can the EU&apos;s &quot;neighborhood policy&quot;, falling short of full admission for some of the countries knocking at the door, become an instrument for supporting development and stabilisation, much as the Marshall plan once was for western Europe? Third, instead of a futile theoretical debate over &quot;liberal&quot; versus &quot;social&quot; models of economic development, we need to compare the experiences of such countries as Britain, Sweden, Germany and France. Are their experiences mutually exclusive, or is convergence possible? Which policies in fact reduce unemployment? Which measures can ensure the EU&apos;s global competitiveness? How can we narrow the existing differences in development and material welfare within Europe? Fourth, the EU&apos;s aspiration for a common foreign and security policy must be addressed. The threats facing the world today are supranational, so counteracting them must be supranational, too. But this is impossible without a clear European identity - and thus a common interest to be asserted and defended. Only then will a common approach to pressing issues, such as energy supplies, be possible. Such questions could be the topic of a consultative referendum held simultaneously in all member states. Its results would allow the treaty to be presented in a simplified version for ratification by the nine member states that have still not done so. The EU would then gain both a political dimension and clear rules of procedure. The alternative is paralysis. If the EU continues to be governed under the treaty of Nice, there will be no room for further political integration or enlargement. Nor do the current rules ensure the effective functioning of the EU&apos;s institutions, as they exist now, while drafting a new constitutional treaty would probably require even more time than was needed for the current proposal. In these circumstances, pragmatism should prevail. Democracy may carry certain short-term costs, but they are always lower than the long-term damage that comes from a lack of popular participation. Only a new European debate that includes both Europe&apos;s citizens and its institutions can combat &quot;alter-Europeanism&quot; effectively. The time may not be ripe for a true European constitution, but confronting, rather than evading, the fundamental issues that the EU faces could create a context for reviving the constitutional treaty and preparing the union for the challenges of our time. \u00a9 Project Syndicate, 2007.", "sentences": ["The treaties of Maastricht (1992) and Amsterdam (1997) created a new organisational structure for the EU and laid the foundations for political institutions equal to Europe&apos;s economic power."], "title": "Europe's next move", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/02/europesnextmove", "tags": ["European Union", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-02T14:40:37Z", "article": "The industrial dispute with cabin crew that cost BA an estimated \u00a380m &quot;could have and should have&quot; been averted during the tenures of previous chief executives, the airline&apos;s boss said this morning. Talking to Guardian Unlimited, BA chief executive Willie Walsh said the company had been damaged by issues that could have been resolved a decade ago. He also dismissed criticism that senior managers should have acted sooner to defuse the row. A last-minute deal on Monday resulted in strikes planned for Tuesday and Wednesday this week being called off. But BA had already cancelled those flights as a precaution, leaving it with an \u00a380m loss from cancelled tickets and low sales as passengers avoided the airline altogether. Mr Walsh said: &quot;Some of these issues go back 10 years. We made a lot of progress in a short space of time. &quot;The question that you should ask is why they were not dealt with back then. These are issues that should have and could have been addressed earlier.&quot; Mr Walsh, who replaced Sir Rod Eddington as chief executive in September 2005, said he was not criticizing his predecessors. The cabin crew dispute centred on two issues: a pay agreement introduced by the then chief executive, Bob Ayling in 1997; and a sick leave policy implemented when Sir Rod was in charge in 2004. Mr Walsh added: &quot;I thought it [the threat of strike action] was unnecessary and unjustified. We made every effort to get it resolved as quickly as we possibly could. The positive is that we averted strike action. &quot;The unfortunate part is that our business got impacted once people started talking about the threat.&quot; BA said in third-quarter results this morning that the freezing fog that grounded 800 flights in December, a baggage system breakdown at Heathrow and a sales dip caused by security restrictions had clipped \u00a340m off sales. The \u00a380m hit from the strike will appear in full-year results later in 2007. Today&apos;s annnouncements mean that BA has lost an estimated \u00a3220m since August 10, when a terror alert brought the airline&apos;s Heathrow base to a standstill and cost it \u00a3100m in turnover. The airline said that transfer traffic sales, where passengers fly into Heathrow to connect with BA flights, remained down as customers switched to European airports with less stringent security measures. Mr Walsh admitted that the number of premium transfer passengers, the worst affected segment, will stay low until hand luggage restrictions are harmonized across the European Union in May. Terminal Five However, some business class passengers will not switch back to Heathrow from rival hubs such as Amsterdam Schiphol and Paris Charles de Gaulle until BA moves into Heathrow Terminal Five in 2008, he added. He said: &quot;Wait until you see Terminal Five - 422 days from now, we will have the best transfer facility in the world.&quot; BA said third-quarter pre-tax profits had slumped 32% to \u00a3113m, on sales that rose 0.5% to \u00a32.07bn. The operating margin was 6.2%, compared with BA&apos;s long-term target of 10%. The airline also warned that full-year costs will be \u00a350m higher than last year and will not be offset by the drop in oil price, which will knock an estimated \u00a340m off fuel costs. Mr Walsh said the cost of resolving the cabin crew dispute - an above-inflation pay rise - will not impact a cost reduction target of \u00a3450m by 2008 and the 10% margin target. He added that, following an agreement on BA&apos;s \u00a32.1bn pension hole with three out of four of the airline&apos;s unions, the company would be in place to announce the first phase of its airplane replacement programme by the summer. BA will spend up to \u00a37bn overhauling part of its long-haul fleet, with 34 Boeing jets to be replaced from 2009 onwards.

Mid-December and York is fog-bound for a week. &quot;Let&apos;s pay the carbon tax,&quot; Sophie says. &quot;How about Thailand?&quot; I&apos;m re-reading Thoreau&apos;s Walden. I suggest a cottage on the North Yorkshire Moors. Some friends have one that is further from civilisation than anywhere in south-east Asia. It has no phone, no power, no piped water and no neighbours. I want a new rule of thumb adopted by all ticket and travel agencies: every hundred miles from home should mean a day away. At 6,000 miles Thailand requires two months. A long weekend would allow us 300 miles, ruling out Paris but not Amsterdam. And, at just 25 miles from home, the North Yorkshire Moors demand just six hours. Now that is an efficient holiday. &quot;Kenya?&quot; She&apos;s moving her front line too fast, leaving a huge vapour trail across the globe. Where is she really aiming for, I wonder, and how much carbon has been emitted by our internet provider as he bustles about gathering information on exotic locations, not to mention the strain of calculating carbon emissions? &quot;It&apos;s only two tonnes,&quot; she continues.  Me: &quot;A six week experience - we could sail by dhow to Socotra and back. No extra carbon, and the piracy problem is almost a thing of the past.&quot; Her: &quot;Tunisia? Only 0.4 tonnes.&quot; She makes a face at her own idea. &quot;But not Hammamet - it&apos;s hardly exotic.&quot; Me: &quot;We could stay at home and go out dressed up as aliens. We&apos;d get just the same experience: staring, incomprehension, overcharging, inappropriate new friends.&quot; I do think that no one should feel guilty about flying long haul. What is bad is coming back after a week or two. Let&apos;s all go further, but for longer. Take the slow boat, the bicycle rickshaw and four-legged animal. Go for so long that you forget your home phone number. Go for the experience, but don&apos;t go for a holiday. Holidays are about playing with the kids, about reading and drinking and hanging out. You can do that closer to home. One of the best holidays we ever had was in Wales and it rained every day. &quot;Lake District - 0.03 tonnes per person.&quot; &quot;No way. Marrakech.&quot; I rush off and discover that Marrakech, surprisingly, invokes a higher carbon penalty than Tunisia. Damn, I&apos;d actually prefer Morocco. Best to keep that one quiet. Quit while you&apos;re winning. &quot;OK.&quot; &quot;What? No agenda? You&apos;ve got some plan, haven&apos;t you? There&apos;s an assignment. You&apos;re going to disappear for a few days halfway through.&quot; &quot;Absolutely not.&quot; Suspicion eats into her through Christmas. Morocco, it seems, was her objective all along. But now that her forces have swept to power she is uneasy. Over new year she makes a tactical withdrawal to Spain. I am not impressed.  &quot;A beach holiday in Spain? With all those pasty white larder louts from Slough?&quot;  &quot;No, a cottage.&quot; We&apos;re in the home straight now. I&apos;m reading a biography of Henry Morton Stanley, who was born in Wales. &quot;Pembrokeshire.&quot; &quot;Cornwall.&quot; &quot;OK.&quot; &quot;Fine.&quot; But she&apos;s laughing. &quot;Actually I quite fancied Cornwall all along,&quot; she claims. &quot;It&apos;s got everything we need: warmth, good food and stunning beaches. I checked out the climate charts for February, and with a bit of luck it can be as warm as Morocco.&quot; I&apos;m outfoxed but I check the carbon charts: &quot;By car it&apos;s 0.07 tonnes per person.&quot; &quot;To Polperro?&quot; &quot;No, the Lizard - I can read Daphne du Maurier.&quot; &quot;Call it Port Isaac.&quot; &quot;Done.&quot; Our peace accord is finished - all part of the new carboniferous age of travel and marital politics.

No gentle journey this, but a brutal and forced passage into a premature kind of womanhood that is exploited and filled with shame. For this is a world where, whether you have a little or a lot, the only thing that really talks is money. And its favourite word is &quot;more&quot;. Oksana pretends that she is called Natasha. She once had a mother, brother and father and blinis on her birthday back in Russia. Now she is known as a &quot;whore&quot; in her hometown because she has been bought and sold across Europe for sexual gratification. Holed up in Amsterdam, goods in transit, her desperate co-chattel, Marie, makes a bid to escape and takes the only path left to her: to the bottom of the canal. Hope is 15 and holidaying in France in the family villa. Her father is a very busy businessman. Her mother once had a career but abandoned it to the demands of running a luxurious home. Hope&apos;s central concern is whether her friends are getting into clubs back home in Norfolk and getting off with dashing, older boyfriends. Holiday over, she returns to England on the ferry across the channel. The girl who darkens her path and asks in broken English for a light for her cigarette introduces herself as Natasha. What follows &quot;feels like a storyline on TV, on CSI&quot;. The trouble is that it is all too real. What happens after Natasha stows away in Hope&apos;s dad&apos;s camper van and goes home with her to East Anglia is told from the differing perspectives of each girl. Hope tries to help the stowaway get to Tottenham, where she wants to find an old friend from Russia, and both of them end up being kidnapped by Natasha&apos;s pimp and sold to a gang of Turks in London. Locked up somewhere in the city above a fish and chip shop, they are soon sharing with a couple of Estonian girls who live off drugs and fast food. &quot;I&apos;m not supposed to be here!&quot; wails Hope, waiting for the police to rescue her, incredulous that she could be mistaken for &quot;trade&quot;. And then Natasha confides in this English girl, whose attempt to help her has led to the hapless and privileged teenager being sucked into the dirty dealings of the underworld she saw only as fantasy on TV. She tells her that her name is not Natasha after all - &quot;And I am not supposed to be here either!&quot; A label on the front cover, beneath the glare of a red light bulb, urges the potential reader to &quot;Help stop child trafficking&quot;. For every copy sold, 50p goes to Unicef. While this is obviously a worthwhile cause, it raises questions. Is this book intended to educate? Is the reader being encouraged to buy it as an act of charity? Is the prime intention of the publication to campaign for the rights of those young women, mostly from eastern Europe, who are being sold daily to do this &quot;dirty work&quot; in the more prosperous west? Before I started reading I was concerned that the content might best be served as non-fiction, the novel form being no more than a vehicle for documentary material. But Bell tells a strong story and creates some compelling characters. She is clearly most interested in the female perspective, and her men are drawn more sketchily, adjuncts to the girls&apos; dramas. She is also more concerned with the tougher life of Oksana/Natasha than with the &quot;cushier&quot; experience of Hope, giving the Russian greater stature and more space to share her life journey. But the growing relationship between the two adolescents, both emerging against the odds as young women of courage, provides a strong backbone to the tale and enables the reader to engage imaginatively. Bell avoids getting to grips with the grittier and more intimate details of life as an underage forced sex worker, the uneasy inevitable result of grappling with adult territory for a pre-adult readership. That apart, the sense of authentic detail - cheap underwear falling off the skinny frames of the girls, the types of cars the pimps drive, the descriptions of typical trafficking methods and routes - does not feel like journalism but serves to give some edge to what is essentially a rite-of-passage tale. There are echoes of the socially aware novels of the 19th century: Oliver Twist came to mind, with its evocation of the criminal underworld and the street kids forced to pickpocket and burgle. While Dirty Work is a far more modest work than Dickens&apos;s great epic, and doesn&apos;t burst so fully off the page, it nevertheless follows in an illustrious literary tradition of taking readers, through story, into the seedier side of a reality that cannot be ignored even if most people would rather avoid it. \u00b7 Diane Samuels&apos;s play Kindertransport will be toured nationally by Shared Experience from March 1", "sentences": ["Holed up in Amsterdam, goods in transit, her desperate co-chattel, Marie, makes a bid to escape and takes the only path left to her: to the bottom of the canal."], "title": "Review: Dirty Work by Julia Bell", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview27", "tags": ["Books", "Children and teenagers", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-04T08:00:00Z", "article": "Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a woman who makes many European liberals very uncomfortable. A Somali, a Muslim, a woman and a refugee, she arrived in Holland, having fled an arranged marriage, and the severe limitations imposed on women by her clan, culture and religion. She took advantage of the generous Dutch social benefits and provisions, gained a degree, and, bizarrely enough, decided that secular liberal humanism was a wonderful thing. A certain cast of guilty liberal would rather listen to Abu Hamza raving on about the corrupt and degenerate ways of the infidel than hear a black African woman say that west is best. But that&apos;s not the only reason why Hirsi Ali upsets people. Not content with being an unapologetic proselytiser for Enlightenment values and the human rights and freedoms that stem from them, she is also a trenchant and outspoken critic of Islam. And therefore she has been accused of Islamophobia and even, by those who see Islam as a race rather than an ideology, a racist. As a consequence of her stance on Islam she lived under round-the-clock police protection in Holland. Theo van Gogh, with whom she made a short film that featured Koranic verses that allow men to beat their wives, did not have such protection and he was shot dead and had his head half-cut off on the daytime streets of Amsterdam. This perhaps is another reason why Hirsi Ali causes liberal unease. We don&apos;t like to be reminded of what can happen to those who dare to criticise the Prophet Muhammed. Certainly her neighbours in the Hague didn&apos;t like to be reminded, and they won a legal case ruling that Hirsi Ali&apos;s proximity placed them in jeopardy. She was evicted and she promptly moved to America. So what are we to make of Hirsi Ali? Is she the &quot;Enlightenment fundamentalist&quot; of which the distinguished historians Tony Judt and Timothy Garton Ash both anxiously speak? The answer I think is, yes, but not in the way that Judt and Garton and Ash mean. She is a fundamentalist insofar as she thinks that principles are not particularly helpful unless they are applied in practice. As we saw during the Danish cartoons crisis, the principle of free speech was one that the liberal intelligentsia in the media was all too willing to abandon. There are many arguments on which it&apos;s perfectly reasonable to disagree with Hirsi Ali, but there are two crucial points on which only the illiberal can afford to dismiss what she has to say. The first is her own experience as a Muslim woman growing up in the Third World and then arriving in Europe. In the first place, she was brought up to understand that women were the property of men, that Jews were the source of all the worlds problems, and that the answer to her predicament was to become a more faithful and observant Muslim. In the second, she took control of her own destiny, and gained access to all the freedom and opportunity that European culture has to offer. Many observers will look at the two situations and conclude that the overriding difference is economic. But Hirsi Ali insists that this is a misnomer that is leading us in the wrong direction. The reason that Saudi Arabian society, for example, has failed to develop secure rights and freedoms is not through shortage of money - nor, as some like to believe, because of the pernicious support of America. The problem is cultural, specifically the rigor mortis grip of Islam. That, Hirsi Ali believes, is the same problem that faces many Muslims in the west. The alienation many feel is chiefly due not to racism but the difficulty of reconciling incompatible value systems. &quot;That&apos;s what the integration debate is about,&quot; she says. &quot;If you take those values with you and come here, it&apos;s not going to change your misery.&quot; These may sound like insensitive words, but they lead us to Hirsi Ali&apos;s second major contribution. In her film Submission 1 and in a number of her writings, she has attempted to flush out some of the more controversial passages of the Koran. Hence her police protection. Hirsi Ali contends that there can be no proper debate about culture, customs or values until we can discuss and assess the Koran as we would any other text. Try as I might, I can see nothing to disagree with in that analysis. As things stand, only the very brave and the foolish are willing to take on a religious system that maintains the oppression of millions of women across the globe. And say what you like about Hirsi Ali, she&apos;s no fool.", "sentences": ["Theo van Gogh, with whom she made a short film that featured Koranic verses that allow men to beat their wives, did not have such protection and he was shot dead and had his head half-cut off on the daytime streets of Amsterdam."], "title": "Enlightenment from Somalia", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/04/post1047", "tags": ["Islam", "Ayaan Hirsi Ali"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-04T11:44:38Z", "article": "A huge plume of black smoke drifts ominously over Amsterdam. Beneath it, people pass to and fro as if nothing untoward were happening. When Dutch film-maker Cyrus Frisch saw this after emerging from his apartment in the city centre, he felt compelled to film it using his mobile phone. &apos;It looked like the end of Amsterdam. It felt like something terrible had happened and we were all going to die,&apos; says Frisch. Frisch was responding to the impulse that makes people capture dramatic events - a large fire had broken out in Amsterdam&apos;s Centraal station - on their mobile phones. But he decided to take the next step: a mobile-phone movie. Determined to cast a light on the increasing fear and tension he felt within Dutch society, he began by filming what was happening outside his window, where immigrant kids gathered in a square, irritating local residents who called the police. He then filmed clashes between these youths and the police. &apos;Why didn&apos;t anybody tell me it would become this bad in Afghanistan&apos; premiered last week at the Rotterdam Film Festival, making it the first such film to screen at an international festival. Frisch is a celebrity in Holland, known for tackling difficult subjects. His 2001 film Forgive Me, a partially scripted documentary starring Amsterdam drunks and junkies, was a critique of reality-TV culture. He is also a consummate self-promoter. Minutes after the latest premiere, he was outside the theatre doing a live interview for Dutch TV ... via his mobile phone. There was just one drawback to shooting this way, says Frisch. &apos;Whenever I got a call, the camera stopped filming.&apos; The viewer watches the 70-minute film through the eyes of a Dutch soldier who has returned shell-shocked after a tour of duty in Afghanistan and now finds life at home as tense and fraught with uncertainty and violence. &apos;It&apos;s a metaphor for what I see happening in Western society,&apos; says Frisch. &apos;There&apos;s a lot of fear about war, the environment and the economy and this is projected on to something smaller that we can cope with, like immigrant kids in our streets.

This should have been &apos;nave&apos;, and this homophone has now been corrected in the text.   Once he had scaled 9ft or so of gothic stone tracery, Robert Broudie probably steadied himself against one of the eight pinnacles that crown Liverpool cathedral&apos;s 331ft bell tower, among the tallest in the world. He was on the western side of the cathedral. From the horizon to his left, the river Mersey meandered until it swelled into the great estuary in front of him. There, to the southwest, is the Wirral and then the hills of North Wales. Over the water, as they say in Liverpool, the Dublin ferry-landing and Birkenhead. Below, to his right, the Pier Head, the Royal Liver Building and the city centre, a pincushion of cranes heralding Liverpool&apos;s year as 2008 City of Culture. And then only the sea. Now 58, Robert Broudie was tired. Earlier that morning, like so many in the previous two years, he had not made it into work. He had called his law firm&apos;s driver, Billy Brittles, and asked to be taken from his cottage near Sefton Park to the Anglican cathedral. This was not unusual. Robert was an atheist from a Jewish family yet he loved the cathedral, often eating lunch in its cafeteria. It was about 11am on 16 October 2006. Robert walked across the main nave, through the arch beside the nave bridge and to the elevator in the Western Room, which leads to the bell tower. He bought a ticket from an attendant and stepped into the lift. Up it went, four floors. Then he had to climb 26 steps and change to another lift that sped him to the 10th floor. From here, a further 108 concrete steps took him to the top, along a staircase that clung to the left wall and was open to the right, where the cavernous belfry gaped. Below, in a circular array, dwarfed by an edifice of industrial dimensions, were the cathedral&apos;s 13 bells, at 16.5 tonnes and 219ft the heaviest and highest ringing peal in the world. At some point Robert had scribbled a note: &apos;This building has no religious significance. It is just the highest building I can find. Sorry.&apos; It was in his pocket as he emerged into the brightness of the morning, high above Liverpool. No one knows exactly how much time Robert Broudie spent taking one last look at the city, but it wasn&apos;t so very long. He simply waited until the tower was clear of other visitors and none of the cathedral staff could see him, and then he jumped. Later, he would be described not in his own right as a good man, a talented and wealthy lawyer who always fought for the underdog, and an obsessive who would stop at nothing to win justice. Instead, he would be described, incompletely, as the brother of Ian Broudie, one of the most successful men in British pop music. In a recording studio in Hammersmith, west London, Ian Broudie had spent the same day worrying. At 48, he is the youngest of the Broudie brothers; Robert was 58 and in between them there is David, 54, a retired businessman (to whom Robert&apos;s suicide note was addressed). Ian is best known as the frontman of the Lightning Seeds and for writing, with David Baddiel and Frank Skinner, the hugely successful Euro &apos;96 theme &apos;Three Lions&apos;. Behind the scenes as a producer, however, he has had an enormous influence on British music for more than 20 years, working with bands ranging from Echo and the Bunnymen and the Fall to the Coral and, today, the Zutons. Ian freely admits that when he was young, he didn&apos;t know an awful lot about Robert. A full 10 years older, Robert was very much the big brother, the grown-up sibling who left home when Ian was only nine or 10. In recent years, their relationship had been strained, but they had made up their differences and Ian had been feeling better about things. Now this. Frantic calls all day from David and Ian&apos;s ex-wife and great friend Becky: Robert was missing. &apos;At first we thought there would be a simple explanation,&apos; says Ian. &apos;Then as the hours went by I began worrying that perhaps he had been mugged. After nine or 10 hours I had begun reassuring myself that, no, he wouldn&apos;t do anything silly. This was Rob and Rob was intelligent and strong.&apos; As the hours continued to pass, friends and family worked themselves into a terrible frenzy. &apos;Dave was on holiday in the Lake District and our friends in Liverpool were calling with regular updates. Then, around 1 or 2am, I was speaking to Dave and he said he had another call coming through,&apos; recalls Ian. &apos;He answered the phone and almost immediately two police officers knocked on his door and told him they had found Rob. Dave rang me back to say that he was dead.&apos; At first, the newspapers reported that Robert had hidden in the cathedral and jumped at some time between midnight and 2am on Tuesday 17 October. That would have meant that he died in the dark. It is true his body was not found until 2am because it had not fallen all the way to the floor. Instead, Robert had landed on a roof above a large, and rarely used, side-entrance known as the Rankin Porch, about 100ft above ground. Eventually, a student, a stranger to the city, would come forward and report having seen someone jump at some time between 11am and noon on Monday 16 October, a time that tallied with Robert having been dropped off by his driver. He had jumped in daylight, then. He had seen his city one last time. The sense of shock in Liverpool that someone should choose one of its two cathedrals from which to jump was palpable (Liverpool also has a Roman Catholic cathedral). The Reverend Fran Lovett, a member of the Dean of Liverpool&apos;s staff, later attended Robert&apos;s funeral (as did a couple of hundred other people) and spoke to his friends and family. &apos;As you can imagine, it left people very shocked indeed that something like this could happen in our midst,&apos; she says. &apos;Many people work at the cathedral and many more come to visit and pray, so we had to do a lot of comforting of individuals for all sorts of reasons. It was awful at the time. Our thoughts are still with Robert Broudie&apos;s family and friends.&apos; Shock soon turned to puzzlement when it emerged that the jumper was not only the brother of Ian Broudie but was also one of the city&apos;s most successful and well-known lawyers. The papers reported that he had been depressed for some time. But to jump? And from the top of the cathedral? Why? Robert grew up with his two brothers and a sister, Sharon, 14 years his junior, in Allerton, Liverpool. His father, Dennis, was a businessman; his mother, Renee, a housewife. Ian and David remember a happy childhood, but there was, understandably, more of a closeness between the older brothers, Robert and David, and the much younger Ian and Sharon. &apos;Robert was always a bit of a mystery to me,&apos; recalls Ian. &apos;I remember he had a guitar and he used to lock his bedroom to stop me getting to it. So I used to climb through the window and play it. It was years before I got to know him properly as an adult. It was Dave that knew him best. I do know that he was supremely intelligent, very forthright and very strong.&apos; Robert earned a 2:1 in law at Liverpool University, graduating a year early. At first, he wanted to specialise in international law and studied in Amsterdam, before dropping out to do what the family called his &apos;hippy thing&apos;, travelling across the US. When he began working as a solicitor in Liverpool, some doubt seems to have crept into his mind. Did he really want to work in international law for the rest of his life? Wouldn&apos;t he be better suited to specialising in crime and civil rights? According to Ian, any doubts that might have lingered disappeared when, in July 1981, the Toxteth riots exploded and Robert&apos;s fate was sealed. &apos;For him, I think the riots were the catalyst that made him realise he could bring together the two sides of his life - the one that wanted to do good for other people and the one that wanted to be a great lawyer,&apos; says Ian. &apos;It gave him the focus he needed for the whole civil rights thing, afforded him the ability to champion the underdog.&apos; And for a time, Robert&apos;s commitment to the cause allowed him to shake a monkey from his back, a monkey that had brought with it anxiety and depression since the age of 15. The family knew about &apos;Rob&apos;s problem&apos; and were attentive, but they could not have known just how much it would shape and take over his life. On 3 July 1981, Leroy Cooper, a headstrong 19-year-old from Toxteth, known locally as Liverpool 8, was with a group of young men who had surrounded a number of police officers to remonstrate about the rough and, as they saw it, unfair treatment of a friend who was being questioned about his use of a Kawasaki 650cc motorbike. Everyone knew it wasn&apos;t the rider&apos;s bike, but equally, according to Cooper, everyone knew he had permission to ride it. The youths had had enough of what they saw as police brutality and racism, and that day they were having no more of it. Scuffles broke out and Cooper was arrested. Word spread around Toxteth and, even as the youngster was being taken to Risley remand centre in Warrington, the riots were beginning. &apos;I was terrified,&apos; says Cooper, now an accomplished artist, photographer and actor in Liverpool. &apos;I was in a cell and people kept shouting to me about the way the riots were growing more and more violent, supposedly in my name. I was being held up as a kind of martyr by the rioters while the authorities wanted to use me as a scapegoat. It was a terrible responsibility for a 19-year-old and I wanted none of it.&apos; During nine nights of the most violent rioting Britain had ever seen, 468 police officers were injured, 500 people were arrested, dozens of cars were set alight and 70 buildings were demolished. CS gas was used on mainland Britain for the first time and, folklore has it, as rioters edged closer to Merseyside police headquarters, the government had debated whether besieged officers should be allowed to use lethal force or submit to anarchy. More than anything, the fallout from the riots changed the face of policing forever and focused the attentions of Margaret Thatcher&apos;s government not just on issues of race, but those of poverty and inner-city decay - poor white youths had joined in, too. Paul Thompson remembers it as the time Robert Broudie bloomed into a tenacious, angry and first-rate lawyer. Thompson, now 49, had joined Robert&apos;s firm, RM Broudie, several months earlier. They were to work together for the next 25 years. &apos;Robert had founded his own firm in 1979 in Sir Thomas Street,&apos; recalls Thompson, who has been as affected by Robert&apos;s death as anyone in the Broudie family. &apos;When he interviewed me, he had just two rooms and it was a wonderful shambles. He was as interested in me as a person as he was in my qualifications, and I liked that. We immediately formed this connection and I remember thinking that I really wanted to work with this guy. &apos;Within months the riots kicked off and Rob was outraged at the way the people of Toxteth were being treated by the local magistrates. Hundreds of people were being arrested for the most minor of offences, but instead of being given bail, they were being remanded in custody unlawfully. We took on dozens and dozens of cases, challenging remand orders with higher courts and getting people released. &apos;Rob had me going into Liverpool 8 with witness summonses to prove people&apos;s innocence at a time when it was simply a no-go area. It was a crazy time. We were working round the clock. Rob was pretty much the only lawyer who was standing up at the time and fighting for everybody. A lot of officials in the system didn&apos;t like him for it, but it earned him the respect of the people on the ground.&apos; Leroy Cooper, who regarded Robert as his solicitor until the day he died, recalls: &apos;Word soon spread that there was this lawyer who didn&apos;t simply want you to sign the green Legal Aid form so he could get his money - he was actually interested in winning your case. He always went the extra mile and he was loved and respected for that. Right up until the time he died, he was always the man the people of Toxteth turned to whenever they felt there had been an injustice. He was a great man.&apos; The most high-profile case to come out of the riots involved a harmless drinker called Kenny Anderson, Cooper&apos;s now-dead uncle, and the use by police marksmen of CS gas cartridges called Ferrets which were designed to be fired through walls, not at people. Known locally as &apos;Dog&apos; for his ability to curl up and fall asleep wherever he fell, Anderson, who had no criminal record, was shot in the thigh at the height of the riots. Normal CS gas canisters are cylindrical and flat at either end; the Ferrets were pointed, looking like a cross between a large bullet and a small mortar. Anderson&apos;s artery was severed and only the intervention of a quick-thinking police officer stemmed the blood flow and saved his life. &apos;The police said Kenny was the ringleader of the rioting, charged him and issued a statement saying he was dressed in camouflage combat gear, ready for action,&apos; recalls Paul Thompson. &apos;But there were lots of witnesses who said he had simply been caught up in it.&apos; Later, a member of Anderson&apos;s family recovered his bloodstained clothes from the hospital - they were not camouflage fatigues but a red jumper and a pair of jeans. &apos;The police took the clothes away, telling the relative that Rob had given his permission - which he had not,&apos; says Thompson. &apos;He immediately got a civil court to issue an order that the clothes should not be destroyed. Rob was too quick for them, but Kenny was still charged with a number of serious offences.&apos; During a six-week trial in which Robert flew over a former CIA weapons expert from the US, the police insisted the shooting of Anderson was an accident. They also insisted that another victim, a body builder called Phil Robbins, was accidentally shot in the chest with a Ferret - and then accidentally shot in the back. After the jury failed to reach a verdict, a second trial went ahead, but lasted only a few days before Anderson was cleared. &apos;It was a wonderful moment,&apos; says Thompson. &apos;There weren&apos;t many people who would have taken on the police and the whole establishment at the time, but Rob did. We were both exhausted and I learnt a valuable lesson then: never get too involved in a case. I&apos;m not sure it was a lesson Rob ever learnt.&apos; There were more high-profile criminal cases over the years, but Robert also spent much time pursuing judicial reviews. Judicial review applications involve asking the High Court to examine decisions made or rules introduced by official bodies or government departments. They are the means by which bad law or the abuse of power can be challenged by an individual. &apos;He became an expert in filing applications for judicial review,&apos; says Thompson. &apos;That made him a thorn in the side of the establishment whenever he believed someone was abusing their power.&apos; Robert&apos;s most successful challenge, which went all the way to the House of Lords, came against a High Court judgment which ruled that the 400-year-old principle of doli incapax was obsolete. Doli incapax was the legal presumption that a child between the ages of 10 and 14 was not capable of committing a criminal offence. The Law Lords agreed with Robert&apos;s argument that only government legislation, and not a panel of judges, could set the principle aside. In 1998, the Blair government reduced the age of criminal responsibility to 10, but Robert had made his point. &apos;He was the most brilliant lawyer I ever met,&apos; says Thompson. &apos;He worked six days a week, always first in the office and last to go home, and he really cared.&apos; Other lawyers I spoke to said Robert could sometimes be stubborn, difficult and inflexible. But such intensity might be attributed in part to his worsening condition. Although prosaically described after his death as &apos;depression&apos;, he was actually suffering from acute anxiety. Feelings of anxiousness, coupled with his frenetic work rate and determination seem to have worn him down. Robert always had his family as a safety net, but in 2001 a series of personal tragedies began unfolding that, ultimately, seems to have led to his undoing. On 21 September that year, Robert&apos;s birthday, his mother, then 83, died from a heart attack. Less than a year later, his father died of cancer at the age of 79. &apos;My mother and father had always been very understanding of Rob&apos;s problems and, for him, their deaths must have felt like his support network fragmenting,&apos; says David Broudie. David still lives in Liverpool and had been caring for Robert on a daily basis until his suicide. We meet at Robert&apos;s pretty stone cottage. The living room is pale blue, the furniture upholstered in a tasteful Egyptian print. Along one wall are Robert&apos;s albums; he loved Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Jackson Browne, and sometimes he still played the guitar. On one of the sofas is the poem &apos;Desiderata&apos;, written as if part of a calligraphy exercise, which begins: &apos;Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence...&apos; &apos;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s significant,&apos; says David. &apos;Although when he was dying, my father gave us all a piece of paper with some thoughts on. Perhaps that was the one he gave Robert.&apos; On 10 May 2005, his sister Sharon died at the age of 44, leaving behind three young children. According to David and Ian, all that remains of the family, her death was horrible, caused by a brain tumour that had spread from a melanoma. &apos;Sharon was an angel,&apos; says David. &apos;She worked for an agency that cared for young women in trouble. She was a lovely person, full of energy and fun, and she was very much there for Rob. When she fell ill, Rob was fantastic insofar as he tried to put his own problems to one side. But when she died, he took it very badly. We lost our mother, father and sister in the space of three years. It was hard for all of us.&apos; Sharon&apos;s death was the catalyst for a worsening of Robert&apos;s condition. His anxiety heightened and he became a fizzing bundle of nerves, unable to make decisions, to sit and listen to music, to watch TV, read or concentrate. &apos;I would get phone calls from him in utter panic asking me to come over because he couldn&apos;t decide which clothes to put on,&apos; says David. &apos;Every aspect of his life was taken over by this anxiety. In a sense you could call it a series of continuing panic attacks.&apos; David says it upset Robert that the anxiety left him unlikely to form any loving relationships. &apos;He&apos;d had two long relationships in the past, but he was unlikely to have any more unless he were to improve. I remember I once introduced him to a woman and we all went out together. He seemed to relax and had a good evening. When I pointed this out to him later, he replied: &quot;Yes, but now I&apos;m depressed, because I know I can&apos;t take it anywhere.&quot; &apos;It was sad,&apos; David says, &apos;because he was intelligent, witty and strong - as well as obstinate and single-minded. Over the years, he had been on every kind of medication, and every combination of medication, but nothing seemed to work for any length of time. We all felt that if only we could get him well enough for work, he would be OK. But we couldn&apos;t.&apos; As a last resort, Robert, David and Robert&apos;s psychiatrist, Dr Peter Mason, had agreed that he should undergo a programme of electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) in the hope it would break his cycle of anxiety. ECT - sending an electrical current through the brain - was once considered the bogeyman inside the psychiatrist&apos;s medical cabinet, but is now recognised as being a useful treatment in small numbers of cases. But Robert was dreading it. &apos;I don&apos;t think that contributed to his decision to commit suicide, as it had been his decision to go ahead and he could have pulled out at any time,&apos; says David. &apos;But I do think it was one of many worries weighing on his mind. He had this fear that it might damage his brain in some way and he might have been afraid of the consequences. He used to say to me: &quot;Please, whatever happens, promise me you will never have me sectioned, ever.&quot;&apos; When someone is sectioned under the Mental Health Act, they are sent to a psychiatric hospital for treatment regardless of whether or not they consent. No one will ever know for sure just what it was that tipped Robert Broudie over the edge, but Ian has a theory. &apos;I remember when Becky [Ian&apos;s ex-wife] was pregnant, we got a call from Robert to say he couldn&apos;t move and he was shaking, and we picked him up and took him to Wales,&apos; he recalls. &apos;That was 15 years ago. He had been suffering like this for years. I just think a person can reach a point where they believe anything is better than this,&apos; Ian adds. &apos;I think that was the point he was at. What he did was an expression of great pain, but I suppose it was just like him to do this grand gesture from the top of the cathedral. He wasn&apos;t the sort to just quietly whimper away. Some people say it is a terrible way to go, but I feel there was something clear and bright about it.&apos; When you ask the remaining Broudie brothers how they feel after losing their mother, father, sister and brother in such a short time they can&apos;t give you a straight answer. Frankly, they both seem in shock. &apos;I&apos;m not sure,&apos; says Ian. &apos;I think I&apos;m doing OK, but then I don&apos;t know. So much has happened so quickly. Perhaps it will take a little time to come to terms with it all.&apos; David seems to be able to call on happy and funny memories to help him raise a smile through all the confusion. But just as quickly, his laughter sometimes degenerates into dignified crying. They both have a long way to go, but already the Broudie brothers are finding comfort in the fact that Robert&apos;s torment is over. &apos;During the last year, he was so very disturbed,&apos; says David. &apos;Whatever you believe in, heaven or nothing, the simple fact is that Rob&apos;s now at peace. And God knows, he deserved some of that.&apos; \u00b7  Leroy Cooper&apos;s work on Toxteth can be seen at bbc.co.uk/videonation/articles/l/liverpool_toxteth.shtml", "sentences": ["At first, he wanted to specialise in international law and studied in Amsterdam, before dropping out to do what the family called his &apos;hippy thing&apos;, travelling across the US."], "title": "Steve Boggan on the life and death of Robert Broudie", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2007/feb/04/features.magazine37", "tags": ["Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-04T23:51:44Z", "article": "Ayaan Hirsi Ali is not the only critic of Islam who lives with round-the-clock protection. But surely none wears their endangered status with greater style. The Dutch Somali human-rights campaigner looks like a fashion model and talks like a public intellectual. Tall and slender with rod-straight posture and a schoolgirl smile, she is a thinker of stunning clarity, able to express ideas in her third language with a precision that very few could achieve in their first. This combination of elegance and eloquence would be impressive in any circumstances. Under threat of death, it is nothing short of incredible. A little over two years ago, a second-generation Dutch Moroccan by the name of Mohammed Bouyeri sent a letter to Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Aside from the destruction of Holland and Europe, Bouyeri called for the death of Hirsi Ali, whom he described as a &apos;fundamentalist unbeliever&apos; and a &apos;soldier of evil&apos;. His macabre method of delivering the correspondence was to impale the note in the chest of the filmmaker and outspoken maverick, Theo van Gogh, having already shot him eight times and cut his throat through to the spine. Van Gogh had made a short film with Hirsi Ali called Submission 1, in which lines from the Koran, detailing a man&apos;s right to beat his wife, were superimposed on the body of an actress portraying a victim of domestic violence. The murder took place in broad daylight during the morning rush hour in a busy Amsterdam high street. Though the letter was addressed to Hirsi Ali, it was intended for a wider audience. Its message, while incoherent and rambling, was shockingly simple: say the wrong thing about Islam and nowhere is safe for you. It was medieval justice meted out in one of the most liberal and modern cities in the world. The killer, it turned out, was part of a cell linked to a fundamentalist network that stretched across Europe. The murder of van Gogh had the unintended effect of bringing Hirsi Ali global recognition. While she was whisked away by Dutch security to an army base and on to a &apos;dismal motel&apos; near an industrial estate in Massachusetts, cut off from the rest of the planet, the rest of the planet became suddenly very interested in her. The subject of numerous profiles, she was named the following year one of the &apos;100 Most Influential People of the World&apos; by Time magazine. In Holland, though, Hirsi Ali was already both famous and infamous. In Amsterdam a few days after the murder, I spoke to Muslims on the street about the killing. The majority blamed Hirsi Ali. &apos;This woman is the cause of all the problems, telling lies about Islam,&apos; one told me. &apos;If she hadn&apos;t sucked van Gogh into this, he&apos;d still be alive today.&apos; The reason Bouyeri killed van Gogh rather than Hirsi Ali was that she was already under police protection. Two years before van Gogh&apos;s slaying, Hirsi Ali had called Islam &apos;backward&apos; in a TV debate and was forced into hiding. Her subsequent media profile encouraged the Dutch Liberal Party to offer Hirsi Ali a position as an MP. She served with some distinction, focusing on issues such as domestic violence and female genital mutilation - the sort of campaigns that used to be part of frontline feminism but which had become increasingly neglected owing to multicultural sensitivities. I met Hirsi Ali at her publisher&apos;s office in central London last week. Dutch bodyguards follow her everywhere she goes, and reportedly in Britain Special Branch officers afford further protection, though neither were in evidence. She looked as sharp as a pin in a black trouser suit, even if she was jet-lagged and tired, having flown in from her new home in the United States. Last year Hirsi Ali, the most assimilated of all Dutch immigrants, was rejected by her adopted homeland twice over. Residents in her apartment block gained a court ruling, under European Human Rights law, stipulating that her presence placed her neighbours at risk, and she was duly evicted. At the same time a TV documentary alleged the MP had provided false information on her original asylum application. Hirsi Ali had admitted as much many times in interviews but nonetheless a minister in her own party decided to revoke her citizenship. In a farcical series of events, the citizenship was reinstated and the government collapsed. Meanwhile Hirsi Ali moved to Washington DC to take up a post at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank. She says she feels at home in America, a nation of immigrants. The move was only the latest, and perhaps least dramatic, in a lifetime of peripatetic reinventions. Born in Somalia to a resistance leader, she was exiled to Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and Kenya. In Nairobi she joined the Muslim Brotherhood and in 1989 she believed that Salman Rushdie should be killed for having blasphemed the prophet. How she went from devout believer to fearless opponent, from a loyal clan member to being renounced by her family, from Africa to Europe, and from blind faith to unbending reason is the compelling story she tells in her new autobiography entitled, with characteristic bluntness, Infidel Strictly speaking Hirsi Ali is not an infidel but an apostate, a designation that in the Koran warrants the punishment of death. The distinction is not without significance. In a poll published last week, one in three British Muslims in the 16-24 age group agreed that &apos;Muslim conversion is forbidden and punishable by death&apos;. This figure comes as no surprise to Hirsi Ali. She argues that Europe&apos;s determination to maintain cultural difference will lead increasing numbers of alienated Muslims to seek the unambiguity of fundamentalism. Liberals, she says, have shirked the responsibility of making the case for their own beliefs. They need to start speaking out in favour of the values of secular humanism. And they need to make clear that they are not compatible with religious bigotry and superstition. &apos;You have to say that if you want the Prophet Muhammad to be your moral guide in the 21st century and you are aware of the choices the Prophet Muhammad made towards unbelievers, women, homosexuals, do you really think you&apos;re going to succeed? You will get into some sort of cognitive dissonance if you at the same time want to adapt to a life here.&apos; Without an open and robust critique of the nature of the prophet&apos;s teachings, she goes on, &apos;these clerics proselytising radical Islam make much, much more sense. Because the radical Muslims say that democracy is bad, and the young Muslim mind says &quot;Why is it bad?&quot;. Because the Koran says it&apos;s bad. That makes more sense than democracy is good, the rights of individuals must be observed but you can also hang on to what the Koran says. I say stop that and appeal to and challenge young minds.&apos; When it comes to words, Hirsi Ali is not one to look for the mincer. She speaks in a language that makes no concessions to the softening euphemisms of political correctness. Those immersed in circumspection and ever vigilant to the contemporary sin of offence are bound to ask themselves if she&apos;s allowed to say what she says. In this respect her predicament is reminiscent of the moment in Basic Instinct when Sharon Stone lights a cigarette under interrogation in a police station. She&apos;s told that&apos;s it&apos;s non-smoking environment and she replies: &apos;So arrest me.&apos; Hirsi Ali&apos;s life is already in jeopardy. She&apos;s long past the point of polite restraint. Some observers find her forthright approach refreshing and, indeed, intoxicating, but many recoil from her unadorned conviction. Writing in the New York Review of Books, the historian Timothy Garton Ash described Hirsi Ali as a &apos;slightly simplistic Enlightenment fundamentalist&apos;. Last year when Garton Ash chaired a discussion with Hirsi Ali at the ICA, he seemed both to admire the incisiveness of her quietly spoken logic and to wince at its unshakeable conclusions. &apos;For him,&apos; Hirsi Ali laughs, &apos;the Enlightenment is complex. For me, it isn&apos;t. There&apos;s nothing complex about it.&apos; A student of 17th- and 18th-century political ideas, she doesn&apos;t mean that she thinks the Enlightenment was some kind of uniform philosophical movement. The simplicity, for her, is the legacy of the Enlightenment, the things we take for granted about Western sociopolitical culture: the rule of law, the rights of the individual, freedom of expression. To Hirsi Ali these are bedrock precepts that should not be compromised in the name of cultural diversity. Most of the political classes would agree with her in principle but like to take a more nuanced, and often evasive, stance in practice. She was one of the few intellectuals, for example, who rushed to support the Danes in the cartoon crisis last year. If you believe in the right of freedom of expression, she says, you have to defend that right. In a debate a few years back, Hirsi Ali challenged the Swiss Muslim academic Tariq Ramadan, something of a poster boy for the multicultural left, to be more consistent and clear-cut in what he said. Was the Koran the word of God or a man-made text that was out of date? Ramadan responded by questioning Hirsi Ali&apos;s adversarial style. &apos;The question,&apos; he said, &apos;is whether you want to change the mentality or please the audience.&apos; Does her bald delivery not further alienate Muslims, forcing them to cling to traditional values? Hirsi Ali is too smooth of skin and composure to bristle, but it is obviously an accusation she finds irritating. &apos;Tariq Ramadan is filled with contempt for Muslims because he believes they have no faculties of reason,&apos; she replies in a beguilingly friendly tone, as though she had remarked that he had an excellent taste in shirts. &apos;If I say that terrorism is created in the name of Islam suddenly they take up terrorism? He gives me so much more power than I have. Why don&apos;t my remarks make him turn to terrorism? Because he&apos;s above that. Like many believers in multiculturalism, he puts himself on a higher plane. The other thing is that it&apos;s not about your style, it&apos;s about your content. Are my propositions right or wrong? Is it social, cultural and religious beliefs that cause economic backwardness or is it the other way round? My take on this is the cultural and religious elements are far more important to look at. That is what we should be looking at and not how I say it.&apos; All the same, it&apos;s fair to say that her audience is made up largely of white liberal males, rather than the Muslim women she wishes to liberate. In Holland, a female Muslim politician named Fatima Elatik told me: &apos;She&apos;s appealing to Dutch society, to middle-class Dutch-origin people. She talks about the emancipation of women but you can&apos;t push it down their throats. If I could talk to her, I would tell her that she needs to get a couple of Muslim women around her.&apos; Hirsi Ali dismisses this as &apos;a very silly remark. I started off in a position where none of these women were visible anyway except as proxies to be put forward to get subsidies from the government. Just keep singing we&apos;re discriminated against. No Muslim women are allowed into this debate by their own groups. So it&apos;s way too early. By the time these women are assertive enough, I won&apos;t be around. It will be one generation on.&apos; She also argues that it&apos;s important to address white liberals because they need to overcome the self-censoring effects of post-colonial guilt. &apos;If you want to feel guilty,&apos; snaps Hirsi Ali, &apos;feel guilty that you didn&apos;t bring John Stuart Mill and left us only with the Koran. It doesn&apos;t help to say my forefathers oppressed your forefathers, and remain guilty forever.&apos; There is no zealot like the convert, goes the old saying, and many commentators have concluded that Hirsi Ali is a prime secular example. &apos;In a pattern familiar to historians of political intellectuals,&apos; wrote Garton Ash, &apos;she has gone from one extreme to the other&apos;. The word on Hirsi Ali is that she is &apos;traumatised&apos; by her upbringing and her subsequent adoption of a Western lifestyle. It&apos;s the word that Ian Buruma uses to describe her condition in his book Murder In Amsterdam Needless to say, she finds this appraisal of her ideas patronising. It was, she says, partly in an effort to combat this impression that she wrote Infidel. &apos;People can see that there is not much trauma in my story.&apos; That depends on what you think constitutes trauma. The account of being held down by the legs, aged five, and having her clitoris and inner labia cut off with a pair of scissors will certainly alarm many readers. &apos;I heard it,&apos; she writes, &apos;like a butcher snipping the fat off a piece of meat.&apos; The fierce beatings she receives at the hands of her embittered mother, and the fractured skull inflicted on her by a brutal religious teacher, these too would leave psychological scars on most of us. But as Hirsi Ali writes, they were normal events in her childhood and in the lives of people she knew. Death and illness were commonplace in Africa, and by African standards she lived well. There is nothing melodramatic in Hirsi Ali&apos;s prose. It&apos;s matter-of-fact and also, as she is quick to point out, entirely subjective. It&apos;s possible, she says, that her family will remember things differently. &apos;But it&apos;s my story and if you undertake such an endeavour you have to be honest. Usually people make excuses for their culture and family etcetera. I could tell the story that we in the Third World have things that the West could learn from, which is obviously true, but that isn&apos;t what I wanted to show. My argument is that western liberal culture is superior to Islamic tribal group culture.&apos; Hirsi Ali was born Ayaan Hirsi Magan 38 years ago in Mogadishu, Somalia. Her father, Hirsi Magan Isse, was a leading figure in the Somali Salvation Democratic Front. He was imprisoned by the Somali dictator Siad Barre during much of Hirsi Ali&apos;s childhood, and thereafter she lived in exile with her mother and brother and sister, largely estranged from her father, who remarried. In Kenya she gained a limited amount of freedom from the strict Somali clan system, though its extended network continued to circumscribe her life. She was a good but not exceptional student at school in Nairobi and went on to attend a secretarial course. Her mother and religious instructors brought her up to distrust unbelievers and to hate Jews, who, she was told, were responsible for all the problems of the world. Her mother did not want her daughters to work and in 1992 her father announced that he had arranged a marriage to a distant cousin living in Canada. Hirsi Ali maintains that she had no desire to marry the man but also, given family and clan honour, no choice. &apos;I was condemned to a predictable fate,&apos; she writes, &apos;that of being a subservient wife to a stranger.&apos; En route to her husband in Canada she stopped over in Germany, and from there she went to Holland where, in a sudden surge of self-empowerment, she claimed asylum. She was told that running away from an arranged marriage was no reason to be awarded refugee status, so she made up a story about fleeing persecution in Somalia. It was then that she changed her name to Ali, the better to elude her infuriated clan. She marvelled at the free room and board and health care provided by the Dutch state: &apos;...all these people were busy helping you, and this for foreigners. How on earth did they treat their own clans?&apos; Not all her fellow refugees were quite so appreciative. Many complained of racism and saw themselves as victims of European imperialism. &apos;The Europeans had colonised Somalia,&apos; writes Hirsi Ali in characterising this sense of grievance, &apos;which was why we all had no qualifications and were in this mess to begin with. I thought that was so clearly nonsense. We had torn ourselves apart, all on our own.&apos; Little by little, she dropped the trappings of her culture and religion. First she removed her headscarf, then she wore jeans, rode a bicycle, fraternised with Dutch people, and with Jews, went to a pub, later drank a glass of wine, and eventually she met and moved in with a Dutch man. But her younger sister, who had been more of a rebel, joined Hirsi Ali in Holland and grew increasingly religious, to the point of psychosis. She returned to Africa and died following a miscarriage. Working as a translator for Dutch social services, Hirsi Ali came across a hidden world of domestic violence, honour killings and of women entombed in the home, unable to speak Dutch or English and with no idea about the society in which they lived. &apos;While the Dutch were generously contributing money to international aid organisations,&apos; she writes, &apos;they were also ignoring the silent suffering of Muslim women and children in their own backyard.&apos; She took a degree in political science at Leiden university - no mean feat for a refugee without any previous academic ambition - after which she became a researcher with a Labour party think tank, looking at immigration. By now her belief in Islam was precariously loose but she still held on to the idea that she was a Muslim. But the events of 11 September 2001 changed that. &apos;The little shutter at the back of my mind, where I pushed all my dissonant thoughts, snapped open after the 9/11 attacks, and it refused to close again. I found myself thinking that the Koran is not a holy document. It is a historical record, written by humans. It is one version of events, as perceived by the men who wrote it 150 years after the Prophet died. And it is a very tribal and Arab version of events. It spreads a culture that is brutal, bigoted, fixated on controlling women, and harsh in war.&apos; She decided that what the Muslim world needed was its own Voltaire. And after she wrote an article outlining her ideas and concerns, some readers decided that they had found their new Spinoza, the 17th-century Jewish refugee from the Inquisition who came to Holland and founded the Enlightenment. No doubt Hirsi Ali&apos;s critics would find the comparison hard to stomach. Spinoza was against religious persecution, whereas Hirsi Ali, say her opponents, is an arch exponent of Islamophobia. One such critic has written a stinging attack on Hirsi Ali in this month&apos;s Times Literary Supplement. Maria Golia, an Egyptian-based academic, writes: &apos;Hirsi Ali seems far more interested in indicting Islam than helping damaged women, whose horror stories she conveniently trots out whenever she needs to bludgeon home a point.&apos; She takes Hirsi Ali to task on female genital mutilation which, she points out, is not an Islamic practice. Hirsi Ali wanted the Dutch government to institute medical checks on young girls in vulnerable circumstances. Golia calls the idea &apos;institutionalised violence&apos; and prefers an approach that &apos;requires understanding of context and coalition-building, not to mention compassion and subtlety&apos;. It should be said that in Infidel Hirsi Ali specifically states that FGM predates Islam, is not limited to Islam and that it is not practised in many Islamic countries. However, she adds, it is very often &apos;justified in the name of Islam&apos;. Indeed one need only look at the advice of the leading Egyptian cleric, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who is considered one of the most influential scholars in Islam. Qaradawi has been promoted by London mayor Ken Livingstone as a moderate voice, but on his Islam-online website he writes of female circumcision: &apos;Anyhow, it is not obligatory, whoever finds it serving the interest of his daughters should do it, and I personally support this under the current circumstances in the modern world.&apos; She characterises the manner in which liberals sidestep such details as a confusion of facts and strategy. &apos;Some people will accept that Islam is backward but they&apos;re not going to say that because Muslims will be offended. &quot;We want them to become liberals, so we&apos;re just going to trick them into a secular humanistic way of thinking.&quot;&apos; At this she lets out a giggle, as if tickled by the absurdity of the idea. &apos;But people are aware of what&apos;s going on. That&apos;s why many Muslims are suspicious of liberals. Because they know they are not being taken seriously.&apos; Perhaps a more telling symbol of the growing cultural gap between mainstream Western society and doctrinaire Islam is the veil. Again Hirsi Ali does not look around for a fence to sit on. &apos;The veil,&apos; she says, &apos;is to show that women are responsible for the sexual self-control of men.&apos; It&apos;s a surgical observation, cutting right through to the bone of the issue. She goes on to note that in all communities where the veil is actively observed boys are not taught to restrain themselves. &apos;They look upon all those who are not veiled as women who are looking for sexual contact and they just go about molesting and being a nuisance.&apos; But what about those women who say that the veil has nothing to do with sex, that is a demonstration of their love of Allah. &apos;That is a very small group of women?&apos; But are you to deny them their right to dress as they please? &apos;No,&apos; she insists, &apos;I don&apos;t want to deny them that and I don&apos;t want anyone to deny them that.&apos; Her solution is secular civic space - for example in schools and government offices - in which all religion is removed. The French model then? That&apos;s hardly been a great success. &apos;It&apos;s never been tried,&apos; she counters. &apos;The French have voiced it but never implemented it. They&apos;ve created these zones outside Paris where people from Third World countries are put together and excluded from the secular neutral model. They&apos;ve preached secular Republicanism and practised multiculturalism, that&apos;s the whole French hypocrisy.&apos; Hirsi Ali doesn&apos;t really do small talk. She&apos;s not interested in talking about her private life, whether she is in a relationship, how often she thinks about the danger she is in, her everyday life in America, or any of the sort of personal details that fascinate people who want to know what it&apos;s like to live life under threat of death. This is partly because she is not supposed to give away any information that may aid potential attackers. But more than that, it&apos;s because she really only wants to talk about ideas. To some readers, especially Muslim readers, it may seem that she only wants to talk about one idea: the danger of Islam. Certainly, it&apos;s a major preoccupation. But for all her clinical rhetoric, Hirsi Ali is not really interested in carving the world into two blocks of clashing civilisations. At heart she is a universalist, a passionate believer in human rights. If you believe in equality for women, then you must believe in equality for all women, regardless of their culture or religion. Her deepest wish is to allow the world&apos;s oppressed peoples, especially women, to share in the fruits of reason. &apos;And to do that,&apos; she says, &apos;someone&apos;s got to shake the tree.&apos; As she sees it, Islamic society is inimical to development. &apos;So everyone wants to move here, and they want to make this place look like there. We shouldn&apos;t cling to the customs and beliefs that caused us to move out in the first place. Unfortunately people in the Third World think that just by moving house they leave their misery behind. And that&apos;s what the integration debate is about: if you take those values with you and come here, it&apos;s not going to change your misery.&apos; This is in essence what Tony Blair said a few weeks back when he spoke about a &apos;duty to integrate&apos;, and suggested that those people looking to move to Britain who didn&apos;t agree with British values should perhaps think about not coming. To some, Blair&apos;s comments were tantamount to a crude &apos;send &apos;em back&apos; agenda. This in itself is perhaps reason to be thankful for Hirsi Ali. She knows what life is like without the benefit of the freedoms and rights that Europe has established and she, at least, is not afraid to emphasise how crucial it is not to lose them. But of course in voicing her opinion in the style she does, she risks lumping together over a billion people from different nations, cultures and traditions as a single &apos;problem&apos;. For Hirsi Ali, the problem is one of self-definition. If Muslims want to assert a religious text as the basis of their public identity, then they have to accept public debate of that text and its ideas with all the discomfort and offence that may involve. In truth there is probably room for both what Hirsi Ali calls &apos;Tariq Ramadan gymnastics&apos; and her more uncompromising approach.

Yet the official launch of the AT+T Williams-Toyota on Friday morning carried an air of renewal and anticipation that had more to do with an open season ahead than the restructuring of the Williams technical department and a new association with Toyota and a title sponsor. &apos;It&apos;s impossible to predict anything,&apos; said Williams. &apos;There are two reasons: the technical rules have remained stable for quite some time, which means everyone has closed up in terms of competitiveness, and there is just one tyre company supplying every team.&apos; Bridgestone&apos;s monopoly will rid F1 of the variation in performance evident last year when the Michelin tyre worked better than Bridgestone&apos;s offering, and vice versa, depending on track conditions. The single make of tyre will help to level the playing field but Williams was too polite to mention that his enthusiasm to start racing in Melbourne on 18 March has also been fuelled by the fact that the top teams are in various states of disarray. ING Renault launched their 2007 car in Amsterdam on 24 January. The replacement of Mild Seven by ING marked a significant landmark in motor racing sponsorship as tobacco companies make their enforced departure 39 years after the appearance of John Player&apos;s Gold Leaf symbol on a Lotus. The Renault R27, an elegant development of last year&apos;s championship winning car, may have looked purposeful but there could be no disguising the vacuum left by Fernando Alonso&apos;s move to McLaren. Giancarlo Fisichella steps into the lead role but his awkward attempt at self-assurance perhaps indicated that the Italian&apos;s confidence has been pummelled by Alonso&apos;s natural brilliance during the past two seasons. Indeed, Fisichella may find himself looking over his shoulder as Heikki Kovalainen is promoted from test driver and joins Lewis Hamilton as leading novices. Kovalainen&apos;s entry will be low-key when compared to the attention that will surround Hamilton as he becomes the first mixed-race driver in F1. McLaren-Mercedes have gone to significant lengths to protect the 2-year-old from the media but full-page stories devoted to an innocuous crash by Hamilton during testing last week are a sign of the unreasonable expectation being heaped upon the youngster. The McLaren, in its silver colour scheme, may not be one of the prettiest cars but it promises to be among the quickest. The question, as ever with McLaren, surrounds the ability to make the car last until the end of each race and allow Alonso to join Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher as the only drivers to have won the title for three years in succession. Schumacher&apos;s retirement will be keenly felt at Ferrari, as will the absence of Ross Brawn following the English technical director&apos;s decision to take a sabbatical. The Ferrari designers have gone out on a limb with their new car, a theory that will place the Italian team either streets ahead of the opposition or struggling to keep up. If it is the latter, then Kimi Raikkonen, who has moved from McLaren and is renowned for a lack of mechanical sympathy, is the last man Ferrari need to help sort out the problem. Furthermore, Ferrari may no longer have the counsel of Nigel Stepney. The Englishman, a former mechanic with Lotus, has been a vital part of the technical management but his sudden wish to look elsewhere after 13 years at Maranello is an indication of simmering unease as the technical team regroup. Honda are one of the few teams to remain a cohesive fighting unit. Jenson Button, finally at the top of his game, is confident and aggressive enough to win consistently and take the title but questions remain over Honda&apos;s ability to provide the Englishman with a car that is quick enough. Red Bull remain a similarly unknown quantity as their first car from the pen of Adrian Newey (ex Williams and McLaren) carries the hopes of Mark Webber and David Coulthard. Judging by the Australian&apos;s blunt comments to his national media, Webber is not sorry to have left Williams after a disappointing two seasons. Although they remain tight-lipped officially, there is the impression from Williams employees that the feeling is mutual. Alex Wurz replaces Webber and the Austrian clearly has a much better working relationship with Nico Rosberg than the novice enjoyed with Webber last year. Against all odds, Williams might be in a position to collect points consistently while the rest find their feet. Sir Frank Williams knows that anything is possible. Two years after the struggles of the 1978 season his team took the title - but even Williams, for all his experience, will not begin to hazard a guess on who might win the championship in 2007.", "sentences": ["ING Renault launched their 2007 car in Amsterdam on 24 January."], "title": "Formula One: Disarray gives Williams hope", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/feb/04/formulaone.sport", "tags": ["Formula One", "Sport", "Formula one 2007", "Williams"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-06T00:07:25Z", "article": "If England are never free of injuries, they can only be thankful when the handful of key personnel are spared. Steve McClaren will be glad that Wayne Rooney is not yet ruled out of tomorrow&apos;s friendly with Spain at Old Trafford after seeming to hurt his back at White Hart Lane on Sunday. A decision on his fitness is to be taken by the Football Association&apos;s medical staff today. As he waits on that verdict, McClaren was dismayed to see Wayne Bridge leave the squad and return to Chelsea because of a thigh strain. With Ashley Cole already ruled out by a knee injury, England lack both regular candidates for the position. Aston Villa&apos;s Gareth Barry, uncapped since June 2003, is likely to fill the vacancy if McClaren does not turn to Phil Neville. So far the manager&apos;s plans have been impaired only by the absence of Andrew Johnson who, like Jermaine Jenas and Chris Kirkland, is injured. McClaren used the Everton striker in a three-man attack for England&apos;s last outing, the 1-1 draw with Holland in November, and would probably have employed him thus tomorrow. While the personnel have altered, it would seem sensible for England to look again at the 4-3-3 system that had its merits in Amsterdam. Kieron Dyer, who has not featured for his country since March 2005, could well start on the left of the forward line, with Rooney in the centre and Aaron Lennon on the right. Should Rooney be ruled out, the vacancy could be filled by Peter Crouch, although the Liverpool target man&apos;s inclusion would come at the expense of some fluidity. Certain conclusions have been arrived at without difficulty. Owen Hargreaves, by his own choice, will be excused service tomorrow. His comeback from a broken fibula was made last Friday but the Bayern Munich midfielder informed McClaren that he felt &quot;a bit tired and sore&quot; after the 3-0 defeat by Nuremberg. The position in deep midfield will be taken by Michael Carrick, with Steven Gerrard appreciating the presence of that kind of footballer. Gerrard, standing in for John Terry as captain, stated that his much doubted partnership with Frank Lampard will flourish if there is someone holding. &quot;You will get the best out of us if we&apos;re given licence to break forward.&quot; Security of a different sort will be provided by Jonathan Woodgate.

He has just conducted his Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in a scintillating programme of Berlioz, Debussy, Berio and Ravel - one of two concerts they will play at London&apos;s Barbican this weekend - but, a lifelong perfectionist, he is not completely happy, and is talking things over with a committee from the orchestra. When I&apos;m finally allowed through to the conductor&apos;s dressing room to meet him - a place where everyone from Gustav Mahler to Leonard Bernstein has taken up residence - he explains. &quot;This is the third time we do this programme. I must say that these Sunday midday concerts are not easy to do. Psychologically, physically the energy is difficult. &quot;I prefer evening concerts. But you know maybe, because it was the third time, there was room for some improvisation and in Debussy&apos;s La Mer, we got a very transparent, very nice sound, and in Ravel&apos;s La Valse as well. But I think the second evening was perhaps the best.&quot; I trust his assessment of his afternoon&apos;s work, but it is hard to imagine how the concert I&apos;ve just heard could have been improved upon. It&apos;s my first time in the Concertgebouw. By reputation, this is one of the world&apos;s greatest acoustics for orchestral music. All I can say is that I&apos;ve never heard an orchestra sound as thrillingly clear or as overwhelmingly sensual as it does here: the delicate splashes of the percussion writing in La Mer were shimmeringly evocative, the huge climaxes of La Valse massively powerful. But acoustics are meaningless without the virtuosity of the performers, and Jansons moulded the opulent warmth of the Concertgebouw&apos;s string section and its dazzling woodwind players into a compelling whole. La Mer was not just an impressionistic illustration of the sea, but a physical experience in its own right, an ocean of sound that contained everything from limpid tranquillity to vicious storms; La Valse a devastating dramatisation of the moment when the pleasure of sensual abandon, the voluptuous rhythm of the waltz, curdles into decadent over-indulgence. For all his brilliance at the helm, Jansons can&apos;t take the credit for turning the Concertgebouw into a world-class band: since its formation in 1888, the orchestra has been recognised as one of the world&apos;s best. Jansons is, however, only the sixth man in charge of the ensemble, taking over from Italian Riccardo Chailly in 2004. I ask him about his vision for the future. &quot;I just want to continue the growth of this wonderful orchestra, and to play a repertoire that goes from Haydn up to contemporary composers. But, you know, even if it&apos;s a top-class orchestra, nothing comes by itself. You must always work to get the best results. Talent is one thing, but work is work - always work.&quot; Jansons, who has just turned 64, should know. He is a product of one the most intense musical educations anywhere in the world. Born in Latvia, where his father was conductor of the opera house in Riga, the family moved to Leningrad when he was in his early teens and Jansons enrolled on the legendary conducting course at the Leningrad Conservatoire. &quot;It was the best training in the world for conductors. We had fantastic opportunities because there was a professional orchestra in the conservatory that we could conduct, and an opera house, too. Such a unique thing doesn&apos;t happen any more.&quot; But conducting was in Jansons&apos; musical make-up right from the start. His father was a role model, and conducting was a dream that the young boy played out in childhood games and fantasies. &quot;It started when I was four or five,&quot; he says. &quot;I made an orchestra of buttons, of paperclips, and rubber erasers - thousands of things - and I would conduct concerts.&quot; Jansons would lay out this miniature orchestra in minute detail, with different formations for different repertoire, and conduct whole pieces from full scores. &quot;If my mother changed one piece for another, I could recognise immediately what had been altered, that there was a button - a player - in the wrong place! I would design whole programmes, and conduct them in rehearsals, after which I would clear them away, and then they would come back for the concert.&quot; Jansons would even dress up in different concert outfits, depending on whether it was a matinee or evening gig. &quot;I played this game for a very long time. Until I was 14 or 15.&quot; It&apos;s a passion that led him - after the transition from buttons to flesh-and-blood players - to long associations with the St Petersburg Philharmonic, where he was involved for 30 years, a two-decade stint transforming the Oslo Philharmonic from also-rans to world-beaters, and later pulling off a similar trick with the Pittsburgh Symphony in the US. Today, the Concertgebouw isn&apos;t Jansons&apos; only job: he&apos;s also music director of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in Munich. While the Bavarians are not in the same league as the Concertgebouw in terms of fame or prestige, they are a force to be reckoned with, as Jansons showed at the Proms a couple of years ago. During a performance of Strauss&apos;s Ein Heldenleben, the lights in the Albert Hall went out, but Jansons and the orchestra simply kept playing from memory until they were turned on again. How on earth does he manage these two demanding positions in Holland and Germany? &quot;I must treat them both equally. I always say that I&apos;ve divided myself into two Jansons: 100% Jansons in Amsterdam and 100% Jansons in Munich. I have to be very objective, and not prioritise one over the other.&quot; He would say that, of course, but this musical multi-tasking can lead to problems: &quot;I have to be careful about tours, not to play the same piece in the same city with the different orchestras.&quot; It&apos;s a headache, too, for orchestra managers and tour promoters, all of whom want as much as they can get from him. And the endless round of international travel leaves its mark on Jansons&apos; personal life. His constant companion is his wife Irina, who has devoted her life to accompanying him at every rehearsal and concert. They don&apos;t have a base in Amsterdam, living instead in hotels for the 12 weeks of the year they are in Holland, and their home is still St Petersburg. &quot;I don&apos;t perform at all there any more,&quot; says the conductor. &quot;So between tours, I go to St Petersburg and feel at home. I read, I prepare scores, but I&apos;m not doing anything else there. You need somewhere to have some kind of rest in your life.&quot; He doesn&apos;t take holidays, either. Last year, he squeezed in some time in Mauritius after a gruelling tour of Japan and Taiwan with the Concertgebouw. But this week in the sun turned into a chance to catch up on work: &quot;I was working on Beethoven&apos;s Ninth, so every day I was with the score on the beach.&quot; Jansons lives his life with the same intensity that defines any of his performances. But he is lucky to be able to live it in the way he does. Eleven years ago, conducting Puccini&apos;s La Boh\u00e8me in Oslo, Jansons had a heart attack on the podium, just before the end of the piece. He says he knew what was happening to him - his father collapsed and died while conducting a concert with the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra - but still felt he could get to the end of the opera. As he collapsed, he was still beating time. Now fitted with a defibrillator to prevent heart attacks in the future, he says it&apos;s an experience that changed his approach to music and to life. &quot;You know, when you face such a dramatic moment in your life, it influences you - not consciously, but sub-consciously. &quot;I think you become a more profound person. I felt that I started to like more quiet music, definitely; I started to enjoy performing more profound music, more slow tempos. But you have to forget about it as well - you can&apos;t always think about that experience, even if, from a medical point of view, you must never forget.&quot; He admits to not always being as careful with his health now as he was in the immediate aftermath of his operation: Irina offers me a sumptuous selection from Jansons&apos; favourite chocolates - ironically called Puccini - before I leave. Jansons&apos; life now looks like the charmed life of the maestro, able to pick and choose his programmes, his soloists, and his orchestras: every concert he gives with the London Symphony Orchestra is a highlight, and it&apos;s the same with the Vienna Philharmonic. But he still has unrequited musical passions. &quot;I want to do opera, more opera. My problem is that I don&apos;t have the time. But I grew up in the opera house, and my biggest passion is opera. &quot;I&apos;m so happy with the Concertgebouw because I get to do opera every couple of years - it&apos;s Carmen next. But this is my problem: I really want to do more.&quot; I put it to him that there&apos;s a simple solution: give up one of his orchestras. He looks pained, and says, &quot;it&apos;s good to have dreams, and if you don&apos;t fulfil them, it&apos;s OK; hopefully, you can in your next life. In my next life, I&apos;d like to do only opera.&quot; In this life, for the moment at least, the opera world&apos;s loss is the concert hall&apos;s gain. \u00b7 Poulenc&apos;s Gloria and Honegger&apos;s Symphonie Liturgique, conducted by Mariss Jansons, is out now on RCO Live; a 14-CD box set, Anthology of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, is released next month.

While England were losing to Spain in Manchester, Raymond Domenech&apos;s World Cup finalists were going down by a single goal to Argentina in front of 79,000 at the Stade de France. Guus Hiddink&apos;s Russia, lying in wait for Steve McClaren&apos;s side in their Euro 2008 qualifying group, lost 4-1 in Amsterdam to Marco van Basten&apos;s Holland. And it cannot be denied that the enforced absence of Wayne Rooney, Aaron Lennon, Joe Cole, Owen Hargreaves and Ashley Cole deprived England of their three most creative players, the man whose belated introduction in Germany last summer brought a degree of order where muddle-headedness had reigned, and the full-back who gives the left side of the team whatever authority and dynamism it possesses. Without them on Wednesday, however, England had nothing to offer and looked a nothing side. And, unfortunately, it was the reviled Luis Aragon\u00e9s who penetrated the snowstorm of meaningless post-match soundbites delivered by England&apos;s head coach and his players with a remark that struck deep and true. &quot;England are a strong team,&quot; Spain&apos;s coach said, &quot;but we were thinking more quickly as footballers and my players knew where to play the ball when they received it. I think that was the difference between the two sides.&quot; Aragon\u00e9s was talking specifically about England&apos;s weakness on the left flank, an old achilles heel rendered even more nakedly vulnerable by a starting line-up so bizarrely dysfunctional that it asked serious questions about the ability of McClaren and Terry Venables, his assistant, even to reach, never mind exceed, the standards of Sven-Goran Eriksson. Whatever the Swede&apos;s faults, he never wrote out a team sheet marred by the kind of tactical illiteracy demonstrated by McClaren and Venables on England&apos;s final visit to Old Trafford. Lacking Ashley Cole and his understudy Wayne Bridge, the coaching duumvirate preferred the right-footed Phil Neville to Gareth Barry, who is left-footed and has played in the position many times for his club and for England&apos;s age-group teams. Barry has been appearing on the left side of Aston Villa&apos;s midfield this season, and McClaren apparently promised to give him a chance in that position for England. The way the substitutions went, however, the Villa man ended the match at left-back anyway, so he might as well have started there. In front of the younger Neville, Frank Lampard occupied a space best described as inside-left, with no one outside him. Nor, since this was not a 4-3-3 but a 4-1-3-2, was there anyone to occupy the wide space in front of him. So there was no proper left-back capable of overlapping, no wide midfield player on the left side capable of helping his defender, and no left winger either. Not since Kevin Keegan picked Gareth Southgate in midfield against Germany six years ago had an England coach got it so wrong before a ball was kicked. No wonder Aragon\u00e9s mentioned his surprise at the number of times Spain were allowed to get two attackers on one defender down that side of the field. And, as he said, his players noticed the opportunity and took advantage of it, thereby exposing England&apos;s oldest and most damaging defect: an inability to think for themselves in anything other than the most limited terms. It is as if their egos are too inflated to allow them to recognise that the course of a match might be swayed by anything other than their mere presence on the pitch. That, as the world knows, is far from the truth. At Old Trafford the chance was there for them to show their qualities. Spain were on a run of poor results, and their defence, Carles Puyol apart, is hardly a steel wall. But all England managed to prove was that Shaun Wright-Phillips and Peter Crouch - for all his impressive scoring record - are not international footballers.  Neither, one has to say, is Lampard, whose 52 caps include how many truly effective performances? Half a dozen, at the outside? The time has come for McClaren to admit that Lampard and Steven Gerrard are never going to hit it off in the same team, even with a Hargreaves or a Michael Carrick behind them, and to conclude that the Liverpool captain&apos;s ability to energise his team-mates must be allowed to count for more than the skills of Lampard. It was noticeable that when Joey Barton came on for the Chelsea man in the 79th minute, just about the first thing he did was push the ball up to Crouch and then race forward to get ahead of the striker, hoping for a return that failed to arrive. Obviously nobody had told him that England&apos;s central midfielders simply do not do that sort of thing. Perhaps someone had a word, because he did not try it again. In the end, however, it was England&apos;s coaches, not their players, who were on trial on Wednesday. In failing to devise ways to compensate for the absence of a handful of influential regulars, McClaren and Venables gave the impression that they are not up to the job.", "sentences": ["Guus Hiddink&apos;s Russia, lying in wait for Steve McClaren&apos;s side in their Euro 2008 qualifying group, lost 4-1 in Amsterdam to Marco van Basten&apos;s Holland."], "title": "Richard Williams: Tactical illiteracy is what McClaren gives to England", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/09/sport.comment5", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-09T10:49:07Z", "article": "The cloakroom is a pokey, bullet-riddled bar.

But if you make it past the police checkpoints and the concrete barricades, the good news is that entry is free. And so far there has not been an art critic in sight. The heavy artillery on show might suggest otherwise but this is Rio de Janeiro&apos;s newest, most unusual and certainly most dangerous, modern art gallery. It is located at the heart of the Vila Cruzeiro shantytown. The open air gallery, where crumbling shacks have become giant canvasses, is the brainchild of Jeroen Koolhaas, a Dutch illustrator who works for New Yorker magazine, and Dre Urhahn, an art director from Amsterdam. &quot;Normally, outsiders would only come here to buy cocaine,&quot; said Mr Urhahn, who admits to having found empty cartridges on the scaffolding used for the painting. &quot;The museum is about giving them another reason to visit the community.&quot; Vila Cruzeiro is definitely an odd location for a museum. The favela became notorious in 2002 when a Brazilian journalist was dismembered and incinerated by local traffickers. These days, teenage gangsters surround the art gallery with military-issue grenades strung from their shorts. Gun battles between police and members of the Red Command drug faction are a regular occurrence. Recently, more than 200 military policemen, backed up by three helicopters, launched an assault on the favela, killing at least six &quot;suspects&quot; and wounding several civilians. Roberto Carlos Teixeira, a local social worker, estimates that there are at least 120,000 young people in the Complexo da Penha, a labyrinth of shantytowns that includes Vila Cruzeiro. &quot;I&apos;d be surprised if 50 of these kids had ever visited an art gallery,&quot; he said. The launch of Vila Cruzeiro&apos;s own outdoor gallery has brought about some optimism. Working so far mainly to the designs of the two Dutchmen, the residents have been painting huge murals on the exteriors of their homes. &quot;Everyone in the favela approves of it 101%,&quot; said Alex Rigueira, 32, the owner of one concrete shack transformed into a vast sky-blue mural by the Favela Painting Project.

In 1966, when I first went there, it was rather different. Non-Catalans thought it was provincial, like the rest of Spain. Nobody outside Catalonia, and by no means everyone inside it, would have agreed with the argument of Barcelona and Modernity: Gaud\u00ed to Dali, the new show opening at the Met in New York next month, which is essentially that, between 1870 and 1920, Barcelona was intermittently a great cultural centre, to be reckoned as one of the essential proving grounds of modernism. So many Americans, and even some Europeans, were used to thinking that modernism had two capitals: Paris and New York. You could hardly even call this view simplified. It was blind. It left out Vienna. It ignored London. It downplayed Berlin. And as for Barcelona, what did I know about it, in my semi-virginal ignorance during the mid-1960s? That three decades before, in the name of the doomed Spanish republic, it had stubbornly resisted General Franco and paid a heavy, bitter price for it. That George Orwell had written a book about it called Homage to Catalonia; that in it he had been spectacularly wrong in dissing the admittedly very weird architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, claimed by the French surrealists, who had designed that enormous penitential church apparently made of melted candle-wax and chicken-guts, the Sagrada Familia. That was about it. Forty years ago, the foreigner&apos;s knowledge of Barcelona was so embarrassingly slight that we weren&apos;t even embarrassed by it. The 1,500 years of the city&apos;s existence had produced only five names that came readily to mind. There was Gaud\u00ed, and the century&apos;s greatest cellist, Pablo Casals. There were the painters Salvador Dali, Joan Miro and Pablo Picasso, who, although he was born in Malaga and spent most of his long life in France, had become a sort of honorary Catalan because he studied at the art school in Barcelona. But even the appreciation of Dali and Miro was considerably distorted because those who loved them didn&apos;t appreciate their Catalan roots. Miro, for instance, was a country boy to whose imagery the folk culture of Catalonia, with its obsessive concentration on shit as a rural sacrament, was absolutely basic; such meanings were not at all obvious when seen from Paris or New York. Of other Catalan artists who were older than Picasso, and were at the time rather his superiors, such as that superbly fluent and piercing draughtsman Ramon Casas, we were quite ignorant. We got Gaud\u00ed wrong because we knew little or nothing about his deeply Catalan roots, his obsession with craft culture and his deep, Catholic piety. We took him for a proto- surrealist weirdo, which trivialises his achievement. We had no idea where to put him, although he was so manifestly radical an artist, because we were too blinded by the rhetoric of the 1960s to imagine a radicalism that was both right-wing and intensely fruitful. On the other hand, we probably wouldn&apos;t have recognised the name of an almost equally great architect of the late 19th century, Lluis Domenech i Montaner, or even been able to pronounce that of Josep Puig i Cadafalch, one of the most erudite and sophisticated designers ever to work in Europe. Of course, none of these ever built anything for a non-Catalan patron. We knew little or nothing about the magnificent murals by Romanesque artists salvaged from the collapsing churches of the Pyrenees and transferred to the National Museum of Catalan Art - which are to fresco painting what the images of Ravenna are to the art of mosaic. Barcelona hadn&apos;t produced significant painting when the siglo d&apos;oro, the &quot;golden century&quot; of Velazquez and Ribera, was at its height. Its turn would begin to come at the end of the 1800s with what Catalans called their Renaixenca - not &quot;renaissance&quot; in the Italian sense, but certainly a rebirth of energy, in which Catalan painters like Casas and Santiago Rusinol hooked into the energies of fin-de-siecle Paris (a train journey away to the north) and came up with their own realist movement: laconic, gritty and often infused with political reportage. Its centres were two: a Parisian boite called the Moulin de la Galette, and a bohemian bar- restaurant in Barcelona named Els Quatre Gats (the Four Cats). Revolt, and the smell of dynamite, was in the Catalan air as in the Parisian; indeed, through the 1890s, Barcelona was the capital of world anarchism, and the sporadic roar of explosions ratcheted up the anxieties of its middle classes then as the thought of Islamist terrorism does now. An outstanding painting by Casas was Garrote Vil, 1894, showing the execution of a young star of the anarchist movement, Santiago Salvador, whose bomb had slaughtered several dozen opera-goers during a performance of Rossini&apos;s William Tell. An artist of marvellous facility, Casas moved with ease between the lower and upper crusts of Barcelona, becoming the city&apos;s chief social recorder. His self-portrait, pedalling a tandem bicycle with his friend Pere (Peter) Romeu, the lugubrious, rabbit-toothed manager of the Four Cats, is one of the indelible emblems of the period. A good deal of expert, witty and sometimes moving work came out of the Catalan Renaixenca, though it certainly produced no painter as great as Adolf von Menzel in Germany, Isaac Levitan in Russia or Frederic Church in the United States. But it did create an extraordinary city plan, the Eixample, or &quot;enlargement&quot;, of Barcelona into the grid of equal squares that surrounds the medieval city. The Eixample was the ancestor of all grid cities to come after the 1860s, including Manhattan. Its visionary designer was Ildefons Cerda. Trained as a civil engineer in Madrid, he had written a treatise on the appalling housing conditions of the old city, which he was determined to change. While the bards of 19th-century Catalonia - obsessed by the desire to revive their lost cultural independence - were warbling nostalgically about the need to bring back the glories of the Catalan middle ages, it was clear that in terms of hygiene and social services, the ordinary working folk of Barcelona inside the muralles - the corset of walls in which the Bourbons had imprisoned the rebellious, working-class ciutat vella, or old core of medieval-to-18th-century Barcelona - had never escaped them. And because of the explosive industrial growth of their city, conditions were getting worse all the time. Cerda would change this. He envisioned his new city, built on the sloping plain outside the muralles, as a perfect fabric of identically sized blocks, covering nine square kilometres with their regimented grid. It was therefore quite different to Baron Haussmann&apos;s plans for Paris. Haussmann needed to demolish an ancient city. Cerda had nothing to demolish. He had the urbanist&apos;s dream, a blank slate. Cerda thought of each of his blocks as a social cross-section: there would be no &quot;good&quot; and no &quot;bad&quot; end of town, and the cellular plan could be expanded forever. Only a third of each block, about 5,000 square metres, would be built on; the rest would be patio and green space. Cerda&apos;s standard block would have 700,000 square feet of built floor space and a maximum height of 65 feet. Over the next century such restrictions went by the board, particularly during the Franco era. Developers and corrupt officials made a travesty of Cerda&apos;s plan. Nevertheless, the new city, from the 1870s on, became a treasury of new architecture, which fused two seemingly incompatible desires: to be modern, and to recapitulate the glories of the Catalan past. Painting had not done this. But building would. Llu is Domenech i Montaner, born 1849, died 1923, was the great theorist and the practical all-rounder of Catalan architectural nationalism. He was widely travelled, deeply read, and a scholar of everything from iron forging to medieval heraldry. This protean figure was the son of a Barcelona bookbinder. He was politically more conservative than William Morris in England, but a somewhat analogous figure and just as delightful a personality. Domenech was absorbed by the problem of defining a national architecture, a necessary thing for Catalans if they were to assert their difference from the rest of Spain. All talk about design and building, he declared in a manifesto published in 1878, has to centre on this. In writing, we can say who we are and what we aspire to be. We can imagine painting making similar declarations. But can architecture do it? And if so, how? We modern Europeans, he argued, live in a culture which is alive but also a museum. Through it we get access to a huge variety of prototypes and ideas - Greek, Gothic, Vitruvian, Indian, Egyptian and Islamic building forms, and we ought to be proficient in all of them. But none of them constitutes our central myth, technology itself. In a world of iron and glass, of chemistry and electricity, Domenech wrote, &quot;everything heralds the appearance of a new era for architecture&quot;. Spain, he went on, has two great wells of architecture. One is the Romanesque and Gothic in Catalonia. The other, in the south, owing its existence to the Arabs, is Islamic: Granada, Seville, Cordoba. Neither excludes the other and local patriotism must not make it seem to. A truly national architecture has to draw strength from both, but it will not do so just by copying. A wonderful example of what he meant was in fact one of his earliest buildings, designed for the 1888 Universal Exposition: the cafe-restaurant, now converted into a zoological museum. It looks medieval, with its crenellations and white ceramic shields, but these are actually an early form of pop art, advertising Catalan produce and even the drinks the cafe was offering its customers. And the building itself is made of plain brick and industrial iron. The stretch between its medievalism and the modernity of its materials makes it an early modernist landmark. To use plain brick in a festive urban building in 1888 was close to a breach of etiquette. The very word for brick in Catalan, totxo, also meant &quot;ugly&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot;. But Domenech thought brick ought to be used plainly. To him, as to Gaud\u00ed and to their younger colleague Puig i Cadafalch, it was clar i catala, &quot;clear and Catalan&quot;. The same with iron, about whose unembellished use young Domenech was just as explicit. He let his iron framing show. He also used painted, glazed and moulded ornament, but never to obscure the structure underneath. This reached an extreme in the ceramic flowers on the structural grid of his masterpiece of the early 1900s, the Palau de la Musica Catalana, or &quot;Palace of Catalan Music&quot;. This amazing building had been designed to house a choral society, formed to revive and glorify Catalan folk music - canco popular. This in turn would serve as a bridge to classical music, musica universal - Bach, Beethoven, Handel, Berlioz, Mahler and especially (the favourite musical obsession of educated Catalans) Wagner, who was regarded as an honorary Catalan - &quot;an instrument and a sign of national culture&quot;, as one Catalan put it. They saw in his work for Germany an achieved parallel to their own desire to create a myth of national identity for Catalonia. His holy mountains, like Montsalvat, Parsifal&apos;s birthplace, were their holy mountains. Moreover, the age of Wagner&apos;s themes contrasted with the daring newness of his forms. Wagner had meant the Ring cycle to be the founding epic of Bavaria. Its mission was to describe the identity of the German race. Likewise, the Renaixenca was obsessed by the supposed uniqueness of the Catalan people. It sought its modernism in an idealised, mythic past. No wonder Catalanists adopted Wagner as a guide to combining myths of a legendary past with the overarching myth of progress and innovation. Wagner&apos;s vision of the &quot;total work of art&quot;, in which all media played a part, had a strong allure for architects who were working out of a deep craft base to combine the talents of painters, ceramists, metalsmiths, joiners, mosaicists and glaziers. All these are present at an abnormally rich level of display in the Palau de la Musica, the most Wagnerian building in Barcelona - or the world. It is an ultimate showcase building, its vaults sheathed in pale ochre and aquamarine embossed tiles, its surfaces brilliant with roses the size of cabbages, its staircases shining with squat golden-glass balusters. But not even these prepare you for the auditorium, a large box of pink stained glass. From the middle of its ceiling a huge, spectacular skylight, or claraboia, swells down, an inverted bell or pendulous breast. Its motif is a circle of angelic choristers, diffusing a soft pink-and-blue radiance from on high. In his architecture Domenech quoted incessantly, but he did so with great intelligence and verve. So did other Catalan architects, his contemporaries, like Puig i Cadafalch, who fell under the inspiration of Dutch townhousing and, for a chocolate millionaire named Amatller, built on Passeig de Gracia a fantastically rich variant on one of those stepped facades that gaze down on the canals of Amsterdam. Its tiles, blue, cream, pink and oxblood, shine and twinkle in the Spanish sun in a way that no Dutch burgher would have tolerated. And its chromatic richness shines out against the uniformity of the Eixample &apos;s grid in a way that Ildefons Cerda would not have liked either. Puig hated the uniformity of the Eixample, and was not the only architect who did his best to disrupt it. And though no museum can borrow whole buildings, what will be shown at the Met is the utterly delectable character of high-bourgeois social surface: the curling inlaid furniture of brilliant cabinet-makers like Gaspar Homar, the delicate jewellery of Lluis Masriera, the fabrics, ceramics and bronzes that gave such iridescent texture to things of domestic use. Though Barcelona&apos;s later devotion to a more strict, International-style modernism is also set before you in lavish detail in this show, and there is a brilliant, furious sampling of republican propaganda connected to the civil war, it&apos;s inevitable that the belle-epoque material seems the most fascinating and idiosyncratic. Some things were designed by the most famous architect - and for most people, especially foreign visitors, the single most famous human being - that Barcelona ever produced, who was killed by a tram one June day in 1926. Only later, as he lay dying in the public hospital of Sant Creu, was he identified as the 74-year-old Antoni Gaud\u00ed, architect of the unfinished temple of the Sagrada Familia and a dozen other smaller (but, many believe, better) buildings in and just outside his city. The Sagrada Familia, or (to give its full name) the Expiatory Temple of the Holy Family, is beyond rival the best-known structure in Catalonia. It is to Barcelona what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris or the Harbour Bridge to Sydney: a completely irreplaceable logo. Being unfinished, it is also much misunderstood, starting with the fact that so many of the millions of tourists who visit it every year imagine that it is a &quot;cathedral&quot;. But Barcelona had already had a perfectly fine cathedral since feudal times. The Sagrada Familia was intended to be what its name says: a temple, where Catalans (and, Gaud\u00ed hoped, eventually the whole Catholic world) would converge to do penance for the sins of &quot;modernity&quot;. In the last quarter of the 19th century, the Catholic church felt it was under siege from all those forces of atheism, scientism, disobedience and doubt that its hierarchy rolled together into the portmanteau word &quot;modernism&quot;. Huge rearguard actions were fought by Rome. There was Pope Pius IX&apos;s &quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot;, launched against the threat of liberalism and listing just about every conceivable advanced or critical idea about sin, belief and duty as a loathsome heresy, to be punished in hellfire. Extreme dogmas were promulgated, such as that of papal infallibility. It is probably true to say that, in the late-19th century, the Catholic church became more ferocious in its perception of heretical threat than it had been since the time of Luther. And Gaud\u00ed, to whom a penitential relationship with an implacable God was the very core of religious belief, was just the architect to convey this in stone. What the church wanted was a new counter-reformation, based on an extreme ratcheting-up of cultic devotion to Jesus, Mary and the saints. Gaud\u00ed conceived his temple as a means to that end. It would be an ecstatically repressive building that would help atone for the &quot;excesses&quot; of democracy. &quot;Everyone has to suffer,&quot; he once told a disciple. &quot;The only ones who don&apos;t suffer are the dead. He who wants an end to suffering wants to die.&quot; Gaud\u00ed was born in 1852 in Reus, a fair-sized provincial town in the lower plains of Tarragona. He came from an artisan family of metalsmiths. The country round Tarragona is archetypally Mediterranean, hard stony country where almond trees and olives flourish in the unforgiving soil. Growing up there, Gaud\u00ed developed a passionate curiosity about its plants, animals and geology. Nature, he said later, was &quot;The Great Book, always open, that we should force ourselves to read&quot;. Everything structural or ornamental that an architect might imagine was already prefigured in natural form, in limestone grottoes or dry bones, in a beetle&apos;s shining wing case or the thrust of an ancient olive trunk. He never ceased to draw on nature. Each paving-block of Passeig de Gracia features a starfish and an octopus, originally designed for the Casa Batllo. Turtles and tortoises support the columns of the Nativity facade of the Sagrada Familia, which also has 30 different species of stone plant copied from the vege- tation of Catalunya and the Holy Land. Mushrooms become domes, or columns of the Casa Calvet. Gaud\u00ed was particularly fond of mushrooms. Most Catalans are, yet Gaud\u00ed not only perceived in them a possible origin of the column and capital, but also used a fong, a poisonous amanita mushroom, for one of the ceramic entrance domes of the Parc G\u00fcell. The columns of his masterpiece the G\u00fcell Crypt are a grove of brick trunks, sending out branches - the ribbed vaults - that lace into one another. Gaud\u00ed never forgot country buildings in stone, clay and timber - materials, he said (with a sovereign disregard for the working hours of common folk) &quot;which can be gathered by the peasants themselves in their spare time between their labours.&quot; Thus the rough stone walls of terraces in the Baix Camp became the &quot;rustic&quot; colonnades of the Parc G\u00fcell. In the latter years of his life, when making the figures for the Nativity facade of the Sagrada Familia, he made literal transcriptions from nature, by chloroforming birds and even a donkey in order to cast them in plaster. Sometimes this effigy-making was of a rather gruesome kind; in order to make infants for his scene of the Slaughter of the Innocents, he got permission from the Hospital of the Holy Cross on the Ramblas to cast the corpses of stillborn babies in plaster; live ones could not be used since they could not be prevented from moving. There exists an old photo of the inside of one of Gaud\u00ed&apos;s studios, looking like a charnel-house, with plaster bodies and limbs hanging on every wall. But what mattered most to him were the forms and structural principles that could be deduced from inanimate matter, plants and rock-forms especially. His artisan ancestry mattered immensely to Gaud\u00ed. He thought of himself as a man of his hands, not a theoretician. He said he learned about complex membranes by watching his father beat iron and copper sheets, making up the forms as he went along without drawing them first. Unlike his colleagues Puig i Cadafalch and Domenech i Montaner, he thought in terms of manual, not conceptual space. His mature work can&apos;t be imagined at all from flat drawings. Its surfaces twist and wiggle. The space flares, solemnly inflates, then collapses again. He did not like to draw - it didn&apos;t give enough information about the complex spaces he carried in his head - and he only used drawing as a last resort. Instead, he made models, from wood, clay or turnips. Because abstractions bored him, and he did not think naturally in terms of T-square architecture (orthographic projection: plan, elevations, sections), he was not highly esteemed as a student and seems not to have won exceptional grades - not the first time by any means that a genius has not seemed to be one when at school. Also, the teachers at the school were much more interested in transmitting the principles of Graeco-Roman planning and ornament to their pupils than in teaching what most interested Gaud\u00ed - rural vernacular building and Catalan medievalism. The lessons of both, he came to believe, fused in a unique sensibility that was nationalist at root, that could only be fully pursued in Catalonia - neither pinched like the Protestant north nor laxly sensuous like the deep Arabic south. &quot;Our strength and superiority lies in the balance of feeling and logic,&quot; he wrote, &quot;whereas the Nordic races become obsessive and smother feeling. And those of the south, blinded by the excess of colour, abandon reason and produce monsters.&quot; One medieval complex in particular fired Gaud\u00ed&apos;s imagination as a teenager. It was the monastery of Santa Maria de Poblet, some way inland from Barcelona, not far from Reus. This once mighty Cistercian foundation had begun in the mid-12th century. Its historical and patriotic import was immense, since from the time of his death all the kings of Aragon and Catalonia had been buried there. It was therefore the national pantheon. As architecture, it was the grandest Cistercian building in Catalonia, strong, severe and plain. But when Gaud\u00ed was a boy, Poblet was a ruin and he conceived the mad, devout idea of restoring it to at least a memory of its former glories. To him it was the arch-symbol of Catholic supremacy and Catalan identity - and the liberals had ruined it in the name of &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;rights&quot;. Thus in Gaud\u00ed&apos;s mind, religious conservatism - the more extreme, the nobler - fused with the retention of Catalan identity. Hence his obsession with making amends to God. Very luckily for him, he found a patron for his work. He was the magnate Eusebi G\u00fcell, fanatical Catholic and quintessential grandee of the Catalan establishment. Practically all Gaud\u00ed&apos;s first projects were for G\u00fcell: the fierce iron dragon gate of his finca [estate], and the weirdly lugubrious G\u00fcell Palace off the Ramblas, which has the most beautiful roof in Spain - an acropolis of 20 or more chimneys and ventilators, each sheathed in trencadis or irregular mosaics of broken tile and glass. He was fascinated by how the mosaic fragmentation of the trencadis played against the solidity of architectural form, dissolving its stability. Later, his brilliant but lesser-known colleague Josep Maria Jujol would design the trencadi patterns for the walls and serpentine seats in the park of a large (but financially unsuccessful) housing project G\u00fcell began on Mont Pelat, overlooking the city, which became the Parc G\u00fcell. G\u00fcell, as an enlightened capitalist, wanted to reduce friction between workers and management - Barcelona was a city of frequent riots and strikes. He decide d to create an industrial village, or colonia, south of Barcelona. It would have every amenity, including a church, which would naturally be de- signed by Gaud\u00ed. He started thinking about the design in 1898. The first stones were laid in 1908. Eusebi G\u00fcell died in 1918. By then, the crypt was almost finished, but there was not much above ground. What we have now is only a fragment of a dream. And yet its logic of construction, its sheer blazing inventiveness, removes it from the domain of fantasy and creates one of the world&apos;s most sublime architectural spaces. How did Gaud\u00ed do it? Upside down, with string and little bags of birdshot: the infinitely laborious ancestor of computer modelling. Gaud\u00ed draws out the plan of the crypt, and marks where each column would meet the floor. He hangs a string from each point, and connects the hanging strings with cross-strings to simulate beams, arches and vaults, attaching to each string a tiny bag of lead pellets, care- fully scaled at so many milligrams per pellet. The result is a web of forces. All the forces in the web would be tensile, since string has zero resistance to bending. Now he photographs the model 72 times, with a five-degree change of rotation each time. And he turns the photos upside down. Tension becomes compression. All the angles of lean in the crypt are plotted. And because there will be no tensile bending stress anywhere in the structure, it can be built of stone, brick and tile by traditional masons - in a technology that hasn&apos;t changed since the 14th century. \u00b7 Barcelona and Modernity: Gaud\u00ed to Dali is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, from March 7 to June 3", "sentences": ["So did other Catalan architects, his contemporaries, like Puig i Cadafalch, who fell under the inspiration of Dutch townhousing and, for a chocolate millionaire named Amatller, built on Passeig de Gracia a fantastically rich variant on one of those stepped facades that gaze down on the canals of Amsterdam."], "title": "Robert Hughes on Barcelona's uniquely Catalan architecture", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/10/architecture.spain", "tags": ["Books", "Architecture", "Travel", "Spain holidays", "Barcelona holidays", "Art and design", "Culture", "Art and design", "Catalonia holidays", "Robert Hughes", "Antoni Gaud\u00ed"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-10T14:56:07Z", "article": "The growth in video downloads could create an internet traffic jam that threatens the net&apos;s development, according to Google. Services such as YouTube, which is owned by the Californian giant, are proving tricky for internet providers to deal with and new developments could create even more problems, senior internet executives were told yesterday. &quot;The web infrastructure - and even Google&apos;s - doesn&apos;t scale,&quot; said Vincent Dureau, Google&apos;s head of TV technology. &quot;It&apos;s not going to offer the quality of service that consumers expect.&quot; Surfers around the world already use sites such as YouTube to watch videos online, but video filesharing services are increasing pressure on the internet&apos;s capacity. One of the unwitting culprits is BitTorrent, a technology already used by millions of people to obtain high-quality video over the net. Many people use it to download episodes of US TV series such as Lost, which have yet to be shown in the UK, or to see concert footage. But BitTorrent has proved controversial with Hollywood because many people also use it to download movies illegally. Later this month the system&apos;s creators are expected to launch a legitimate movie download site in conjunction with some major studios. BitTorrent hopes to draw in mainstream users with a new system which lets them legally pay for major releases such as Mission Impossible 3. It is not alone: another BitTorrent-based service, Zudeo, recently signed a deal with the BBC to distribute programmes outside the UK and the corporation is currently testing its own iPlayer download system. Despite the relatively small number of users, research indicates that systems such as BitTorrent are responsible for more than 50% of all internet traffic. Some executives fear that without proper investment, video download services could clog up the internet and cause online gridlock. &quot;Most of the internet traffic is peer-to-peer, and most of that is video. Every year we have to invest substantially just to maintain the user experience. In fact it has actually decreased,&quot; Richard Alden, chief executive of Spanish cable company ONO, told the Cable Europe Congress in Amsterdam. &quot;People don&apos;t like to talk about [the fact] that just to stand still, they have to invest.&quot; Tensions are only likely to increase with the imminent arrival of Joost, a new London-based video venture from the dotcom entrepreneurs who invented internet telephony company Skype. Like BitTorrent, it also uses peer-to-peer systems. Internet users affected by such a scenario would most likely see their high-speed broadband connections slow to a crawl and top downloads speeds reduce. A spokesman for the UK&apos;s Internet Service Providers Association, Ispa, said broadband providers were successfully dealing with a number of different services putting strain on the net. &quot;There are a variety of things putting pressure on internet providers, and BitTorrent is just one of them,&quot; he said. &quot;But there is concern about the amount of bandwidth that&apos;s used. It&apos;s one of the things that ISPs have to react to whenever something new turns up.&quot; Not everyone believes the problem is straightforward. Jonathan Arber, a technology analyst with Ovum, said internet capacity existed in abundance but the question was whether ISPs were prepared to invest their money to keep up with developments. &quot;It&apos;s not the case that the internet wasn&apos;t designed for video, because it wasn&apos;t really designed for anything,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem is that media companies are starting to use these peer-to-peer methods to distribute videos but the internet providers are the ones paying for it.&quot; The concerns come just days after hackers attempted to overload some of the internet&apos;s crucial computers. Three of the internet&apos;s 13 &quot;root servers&quot; were struck as the hackers tried to overwhelm them in a 12-hour onslaught. The attack ultimately failed, however, as the targeted computers struggled but remained operational. Explainer: BitTorrent BitTorrent is revolutionary because it makes downloading faster than any of the traditional methods; perfect for large files such as video. Instead of allowing people to swap complete items, such as music tracks or entire TV series, it breaks each piece of information into tiny fragments. The technology then finds a multiple number of sources which already have the files and downloads all the separate fragments to your computer simultaneously. The results are then reassembled into the finished article so that you can watch the video on your machine.

The concierge, meanwhile, was preparing our cabin, with its own ensuite toilet and shower, for a tipsy reunion a few hours later.  I surveyed our fellow travellers and felt a twinge of surprise as we glided through the French countryside. In the 15 years I&apos;d shunned aeroplanes for long distance trains, I had become used to being the youngest passenger in the dining car by at least 30 years. But not this time. My partner Rachel, our son Wilf and I weren&apos;t even the only young family. Only one couple could actually pass as retired. The rest of the relaxed, smiling faces belonged to adults of all ages who were thoroughly enjoying the journey to Madrid and all that free wine. It was then that I realised that our secret was out. Trains are back in fashion. In recent years, rail companies may have been slow on the uptake when it comes to fighting back against the budget airlines, but with carbon emissions now so high up on the political agenda it&apos;s safe to say that the time of the train has come. Indeed by the end of 2007 the infrastructure will be in place for a whole new era of international rail travel. Eurostar&apos;s new terminal at St Pancras, and the UK&apos;s first high-speed line, set to open in November this year, will cut journey times from London to Paris to 2\u00bc hours. Once it&apos;s up and running, there are plans to introduce tickets from the north of England and Scotland to destinations right across Europe. Manchester to Marseille, for example, or one day even Edinburgh to Istanbul. In June SNCF launches its high-speed TGV Est service, allowing passengers to travel from London to Strasbourg in a mere six hours. A new high-speed rail link between Brussels and Amsterdam is also opening in December cutting journey times by a third. In an attempt to inject even more glamour into the experience, the rolling stock will look a little different, too, having been designed by Pininfarina, the famous Italian design company that lists Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and Jaguar among its clients. Then there&apos;s the new Railteam project (eurostar.com) , which will give international rail companies in the UK, France, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Belgium and Austria the chance to offer a combined service right across the continent. Even the classic Inter Rail pass is being updated so you can cherrypick the countries you want to visit instead of the old-fashioned zone system that meant paying through the nose for a ticket covering countries you had no intention of visiting. A fully integrated network will soon be in place offering an alternative to the environmentally damaging pursuit of no-frills flying with its emotionally draining two-hour check-ins and habit of dumping you miles from where you want to go. However, once you&apos;ve tried international rail travel, you&apos;ll find it&apos;s not just a question of assuaging your environmental guilt. Those who are prepared to take a bit more time when going abroad have discovered something else, too. They&apos;ve realised that the very fact that it takes a little longer means you genuinely get to &quot;travel&quot;.  Before I stumbled upon European Rail, the company that organised our family package deal to southern Spain with a Grand Class overnight cabin that includes dinner and wine, I arranged my own rail trips abroad. And, if I&apos;m honest, organising them was always a nightmare. I had some interesting experiences though, including one memorable 24-hour trip to Warsaw via Brussels to be the best man at a friend&apos;s wedding. Despite various mishaps, it gave me a taste for a new kind of &quot;slow&quot; travel. I got my timings wrong, missed all of my connections and ended up in Cologne station at midnight reading The Day of the Jackal while being stalked by the world&apos;s worst pickpocket.  I managed to talk myself on a train to Berlin via Hamburg before getting a connection to Warsaw. I awoke at dawn in Berlin, a horizon peppered with dozing cranes beneath an orange glow. Into Poland and we passed through fields where stout men were dragging their heels behind horse-drawn ploughs. On route, I chatted to a soldier on the run from Germany before giving an impromptu English lesson to a mother and her 10-year-old son. I&apos;d also read that this stretch of the line formed part of Jonathan Harker&apos;s journey into Transylvania in Bram Stoker&apos;s Dracula, something that gave the thick dense woodland an air of fascinating menace. My expedition was certainly altering my state of mind - the relative slowness of rail travel gave me time to absorb and acclimatise myself to my surroundings. I arrived in Warsaw somewhat bleary eyed, six hours later than planned. The station was the kind of brutal concrete communist Lubyanka that awoke suspicion and fear in my middle-class eyes, despite the smiles and friendliness around me. I hailed a taxi and found myself once again in the umbilical cord of western life as we drove through the new developments of Warsaw with their lurid Coca-Cola and McDonalds branding jostling for position with Sony and a Holiday Inn.  I soon arrived in my luxury hotel filled with western businessmen and immediately bumped into a friend who had also come out for the wedding. He&apos;d been in London only five hours earlier having, more sensibly in his eyes, chosen to fly. He laughed at my dishevelled appearance and told me how eccentric I had become.  But standing in the lobby of that hotel I realised that he wasn&apos;t really in Poland. Not really. He was in a building of the kind he saw every day at home. He had travelled through a wormhole that began in a taxi outside his flat that took him to an aeroplane that entertained him with his favourite television shows and delivered him to a taxi, which had brought him to this western hotel. He had no conception of the country he had entered. Neither, perhaps, did I, but at least I had the grace to be aware of that fact. I had, at any rate, seen the land and the people of the countries I had travelled through. I would suggest I was also unknowingly more respectful because of that fact.  The journey home a few days later was far less eventful but no less enjoyable, and when I got back to London I felt like I had actually travelled somewhere for the first time in my life. I felt like a pioneer. I was hooked and I have never flown since.  At the moment I&apos;m reading English Journey by JB Priestley to prepare for a travel book I&apos;m writing with my friend Ian called Three Men In A Float. We&apos;re taking this idea of slow travel one stage further and applying it to our own country this summer by driving across England in a milk float with our friend Prasanth. I discovered that Priestley predicted this phenomenon, the downside of excessive speed for anyone hoping to experience what it actually means to travel, while journeying around Britain in the autumn of 1933. &quot;Our new, rapid, closed-in sort of travel has its sinister aspects,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and here is one of them. When people moved slowly in their travel, there was time to establish proper communications with what was strange, to absorb, to adjust oneself. Now that we are whizzed about the world, there is no time for absorbing and adjusting. Perhaps it is for this reason that the world that the traveller knows is beginning to show less and less variety. By the time we can travel at 400 miles an hour we shall probably move over a dead uniformity, so that the bit of reality we left at one end of the journey is twin to the bit of reality we step into at the other end. Indeed, by that time there will be movement, but strictly speaking, no more travel.&quot; Thankfully, since my trip to Poland I&apos;ve found rail package deals that offer the sense of perspective and adventure of that journey with all the luxuries and certainties you want when holidaying abroad. And the Railteam project will soon prevent fearful midnight conversations with surly guards if you do happen to miss any of your connections. So if we are serious about tackling climate change, then the culture of short-haul travel will have to change and we will have to start turning our backs on the budget airlines. Not only do we now have a genuine alternative, you never know, it could even give you an addiction to a far nobler form of travel. \u00b7 Dan Kieran is deputy editor of The Idler. On the rails the sexy, cinematic way to go And the award for the sexiest train scene from a movie goes to ... ? What? Brief Encounter, where Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard played out an unrequited affair exchanging nothing more than Received Pronunciation variations in the caff at Carnforth station? Or Lemmon and Curtis dragging around the sleeper car with Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot?  No, for me, it has to be Hitchcock&apos;s North by Northwest. Especially the bit where Cary Grant first encounters platinum blonde Eve Saint Marie.  Grant, dressed in a silvery Kilgour French Stanbury suit and Persol sunglasses, looks shifty but splendidly suave as he is shown to her table in the restaurant car of the clattering 20th Century Limited locomotive. Eve Marie Saint is coolly smoking. In every way imaginable. She tells him that she tipped the steward five dollars to seat him here. &quot;Is that a proposition?&quot; asks Roger Thornhill, Grant&apos;s character. Seduction moves at clattering double time when you travel by train and before long, Eve has got Cary back to her sleeping berth and sparks start to fly from the undersides of their respective rolling stock.  Of course, for us Brits, train travel isn&apos;t immediately associated with the libidinous, romantic, luxurious or filmic. Our trains are all about the overcrowded, over-priced misery of suburb-to-city commuting, poor quality food, endless cancellations, the wrong kind of snow and Minding The Gap.  But when train travel isn&apos;t a work thing, when one takes a train bound for a pleasurable destination, alone and off peak, to somewhere slightly more evocative than, say, King&apos;s Cross or Crewe, it can be quite wonderful ... sexy even. Even on Virgin Trains. Some of my most memorable journeys have been by train. I&apos;ll never forget my cosy, quaint overnight train journey on the Caledonian Sleeper from London to Fort William. My wife and I had our first holiday together riding steam trains around Rajasthan, India, and a few years ago, on assignment for this paper, I took an Amtrak from Penn Station to the Adirondacks in upstate New York. In Switzerland, I had an insanely steep train journey up to St Moritz on a train that served wine in glasses with their stems specially bent to accommodate the gradient.  But my favourite train journeys have been taken alone, riding the Bullet Train from Kyoto to Tokyo, the magnificent Chihuahua al Pacifico railway into Mexico&apos;s Copper Canyon, or doing the Inter Rail thing from London to southern Italy as a teenager where I did my best to orchestrate my own kind of Cary/Eve encounter. Quite difficult, I discovered, when you have a non-seated ticket, a rucksack, no money for the dining car and an Echo and The Bunnymen haircut.  It may be slightly circuitous and protracted but at its best, long-haul train travel humanises its passengers. People move around on trains. They go to the buffet car and buy each other drinks. They stick their heads out of windows. (Well, they do on foreign trains anyway.) They can let each other through or choose to engage in a comical, playfully harmless frottage unique to railway travel, as they attempt to pass simultaneously. You tend to meet people doing this kind of stuff. Flirting with a stranger while the train jiggers through the night through the Alps or towards D\u00fcsseldorf (very Kraftwerk, that) is much classier and less sordid than a quick bit of mile-high action on a Ryanair flight.  That said, if you want to be left alone, go to Rio or Russia where they&apos;ve introduced single sex carriages so women can avoid being chatted up. Alternatively, bury your nose in a book. How about Michel Houellebecq&apos;s Platform? It&apos;s about a couple who like having sex in public places ... on trains mainly.

The third symphonies of both Schubert and Bruckner formed the programme of the first concert, French music and Berio&apos;s Folk Songs made up the second. Apart from a couple of ragged moments in the Bruckner, each work was characterised by an expressive virtuosity and devastating exposure of sonority and colour, all of which left the Concertgebouw legend intact. Yet perfection of execution was not always balanced by consistency of interpretative insight, a reminder that Jansons has become variable of late. The Schubert proceeded with such exemplary precision that it forbade any emotional response save that of admiration for its very flawlessness. Debussy&apos;s La Mer similarly kept us at arm&apos;s length. Elsewhere, however, we heard Jansons at his best. Berio&apos;s Songs, blowsily sung by Elina Garanca, had a sinuously earthy astringency. Bruckner&apos;s Third was radically done to the point of intransigence, but the gains outweighed the losses. This was Bruckner brought to earth and stripped of his religiosity. The first two movements seemed sparse and skeletal, though the finale was unforgettable. Its polka - an embarrassment for some conductors - was so toe- tappingly buoyant that you wanted to dance. Best of all was Ravel&apos;s La Valse - an overwhelming experience that more than compensated for the inequalities elsewhere. \u00b7 Broadcast on Radio 3 on February 20 and 22.", "sentences": ["Amsterdam&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra has a reputation, first and foremost, for perfection, and their two London concerts with principal conductor Mariss Jansons will doubtless linger in the memory for the quality of the playing."], "title": "RCO/Jansons Barbican, London", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/13/2", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Mariss Jansons"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-14T00:05:54Z", "article": "Over two decades, the environmentalist and peace activist Richard Watson, who has died aged 41 from the inflammatory disease scarcoidosis, scaled smokestacks, occupied bulk carriers and chained himself to weapons of war, all in defence of a world he sought passionately and peacefully to protect. Born and brought up in Burnley, Lancashire, he left school at 16 and worked as a sheet metal worker, spending time with the Territorial army, which turned him into an accomplished caver and climber. After leaving the TA at 22, he attended a local Greenpeace meeting, and quickly found that his rope skills could be put to good use in keeping with his conscience. He first caused consternation in boardrooms and government press offices in 1992, when he broke into the controlled zone at the Sellafield nuclear facility and hung off the THORP reprocessing plant, unfurling an anti-nuclear banner. Three years later, he climbed the inch-thick lightning conductor of a 200m coal stack outside Amsterdam to publicise concern at the effect of CO2 on the climate. Other protests followed: in 1997, Richard built and maintained a lighthouse on the north Atlantic outpost of Rockall, after Greenpeace had declared it an independent state to frustrate oil exploration; in 2000, he stood in the way of BP&apos;s Northstar drilling equipment in the Arctic. That same year, in one five-week period, he boarded four shipments of illegally logged timber, eluding their crews for days as he clung to masts or cranes and held up banners in defence of the rainforests and their people. In 2001, he hung for days - and freezing nights - from oil platforms in the Cromarty Firth to prevent them from being towed out to sea. Richard became Greenpeace&apos;s full-time warehouse manager in 2001, fashioning gadgets and kit for the organisation&apos;s activists across the world. He was a little like Q in the Bond films, though vastly ruder and more obstreperous. He taught dozens of Greenpeace volunteers how to climb, inspiring love and respect despite the verbal lashings he was capable of unleashing to those who did not clear up after themselves. Richard&apos;s conscience later saw him climb the stack of the waste incinerator at Edmonton, north London, and hang a banner reading &quot;London&apos;s cancer factory&quot; from the top; he was charged with criminal damage, but acquitted. In January 2003, he led the team that scaled the reactor dome of Sizewell-B and painted &quot;Danger&quot; down its length, to highlight the threat of unguarded nuclear power stations. A week later British Energy began cleaning the dome, and for a day it glimmered in the Suffolk sun with the word &quot;Anger&quot; in 10ft-high letters - probably what Richard had wanted to paint in the first place. Charged with criminal damage, he was convicted and fined. The last of more than 30 court cases brought against him was in Southampton. He had led 14 activists through the fence of Marchwood military base, on the eve of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Speaking from the dock, Richard was in typical form, declaring that he knew nothing of international law but knew that bloody war was wrong. The fundamental nature of this quick-tempered and passionate man was perhaps best captured in footage played to the magistrate. It showed Richard climbing into an armoured vehicle at Marchwood and locking the turret, refusing to let it be loaded on to a ship bound for the Gulf. But another image shown at his trial could be said to have captured his character. Richard is seen staring into the camera, an ox of a man with a heart as big as his hands, slipping flowers into the barrels of tanks. He is survived by Rachel, who nursed him through his illness, his parents Ron and Margaret, and his brother, Nigel. \u00b7 Richard Ian Watson, campaigner, born January 16 1965; died January 15 2007", "sentences": ["Three years later, he climbed the inch-thick lightning conductor of a 200m coal stack outside Amsterdam to publicise concern at the effect of CO2 on the climate."], "title": "Obituary: Richard Watson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/feb/14/obituaries.guardianobituaries", "tags": ["Environmental activism", "Environment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-14T07:20:28Z", "article": "Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica is today expected to finally kick off the \u00a31bn-plus sale of its production subsidiary Endemol, maker of Big Brother and Deal or No Deal.

He was himself partly responsible for that, since he was self-effacing and worked for most of his life abroad. He had scant regard for local chauvinisms, preferring international groups in Ireland, Paris, Denmark and Holland - as well as in England. He was born near Perth, in Scotland, of English parents, the grandson of the sculptor Sir Alfred Gilbert. From 1929 to 1932, he studied painting at the Slade School, London, where he befriended Roger Hilton and met the sculptor Jocelyn Chewett, whom he married in 1935. The couple established themselves in Paris in 1939, but the following year, Stephen having been turned down for military service, they left for Ireland, where they spent the war years. It was in Ireland that Stephen painted a series of small canvases of spectral insects with staring eyes and ferocious mouths, and of human hydras. Described by Edouard Jaguer as &quot;la peinture de paroxysme&quot;, these were anguished paintings, usually with a balance of wings or heads, on either side of a central body. They were inspired partly by Masson&apos;s surrealist art and by reading Jung, Nietzsche and Jakob B\u00f6hme. Stephen showed them with the White Stag Group in Dublin in 1944. The Gilberts returned to Paris in 1946; it was a tough environment and they lived extremely frugally. A decisive moment came in 1948 when his paintings at the Salon des Surind\u00e9pendants attracted the attention of the Danish artist Asger Jorn, who invited him to join the recently formed radical group, Cobra. Apart from William Gear, Gilbert was the only British member. He held an important position within Cobra, painting a central wall in the house they decorated with murals at Bregnerod, near Copenhagen, in 1949, and being the subject of a monograph in the series Petite Biblioth\u00e8que de Cobra. He also worked with the Dutch member, Constant Nieuwenhuys, in Amsterdam and Paris. Together, in 1950 and 1951 Gilbert and Constant developed from the febrile imagery of Cobra to an abstract art of loose geometric forms and restricted colours, chiefly black and white. In Holland they studied Mondrian, Malevich and Rietveld, and, in the face of the rising tide of tachisme in Paris, structured their paintings of 1952 to 1953 with clear geometric planes coloured with strong primary colours on white grounds. Wanting his colour planes to occupy real space, Gilbert moved from painting to three-dimensional, orthogonal constructions in 1953 to 1954, precisely made from painted aluminium sheet and angle. His move linked him to the English group of constructivist artists gathered around Victor Pasmore, including Anthony Hill and Kenneth and Mary Martin, and he showed with this group in London in 1954. In Paris, he joined Andr\u00e9 Bloc&apos;s Groupe Espace. Strongly influenced by De Stijl ideas, he aimed to destroy closed volumes and activate open space by means of rhythmic placing of coloured planes on an architectural scale. In 1955 Gilbert moved further towards an architectural realisation of his ideas with a model for a house to be built in Yorkshire by an enlightened developer, Peter Stead. Further projects followed for blocks of flats made of mass-produced coloured metal and glass panels but, in the end, only two houses were built, and without Gilbert&apos;s collaboration. But he continued to develop his constructions, and in 1957 abandoned rectilinear frames and let coloured planes, in reacting curves, stand on their own. By 1960 he had ceased to use colour, relying on curved planes of polished metal, spreading from a central stem, to reflect the light and the environment in which they were placed. He achieved some fame with these works, winning first prize for sculpture at the Tokyo Biennale in 1965. By the end of the decade, he was producing more earth-bound constructions of welded tin or copper. His wife died in 1979 and, perhaps in homage to the forms of some of her carvings, he began a group of tall copper pillars with subtly modulated edges. These were his last major sculptures and by the mid-1980s he had returned to painting. Using India ink, pastel and watercolour he painted a long series of loose abstracts with, at times, hints of imagery of the kind he had invented in Ireland. His last exhibition was organised by the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds early last year. He is survived by a son and a daughter, two grandchildren and one great grandchild. A full retrospective would be a revelation. \u00b7 Stephen Gilbert, artist, born January 15 1910; died January 12 2007", "sentences": ["He also worked with the Dutch member, Constant Nieuwenhuys, in Amsterdam and Paris."], "title": "Obituary: Stephen Gilbert", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/feb/14/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries", "tags": []}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-14T14:20:17Z", "article": "Shareholders in Big Brother producer Endemol today approved the \u00a3300m purchase of Endemol France from its parent company Telefonica.

Steve McClaren&apos;s desire to schedule the occasional get-together for his squad instead of a friendly is to be met in the new television contract, running for four seasons from August 2008, that the Football Association has put out to tender. The current deal allows for a maximum of 20 such games and the limit will be reduced to 18. Since England do not play on every permissible date at present, the likelihood is that McClaren&apos;s players would meet purely for a training camp once a season. The difficulties encountered before last week&apos;s 1-0 defeat by Spain suggest that February would be the ideal time. Of the 28 men named in the initial party for that fixture, eight were unable to take part. Clubs going for the title or preparing for the Champions League must resent the distraction of an international friendly. McClaren does not believe actual matches are always essential for England. &quot;The key thing is more time,&quot; he said yesterday. The FA, with ticket revenues from a near-60,000 last week and a TV audience of 8m watching England, may disagree but are prepared to compromise. Discussion and experimentation on the training ground might be enhanced sometimes if there was no game to be contested. &quot;I want the flexibility to be able to control when we have friendlies and when we have get-togethers and what is the best preparation.&quot; McClaren said. &quot;That has got to be under my control. That is what we are working towards with [the chief executive] Brian Barwick, with the FA regarding the opponents, and when we have them.&quot; The idea of squad get-togethers, floated by McClaren&apos;s assistant, Terry Venables, in a newspaper column at the weekend, can be accommodated. Not including warm-up games before major tournaments, there are 38 international dates over four seasons starting in August 2008 and the FA estimates they will use only 32 of them for qualifiers and friendlies. McClaren does not denigrate friendlies entirely. His first match in charge, against Greece, was an encouraging 4-0 victory. He welcomed a 1-1 draw in Amsterdam as well, after defeat by Croatia. &quot;In Holland,&quot; he said, &quot;we wanted a reaction, so it was important we got our best players.&quot; In future England will aim to take the field when it suits the manager best.", "sentences": ["He welcomed a 1-1 draw in Amsterdam as well, after defeat by Croatia."], "title": "McClaren delight with England plan to play less and practise more", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/15/newsstory.sport5", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Steve McClaren"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-15T16:14:59Z", "article": "As a writer for Kidsweek (a weekly tabloid size newspaper aimed at children aged 10 to 15) I get to speak to a lot of young Dutch people. Having an English girlfriend helps me see Dutch life through different eyes, which is why I found the Unicef report - and the ranking of the Netherlands as the best place to grow up and Britain the worst - so fascinating. In general, I think one can say that there are less rules in the Netherlands. The rules that do exist are applied less strictly. The Dutch feel quite safe in general and are probably driven less into thinking there are terrible dangers lurking around every corner. I think the Dutch in general live relatively healthy lives. My own childhood was riddled with the terrible ordeals that haunt every child and teenager: not getting all the toys you ask for, not enough allowance, not enough confidence and worst of all, being dragged away from a perfectly good show on televison to have dinner with the family, &quot;because that is what families do&quot;. My mother, altough a university graduate, stayed home for 20 years to raise my younger brother and me. This meant we had lunch at home every day and after school she would be waiting with tea and biscuits. A problem indeed, for over tea there would have to be conversation, which could easily stumble on tricky subjects such as unfinished homework, bad school reports and anything else most teenagers don&apos;t feel comfortable sharing with their parents, such as cigarettes, alcohol and drugs. These things would worry my parents, as they would parents anywhere in the world. Yet my parents never really enforced very strict rules about them. For they reasoned that anything that is forbidden becomes immediately a hundred times more interesting in the eyes of most teenagers. Whereas left to experiment relatively freely, sensible young people might simply distill whatever experience they deemed worthwhile repeating and leaving other things out for the future. I did. The lives of a few childhood friends who gut stuck in drugs or any other habit seemed dull to me and I moved on, as did most of my generation. This reasoning on my parents&apos; part might have been met with surprise or even indignation from other parents, where it not for the fact that ever since the 1970s common Dutch views on raising children have been very liberal. Indeed for a long time, enforcing any sort of rule or discipline was looked down upon as old fashioned and most of all downright oppressive. Teachers and parents would insist on being called by their first names and children using bad language or throwing tantrums were said to a have promising, creative nature. I did realise occasionally that my brother and I were privileged, for instance when it turned out there were kids in my class who went on holiday less than twice a year. These would be the same kids that stayed in school at lunchtime, to eat the sandwiches their mother had wrapped for them in the morning. Apparently their mothers had jobs, something most privileged children considered a clear sign of poverty. But in the Netherlands poverty is generally considered to be better than snobbery. I can&apos;t remember one incident where someone was bullied over status. Going to the homes of these kids after school would be interesting. They would be allowed as many bags of crisps as they wanted, but there seemed less joy in eating them with no mother around to suggest board-games or remind one of tennis practice. Without real numbers to back it up, I do think life in the Netherlands is, and has been, relatively healthy and safe. I learned to ride a bicycle at age 4 and then always cycled to school. For a while I attended a high school about 14 miles away from home, which I would get to by train in the winter and on bike in the summer. It would take me about an hour there and an hour back. Even today, this is not uncommon for a lot of teenagers living in the Dutch countryside. On particularly windy summer days I would hitchhike, something my parents advised against, &apos;because you never know what might happen&apos;. That phrase can work two ways of course: one can see either danger or adventure. I saw the latter. Nothing ever did happen. Seeing the Netherlands through the eyes of an English partner has made me realise that a rule in the Netherlands is never as strict as initially intended. Any rule seems to be open for debate. Alcohol and tobacco are sold to under-16&apos;s every day, because it&apos;s a hassle having to ask people for ID in a busy shop. The Amsterdam metro trains are not free for admission, but this fact was met with surprise by a group of 12-year-olds I spoke to last year. They ride the metro every day and never pay. &quot;Where are the ticket-inspectors?&quot; they asked. &quot;Or the gates to stop people without tickets?&quot; There were none until this year. The metro has been going since 1982. And &quot;No smoking&quot; in the Netherlands means &quot;light up if you honestly think you&apos;re not bothering any non-smokers&quot;. Of course terrible things happen in the Netherlands too. Frequently there will be stories in the news of young people who were killed, raped or otherwise hurt. When asked, the 10- to 15-year old readers of Kidsweek don&apos;t seem to apply these stories to their own lives. They worried about terrorism. too, when bombs went off on the London tube, but one week later the main debate on our letters page was about why a return to school uniforms (Dutch school have hardly any clothes restrictions) is a bad idea or about a mistreated horse in a petting zoo. At the risk of sounding gleeful or chauvinist, I hope this puts the Unicef report somewhat in perspective.", "sentences": ["The Amsterdam metro trains are not free for admission, but this fact was met with surprise by a group of 12-year-olds I spoke to last year."], "title": "Let's go Dutch", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/15/whyisitsonicetogrowupi", "tags": ["United Nations", "Children", "Netherlands", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-16T20:30:00Z", "article": "Last week Tory leader David Cameron admitted to smoking pot while in school. Unless I&apos;m missing something, the news was greeted with little more than a yawn by the British public. It certainly didn&apos;t result in a chorus of calls for his resignation. In fact, perhaps nothing indicates how far Britain is these days from the Mary Whitehouse, cucumber sandwiches-and-tea era than the lack of interest shown in this dope revelation. About the same time as Cameron was busy establishing his street creds, Indiana Congressman Mark Souder made a stir in the United States when he went onto one of the cable news channels to declare that smoking marijuana really wasn&apos;t much less harmful than smoking crack. Sixty five percent of emergency room admissions for overdoses, he claimed, were due to marijuana, and, in an echo of the Reefer Madness B-movies from the mid-twentieth century, he went on to say that &quot;thousands&quot; of people died each year as a result of crimes connected to marijuana. Where did these numbers come from? He didn&apos;t say. Yes, the pot that hits the streets today is far, far more powerful than that used by the Hippies back in the day. Yes, it&apos;s probably a lousy idea to drive, or operate heavy machinery or do anything that involves careful hand-eye coordination after ingesting it. Yes, it&apos;s probably a pretty good bet that if you smoke pot often enough you&apos;ll mess with your physical and mental health. But the same would hold true for alcohol, coffee, and most of the prescription medicines out there today. Does that mean any of these pose the same sort of societal risk as does crack? Of course not. Souder&apos;s comments, almost profound in their inanity, would have been little more than risible - except for the fact that the Indianan is the most senior Republican on the House subcommittee in charge of federal drug war policies. Thankfully, for now at least, the Republicans in the House are about as potent as alcohol-free beer. But Souder&apos;s comments, reflecting the Bush Administration&apos;s latest thinking on the issue - the congressman was on TV to defend an administration request for extra funds for its notoriously manipulative, inaccurate anti-pot advertising campaign, the one equating pot smoking with support for terrorism - did show how very out of step the federal government now is on marijuana. From the get-go, America&apos;s War on Drugs has confused hard and soft drugs. When heroin and cocaine use rose to epidemic proportions in the 1970s and 1980s, the feds passed catch-all laws that didn&apos;t just target big-time Class A dealers, but also peddlers of pot. In the early 1980s, when President Reagan pushed the war to the top of his domestic agenda, one front of that fight became the pot fields of northern California. Campaign Against Marijuana Production (CAMP) helicopters buzzed the area, photographing cultivation sites and spraying huge areas with pesticides. Even today, some states still have laws on the books allowing for life imprisonment for some categories of marijuana dealers; in certain circumstances the sentence can be imposed on those merely caught in possession of the drug. The laws are almost never fully implemented, but every so often reporters roaming around inside prisons in Oklahoma, Alabama and a few other locations do stumble upon marijuana lifers. I&apos;ve met a handful of them in Alabama: middle-aged men sentenced to life in prison because they were habitual users. On the whole, though, in recent years states have moved law enforcement resources away from their anti-marijuana campaigns. Throughout most of the western states, and in a handful of other states, medical marijuana is now legal; in many states, low level possession is a ticketable misdemeanor offense, on a par with speeding; cities like Denver have voted to deprioritize marijuana arrests; and this past November 44% of Nevadans voted in favor of an initiative that would have legalized the sale and possession of marijuana - creating a regulated market somewhat similar to that present in Amsterdam, or to the web of pubs that distribute liquor in the UK. When Souder argued pot was as harmful as crack, many critics immediately pointed out that - since so many teenagers smoke pot and know that it doesn&apos;t turn them into frothing-at-the-mouths psychopaths - this was a virtual invitation for teenagers to experiment with really nasty narcotics. After all, if A=B, it doesn&apos;t really matter if you say &quot;A is as harmful as B&quot; or &quot;B is as harmless as A&quot;. At the end of the day, you&apos;re saying they&apos;re both the same. I think, though, that Souder&apos;s ineptitude goes beyond this: it goes to the deeper issue of trust. If Bush&apos;s proxies can spout such utter garbage on drugs, why should we trust them about anything else, on prognostications about terror, about foreign policy, about nuclear proliferation? There are already many reasons to be suspicious of this government. Why would Souder want to make it even easier to give the Bronx cheer to this bunch of fools?", "sentences": ["Throughout most of the western states, and in a handful of other states, medical marijuana is now legal; in many states, low level possession is a ticketable misdemeanor offense, on a par with speeding; cities like Denver have voted to deprioritize marijuana arrests; and this past November 44% of Nevadans voted in favor of an initiative that would have legalized the sale and possession of marijuana - creating a regulated market somewhat similar to that present in Amsterdam, or to the web of pubs that distribute liquor in the UK."], "title": "Pot calls the kettle crack", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/16/potcallsthekettlecrack", "tags": ["David Cameron", "US news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-17T02:10:33Z", "article": "Even in the relative warmth of the Birmingham National Indoor Arena Kenenisa Bekele, the world&apos;s greatest distance runner, was loth to remove his Puffa jacket. Not surprisingly, having just flown in from Ethiopia, he appeared a little stunned, although not half as gob-smacked as the many cross-country and distance runners who have been blitzed by his turn of speed that might make a cheetah regroup and draw breath. It had seemed impossible that any man would begin to unravel the numerous world records set by Haile Gebrselassie but Bekele is doing precisely that while the fact that both men - call them supermen - were born in Ethiopia makes it all the more astonishing. And they could not be more different. Whereas Gebrselassie is outgoing and gregarious, Bekele tends towards introspection and his small close-knit group of friends back in Addis Ababa. As he talks, his large brown eyes appear to roam to a horizon way beyond the confines of the NIA on a wet and particularly unpleasant late winter&apos;s day in Birmingham. Yet this is the life of modern athletics. Shortly before midnight on Thursday Bekele was still at home in Addis Ababa. Now, via Amsterdam, he is here for business, &quot;his job&quot; as he refers to his athletics career. Today&apos;s Norwich Union grand prix will see him tackle the 2km indoor world record held, of course, by Gebrselassie. &quot;My shape is good and I have the possibility to try it,&quot; he says. This is about as near as Bekele would ever come to suggesting he might smash the record to smithereens. He is not an arrogant or boastful man, though it would be foolish to suggest he does not know his own worth. This is currently the sticking point over whether or not he runs in this year&apos;s world cross-country championships in Mombasa next month. Bekele has won the long and short races for the last five years and he believes this extraordinary feat should be recognised financially. He currently feels that other world-class athletes have received greater recognition than him. &quot;He feels special and he feels the need for others to show it. It&apos;s not only about money,&quot; said Holland&apos;s Elly van Langen, the women&apos;s 800m Barcelona Olympic champion, part of his support team. Obviously his country is somewhat more than anxious to see him run in the Kenyans&apos; backyard, for it is the most intense of athletic rivalries. For the moment Bekele is in no mood to be budged. &quot;I&apos;m not planning to run and I&apos;m not ready to run,&quot; he said, his voice rising above its normal gentle tones. He pauses. &quot;Of course, if I change my mind, I can run. It&apos;s not so difficult.&quot; Time will tell. Back in Ethiopia a Lebanese production team are making a film about Bekele&apos;s life, which has so far taken six months and will take another six. It is difficult to imagine the quietly charming runner being thrust before the cameras and declaiming his many startling feats. Apparently he will not. That will be the job of an actor. &quot;Then they will cut in my races,&quot; he reveals with a slightly abashed look. He began running seriously when he was about 15 and now this son of a farmer is recognised everywhere he goes in Africa and beyond. &quot;When I go back to my village, or where I went to school, the kids run after me and call to me. They all know me. I loved running with similar kids when I was that age and playing football. Life was so different then.&quot; If there is a wistful tinge to such memories, it is momentarily forgotten as he talks about his friends in Addis Ababa, the music they enjoy and the good times they have together. Yet the tragic death of his fianc\u00e9e of three years, Alem Techale, is never far from his thoughts. While out training on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, just over two years ago, Alem collapsed and died. She was 17. He still has no special girlfriend. &quot;I am still looking for a friend. It is difficult to find a good person,&quot; he said. The hurt is deep and, obviously, has completely changed the way he looks at life. &quot;It&apos;s all quite different. Everything changed. It was very, very difficult time for me. I was thinking of stopping running altogether. Fame and money meant nothing. But my friends advised me that such feelings were normal. &apos;You have to continue your job and your career,&apos; they said. So I changed my mind. But it can never be the same.&quot; One day, assuming he meets the &quot;good person&quot; he is searching for, the pain will ease. For now the records he blasts and the medals he wins are dedicated to her: &quot;I do it for her.&quot; Given the right pace and the enthusiasm of the crowd another record may fall today. Such has been his enormous success that when he was asked yesterday how many world records he currently held, Bekele was at something of a loss. &quot;Maybe 10?&quot; He allowed himself a laugh, one that changed to a prolonged chuckle some time later when he discussed what other world record he might capture. &quot;Any of the records. Anything.&quot; There has, no doubt, been some frustration felt by Bekele with the constant, and perfectly natural, comparisons with Gebrselassie. The great man was both his mentor and his rival. But those days of thralldom are now over. Bekele is the king. Records and titles in amazing six-year run 2001 World junior cross-country 8,000m champion. 2002 Becomes first runner to win gold at World Cross-country Championships in both the long and short races. 2003 Wins 10,000m at World Championships in Paris.

A jazz saxophonist plays a solo beyond the leather booths of the bar while the DJ&apos;s decks are wheeled towards the back wall to open up more space for clubbers keen to throw a few shapes. Formerly a pedestrian underpass littered with rubbish and dirty needles, today this sealed-in, subterranean club is home to Rotterdam&apos;s beautiful crowd sipping mojitos and grooving to urban soul tunes. It&apos;s also the latest opening among the city&apos;s new breed of eco-clubs recycling old public spaces for cool new nightlife.  Rotterdam is already the Netherlands&apos; premier clubbing city, with 10,000 revellers hitting the dancefloors each weekend to catch house and electronica sets by local DJs such as Speedy J and Michel de Hey. Every summer, around 400,000 attend the Heineken Fast Forward Dance Parade, Rotterdam&apos;s answer to Berlin&apos;s Love Parade. But, more importantly, Rotterdam is the first European city to embrace the idea that clubbing can promote sustainability.  &quot;Rotterdam is a great breeding ground for sustainable projects as it has a young population and a culture of collaboration between different groups,&quot; says Michel Smit, founder of the Rotterdam Electronic Music Festival (remf.nl), held annually in November. &quot;People want to go out but not be lectured about how to live their lives. By making sustainability cool, we can get the message across to a wider audience.&quot;  Across town in Delfshaven is Worm (wormweb.nl), a multi-purpose arts space with a club, cinema, record shop and creative studio. I&apos;m met at the door by Mike van Gaasbeek, a squatter turned eco-visionary with an electric-shock hairstyle and a business card that reads &quot;Chef de ping ping&quot; (Dutch slang for &quot;cash&quot;).  &quot;We opened in November 2005 with a plug-and-play construction to slot into disused buildings using 90% recycled materials and without even knocking in a single nail,&quot; he says. Today, the walls at Worm are made from recycled estate agents&apos; boards, the toilets from oil drums and the door handles from bicycle handlebars. The only non-recycled items are the fire safety doors and emergency exit signs. &quot;This is the piece de resistance,&quot; says van Gaasbeek, ushering me into the cinema. The room is filled with car seats recycled from Volkswagen Passats. &quot;Really comfy,&quot; he winks. What will really put Rotterdam on the map as the green clubbing capital of Europe, however, is a project called the Sustainable Dance Club. From a nondescript office block in a suburb of the city, developer Enviu (enviu.org) is drawing up a masterplan to take eco-clubbing to the world.  The project is the brainchild of Stef van Dongen, who founded Enviu as a community of young professionals to facilitate start-ups based on environmental principles. Working with architects D\u00f6ll (dollab.nl) and Professor Han Brezet of the Delft University of Technology, he unveiled the project at Rotterdam&apos;s Off_Corso nightclub last October. Enviu has allocated \u20ac550,00 (\u00a3370,000) to develop a pilot dancefloor for an existing venue. It then hopes to take the template to major European festivals, such as Roskilde in Denmark and Glastonbury in the UK.  &quot;A nightclub uses 150 times the energy of an average household and produces around 12,000 litres of glass to recycle from bottles and glasses each weekend,&quot; says van Dongen. &quot;I was out clubbing one night when the idea came to me to make a self-sustaining club that is mobile to plug into existing spaces.&quot;  Alijd van Doorn, D\u00f6ll&apos;s social architecture project manager, says: &quot;At the launch we had intelligent LED lighting systems, rainwater-flush toilets, a water purification system to turn urine into drinking water [a system developed specifically for the project], a cafe using recycled food [they use leftovers from the previous night to make vegetarian-friendly burgers and stir fries] and an electricity-generating dancefloor, whereby the more people dance, the more energy they produce.&quot;  There are three pilot dancefloors in development, each using different technology to generate energy. The finished product could work according to pneumatic, mechanical or sensory principles. &quot;This is not recycling, it&apos;s upcycling,&quot; says van Dongen. &quot;It&apos;s about finding ways for consumption to generate positive benefits via the interaction between clubbers and the club itself.&quot;  Back at the Catwalk (catwalkrotterdam.com) opening party, the dancefloor is a mass of designer labels and vodka cocktails. Former record company executive turned club owner Raymond Contein sinks into one of the booths and smiles. &quot;We&apos;ve recycled a dirty space to give people a place to enjoy themselves,&quot; he says. &quot;Now that&apos;s what I call green clubbing.&quot; \u00b7 Jet2.com (jet2.com) flies from Leeds, Manchester, Blackpool and Newcastle to Amsterdam from \u00a349, trains to Rotterdam take 45 minutes; doubles at Stroom Rotterdam (0031 10 2214060, stroomrotterdam.nl) from \u20ac145 per night.

Chatting over their lattes, Tony Magee, and Gerry Smith, two London criminals, negotiated the purchase of a consignment of weapons from Evaldas Cinga, a small-time Lithuanian arms dealer. When police moved in, they found that Cinga had sold 18 Baikal IZH-79s pistols to the pair. Each came with a silencer and 20 rounds of ammunition. Banking records showed that Smith had transferred around \u00a32,500 to Lithuania before his arrest. At Blackfriars crown court yesterday, Cinga, 34, was jailed for seven years and Smith, 47, for 10\u00bd. The sentencing of Magee, 43, was adjourned. Officers from Operation Trident, the Scotland Yard unit set up nine years ago to reduce shootings and murders among black men in particular, seized 909 firearms last year along with 61,867 rounds of ammunition. In one raid on a suburban semi opposite a school in Dartford, Kent, they are alleged to have found hundreds of firearms mounted on every available stretch of wall space. Further seizures were made around London by police who are not members of the 300-strong Trident team, as well as by other police forces. Customs officers, meanwhile, intercepted 762 firearms and 7,407 rounds being smuggled into the UK last year. They often discovered the firearms had been parcelled up with consignments of drugs. Police believe that eastern Europe - particularly the Baltic states - are the source of many of the illegal firearms in the UK. The jailing of Cinga and Smith followed a similar case six months ago, when two British criminals and two Lithuanians were jailed for up to 18 years each for smuggling into the country 30 handguns and 1,220 rounds of ammunition which were intended for sale in Manchester. The misery and mayhem that can be caused by a single batch of illegal weapons was demonstrated by a study of 2,710 handguns known as HS95s which were smuggled out of Croatia in the late 90s. One was used to shoot Derek Dunne, an Irish gangster, in the neck after he opened the door to his Amsterdam home in January 2000. In May the following year another weapon from the same consignment was wielded by the Basque gunman who assassinated Manuel Gim\u00e9nez Abad, a Spanish politician, in Madrid. In December 2003, another handgun surfaced in Leeds, where it was used to shoot PC Ian Broadhurst at point-blank range. Then, in November 2004, a fourth was used to fire seven rounds into Theo Van Gogh, the Dutch film-maker. Other weapons from the same batch have been recovered by police in Germany, Sweden, France and Belgium. Many of the illegal guns in circulation in Britain were not smuggled into the country, however, but manufactured in the UK from replica firearms, starting pistols and air guns. One type of air gun, the self-contained gas cartridge weapon, which can be converted easily to fire live ammunition, was outlawed in 2004. Some firearms experts criticised the government&apos;s failure to offer compensation, however, which they say resulted in thousands of owners failing to surrender their weapons. Many of these, they argue, could fall into the hands of criminals.", "sentences": ["One was used to shoot Derek Dunne, an Irish gangster, in the neck after he opened the door to his Amsterdam home in January 2000."], "title": "Two jailed for smuggling handguns from eastern Europe", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/feb/17/ukguns.news1", "tags": ["UK news", "Gun crime", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-19T11:46:28Z", "article": "From inbox to in-crowd, LeCool.com emails trendy tip-offs to subscribers each week.

(An aside: imagine how much more interesting the Premiership would be should The Big Four leave to play in a permanent European Super League. English league football could be played at 3pm on Saturdays, while TV companies could pay the mega-clubs billions to screen European football all day on Sunday, culminating in NFL-style end-of-season play-offs. Everyone would be happy.) While the evening&apos;s most raucous and fractious atmospheres should be found at Celtic Park and the Bernabeu respectively, and the night&apos;s most riproaring encounter at St Andrew&apos;s, on this here page we&apos;ll be concentrating on one of Europe&apos;s unexpectedly developing rivalries. Little Lille and Manchester United have met four times in the past six seasons, winning one game each and drawing the other two. The scoresheet has consistently resembled a binary programme, with neither side managing more than one goal in any of the matches. When Lille, third in Ligue 1, defeated United at the Stade de France last season, Fergie&apos;s apoplexy reached new levels of purple-facedness, branding Lille and their defensive tactics &quot;pathetic&quot; and refusing to shake his opposite number&apos;s hand. Claude Puel should expect a similar snub tonight if his team achieve the shock result that sets them on their way to denying United a first Champions League knockout victory since they defeated Deportivo half a decade ago. Teams Lille Sylva, Chalme, Plestan, Tavlaridis, Tafforeau, Debuchy, Bodmer, Makoun, Obraniak, Fauvergue, Odemwingie Subs Malicki, Schmitz, Cabaye, Michel Bastos, Audel, Lichtsteiner, Mirallas Man Utd Van der Sar, Neville, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Ronaldo, Carrick, Scholes, Giggs, Rooney, Larsson Subs Kuszczak, Brown, Saha, Park, O&apos;Shea, Fletcher, Silvestre Referee Eric Braamhaar (Holland) Pre-match farce Some severe technical difficulties, which left Adamson and Glendenning running around the office doing their best Laurel and Hardy impression, have finally been taken care of, and we&apos;re ready to go. 1 min The first thing to report is that Rooney has been positioned up front from the kick-off. This is excellent news for both United fans and those who wish to see a good game. Bad news for United fans: David Pleat has just picked them as this season&apos;s Champions League winners. 3 mins It&apos;s out-and-out 4-4-2 for United with Giggs and Ronaldo on the wing, which suggests they&apos;re going to go for broke tonight rather than play their overly cautious European style of the past two seasons (and more). However, it&apos;s also 4-4-2 for Lille, and it&apos;s one of their strikers, Fauvergue, who has the first attempt: a header looped over Van der Sar&apos;s bar. 4 mins Fauvergue also has the first booking to his name for a late challenge on Neville. The pitch, incidentally, is bumpier than a Ryanair flight in an electrical storm. 6 mins Ronaldo&apos;s trickery wins United a corner, but he then makes the sad mistake of playing it short to captain Neville. The right-back&apos;s delivery was more wayward than Steve Harmison&apos;s Ashes opener. 8 mins It&apos;s been a positive start from United, who seem to be playing with much more purpose than they have on their previous seven European trips, in which they failed to score against Copenhagen, Lille, Villarreal, Celtic and Milan. 10 mins &quot;I notice Paul Doyle is offering a prize for the loser, sorry, reader, who sends in the most interesting piece of footballistic (as Wenger would have it) trivia,&quot; observes Stephen Hewitt. &quot;Throw us a bone mate!&quot; Ok, I&apos;ll offer a prize to the reader who can come up with the best reason as to why I should give him or her a prize. 12 mins Ferdinand loss of concentration, mark I: dallying on the ball, Rio was burgled by Debuchy, but his cross was eased out of play by Neville. 13 mins Preposterous Scholes lunge, mark I: just the one foot this time, the ginger wizard took enough of the ball along with Makoun&apos;s leg to escape a booking. If he does see yellow tonight, Scholes will be banned from the second leg. 14 mins Like United, Lille are also playing more openly than expected, typified by Odemwingie&apos;s leggy run past Neville and driven cross to the penalty spot. His target was Fauvergue, but Vidic saw off his run comfortably. 15 mins Evra is booked for a crude challenge on Debuchy. It&apos;s tasty. 17 mins Ronaldo&apos;s first run directly at the Lille defence involves him knocking the ball one side of Tavlaridis and trying to run around the other side. But the former Arsenal defender is a big-boned individual, and not even Ronaldo&apos;s pace was enough to enable him to make that detour in time. 19 mins There is some trouble in the end of the stadium where the United fans are situated. The ITV reporter on the spot says that rather than any act of hooliganism from the fenced-in United fans, there actually seems to be too many of them in the lower tier of the stand. Concerned about overcrowding, they&apos;ve been trying to draw this to the attention of the police, but have been repelled. 21 mins United have their first attack of note. Giggs&apos;s deep cross found Rooney 15 yards out, but he mishit his volley into the ground and Lille were able to clear. 23 mins The United fans are taking things into their own hands and spreading themselves out across the whole stand, which looks to have cleared the problem. Now United need to deal with their on-pitch problem, which is an inability to pose much of an attacking threat on this poor pitch. 24 mins &quot;I should get a prize because, like Evra, I came in late and did not make any contact with the ball,&quot; says Ram Elisha. &quot;If he deserved a card, I guess I deserve a prize.&quot; Ram, you&apos;re like the downhill skier who goes off first and subsequently is in the lead, but can expect to be beaten when the big names come out to race nearer the end of the time-trial. 26 mins Debuchy exacts vengeance on Evra for the United full-back&apos;s earlier foul. Debuchy is also booked, which makes their private duel down that flank one to watch for the rest of the game. Ronaldo has swapped wings with Giggs, but Lille are doubling up on both to limit their impact. 29 mins Vidic is booked for a tug on Odemwingie&apos;s shirt that was less subtle than an MBM reporter&apos;s simile. Looks like there&apos;s going to be more cards in this game than the GU Sport desk received on Valentine&apos;s Day. 31 mins &quot;So Edwin van der Sar is back. Can you tell me how the broken nose is? Is he wearing a Hannibal mask, does he look like Steve Bruce with bigger ears?&quot; asks Rick Buur in Amsterdam. I&apos;m afraid I haven&apos;t notice old big Ed (the second) because the ball has barely been in the United box. Then again, it&apos;s barely been in the Lille box either. 33 mins My earlier excitement for the Champions League knockout stages is withering. I must have forgotten that goals come at a very high premium in these matches. 35 mins Giggs, still on the right flank, scuffs one right-footed cross which is half-cleared, then whips in a far better one with his left foot. Sylva carelessly dropped the ball at Rooney&apos;s feet, but the Dutch ref had already seen a foul that I hadn&apos;t. It&apos;s rather tragic that that&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve written the Lille keeper&apos;s name. 37 mins Rooney attempts a clipped pass through to Larsson that needed to be uber-precise, but wasn&apos;t. Even though they&apos;ve switched to the 4-4-2 United fans have been calling for, the Red Devils are still lacking the freedom that characterises their better Premiership performances. 40 mins Ronaldo wins a free-kick in a dangerous position after flicking the ball past Tafforeau. The kick itself, directed by Giggs onto the head of the first Lille defender, is a microcosm of the first half: a non-starter. 42 mins At last, a good piece of football. Hovering on the touchline, Giggs guided a clever pass into Rooney&apos;s feet in the box. He turned and instantly rolled the ball across the six-yard box where, after an old-fashioned scramble, it fell to Ronaldo. Debuchy did brilliantly to dive across the path of the winger&apos;s shot and prevent a certain goal. 44 mins Bodmer - the man to watch according to GU&apos;s expert on all things French, Paul Doyle - comes closer than anyone to opening the scoring, but his left-foot shot from 20 yards trickles the wrong side of Van der Sar&apos;s left-hand post. Half time United are missing a great chance to send out a message to the rest of Europe here. With so many of the continent&apos;s big guns faltering at present, now would be an ideal time to present a performance full of the flair that has seen United dominate the Premiership this season. Sadly, the overriding impression of the first half is that United would be more than happy with a goalless first leg, suggesting Ferguson hasn&apos;t learnt from previous European campaigns when his team crashed out to Rotor Volgograd, Monaco and Real Madrid after achieving a seemingly solid 0-0 result away from home. The upshot of this, of course, is that the neutral is bored witless. Half-time emails Given how bad this game has been, let&apos;s start with Henry Carter: &quot;What do you mean lack of goals? 3-1 to Madrid and Beckham playing a blinder!&quot; &quot;Ruud has scored,&quot; says Damien Neva. &quot;At least his pony&apos;s one trick still works in Europe.&quot; I was actually at the Bernabeu to see Real draw with Betis on Saturday - I&apos;ve never seen a striker give a more static performance than Van Nistelrooy then. He wouldn&apos;t look out of place in Lens tonight. And now for Oliver Thorpe in Madrid: &quot;Hargreaves may well say that Beckham is his idol, but that hasn&apos;t prevented his idol from taking more swings at his legs than the Diogo vs Fabiano handbags a few weeks ago.&quot; Trust that match to be the only one we&apos;re not covering on GU. &quot;Mike, you are mixing your metaphors,&quot; says Ram rightly, with reference to min 24. &quot;Rather, I am like a big-boned but lead-footed striker released by a long ball that thinks he is clear on goal, but is ultimately overtaken by much younger, faster and better defenders who whisk the ball to safety and leave me standing in the box, dazed and confused like Emile Heskey after an aborted breakaway.&quot; &quot;Everyone knows that the real excitement in any match comes in the second half,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Two-legged European games are like three first halves in a row - wake me up in 14 days and 25 minutes time.&quot; Actually, most of the excitement comes at the end of either half. Given how much fitter footballers are these days - and consequently how much further they can run - perhaps the game should be extended to one-hour halves. That way we&apos;d have 20 minutes of fun at the end of each period, rather than just five. ITV&apos;s half-time analysis Apparently it&apos;s been a decent first half, with United looking very solid and surely pleased with the way they&apos;ve played on a difficult pitch. Why can&apos;t they just admit that a game is rubbish, if indeed it&apos;s rubbish? Fergie&apos;s halt-time analysis &quot;We need to keep it simple.&quot; Effectively, more of the same please. Deary me. 46 mins The pattern of the second half looks set to mirror that of the first, ie Lille sit off, United have the majority of possession but fail to commit enough men forward to make much of it. 49 mins Ronaldo, like the rest of his team, is seeing plenty of the ball, but is proving totally effective because every time he beats a man, it&apos;s on the halfway line or thereabouts. He, Rooney and Giggs need to play in more advanced positions. 51 mins Brilliant from Rooney. Collecting the ball 40 yards from goal he drifted forward serenely as United runners moved in all directions in front of him. After travelling effortlessly behind Makoun, he kippered Plestan and craftily dinked the ball over the keeper to the back post. Giggs, though, was unable to guide it on target as he slid in. 53 mins Suddenly United are carving Lille apart. Rooney fed a pass in behind Tafforeau, who was embarrassingly outpaced by Ronaldo. Sylva, though, stood up for long enough to parry away Ronaldo&apos;s one-on-one shot, and then when Ronaldo played a short pass back to Rooney on the penalty spot, the combination of a bobble and the England forward&apos;s right foot sent the ball flying into the top tier of the stand behind the goal. 55 mins &quot;I&apos;m watching Real and Bayern and all I can say is that David Beckham should be back in the England team and not going to America on this performance,&quot; reckons Stephen Thomas. &quot;Totally outplaying Hargreaves and everyone else on the pitch.&quot; He was also the best player on the pitch on Saturday. And Stephen&apos;s not the only one: &quot;I&apos;m watching Real Madrid v Bayern Munich. Very good,&quot; says Paul Hayes. &quot;There&apos;s a lad called Beckham playing a blinder. Maybe he&apos;s English. McClaren should have a look. Seriously, if Capello can change his mind then so can McClaren.&quot; 57 mins The game I&apos;m supposed to be commentating on and you&apos;re supposed to be emailing about (in theory) has burst into life. Two things to report: a Lille substitution as Fauvergue is replaced by Cabaye (ok, hardly thrilling news, I&apos;ll grant you); then a remarkable save/dreadful miss (delete as appropriate) as Van der Sar kicks away Bodmer&apos;s weak shot from eight yards. Bodmer escaped Vidic and Ferdinand and really should have passed that into the net. 59 mins Lille appeal for a penalty! Turned down! Odemwingie went down off the ball while being marked by Ferdinand, claiming he had been tugged. I think the ref got it right. 61 mins GOAL FOR LILLE! DISALLOWED! Very, very controversial. It was superb link-up play between the left full-back and winger as Cabaye backheeled into Obramiak&apos;s path. His cross was met by a thumping header from Odemwingie, but the lineman&apos;s flag went up for a slight push from the striker on Vidic as they both attacked the ball. It probably was a foul, but it was a brave decision by the officials. Put it this way, if United had such a goal disallowed, Fergie would be fuming. 63 mins Lille&apos;s game has been transformed by the introduction of Cabaye, which has allowed Bodmer to play up top alongside Odemwingie. Scholes and Carrick are being outpassed in midfield. 66 mins Now then, this is interesting. United&apos;s first substitution is to take Ronaldo off the pitch, and put Saha on it. Ronaldo hasn&apos;t played well tonight, but that&apos;s a bold move taking off the best player in Europe this season. 68 mins Saha almost scores with his first touch. Evra&apos;s throw was intelligently dummied by Giggs, taking Tavlaridis away from Saha, but the Frenchman didn&apos;t quite catch his shot and Sylva made an easy save. 69 mins Odemwingie tries to bend a shot around Ferdinand and into the far corner, but doesn&apos;t quite put enough curl on the ball and Van der Sar&apos;s goal is untroubled. 71 mins &quot;I&apos;m trying to follow all tonight&apos;s matches, as well as putting together a business plan, and writing something for GU&apos;s big blog, and whilst we&apos;re all going through nil-nils everywhere, I check out your coverage, and find Naylor there,&quot; says Clare Davies. &quot;Does the man never rest?&quot; And as if to prove a point, here&apos;s Gary Naylor: &quot;I note that the fair Colleen, whom I am led to believe steps out with Mr Rooney, has followed in her fiance&apos;s footsteps and written a book. Are they the Ted Hughes and Syvia Plath of the 21st Century?&quot; Perhaps Davies and Naylor have a better claim. 73 mins Nervousness is pervading the United line-up, so much so that the normally unflappable Van der Sar flaps at Obramiak&apos;s corner. However, his defenders bail him out and United break with pace. After Rooney&apos;s burst down the right flank and Sylva&apos;s misjudgment of his low cross, Larsson dragged the ball away from keeper and defenders but put just too much oomph on his delicate chip to the back post. That would have been a great goal. 75 mins Lille sub: Odemwingie off, Audel on. That&apos;s something of a surprise given how penetrative Odemwingie has been in this second half. I know nothing of Audel, but I imagine Vidic and Ferdinand were pleased to see him enter the fray. 77 mins Scholes again avoids a booking despite a deliberate swipe at Tafforeau. It would be a blow for United to lose Scholes for the second leg - that would mean the appearance of Fletcher or O&apos;Shea. 79 mins Another great chance for Lille: Audel reacted quicker than Ferdinand to Debuchy&apos;s low cross, but his outstretched left leg only deflected the ball over the bar. GOAL! Lille 0 - 1 Man Utd (Giggs 83) A hugely controversial moment. It was a free-kick to United 25 yards out and as Sylva was lining up his wall, Giggs curled the ball into the corner which Sylva had vacated. It was something that Thierry Henry has done many times before, but the Lille players are livid. 85 mins Sylva is booked for protesting because the ref hadn&apos;t blown his whistle before the taking of the free-kick; but the rules state that as long as the free-kick taker says instantly when asked that he wants to take the set-piece immediately, the goal should be awarded. Likewise, had Giggs missed, play would have continued. 86 mins AND NOW THE LILLE PLAYERS ARE LEAVING THE PITCH! Summoned by one of their coaches, the Lille team wander off the pitch. All hell breaks loose, with Neville coming over to remonstrate with his opponents and then being given a mouthful by Ferguson, who tells him to leave them alone. After a couple of minutes, the ref convinces the Lille players to return to the pitch, and missiles start raining down from angry fans as the game restarts. 87 mins Fetching a ball for a throw-in near the corner flag, Neville motions that he&apos;s been struck by something thrown from the crowd. 89 mins Cabaye shoots from distance, the ball loops up off Carrick&apos;s boot and Van der Sar catches underneath his crossbar. 90 mins Lille make a third substitution - Bastos on for Obraniak - but there&apos;s only three minutes for him to alter the scoreline. He tries to do just that with a shot from 30 yards, but his attempt only manages to increase Lille&apos;s ire even further. 90 mins + 3 United sub: Scholes off, O&apos;Shea on. Full time The ref brings to a close a bad-tempered game that would have been utterly forgettable had it not been for the final 10 minutes. However, now there are several talking points to digest: the treatment of United&apos;s fans, Odemwingie&apos;s disallowed goal, Giggs&apos;s allowed goal, and then the Lille team walking off the pitch, seemingly intent on not playing out the last seven minutes. United were certainly lucky to emerge victorious after a disjointed performance, and Lille may have a case over the ref&apos;s first big decision, if not the second. However, that does not justify their behaviour and Ferguson is understandably irate: &quot;It&apos;s a disgrace what happened tonight - that&apos;s not football,&quot; he says. &quot;The Lille staff encouraged them to come off the pitch and they tried to intimidate the referee. I&apos;ve never seen anything like that.&quot; You&apos;ve not heard the last of this, and neither have Lille. There will certainly be repercussions.

If it rules for Bosnia, the International Court of Justice could open the way for compensation amounting to billions of dollars from Serbia, the successor state of Slobodan Milosevic&apos;s Yugoslavia. It also would be a permanent stain on Serbia in the eyes of history. Reflecting the complexities, the 16 judges have taken 10 months to deliberate since hearing the final arguments last May. Officials at the world court, as it is informally known, say just the summary is likely to take three hours for court president Judge Rosalyn Higgins to read. The full decision could be as thick as a book. The court was created after the second world war to adjudicate disputes among UN members. Its decisions are binding, without appeal, and subject to enforcement by the security council if necessary. Seldom before has it had to deal with issues that go to the heart of a nation. Dozens of Bosnian survivors, including women from Srebrenica where some 8,000 men were killed in July 1995, are expected to stand vigil outside the baroque Peace Palace while the decision is being read. The ruling comes 14 years after Bosnia first approached the court during the chaos of Yugoslavia&apos;s bloody disintegration, and 12 years after the end of the 1992-95 war. The political landscape has changed dramatically since then, with both countries separately aspiring to join the European Union. But passions have hardly cooled. &quot;This will be a very significant judgment, both from the perspective of the aftermath of the conflict and for international law generally,&quot; said Andre Nollkaemper, director of the Amsterdam Centre for International Law. Other courts already have ruled that acts of genocide occurred during the war, when more than 100,000 people were killed in a Bosnian Serb campaign that gave the world the phrase &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;. Two Bosnian Serb officers have been convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, set up in The Hague in 1993 - even as the fighting continued - to prosecute suspected war criminals. General Radislav Krstic is serving a 35-year prison term for aiding and abetting genocide, and Colonel Vidoje Blagojevic is appealing his 18-year sentence for complicity in genocide. Milosevic died last year in his prison cell in the final weeks of his four-year-long genocide trial. Two other Bosnian Serbs accused of orchestrating atrocities, Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, remain at large, and critics accuse Serbia of harbouring the latter man. But the world court case is not about individuals. Bosnia says the Serbian state itself must accept blame. It argues that Serbia&apos;s nationalist ideology incited genocidal hatred, while its financial and military aid to the Bosnian Serbs gave them the tools for genocide, and Yugoslav army officers actively participated in actions to drive out Muslims. &quot;It is the accumulation of solitary crimes - the dreadful repetition of evil acts - that emerges finally, clearly, as the super crime of genocide,&quot; Bosnia&apos;s US advocate Thomas Franck told the judges last year. Serbia says it is not that simple. Genocide, by definition, requires the clear intent to wipe out an ethnic or racial group - and Serbia says it never waged such a systematic campaign. &quot;A pattern of &apos;ordinary crimes&apos; cannot be simply transformed into the crime of genocide,&quot; argued Sasa Obradovic, summing up Serbia&apos;s case last May. Rather, it must be &quot;a specific crime, with a specific mental element.&quot; The key is whether the judges are persuaded that the Bosnian Serbs were under the control of the Serb government - an issue that might have been resolved had the Milosevic trial reached its conclusion. It was stopped when he died, and the massive amount of evidence it heard is now legally worthless. The Yugoslav tribunal &quot;has not been successful in establishing a proven link between the paramilitaries who did the killing and the government in Belgrade,&quot; said Johannes Houwink ten Cate, a historian at the Netherlands War Documentation Centre and a professor of genocide studies. By contrast, he said, the Nuremberg trial of Nazi war criminals found a clear chain of command to the Holocaust. The Bosnia-Serbia dispute is not a criminal case, and the standards of proof are lower than required for a criminal conviction. It is enough that a majority of judges find on a &quot;balance of probabilities&quot; that Serbia was responsible. However, before the judges even address Serbian responsibility, they must first rule on whether they have jurisdiction - a tricky question on which the same court has contradicted itself in the past. Serbia argues it was not a UN member when the murders happened, and therefore cannot be judged by the UN court. Yugoslavia&apos;s UN membership was suspended in 1992, and Belgrade was only readmitted as Serbia and Montenegro in 2001. Montenegro split from Serbia last year, and has asked the court to remove its name from the case. In 1996, the court rejected Serbia&apos;s move to dismiss the genocide suit, ruling that it did have jurisdiction. However, three years later, Serbia itself applied to the court to intervene to stop the Nato bombing campaign against it during the war in Kosovo. The court ruled by a majority of one it had no standing because Serbia was not a UN state. &quot;Technically, the court is not bound by its earlier rulings,&quot; asid Mr Nollkaemper. &quot;Whatever the court decides, it will be incompatible with some part of its earlier case law.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;This will be a very significant judgment, both from the perspective of the aftermath of the conflict and for international law generally,&quot; said Andre Nollkaemper, director of the Amsterdam Centre for International Law."], "title": "UN court to rule on Serbian role in genocide", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/23/balkans", "tags": ["World news", "Bosnia-Herzegovina", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-23T14:16:22Z", "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday February 24 2007 A line disappeared from Maya Jaggi&apos;s contribution to the nominations below for the greatest British author. The relevant passage with the restored line should have read: &quot;So Orhan Pamuk is always described as &apos;Turkey&apos;s greatest writer&apos;, but how many [other Turkish writers do we know? Writers sit] very uneasily under national rubrics.&quot; This has been corrected.  Andrew Motion Poet laureate Choosing the greatest living writer is a harmless parlour game, but it might prove more than that if it provokes people into reading whoever gets the call. What makes a great writer? Philosophical depth, quality of writing, range, ability to move between registers, and the power to influence other writers and the age in which we live. Amis is a wonderful writer and incredibly influential. Whatever people feel about his work, they must surely be impressed by its ambition and concentration. But in terms of calling him a &quot;great&quot; writer, let&apos;s look again in 20 years. It would be invidious for me to choose one name, but Harold Pinter, VS Naipaul, Doris Lessing, Michael Longley, John Berger and Tom Stoppard would all be in the frame. AS Byatt  Novelist Greatness lies in either (or both) saying something that nobody has said before, or saying it in a way that no one has said it. You need to be able to do something with the English language that no one else does. A great writer tells you something that appears to you to be new, but then you realise that you always knew it. Great writing should make you rethink the world, not reflect current reality. Amis writes wonderful sentences, but he writes too many wonderful sentences one after another. I met a taxi driver the other day who thought that. Kazuo Ishiguro is more important if you look at that generation, and Lawrence Norfolk has the makings of greatness - for him, a book must be a whole universe. But in truth it is far too early really to be making these pronouncements. In the 60s, I would have confidently said William Golding, Iris Murdoch and Muriel Spark were the major writers, but now I hear it argued that Penelope Fitzgerald was the greatest writer of her generation, and I am coming round to thinking that was true. Yet we didn&apos;t think it at the time. She was very quiet, so we didn&apos;t see how important she was. Natasha Walter Critic It is not ridiculous to talk of Amis as a great writer. Not all his books are great books, but he is a fine writer and ambitious in what he does, and he has always liked to experiment. Some of that experimentation has produced duds, but Money and his latest book, House of Meetings, are real achievements. I don&apos;t know how useful it is to put writers in competition by asking who is Britain&apos;s greatest writer. When people do it, they usually look for a big male writer - someone such as Amis, Salman Rushdie or Ian McEwan. But why not Doris Lessing? Again, not all her books are great books but some, such as The Golden Notebook, are and will always be read. Or Zadie Smith? She is young, but what she has already achieved is extraordinary. Traditionally, women have often been sidelined in the competitive talk about greatness because their canvas has tended to be smaller. They have written more domestic novels and don&apos;t take on the big themes so often. But no roll call of great dead British writers would be complete without Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf and Charlotte Bront\u00eb, for starters. Even now, women tend not to talk themselves up in the way some male writers do. Smith and Sarah Waters, for instance - two superb contemporary writers - always run themselves down in interviews. Men tend to be much more confident about what they achieve. However many bad reviews Rushdie gets, you feel he would never lose the sense of his own greatness. Of course, great writing can communicate moral truths, and that is still true for writers working today. Smith&apos;s On Beauty expresses what I feel are real moral truths about the way we perceive beauty and what kind of love lasts. But writers are not seers. They are not going to get everything morally right because they can make superb fiction. Look at Amis - at his under-researched, flimsy, contentious polemics, which don&apos;t have anything like the power of his imagined universes. Great writers can&apos;t sort everything out for you, but if they can illuminate the world, even a small patch of it, even temporarily, they have done a precious thing. That is what we should hold on to. Al Alvarez  Critic Greatness has to do with range - and with character. You have to feel a writer is talking with some kind of authority about how to live your life. There has to be what Keats called &quot;negative capability&quot;, by which he meant an ability to move into the heads of all his characters so that you don&apos;t feel he is telling it just from one point of view. There has to be a dispassionate understanding of how the world works, and this is very rare. Amis is a classy writer. He is very much a stylist, interested in using the language stylishly and sharply. But does he have this range? I don&apos;t know. Great is a very big word. I don&apos;t know that I would apply it to any living British writers. One of the undoubtedly great writers of the past 50 years is the Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert. He had that kind of range and authority. Perhaps it is something that was more possible to achieve living under repression in the eastern bloc. There has to be some kind of moral force in great writing - a non-egotistical desire to get it right - and an inward quality that shows in the rhythm of the prose. You feel that with JM Coetzee and Philip Roth. John Crace  Book digester Amis was very good in the 80s, but he has been writing the same book ever since. He has got stuck, and has more or less admitted that. When he said that he was going back to university, as a professor at Manchester, to learn from his students, that was the first bit of self-awareness we have seen from him for a while. So I would not plump for Amis, or any of your McEwans or Ishiguros. They are quite patchy. I would be tempted to say John le Carr\u00e9, but he has gone off too. If you could edit out some of the rubbish, I would still put Le Carr\u00e9 up there. JG Ballard has written some good books and fewer shit ones than some other people. And Jonathan Coe has written two of the books I have really loved in the past 20 years - What A Carve Up! and The House of Sleep. Michael Billington  Theatre critic One name comes to mind immediately - Harold Pinter. But playwrights are often overlooked because plays do not have to be literary to be good. Indeed, if they are over-literary, they will often fail. Determining the &quot;greatest living author&quot; must have something to do with age, experience and longevity, and the ability to work in mixed forms with the same precision. Michael Frayn is a name I would lob in. He has produced novels, plays and philosophical essays, and got better with the years. Amis must be there or thereabouts. Julian Barnes writes rich, elegant prose. What about non-fiction? Could the greatest living author be a biographer - someone like Peter Ackroyd or Michael Holroyd? Or the journalist and travel writer Colin Thubron? But in the end I come back to the theatre. Tom Stoppard is hard to gauge, because his plays have such surface dazzle that it doesn&apos;t always translate unless you have a genius actor. But his best work - Arcadia and The Real Thing - will survive. Alan Ayckbourn is underestimated because he writes comedies, but half a dozen of his plays will survive. And then there is Pinter. His 60s plays now come up constantly. There are plays that in the instant look very good, yet do not revive well. But his work unquestionably stands the test of time, and it is not fantastic or absurd to compare him not just with Beckett but with Ibsen and Chekhov. Plays for all time. Philip Hensher Novelist and critic A great writer would be the one who used the English language for the most telling purposes - not just a manipulator of style or a brilliant polemicist, but someone who has something to say and the means of saying it. In my view, there is no one who comes near VS Naipaul. There are a lot of wonderful writers in Britain, but he has reached such a pitch of authority that even if you disagree with what he is saying, you have to acknowledge his intellect and astonishing mastery of style. Colin Dexter  Novelist and creator of Inspector Morse The 20th century was singularly short of great writers. Rudyard Kipling and Thomas Hardy are great writers; Joseph Conrad, too. But it is difficult for me to name any contemporary writers I consider great. Amis is not even in the top 50 of great writers. He writes awfully well, but so do a lot of people. Memorability is the touchstone of greatness for me, and great books are friends. I want to read them and re-read them; I want to take them with me. AE Housman, Hardy and Philip Larkin - three lugubrious old souls - are my greatest friends. Housman especially has meant more to me than anybody else, more even than Homer. The 1950s was rich in poetry with WH Auden, Larkin, Ted Hughes and John Betjeman; Beryl Bainbridge writes beautifully; and this has been a rich period in drama with Harold Pinter and Tom Stoppard. But I am not sure I would call even those two worthy gentlemen G-R-E-A-T. Tim Godfray Chief executive, Booksellers Association I would choose JK Rowling as Britain&apos;s greatest living author. There are not many people who have not heard of her, and she has encouraged so many children to read. Popularity has to be a factor. Somebody who brings books to so many people must surely be a contender. I believe Harry Potter will still be read in 50 years. Nicholas Lezard  Critic Amis is great, whether you like it or not, though he does get up people&apos;s noses. Harold Pinter and Ian McEwan are the main competition. I have no problem with labelling contemporaries great - as critics we should have the confidence to do it. If I had been around at the same time as James Joyce, I would like to believe I would have seen his greatness. Amis isn&apos;t Joyce; his work is not flawless. But his prose has bravado, which is why it produces such intense reactions. JG Ballard Novelist This is one of those questions that makes one suspect we are in the trough of the literary wave. It is not a great time for writing in the English language. The last literary classic was Catch-22 by Joseph Heller, and that was published in the early 60s. That is the only novel in English that I can imagine surviving until the middle of this century. It is mysterious why that is. We have lived through some incredibly stirring times, but where are the great writers? When I came to Britain in 1946, George Orwell was about to publish 1984, and Graham Greene, Aldous Huxley and Evelyn Waugh were all producing important work. We have talented writers such as Amis and Will Self, but I don&apos;t see anyone of the stature of these postwar writers. We no longer live in a literary culture and have not for some while. The American novel is a huge self-indulgent bore, playwrights are flattered and self-indulged, and most of the poets have never produced a memorable line. The last book to influence the English-speaking world in a serious way was 1984. No book since then has changed the world. Literary culture was based on certain notions about social reality. But we are not interested in that any more - everything is up for grabs. The most important thing now is a celebrity chav called Jade Goody. Maya Jaggi  Critic I have a problem with the idea that there is one &quot;greatest living British author&quot;. It&apos;s a pompous as well as a contentious idea. I love the work of James Kelman, but he is only one of my great writers, offering one perspective among many. Also, when we say &quot;greatest writer&quot;, we tend to mean from that country. It is a useful tagline, a tease. So Orhan Pamuk is always described as &quot;Turkey&apos;s greatest writer&quot;, but how many other Turkish writers do we know? Writers sit very uneasily under national rubrics. They don&apos;t like it and why should they? They&apos;re not trying to represent a country. Joel Rickett Editor of the Bookseller Greatness is difficult to quantify. We have just interviewed Jeffrey Archer, and he compares himself to Jane Austen. Amis has been inconsistent in recent years, but do you take people who have just produced a stunning novel or look at the totality of their careers? My top five would be Ian McEwan, David Mitchell, Kazuo Ishiguro, Seamus Heaney [discounted because, though born in Northern Ireland, he insists his &quot;passport&apos;s green&quot;] and Philip Pullman. But later generations might find other writers from our age - people who were uncomfortable on the media stage, never popped up on the Today programme, didn&apos;t want to become public figures. In our loud, frenetic, media-driven culture, we sometimes confuse noisiness with greatness. Amanda Ross Creator of the Richard &amp; Judy book club, known as &apos;the most powerful woman in publishing&apos; I can&apos;t say whether Amis is a great writer because I have never read one of his books. I don&apos;t think his publisher has ever submitted one. The name on the cover doesn&apos;t matter much to us. Just because a writer has written one good novel does not mean that every book is going to be gold. We treat every book on its merits, and that is how we come up with surprises. A lot of the pleasure I get from doing this job comes from first-time novelists. We don&apos;t like to label anything &quot;literary&quot;. In fact, I really hate that word. For our readers, if we said a book was literary, it might put them off. To the public, literary means inaccessible, or full of classical references, or with long passages in French. So we just say they are fantastic books. I like to think that most of the books we choose on the show are great pieces of writing. Julian Barnes and William Boyd are the most famous writers we have featured, and one I really admire is David Mitchell. He&apos;s such a strong self-critic that I don&apos;t think he could write a bad novel. Ian McMillan Poet and presenter of Radio 3&apos;s The Verb What constitutes a great writer is longevity. Being a writer is not like being a rugby player. You have to keep at it - perhaps for up to 50 years. It is not enough to write one great novel or a fantastic poem. It is the body of work over time that counts. Great writers have a capacity to be startling, and to continually reinvent themselves. I&apos;ve just been reading John Cheever, a great writer who showed no diminution over a long career. A measure of greatness is will we still be talking about him in 30 years? With greatness, you have to take the long view. WH Auden has been dead for 30 years, and here we are celebrating his life and work. Of living writers, I consider [the Scottish poet] Edwin Morgan a great writer. And there are many other younger poets who are writing well - Don Paterson, Sean O&apos;Brien, Simon Armitage. I don&apos;t accept that the culture is becoming less literary. It is changing. Lyrics are starting to mean more in music; and rap, performance poetry and street poetry are all becoming more influential. The spoken tradition is as important as the written culture. I am attracted to the idea of a broad church in literature - one that can include Goldie Lookin Chain as well as Auden. Hazel Broadfoot Bookseller Amis is very gender specific. He would not get many women&apos;s votes as greatest British writer. Some biographers must be contenders - Jenny Uglow and Claire Tomalin, for instance - and I have never seen a bad review for the historian Antony Beevor. But can&apos;t we stake a claim for Vikram Seth? He lives here, after all. A Suitable Boy has to be one of the best novels written in English in the 20th century, and his range is extraordinary - poetry, biography, memoir. He would be my choice. Louise Doughty Novelist and critic The title of &quot;Britain&apos;s greatest living author&quot; is a deeply silly moniker to give to anyone, and probably the kiss of death. Amis was lionised in the 80s, but that made it inevitable that people would turn on him - remember all that absurd stuff about his teeth. Getting the crown should strike fear into the heart of any author. I prefer to think about great books rather than great writers. Great authors can sometimes write awful novels. Ian McEwan has written some great books - Enduring Love, The Child in Time, Atonement - but Amsterdam, the novel he won the Booker for, was pants. The need to identify &quot;great writers&quot; is a boy thing. For years people said the only great novelists we had were McEwan, Julian Barnes, Amis and Salman Rushdie, but what about Helen Dunmore and Hilary Mantel? When people say they like women writers, there is no attempt to anoint them. In the end it is not for us to identify the great writers. We don&apos;t have any sense of perspective. Kafka published virtually nothing in his lifetime, while Pearl S Buck won the Nobel prize for literature. It&apos;s a great mistake for any author to get obsessed with whether they are a great writer. Just concentrate on the writing. Sometimes when I get emails from writers, I have a sense they think they are writing them with posterity looking over their shoulder, when the sad reality for most of us is that we are destined to sink into obscurity. What do you think?  Who is the greatest living British writer?

Our billing system didn&apos;t work properly. Our prices were uncompetitive. One million customers deserted us. Let&apos;s call it another successful year and put shareholders&apos; dividends up 6%. Sam Laidlaw, the newish chief executive of Centrica, parent of British Gas, didn&apos;t quite summarise 2006 this way, but you get the gist. The company is pleased to have escaped with limited damage from a period in which critical ratios moved in the wrong direction. The price of gas was high and Centrica&apos;s upstream operations didn&apos;t produce enough of the stuff. The generating division couldn&apos;t escape the fact that other people&apos;s coal-fired stations could produce electricity more cheaply. The &quot;strategy&quot; was to pass as much pain as possible on to residential energy customers and hope for the best. It worked up to a point. It was embarrassing that British Gas&apos;s share of the market fell below 50% for the first time since privatisation, but a subsequent plunge in wholesale gas prices means the company can now promise to be vaguely competitive on price. That accounts for the optimism in the City, where Centrica&apos;s shares were the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 yesterday. We shall see. There is a feeling around that two years of viciously high energy bills may finally prompt a portion of the apathetic majority to look for a cheaper supplier. In other words, the promised price war among energy providers may be worthy of the name this time. If so, it is alarming to hear Laidlaw confess that the efficacy and robustness of British Gas&apos;s new billing system is &quot;still in the proving stage&quot;. That does not sound like an enthusiastic vote of confidence. By contrast, the City appears to be pricing the shares as if a perfect year is already in the can. Centrica&apos;s recent history suggests life rarely runs so smoothly. Household clear-out Can it really be less than four years since Sir John Bond was reassuring us that Household International, a company that had just shelled out hundreds of millions of dollars to settle allegations of predatory lending, was a suitable purchase for an upstanding, conservative bank such as HSBC? Yes, it is, and the funniest thing is that Bond argued that one of the great benefits of the \u00a39bn deal was the quality of the management that Household would bring. Now those same managers are departing HSBC by the back door, shuffled out only a fortnight after the bank&apos;s first profits warning. Bobby Mehta, head of the bank&apos;s North American operations, is the most senior HSBC executive in living memory to suffer such a fate. Sandy Derickson was one of the most senior women on HSBC&apos;s payroll. It is encouraging that HSBC appears to appreciate the scale of its cock-up at Household, even if it has yet to provide a coherent explanation of how it walked into an elephant trap that seemed obvious to everybody else. The mistake was to pour billions into low-quality mortgages and loans that went sour as soon as the US property market stalled. It was an error HSBC would have been expected to move heaven and earth to avoid given the scepticism over the original purchase. Logic says HSBC is sufficiently broad and robust to weather the squall and that the only reasonable perspective to adopt for a bank this size is a long-term one. In half a decade or so, won&apos;t an upset on the trailer parks of America be ancient history? Won&apos;t we be talking about how HSBC&apos;s roots in Hong Kong and Shanghai put it in a prime slot in the booming market of China? Almost certainly, and a dividend yield approaching 5% is a decent incentive for long-term investors to keep the faith. Yet the feeling remains that confidence in HSBC&apos;s management would be shredded in an instant if any other bad news emerges. This is a critical moment. Tops tips Anthony Bolton, Britain&apos;s answer to Warren Buffett, is paid to be contrarian and he rarely disappoints.

A few drinks soon unleash the malice and envy that lie behind the visit. Just between the two of us, asks the younger man, why do you keep the modern world at arm&apos;s length? Why do you pay so much attention to the dead masters? And why are you so obsessed with technique? Don&apos;t be offended, but sometimes I find you much too hermetic. And your rhyme patterns: they are so obvious, so childish. What is your philosophy, your basic idea, in a nutshell? The older man&apos;s mind roams back to his childhood, to the dead masters Byron, Ezra Pound, Stevie Smith. &quot;Stepping stones,&quot; he says. &quot;Pardon?&quot; says the puzzled interviewer. &quot;Stepping stones for the poem to tread on.&quot; He leads the young man to the door, helps him on with his coat. From the doorstep he points up at the moon. Uncomprehending, the young man stares at the pointing finger. In this wry look at himself through the eyes of a dismissive younger generation, Claus manages to summarise the more obvious features of his poetry. He does indeed keep his distance from the modern world (though in a more nuanced way than his rival cares to recognise); he is indeed highly conscious of how his own work relates to literary tradition, national and European; he is indeed a master of verse form, to a point where he can make difficult feats seem childishly easy; he is indeed sometimes hermetic - in fact, sometimes writes within a hermetic tradition; and readers looking for a neat message, some Clausian &quot;philosophy&quot; that will sum up his life&apos;s work, are likely to come away empty-handed. Now in his 70s, Claus has a hugely productive artistic career behind him, during which he has been showered with honours and awards, not only in his native Belgium and in the Netherlands, but more widely in western Europe. His dramatic oeuvre - original plays, translations and adaptations - has made him a major theatrical presence. He has conducted notable forays into cinema and into art and art criticism. But the creations by which he will ultimately be remembered are, first, The Sorrow of Belgium (1983), one of the great novels of postwar Europe, and second, a corpus of poetry that, in his collected Poems 1948-2004, runs to some 1,400 pages. Hugo Claus was born in 1929 in Bruges, in Flanders, the son of a printer with a passion for the theatre. Several of his schoolteachers during the occupation were right-wing nationalists; he himself was drawn into the fascist Flemish youth movement. After the liberation, his father was briefly interned for his wartime political activities. This background is drawn on in The Sorrow of Belgium Claus received a sound Gymnasium-type education with an emphasis on classical and modern languages, but did not proceed to university. He began his career in the arts as a book illustrator, then, at the age of 18, published a first book of verse, and a year later a first novel. Among his early literary idols were Antonin Artaud and the French surrealists; he soon became active in the Cobra (Copenhagen- Brussels-Amsterdam) art movement. During the 1950s, Claus lived in France and Italy, as well as his native Belgium. In 1959, he was invited on a tour of the United States by the Ford Foundation, along with a group of up-and-coming European writers including Fernando Arrabal, G\u00fcnter Grass and Italo Calvino. &quot;A verse from Luke won&apos;t help you here,&quot; he recorded, faced with the impersonal hugeness of Chicago. Talented in a range of artistic spheres and hugely energetic, Claus continued to write poetry and fiction and to paint while at the same time developing his skills as a playwright, screenplay writer, theatre and cinema director, and art critic. With the publication of his Poems 1948-1963 he signalled the close of the first phase of his poetic career, a phase of which &quot;The Sign of the Hamster&quot; (1963), a rambling retrospective look at his life on the lines of Fran\u00e7ois Villon&apos;s &quot;Great Testament&quot;, emerges as the high point. Along with Remco Campert, Gerrit Kouwenaar, Simon Vinkenoog and Lucebert, he had by now established himself in the front rank of the new generation of Dutch-language poets, a generation that made its mark in the early 1950s by espousing an anti-traditional, anti-rational, anti-aesthetic, experimental art receptive to New World influences, but by the 1960s had split apart, its members going their various individual ways. The revolutionary tumult of 1968 did not leave Claus untouched. He paid a visit - obligatory at the time, for left-inclined European intellectuals - to the socialist utopia of Cuba, and praised its achievements, though more guardedly than some of his fellows. Back in Belgium, a law court found one of his theatrical productions injurious to public morals and sentenced him to four months in prison (after a public outcry the sentence was suspended). An ill-starred love affair engendered a book of poems, Morning, you (1971), notable as much for its sexual explicitness as for its emotional intensity. For years thereafter, Claus&apos;s private life would be subject to the prying of the tabloid press. While Claus has not been a political poet in any narrow sense, the poems of his first phase certainly reflect the apocalyptic mood and alienation from mainstream politics of the European intelligentsia during the darkest years of the cold war, a war whose reality - given that Brussels was the headquarters of Nato - was hard for any Belgian to ignore. In this respect Claus is close to his German contemporary, the poet Hans Magnus Enzensberger. But Claus&apos;s vision remains uniquely Netherlandic. The spirit that broods over his trampled motherland is that of Hieronymus Bosch: he harks back to the same late-medieval folk imagination, with its bestiaries and gnomic sayings, upon which Bosch drew for his vision of a world gone mad. In the poetry of Claus&apos;s later phase it is the exploration of relations between the sexes, at both a personal and a symbolic level, that comes to the fore. The spirit of this work is anything but autumnal: like WB Yeats, Claus rages against the decay of the physical self while desire remains untamed. In these explorations Claus calls upon the resources of myth, Indian as well as Greek. His theatrical work of the same period concentrates on adaptations of Greek and Roman tragedy. It would not be going too far to say that the late Clausian universe is dominated by a struggle between male and female principles (this in spite of the poet&apos;s own warning that he has no &quot;philosophy&quot; to peddle). Hugo Claus is not a great lyricist, and though his style is crisp and pointed he cannot be called a great satirist or epigrammatist either. From the beginning, however, his poetry has been marked by an uncommon mix of intelligence and passion, given expression in a medium over which he has such light-fingered control that art becomes invisible. Many of the shorter pieces in his oeuvre are merely fugitive or occasional. Nevertheless, scattered throughout in some abundance are poems whose verbal concentration, intensity of feeling and intellectual range bring their author into the first rank of European poets of the late 20th century.  \u00b7 Inner Workings: Essays 2000-2005 by JM Coetzee is published by Harvill Secker on 1 March, price \u00a317.99", "sentences": ["Among his early literary idols were Antonin Artaud and the French surrealists; he soon became active in the Cobra (Copenhagen- Brussels-Amsterdam) art movement."], "title": "Stepping stones", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/24/poetry.jmcoetzee", "tags": ["Books", "Poetry", "Culture", "JM Coetzee"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-02-24T23:55:38Z", "article": "Phil Nichol Bristol In 2005, Canadian comic Phil Nichol went to Amsterdam for a few days to do some thinking.

Irish comedy has been booming during the last decade, but you&apos;d never know it from reading the London-based papers. Dara O&apos;Briain and Patrick Kielty were both stars in Ireland long before British TV discovered them, and the next Irish wag to make a breakthrough in Britain could very well be Jason Byrne. It&apos;s more than 10 years since he reached the final of Edinburgh&apos;s So You Think You&apos;re Funny? and he&apos;s been filling theatres in his native Dublin for years. Older Irish comedians tend to be more low key and literary, but, as Ardal O&apos;Hanlon says, Byrne is a product of the new Ireland - closer to Britain and Europe, and saturated in British TV. Byrne grew up on Tommy Cooper, Dick Emery, Kenny Everett and Spike Milligan, and there&apos;s a bit of all of them in his hyperactive act. \u00b7 LIT Millennium Theatre, Limerick, Sat 24; The Stables, Mullingar, Sun 25; Menier Chocolate Factory, SE1, Tue 27 to Mar 3 Lenny Henry On tour More than 30 years since he won New Faces (at the age of just 16), Lenny Henry is still an enigma.

No other entertainer has done more for racial equality and integration, yet he served his showbiz apprenticeship with the Black &amp; White Minstrel Show.

You need more to recover properly,&apos; she says. The American Michael Johnson and Britain&apos;s Colin Jackson, who won a treasure chest of gold in their running days, made the criticism, Jackson also stating that it would take a miracle for a Briton to win an athletics title at the 2012 Olympics. Meadows would love to throw that gibe back at Jackson, even if in five years&apos; time she will probably, at 31, be past her prime. Her prime, she thinks, will come somewhere between next year&apos;s Olympics in Beijing and the London Games. During this time the Wigan athlete says she is desperate to win medals at major championships and would like to start with one at next weekend&apos;s European indoor championships in the National Indoor Arena, Birmingham. She made clear eight days ago at the Norwich Union grand prix in Birmingham that this was a legitimate ambition by becoming only the third Brit, after the 2004 Olympic hero Kelly Holmes and Jo Fenn, to go under two minutes indoors for the 800metres. She clocked 1min 59.88sec. &apos;No I wasn&apos;t surprised by the time,&apos; she says. &apos;I knew it was there from my training in 2006. But it didn&apos;t feel like I was doing sub-two-minute pace. I had something to spare. So that&apos;s good for the future.&apos; Meadows, who will be 26 in April, says her father spotted her athletic potential when she was only two. &apos;He said then that I would be sporting. He watched me running rings round children twice my age when we played in the street.&apos; What makes her a little special still is that her strengths are equally divided between speed and endurance. Most runners do not enjoy this balance. At the 2001 European under-23 championships in Amsterdam she remembers noting that her personal bests would have qualified her for every final from 100 to 800 metres. &apos;I&apos;m lucky, really,&apos; she says. &apos;I can run it every way: from the front, or tactically and surge, or come with a sprint finish. I&apos;m prepared for whatever&apos;s required.&apos; She decided to concentrate on the 800m after a knee injury, which recurred during training for the 400, kept her out of competition for most of 2004. The following year, she won Kelly Holmes&apos;s farewell 800m race in Sheffield. Before that race, she asked her coach, Trevor Painter, who is now also her husband, whether she should let Holmes win if they were neck-and-neck down the straight. &apos;Course not,&apos; said Painter. Fortunately the situation did not arise with Holmes, tailing off towards retirement, never in contention. Meadows has the third-fastest 800m time of the starters in next weekend&apos;s heats, which gives her a realistic chance of winning her first individual medal at a major championships. Looking further ahead, she reckons a time close to 1:55 is within her compass. Holmes never ran under 1:56.

It is the set of Channel 4&apos;s new series of on-air trails, or idents, promoting its musical output. &quot;One of the biggest challenges is to have the ident there but not to intrude too much as it is a music promo,&quot; says director Kjetil Njoten. &quot;We want to bring them together and get the artists on board for that.&quot; The artists being filmed are among the most exciting up-and-coming bands in the UK: the Horrors; Unkle Jam; Jack Penate; Bat for Lashes; the Noisettes; and Patrick Wolf, whose regalia looks like Vivienne Westwood&apos;s take on Hitler youth chic. &quot;They all have their own distinctive style, and occupy such different areas of the musical landscape that it would have been great to give each their own set,&quot; says Njoten. &quot;It is impossible to do that, so we have to make it feel uniquely them, through their character and through their music.&quot; C4 reckons that at least 12 promos will be extracted from the single day&apos;s filming. They will be broadcast in March to promote its New Music Month, which will include the NME awards. The previous week C4&apos;s in-house creative services team filmed established female singers such as Sophie Ellis Bextor and Corinne Bailey Rae. The channel has already broadcast promos featuring U2 and the Killers. Channel 4&apos;s head of digital marketing, Cameron Saunders, says: &quot;We wanted to find entertaining, visually interesting ways of presenting a band, its music, our logo and branding, while building an association between the two parties.&quot; This has as much to do with audience response to music on television as it does with the value of retaining the 4 ident. Despite its strong musical heritage, from The Tube onwards, C4 is better known these days for Big Brother, Channel 4 News and hit US imports such as Desperate Housewives and Ugly Betty. Programming geared to young people rarely matches the ratings of the latter two despite the broadcaster&apos;s reputation as a strong youth brand; viewing figures plummeted on youth shows such as The Word and TFI Friday when bands performed, only to pick up again once the music had finished. C4&apos;s new trails are a way of publicising the brand at the same time as providing free marketing for the artist or band. &quot;That&apos;s the beauty of the promos: that they can be flexible enough to say &apos;go to music on the website&apos; or &apos;we&apos;ve got all this stuff on bands coming&apos;,&quot; says Jo Dillon, executive producer of the trails. &quot;Or we can use them more specifically to say &apos;we have an exclusive video on tonight&apos;.

With the arrival of the internet, the whole idea of putting listings on, you know, paper seems so 20th century. Over the past year electronic in-trays have bulged with three weekly e-zines: Flavorpill, which is based in New York; Kultureflash, from London; and, as of this week, the London edition of Le Cool - &quot;a clever guide to the city&apos;s most worthwhile bars, restaurants, shopping and other leisure experiences, without being necessarily trendy&quot; - which is owned by a Swede and edited by Mat Osman, former bass player with 90s Britpoppers Suede. &quot;I started writing when the band split up and the only rule I had was that I didn&apos;t want to write about music,&quot; Osman says. &quot;Le Cool is like a friendly letter about good things that are going on or unusual places to go, written by new writers and London enthusiasts. Some of our team have written for Dazed &amp; Confused but some of them were bloggers whose writing style I liked. We&apos;re looking out for places that don&apos;t have PRs as much as something interesting going on at Harrods.&quot; The first issue, for instance, features Osman&apos;s favourite soup bar; an Austrian restaurant called Tiroler Hut where staff dressed in lederhosen perform bell-ringing shows on Saturday nights; an exhibition in the Museum of Brands which is essentially a collection of every piece of packaging possessed by one man in his entire life; and a pancake race at hip Hoxton bar the Old Truman Brewery. &quot;I like the idea of going to watch graphic designers try to run,&quot; Osman says wryly. The magazine arrives fully flatplanned, rather than simply as a text mail, and owner Ren\u00e9 L\u00f6nngren has already launched versions in Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Istanbul, Milan and Rome, with a combined circulation of around 100,000. &quot;London is a very competitive market,&quot; admits Osman. &quot;As well as Time Out and the other e-zines, you&apos;ve got every national newspaper publishing listings supplements. But most of them cover the same patch, with everything being pretty art and culture-led.

The director, Fons Rademakers, who has died aged 86, was also the first Dutch director - aside from the documentary makers Joris Ivens and Bert Haanstra (obituary, October 29 1997) - to become internationally recognised. Rademakers&apos; first feature, Village by the River (1958), had been nominated for an Oscar almost 30 years previously, so it could be said that he paved the way for other Dutch directors, such as Paul Verhoeven and Marleen Gorris. In his Oscar acceptance speech, Rademakers tried to persuade US audiences to overcome their fear of subtitles and be more curious about life in other countries. The Assault, however, dealt with a subject not unknown to them. It told of how a 12-year-old Dutch boy saw his family and 40 hostages killed by the Nazis in January 1945. Many years later, he encounters three people from that period who reopen his mental scars. This fascinating examination of the changing political background of Europe worked not only on the public and personal level, but as an exciting thriller. Its episodic structure, rather heavy symbolism and many coincidences, did not hinder the illumination of moral questions or its ability to move. Rademakers, who studied at the Amsterdam Academy of Dramatic Arts and began his career as an actor, was drafted into the Dutch army in the second world war, and was captured by the Germans but released because &quot;they considered that actors were not threatening.&quot; In 1943 he fled to Switzerland, where he spent the rest of the war. Returning to Amsterdam, he joined a theatre company, before deciding, at the age of 35, that he wanted to direct films. He therefore became second assistant director to Jean Renoir, Vittorio De Sica and Charles Crichton before embarking on Village by the River. This focused on an eccentric doctor who settles in a village on the banks of the Meuse early in the 20th century. He dedicates himself to caring for the poor and puncturing the pomposity of the local authorities, of whom he eventually falls foul. Based on an Antoon Coolen novel, it combined a sense of documentary truth with a characteristic intensity of emotion. Most of Rademakers&apos; films were adapted from novels but, as he claimed, &quot;Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re didn&apos;t create their subjects either.&quot; An exception was his second film, That Joyous Eve (1960), for which he wrote the original script with his wife, Lili Rademakers, who was assistant director on all his films before becoming a director in her own right. Set in the late 1950s, That Joyous Eve, which won the Silver Bear at Berlin, dealt with three families on the celebration of St Nicholas&apos; Eve, a traditional Dutch holiday on December 5. Rademakers followed this with The Knife (1960), which tells a story in flashback entirely from the point of view of a 13-year-old boy (a startlingly uncompromising performance), who discovers his mother in a degrading sexual relationship with his tutor. This plodding but powerful psychological drama, influenced in part by Ingmar Bergman, a friend of the director, was nominated for the Golden Palm at Cannes. Rademakers&apos; fourth film, Like Three Drops of Water (1963), also nominated for a Golden Palm, was not released until nearly 40 years after it was made. The problem was that Alfred Heineken (he of the beer) agreed to produce the film on the condition that his girlfriend, Nan Los, starred in it. When she dumped him after filming was completed, Heineken withdrew all copies of the movie, which remained unseen until his death in 2002. The tale of a timid photographer who meets his doppelg\u00e4nger, a heroic British agent who parachutes into his backyard during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, and becomes involved in the resistance, had not worn well, being more interesting in the premise than in the execution. Rademakers&apos; rather theatrical style put him at odds with many of the younger directors influenced by the French New Wave, and he made only three films in the following 10 years, including Because of the Cats (1973), which was notorious for its gang rape scene. During this period, however, he returned to acting, notably in Harry Kumel&apos;s bizarre Daughters of Darkness (1972), about a young couple caught up with lesbian vampires. Rademakers plays the young man&apos;s mother, beautifully underplaying the character&apos;s campness. Max Havelaar (1976) marked Rademakers&apos; return to form as a director. His most expensive and expansive film, it dealt with a civil servant whose attempts to reform a corrupt local system in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) are thwarted by his government and mercantile interests. Adapted from an 1859 novel by Multatuli (Edouard Doewes Dekker), which attacked Dutch colonial rule, the film takes a less astringent approach than the book, but the contrast between the scenes of Amsterdam and Java are effective and the recreation of the era compelling. After winning his Oscar, Rademakers produced his wife&apos;s film, Diary of a Mad Old Man (1987), and directed his last movie, The Rose Garden (1989), a gripping, English-language production starring Liv Ullmann, Maximilian Schell and Peter Fonda, about the effects of the Holocaust. Rademakers, who is survived by his wife and two sons, died of emphysema after doctors turned off life support machines at the film-maker&apos;s request. \u00b7 Alphonse Marie &apos;Fons&apos; Rademakers, film director and actor, born September 5 1920; died February 22 2007", "sentences": ["Rademakers, who studied at the Amsterdam Academy of Dramatic Arts and began his career as an actor, was drafted into the Dutch army in the second world war, and was captured by the Germans but released because &quot;they considered that actors were not threatening.&quot; In 1943 he fled to Switzerland, where he spent the rest of the war.", "Returning to Amsterdam, he joined a theatre company, before deciding, at the age of 35, that he wanted to direct films.", "Adapted from an 1859 novel by Multatuli (Edouard Doewes Dekker), which attacked Dutch colonial rule, the film takes a less astringent approach than the book, but the contrast between the scenes of Amsterdam and Java are effective and the recreation of the era compelling."], "title": "Obituary: Fons Rademakers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/feb/28/guardianobituaries.obituaries2", "tags": ["Film"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-02T14:54:48Z", "article": "Come on, it&apos;s a Friday afternoon.

Circumcised as little girls in Somalia, and abandoned by their father, a rebel leader, they were raised as refugees in Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Kenya. Isolated and desperate, their mother would beat them mercilessly. Subjected to harsh Islamic teachings, they were also beaten by their ma&apos;alim - once so badly that Ayaan nearly died. The sisters grew up against a background of tyranny, war, exile, famine and religious dogma. This story, told by Ayaan in her memoir, Infidel, might seem to allow plenty of room for the view that trauma lay behind the mental illness that would eventually consume Haweya. In 1994, after destroying her honour by having an abortion, she joined Ayaan as an asylum-seeker in Holland. There she had another abortion. In 1996, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with a severe psychotic disorder. She had been smashing her head against walls, screaming, &quot;Allaahu Akbar! Allaahu Akbar!&quot; Yet, for Ayaan, the idea that her sister became schizophrenic due to religion or upbringing is simplistic. For a start, it is the same type of interpretation that is often used to undermine her own arguments against female oppression in Islam. If Haweya went mad because of hardship, Ayaan&apos;s uncompromising views can be explained the same way. Her enemies deride her as a self-hating Islamophobe, incensed by her Muslim upbringing, sexually frustrated by circumcision, and haunted by the death of Theo van Gogh - the director who was murdered in Amsterdam in 2004, after making Ayaan&apos;s anti-Qur&apos;anic film, Submission: Part 1. But to use trauma to diminish her critique of Islam is, she says, &quot;just a means of not listening to what I have to say&quot;. Furthermore, Ayaan points out that while she and Haweya might have had a hard life by European standards, by African standards &quot;it was not so bad&quot;. As much as anything, what she remembers is laughter and sisterhood. She and Haweya were deeply bonded. They confided in each other, made trouble together, protected one another. At home, Haweya would rage against their mother and Ayaan would intervene, taking on the mantle of maternal care, washing Haweya gently when their mother wanted to scrub her &quot;like you&apos;d scrub the floor&quot;. Out in the dangerous streets of Nairobi or Mogadishu, meanwhile, Haweya was the fearless one, standing up for her more delicate older sister. Ayaan still thinks of her as &quot;my guardian angel&quot;. Why, then, did Haweya lose her mind? Ayaan provides the same answer you would get from any honest psychiatrist: &quot;It&apos;s mostly guesswork.&quot; For sure, the events of their lives contained &quot;stressors&quot;. Perhaps Haweya&apos;s flight to Holland, which removed the privations of clan life, also removed a psychological safety net. Rates of psychosis increase among migrants and, statistically, African populations are among the most vulnerable. But this doesn&apos;t explain why one sister should become a politician and the other a psychotic. Perhaps there was a fault-line of vulnerability in Haweya&apos;s childhood defiance that would eventually shatter her mind. This kind of guesswork only heightens the difficulty of the question. How, after all, do such predispositions of character emerge in the first place? Behavioural geneticists, who study the biological basis of character, would begin where Ayaan begins, with the story of how her nomadic grandmother drummed into the sisters the lesson of who they were: &quot;I am Ayaan ... I am Haweya,&quot; they were taught to recite, &quot;the daughter of Hirsi, the son of Magan, the son of Isse ...&quot; They learned to list their forefathers going back 800 years, to the dawn of the Darod clan. Yet Haweya&apos;s madness seems to have come not from their father&apos;s side of the family but from their mother&apos;s - with three maternal cousins suffering from similar psychotic illnesses. And therein lies an enigma: in the Somali clan system, matrilineal inheritance is deemed worthless, and nobody recalls the names or characteristics of women. As her grandmother warned the girls, a woman alone is disposable, like a piece of sheep fat in the sun. Ayaan believes she has inherited the strength of the women in her family, only putting it to a different use. Where her mother and grandmother enforced Islamic traditions, she has fought against them. Yet - who knows? - perhaps she also has something of her father&apos;s clan character: born to lead. Haweya inherited other things. During an electrical storm in Nairobi in 1998, she ran out into the night in a psychotic fit, miscarried and died. For five years afterwards, Ayaan lost the ability to laugh. The irrepressible giggling of her childhood would never return. &quot;Something has gone for good,&quot; she says. &quot;Part of me went with Haweya.&quot;", "sentences": ["Her enemies deride her as a self-hating Islamophobe, incensed by her Muslim upbringing, sexually frustrated by circumcision, and haunted by the death of Theo van Gogh - the director who was murdered in Amsterdam in 2004, after making Ayaan&apos;s anti-Qur&apos;anic film, Submission: Part 1."], "title": "Alexander Linklater: A tale of two sisters", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/03/healthandwellbeing.features1", "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Ayaan Hirsi Ali"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-04T00:13:08Z", "article": "Edinburgh is rich. While a recent report suggested it has the dirtiest streets in Scotland, that just makes it filthy rich. The cobbled roads are beaded with Aston Martins, Mercedes and Maseratis. There are boutiques selling clothes that would have shocked city matrons just 15 years ago. The Scottish capital has been described as a city of the mind, a place where our urge towards beauty is played out on a volcanic landscape of crags and ravines. First, there was the fortress, then, in 1124, King David I laid out a towering city for the mercantile classes and, later yet, when Provost Drummond looked north, came the astonishing New Town. Recently, I was talking to a friend who had just returned from Berlin. &apos;The architecture is so impressive,&apos; he said. &apos;Because of the war, they have great functionalist buildings everywhere - it looks like a Kraftwerk cover.&apos; Last week, I was sitting next to an eastern European artist visiting Edinburgh for work. She was talking about Amsterdam, tracts of which have been given over to architects creating a new city. Both cities are booming, their wealth being used to make great statements. Now, in Edinburgh, Scots face the redevelopment of the St James Centre, the &apos;monstrosity&apos; at the east end of the city centre. This is just the latest in a series of city overhauls. The last 15 years have seen the rebuilding of the financial district in the west end, the flatlands out by the airport and long stretches of the Leith shore. All of these changes have been squandered opportunities to leave a lasting mark. This, in its way, is also true of other Scottish cities. Yet, ultimately, while Glasgow has great architecture too, while Aberdeen is distinctive, and Dundee could use being completely reimagined, Edinburgh is our masterpiece, the Unesco world heritage site. It is one of the great world cities, a positive expression of who we are. To walk into a tight close of the Old Town, or among elegant terraces of the New is a reminder of those generations before us who reached beyond the drudgery of day-to-day living to create great works of art and nature. It is a reminder of what we should be attempting to achieve. Yet in the financial district and down on the Leith shore, the banal architecture does none of this. It seeks profit through the use of materials that will soon degrade. Imagination is turned to cost-cutting. Any yearning is directed towards meeting the minimum regulations. &apos;It&apos;s looking for a good photograph, an easy let, and forget what it looks like in five years&apos; time,&apos; said a leading architect. Of course, the St James Centre was a great leap of the imagination, if a disastrous one. It sits on its heights as an ugly hulk, hodden and sullen grey. The pictures of the Georgian square it replaced are sometimes reprinted in the local Evening News as a warning against the mistakes of the past. People call the building on St James Square unforgivable for the damage it did, and perhaps this is true. It is self-defeating, though, to keep criticising the architects&apos; imagination. The modernism the building represented was certainly ambitious and grew out of a postwar sensibility that admired the austere. It didn&apos;t work. We don&apos;t like it and we have lived with it long enough to - in the case of this building at least - pull it down. The ambitions of the modernists should be preserved elsewhere, mainly in the remarkable architecture of the Glasgow firm Gillespie, Kidd and Coia. So it&apos;s a bit rough on the residents of Cumbernauld, with their famously brutal town centre, but life is never fair. There have been other sporadic attempts at greatness, most recently when Donald Dewar was alive. The Scottish Parliament grasps for greatness. It may not reach it and yet the building itself graces Scotland now. As in almost all design, the greatest and most enduring feats are the most practical. It is why a Boeing 747 is a beautiful thing, or the Forth Rail Bridge. The New Town was built as an escape from the stinking slums of the Old Town and, with its grand streets, it is the perfect, practical response to the times. This is why it is so sad when architects design in redundancy to their buildings. Swap the architect with a novelist. Few set out to write a book that will be out of print in 10 years, although that is how it often turns out. No, the good ones reach for greatness. Architects working in such a city as Edinburgh should do the same. I have watched these new neighbourhoods go up with a certain sorrow, because I know they are not the great leaps of the imagination the city needs. Each, I believe, is a lost chance. My grand - some might say grandiose - ambitions are matched by practical benefits. Cutting-edge companies would gravitate towards a city filled with imagination, as every young corporation wants to be close to the contemporary. There is all this money in the city. The arts are thriving. If there was ever an opportunity to say: &apos;This is who we are and this is what we represent&apos;, it lies before us now. If we grasped for it, future generations would walk through the city and feel our ghosts walk among those who founded Edinburgh and those who ignited the enlightenment. ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com", "sentences": ["She was talking about Amsterdam, tracts of which have been given over to architects creating a new city."], "title": "Ruaridh Nicoll: It's time to leave our mark on a great city", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/04/comment.art", "tags": ["Art", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-04T02:19:11Z", "article": "The Amnesiacby Sam Taylor  Faber \u00a312.99, pp392 Sam Taylor&apos;s first novel, The Republic of Trees, was a haunting tale of innocence defiled, let down by a muddled ending.

But if the queues snaking down Marylebone High Road in London were not convincing enough, then the enduring appeal of the waxwork dummy was evident yesterday. The Tussauds Group was bought for more than \u00a31bn by Merlin Entertainment, the owner of Legoland, Sea Life and the London Dungeon. The merger of Merlin and the Tussauds Group, creates a business with 50 locations attracting 30 million visitors a year, making it the nearest rival in the world to Walt Disney. Tussauds also owns the London Eye, as well as the theme parks Alton Towers, Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures. The combined business overtakes Universal Studios, which draws 24 million people a year to its movie-themed resorts. The 11 Disney parks remain the clear leader, pulling in 100 million visitors a year. &quot;We still have a little way to go yet,&quot; said Nick Varney, Merlin chief executive. Merlin aims to open five new attractions a year, and is moving in on Disney&apos;s backyard in the US. On one side is a huge American corporation, with Hollywood film studios, massive financial firepower, a television network and one of the richest libraries of characters in popular culture. On the other, waxworks and brightly coloured plastic bricks. There is already a Legoland in California, north of San Diego, with a second soon to open in Missouri. There are five Madame Tussauds overseas, in New York, Las Vegas, Shanghai, Amsterdam and Hong Kong, with new locations planned for Washington DC and Hollywood. Although Tussauds and Legoland are the flagship brands, the company sees potential in Sea Life (22 locations attract 4 million visitors) and in the London Dungeon (there are sister attractions in Edinburgh, York, Hamburg and Amsterdam). It hopes to build more hotels linked to its sites, taking a leaf from Disney&apos;s book. &quot;I don&apos;t see us as being in competition with Disney,&quot; Mr Varney said. &quot;We are not about $2bn theme parks on the scale of Disney in Orlando. We are pursuing a very different model with very different brands. Ultimately though, Legoland and Madame Tussauds can stand shoulder-to-shoulder alongside Disney and Universal.&quot; Peter Phillipson, Tussauds&apos; chief executive and chairman-to-be of the enlarged group, calls his waxworks &quot;portraits&quot;. The company has tried to capture the interest in celebrity culture with models of Kylie Minogue and David Beckham. &quot;Consumers love celebrity and famous people,&quot; he said. In 2002, Tussauds decided not to feature a dummy of Iain Duncan Smith, the first time the leader of the opposition had not been represented in Tussauds&apos; history. Customer research found that few had heard of him and even fewer wanted to see a wax likeness. Repeat visits The company has also introduced more temporary exhibits themed around events like the World Cup to encourage repeat visits and has introduced more interactive elements. The consolidation of the leisure industry across Europe has been driven by private equity firms, trading companies like playing cards in a high stakes game. They are looking to build bigger businesses that can be sold on or floated at a profit. Two years ago Tussauds Group was bought by Dubai International Capital, an investment arm of the government of Dubai, for \u00a3800m. It is selling the business for \u00a31bn and a 20% stake in the combined company, making itself a tidy profit. The American private equity firm Blackstone, which bought Merlin two years ago from another private equity owner, will retain control of the group. It expects to float the business on the stock exchange in three to four years time, Mr Varney said. Tussauds goes back to 1770, when Philippe Curtis opened a waxwork museum in Paris. After he died, Marie Tussaud, His housekeeper&apos;s daughter, inherited the collection and brought it to Britain in 1802. The museum has been in its current building in London since 1884. Lego opened its first park in 1968 in Denmark and its second in Windsor in 1996. The Danish toymaker sold its theme park business to Blackstone in 2005 and it was injected into Merlin, which is run from offices in Poole, Dorset. John Lord, an expert in the leisure industry at the University of Wales, saw a number of factors behind the growth in leisure attractions. &quot;We perhaps go out more as a family than we did in the past and we are more mobile. That means resorts can be developed on out-of-town sites without needing to worry about being close to town or to bus stops and train stations. Increased leisure time and wealth are also playing their part.

So far as Rafael Ben\u00edtez is concerned that defeat that will serve his players well if they can repeat the overall performance tonight. With a 2-1 lead from Camp Nou, the side is well placed to knock out the Champions League holders Barcelona this evening. The manager&apos;s message to his men was given a wider airing yesterday. &quot;We played better than them,&quot; Ben\u00edtez remarked. &quot;I said to the players that if you can play against United, who are top of the table, and you can control them then that is really positive. When you play against Barcelona you can do the same. Why not?&quot; This was no loose comparison. Liverpool were steely against United and the manager&apos;s emphasis was on avoiding mistakes. &quot;We need to have more concentration this time,&quot; he said. The discipline of the line-up is always to the fore in Ben\u00edtez&apos;s mind. Today&apos;s encounter is a curious one. A 2-0 win would put Frank Rijkaard&apos;s men through to the quarter-finals, but even if Liverpool were to go ahead, two goals for the visitors would still take the tie into extra-time. Much as Ben\u00edtez valued the victory two weeks ago, making maximum use of it is a thought-provoking topic. &quot;It is really difficult when you play against a top side like Barcelona when you come here for the second leg with this advantage,&quot; he claimed, even if few pity him. &quot;How can you manage the situation? Our aim is to win the game. We are not talking about a draw or losing 1-0.&quot; The best insight into his likely approach surely came when he spoke about ways of recording victories. &quot;Some people think that to win the game you always have to [go for] them,&quot; he reflected. &quot;Sometimes it is best to wait.&quot; He is right to counsel patience. Barcelona hint that their situation is so bad that this return match verges on being a write-off. Ben\u00edtez scoffs, knowing that Deco, Lilian Thuram and Samuel Eto&apos;o have all enjoyed recent rests precisely in the hope that they will give peak performances at Anfield. The records show that a home defeat in the knock-out phase of the Champions League has not been reversed since 1996, when Ajax lost to Panathinaikos 1-0 in Amsterdam before rallying to beat the Greeks 3-0 in the return leg and get to the final. &quot;The statistics are not important when you play against good players,&quot; an uninterested Ben\u00edtez said of that. His emphasis is on the battle of wits. He was reflecting that Racing Santander&apos;s 6ft 7in Serb Nikola Zigic may be the only striker in Spain who is reminiscent of Liverpool&apos;s own tall striker. &quot;Peter Crouch is a big problem for them,&quot; he said of La Liga clubs. &quot;They don&apos;t normally play against that kind of player.&quot; Crouch did cause havoc when Liverpool won an away match with Real Betis in 2005, but Ben\u00edtez may have been bluffing when he highlighted the attacker. He might as easily prefer to hit on the break through Craig Bellamy and Dirk Kuyt. &quot;They don&apos;t know because I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said when asked if his men had worked out the line-up. The manager does not care to inform until an hour before kick-off, but in a match of this magnitude his mind was surely made up long ago. Carles Puyol last night admitted Barcelona would have to muster a &quot;perfect&quot; performance if they are to overcome their first-leg deficit. The Catalans&apos; captain and defensive inspiration conceded that patience would be required if the hosts&apos; advantage is to be eroded. &quot;It&apos;ll be a tough game against an excellent side who are strong in defence and on the counter,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ll have to play an almost perfect game to get a result, but that&apos;s what we&apos;re going to try and do. We&apos;ve got to play our own style and concentrate. We can&apos;t go all-out gung-ho in attack, but countering their style would constitute a perfect game for us.&quot;", "sentences": ["The records show that a home defeat in the knock-out phase of the Champions League has not been reversed since 1996, when Ajax lost to Panathinaikos 1-0 in Amsterdam before rallying to beat the Greeks 3-0 in the return leg and get to the final."], "title": "Ben\u00edtez demands reaction to home heartache", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/06/championsleague1", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-06T10:53:26Z", "article": "Adidas has launched a global TV ad campaign featuring stars including David Beckham, former New Zealand rugby union star Jonah Lomu and Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. The Beckham ad, which features the footballer talking about how he braved death threats after being sent off in the 1998 World Cup, launches tonight during the half-time break in the Liverpool v Barcelona Champions League match on ITV1. In the Beckham ad the footballer talks of &quot;never feeling safe for three and a half years&quot; because of death threats after being sent off in the 1998 World Cup quarter final against Argentina. The moment of redemption, says Beckham, is when he scored an injury time goal against Greece to put England into the 2002 World Cup finals. Beckham is the lynchpin of the new Adidas campaign with other stars - each of whom tell inspirational stories of overcoming adversity - used tactically in support. In another Adidas ad, former New Zealand All Black Jonah Lomu - the star of the 1995 rugby world cup in South Africa and the tournament&apos;s all-time leading try scorer - talks of the prospect of spending the rest of his life in a wheelchair following the discovery of a rare and serious kidney disorder. The global campaign, created by ad agency 180 Amsterdam, includes 21 TV commercials, one longer-format film, 15 documentaries and behind-the-scenes clips, as well as a print and outdoor campaign. Adidas&apos;s spend on the campaign has been estimated at as much as \u00a350m globally. Last month, Adidas said it was likely to increase the amount of exposure it gave the Beckham ads in the US following the announcement that he was moving to play for LA Galaxy. &quot;The athletes were incredibly open and honest and ultimately had a direct conversation with the audience,&quot; said Sean Thompson and Dean Maryon, creative directors at 180 Amsterdam. Adidas has a long history of using Beckham in ads, including the commercial that saw England rugby hero Jonny Wilkinson and the footballer take kicking tips from each other. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

For starters, there are good, secure bike parking racks all over the city centre, and the council has started putting in the odd cycle lane here and there. The problem with the latter is that they tend to be shared with Manchester&apos;s very many buses. It is often said that the main route from the south of Manchester into town, from Fallowfield along Wilmslow Road and Oxford Road, is the busiest bus lane in Europe. Though the council has put in cycle lanes, you&apos;d have to be mad to use them, particularly during rush hour. Instead, consider one of the parallel roads: either Lloyd Street or Yew Tree Road in the east, which cuts through Moss Side (fine during the day, less inviting after dark). You could also use Whitworth Lane in the west, which segues into a short traffic-free path at the Old Hall Lane junction and passes some rather nice allotments before you reach Birchfields Park. There is, unfortunately, no secret to tackling the city centre&apos;s tangle of one-way streets. If you want a sneaky (legal) way of getting from Deansgate to Piccadilly, cycle courier Matt Tansey suggests turning right up one of the sidestreets (eg Brazennose Street) to Albert Square, then going along Princess Street and Fountain Street. Don&apos;t be fazed by the one-way sign: it applies only to cars. There&apos;s a little lane for cyclists that goes against the flow and towards the Northern Quarter. Want to go from Hulme to Piccadilly station avoiding the city centre? Local cycling campaigner Costel Harnasz says: &quot;Go down Cambridge Street with the university buildings on your right. Turn right up Hulme Street, which becomes Charles Street as you cross Oxford Road past the BBC. Cross Princess Street, turn left at Sackville Street and turn right immediately after the porter&apos;s lodge. Then go up Altrincham Street, where the road becomes pedestrianised. Go left at Echo Street then along cobbled Pump Street on to Whitworth Street, where Piccadilly station rises splendidly.&quot; The Fallowfield Loop is an almost eight-mile off-road stretch running along an old railway line from Chorlton in the west to grittier Gorton and Fairfield in the east and takes in three of Manchester&apos;s hidden parks, including the wildflower-filled Highfield Country Park. The route is run down in places, but is smoothly surfaced and is convenient for Fairfield, Gorton, Ryder Brow and Reddish North stations. Most local train services allow bikes, but check with GMPTE on 0161-228 7811 or at gmpte.gov.uk. You can&apos;t take normal bikes on trams, but folding models are fine. A good stretch of the Ashton canal running past the new Manchester City ground at Sports-city and almost to the back of Piccadilly station has been converted into part of the Manchester Cycle Way (route 60, which links to the Fallowfield Loop). Work to improve the Rochdale canal route continues and the Bridgewater canal may be made cycleable in the next few years too. Crossing the nightmarish Mancunian Way flyover is almost pleasant if you use the bike-friendly footbridge at the north end of Hulme Park or the cycle crossing at Newcastle Street. A few words about security: if you want to get your bike nicked, park it near the universities. Finally, for those who need refuelling, cycle couriers love Shlurp, an early-opening deli serving porridge behind the Hidden Gem church on East Brazennose Street. There are heaters outside so you can mind your bike as you breakfast. \u00b7 Additional research by Rumeana Jahangir.

It travels en masse by car on a road system built for that purpose. As a cyclist in the second city you are very much in a minority. Birmingham does not have a cycle-route network covering the entire city, but knits together on- and off-road routes using canal towpaths. Getting started 1 Get the free Cycling and Walking Map, available from libraries or online at birmingham.gov.uk. Published in March 2006, it offers a network of designated and advised routes for commuters seeking to avoid busy arterial roads. 2 Invest in a bike worthy of Birmingham&apos;s varied urban terrain - you&apos;ll need a superlight frame and near puncture- resistant tyres. 3 If you find Motor City intimidating, build your confidence with cycle training: contact pro-bike lobbyists Pushbikes (pushbikes.org.uk). 4 Get to know your fellow commuters. There are well-established weekend clubs that offer the chance to meet and exchange hints and tips. One regular meeting point is Del Villagio, in the Bullring shopping centre, on Saturdays at 9am. &quot;There is a great camaraderie among commuters cycling in Birmingham because we&apos;re in such a minority,&quot; says student army nurse Kate Williams. 5 Know your specialist city-centre bike shops: On Yer Bike (0121-627 1590) and Birmingham City Cycles (0121-666 6045) both provide information for would-be commuters and offer a same-day repair service so you can be back in the saddle for the ride home. Designated cycle paths 1 Rea Valley cycle route: fantastic for travelling in from the south of the city. The journey time is 20 minutes shorter than by car, according to commuters. The route starts at Rea Street in Digbeth and follows the course of Rea river all the way to its source in the Waseley Hills. It passes Birmingham city centre landmarks such as the International Convention Centre, Centenary Square and the National Indoor Arena. 2 Ward End route: this on-road route starts at Fazeley Street, near Millennium Point, and goes to Ward End and Castle Vale. The route also passes through Ward End Park. 3 North Birmingham cycle/walk route: this mainly off-road route starts in Sutton Park and goes to Brookvale Park (near Gravelly Hill). Hotspots to avoid - and how Birmingham is encircled by three ring roads. Although much of the inner ring road, Queensway, is being &quot;tamed&quot;, many cyclists say using it is suicidal. Other dangerous routes include Five Ways roundabout in Edgbaston, and the main radial roads that lead into the city centre: Hagley Road, Soho Road, Coventry Road and Bristol Road, which all cross the central ring roads. Belgrave Middleway crossing via Longmore Road into Gooch Street Toucan crossings and a buses-only gateway give a safe cycle crossing point over a busy dual carriageway. Lancaster Circus/Queensway Cycle lanes feed under this busy island to allow safe access from Aston University and the central shopping area. Arthur Road, Bordesley A signed cycle path into Kingston Road allows riders to avoid the massive and busy Bordesley Circus island and provides easy crossing of the Coventry Road radial. Ways Island, Edgbaston At the junction of Broad Street and Hagley Road, signed cycle paths pass under a traffic island, on to Hagley Road, Ladywood Middleway and to the AMC cinema and the new entertainment complex. Swan Island, Yardley Cycle paths lead off Yardley and Church roads to give safe cycle passage over this very busy dual carriageway junction. Canals for commuting Clear towpaths include the Birmingham to Worcester canal; the Birmingham and Warwick canal; the Birmingham to Wolverhampton canal; the Grand Union from Digbeth to Yardley, which is good in patches and atrocious in others; and the Birmingham to Fazeley canal. The city centre The city&apos;s pedestrianised precincts surrounding New Street station and Centenary Square are mostly bike-friendly. However, access is restricted around the Bullring shopping centre, so watch out for signs. Security There are increasing number of Sheffield stands to lock up bikes in the city centre. Cyclists say current crime hotspots include New Street station, nicknamed Ground Zero, and college car parks.

Or something like that. Photograph: Tristram Kenton Suspend your disbelief. Many regard this principle as the cornerstone of theatre, as if the whole representational enterprise depends on turning off, in addition to your mobile phone, some otherwise essential part of your brain before taking your seat. One of the staples of the suspend-your-disbelief brigade is the idea that, in order to believe in a character, you have to forget about the actor playing it: the actor must &quot;become&quot; the character. Having long suspected the inanity of this, I had the opportunity to confirm it on seeing Glen Berger&apos;s intriguing if sometimes clumsy take on the Wandering Jew myth, Underneath the Lintel, starring former director of communications to President Jed Bartlett Toby Ziegler. OK, so the actor is actually Richard Schiff. But the man I saw coming on to the stage of the Duchess theatre, clutching a cumbersome suitcase and nursing an awkward manner, was Toby Ziegler, looking rather worse for wear after his implausible, ugly ejection from the White House. When he opened his mouth, though, the (very creditable) Dutch accent soon reminded me that this was no hot shot from the West Wing, but a semi-autistic librarian from Hoofddorp, Amsterdam, about to report on his attempts to track down the borrower of a Baedeker, returned 113 years too late. And as it dawned that this man was engaged in a pursuit as eternal and hopeless as that of his mythical quarry, a number of things struck me, the foremost of which was: what would Toby Ziegler make of this?  I pictured him back in his Washington office, breathing heavily through his moustache at the playwright and saying, &quot;What do you want me do with this crap?&quot;, a slight wavering perceptible in the otherwise monotone, even delivery of his continuing condemnation. &quot;I don&apos;t know how you&apos;d expect me to sell this stuff. No one&apos;s buying limitless confusion right now, and I sure as hell don&apos;t see any candy on the counter. There&apos;s nothing about this that doesn&apos;t stink.&quot; Unrelenting, but a brief touch on the writer&apos;s arm on the return of the script would let him know that his efforts should continue. The picture of Ziegler helped me considerably in appreciating the play. If he believed in it, it must be worth pursuing, worth believing in too. Talking to Schiff later that evening, I decided against calling him Toby, but did ask him how he found the play. &quot;The play&apos;s not perfect&quot;, he said, more kindly in manner than Toby, &quot;which is hard because the actor has to carry the play. With a really great script, the play carries the actors, but with this you have to be continually at your best, supplying all the energy, keeping it going.&quot; He thought the evening&apos;s performance had been ok, not as bad as on press night, but he hadn&apos;t felt strong enough to carry this flawed, ungainly but searching and sometimes searingly insightful enquiry, which he hadn&apos;t been able to put down when he first read it while still playing Toby, and which saw him moving from a big-league TV series to a one-man show in a town in New Jersey, where it got rave reviews, and here, now, in London, where it didn&apos;t. I told him that I had liked the way his West Wing character rubbed off on the hopeless Dutch librarian, that this had added to the play. He didn&apos;t wince. I told him that the suspension of disbelief is a fallacy, as stupid as the idea of looking at a figurative painting without attending to the marks on the surface, the traces of effort and intention that leave their impression deep in the image; that when you&apos;re in the theatre, you pull every resonant feature into the experience and try to make it stick. Schiff smiled and said he saw my point. I can&apos;t see Toby Ziegler having been so forbearing. &quot;There&apos;s nothing about this that doesn&apos;t stink&quot;. But Toby Ziegler was the reason I went to see the play, and Toby Ziegler was part of why I found it worth wrestling with. As Bartlett&apos;s director of communications, Ziegler was a thorny inspiration to those around him, an astringent reminder of why they may never rest in the search for a political solution. As an actor in a play about a restless search for absolution, he was an equally thorny reminder that some questions are worth the effort to ask.", "sentences": ["When he opened his mouth, though, the (very creditable) Dutch accent soon reminded me that this was no hot shot from the West Wing, but a semi-autistic librarian from Hoofddorp, Amsterdam, about to report on his attempts to track down the borrower of a Baedeker, returned 113 years too late."], "title": "The West Wing's Toby Ziegler is unforgettable", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2007/mar/08/thewestwingstobyziegleris", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "The West Wing"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-09T23:58:52Z", "article": "In his piece on the fate of Tallinn&apos;s Soviet war memorial (Comment, March 6), Konstantin Kosachev overlooks the key fact that Moscow has never apologised for the Soviet annexation of the Baltics. He cites the 1989 nullification of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, implying official Soviet regret for the occupation of Estonia. But two years later, in 1991, the USSR sent tanks into the Baltic states to quash the independence movements and uphold the division of territory enshrined in the pact. Prior to the German invasion, having illegally annexed the Baltic states, the Soviets deported tens of thousands of Estonians to Siberia. The subsequent Soviet &quot;liberation&quot; brought 50 years of unwanted rule by an authoritarian, repressive government based in Moscow. For this reason, any Soviet war memorial in Estonia will always have a resonance beyond simply commemorating those who fell during the second world war. In my view the Estonians should leave the memorial where it is - the soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice in ridding Europe of fascism. On the other side, Moscow must finally face up its history. Moscow has never condemned the annexation of the Baltic states, nor has it recognised that they remained part of the Soviet Union against the will of their people, nor has it apologised for any the brutal acts of repression. Russo-Estonian relations will remain difficult, and war memorials will have an unwanted resonsance, for as long as Moscow refuses to acknowledge the sins of the past. John Lewis Tweede Amsterdam During the past four years it has been my honour to meet and interview veterans of the siege of Leningrad, several of whom fought fascism in Estonia during the second world war. These men and women were not instruments of Stalinist oppression, but former civilians who in some cases lost their entire families as a consequence of Nazi brutality. The Estonian government&apos;s proposal to unearth the bodies of Russian servicemen and women should be a source of concern not only for Russia but also for the EU. Permitting SS veterans to form associations and to parade freely is utterly unacceptable. The Russian government has demonstrated remarkable restraint. Estonia should not regard its newly acquired membership of the EU as an opportunity to engage in such acts of petty nationalism. If the EU allows such proposals to go ahead, it will reflect badly upon us all.Dr James Clapperton University of Edinburgh What is so wrong about exhuming the remains of fallen soldiers from unmarked graves in front of a war memorial and reburying them in a proper war cemetery?

It is a summary that causes Kovalainen no concern since it indicates the pressure surrounding Hamilton&apos;s debut with McLaren just as surely as it allows Kovalainen the freedom to find his feet at Renault. While Hamilton is being touted as tomorrow&apos;s champion, Kovalainen&apos;s growth into a future winner can follow a less frenetic path even though the Finn is replacing Fernando Alonso, Renault&apos;s world champion of the past two years. Alonso has joined McLaren, a move that will have mixed blessings for Hamilton. Alonso can teach the 22-year-old a great deal but the Spaniard&apos;s immediate priority will be to prove that he can win the championship at somewhere other than Renault. Hamilton, for all his quiet self-assurance and abundant natural ability, will find it difficult to match Alonso&apos;s lap times when the world champion is on a mission to make it three titles in a row. If Hamilton can qualify within a tenth of a second of Alonso, then his reputation and confidence will soar. But if mistakes are born of the need to keep pace, then the knock-on effect could compromise the rest of his season. Apart from providing Hamilton with arguably the finest benchmark in F1, Alonso will also be hoping that his young team-mate will be in a position to take points from whoever McLaren&apos;s closest rival might be. If Hamilton fails to do that then the pressure on the youngster&apos;s shoulders will be relentless as one race follows another and the need to perform adopts an urgency that not even McLaren&apos;s kid-glove treatment of their protege can hide. Hamilton is better prepared than any novice in recent years. His rise through the ranks, from karting at the age of eight to titleholder in Formula 3 and other junior categories, has been textbook stuff, bankrolled in its later stages by McLaren in what should eventually prove to be one of the best long-term investments in motor sport. Hamilton has the dignity, maturity and speed to be one of the greatest drivers this country has ever produced. The only concern is that he is possibly being force-fed the same diet that almost choked Jenson Button when he arrived 12 months too soon with Williams, a F1 team for which second place was not acceptable. The problem for Hamilton is that the flawless preparation and the impressive credentials may be another double-edged sword that increases the expectation and yet doubles the disappointment in the event of failure. He only has to look at the difficulties experienced by Nico Rosberg, who won the GP2 championship in 2005 and moved into F1 with Williams last year. Rosberg admits that his highest point last year was also his lowest, the scoring of championship points and setting the fastest lap in his first grand prix quickly becoming a rod for his young back as the fierce competitiveness of F1 took its toll and he was denied much success during the eight-month haul from Bahrain to Brazil. Hamilton became GP2 champion with some exceptionally aggressive drives last year but that will count for nothing if he is deemed, unfairly, to be struggling simply because he has not been able to join Alonso on the podium. McLaren may agree that such criticism will be unfair, but for how long can a team that rightly declares its mission to be the winning of the constructors&apos; championship accept second best? It is significant that Alonso&apos;s departure did not prompt Renault to declare Giancarlo Fisichella as their number-one driver despite the Italian having been with the team for two seasons. Perhaps it is the fact that Fisichella won 13 races fewer than Alonso that has led to the granting of equal status but, either way, Kovalainen is free to race as he pleases. When the Finnish army conscripted Kovalainen, he became one of five to be promoted to sergeant from a squad of 70 recruits. Next weekend, Kovalainen joins an elite group of 22 where his chances of advancement will be compromised by being among officer material rather than motor sport&apos;s equivalent of foot soldiers. Even so, the Renault driver will be under considerably less stress than his counterpart at McLaren when the route march begins at the double. Kovalainen accepts that it will be difficult to beat his team-mate, not only because of experience gained in 178 grands prix but also thanks to Fisichella being aware that 2007 represents his last chance to make something of a career that has not fulfilled its promise. For that reason Kovalainen knows Fisichella will not be a pushover, but there is a quiet and unmistakeable confidence within one of the few drivers on this planet to have beaten Michael Schumacher in a straight fight. Not even the highly hyped Hamilton has managed that. Christmas came early for Kovalainen in December 2004 when he emerged as victor in the Race of Champions, an end-of-season shootout between title winners from across the motor-sport spectrum. Kovalainen, present as champion of a Nissan single-seater formula, eliminated David Coulthard and then Jean Alesi as they drove buggies and Ferrari sports cars on a figure-of-eight twin track laid out in the Stade de France in Paris. The semi-final against Schumacher threatened to be more difficult but the reigning F1 world champion nudged a barrier and lost to a relative unknown. As Schumacher slipped quietly away, an overjoyed Kovalainen celebrated by stopping his Ferrari 360 Modena (worth over \u00a3100,000) and dancing on its roof. Now his name was familiar with at least 62,000 fans as the crowd rose to their feet. The spectators&apos; loyalty became divided as this cheeky youngster took on the world rally champion, Sebastian Loeb, in the final. The Frenchman was the favourite since one of the weapons of choice was a rally car; familiar territory for Loeb but completely unknown to Kovalainen. When Kovalainen, after only the briefest of practice runs, beat Loeb, Schumacher at least could feel marginally better about the shredding of his reputation. Kovalainen, at 23, had gone into the contest unfettered by technical detail and pre-conceived ideas. &apos;I just attacked all evening,&apos; said Kovalainen. &apos;No matter what I was driving or what the car was doing, I just dealt with it. Simple. I was confident in my ability - I had won races before - but I did not expect to do well. I just wanted to enjoy it. I knew that win would improve my popularity but that it would mean very little in terms of my career. It was not going to change my life.&apos; Having started racing karts at the age of 10, Kovalainen returned from the Race of Champions to a career path that would move him into GP2, the final step before F1. It was back to reality as he finished second in the championship to Rosberg. Kovalainen accepted the full-time role of test driver for Renault, but learned a great deal while doing much of the donkey work for Alonso and Fisichella. Just as important, he merged comfortably into this tight-knit team and discovered the value of being familiar with both the methodology of the personnel and the workings of the car. As the team worked flat-out to complete the first 2007 car for the launch in Amsterdam, it was typical of Kovalainen that he should be present in the factory in Oxfordshire at 7.30pm in order to greet and encourage the night-shift. As one quietly impressed mechanic noted: &apos;That&apos;s a first. Most F1 drivers believe the night shift to be an intimate dinner with their accountants and lawyers.&apos; Kovalainen may have completed a thorough preparation, but he is under no illusions about the difficulties that lie ahead in such a competitive environment. There was a painful reminder during a recent test session in Bahrain when Kovalainen crashed at 140mph. The impact destroyed the car and caused a considerable setback to the test programme. Hamilton suffered a similar accident while testing in Valencia, proving to both drivers that F1 cars have a habit of biting back. &apos;I have covered about 25,000km [15,500 miles] during the winter, which is a lot,&apos; said Kovalainen. &apos;I know the car and I know some of the test tracks very well, but it won&apos;t help me much in Melbourne. But I know I have the support of the team. For me, the most important thing when doing the deal at Renault was to be equal with whoever I was driving with. Giancarlo and I start as equals, and that&apos;s enough for me. &apos;Anything is possible, I&apos;ve prepared well and I feel very confident for the season, but it&apos;s too early to make predictions. Everybody is in F1 to win and, of course, that includes me. But at the moment it&apos;s not worth thinking about. I am not thinking of going to Melbourne and getting pole and winning, I just want to do clean laps and do the maximum. I want to score points and finish the race. Then we&apos;ll go from there. &apos;I know everyone is talking about Lewis [Hamilton] and me and comparing us. But, to be top rookie is not enough. I want to be as high [in the standings] as possible. You&apos;ve got to try and do the maximum always. I have to be very aggressive. I&apos;m not going to take it slowly and steady, trying to avoid everything. I will attack to the maximum.&apos; Despite the importance attached to the season ahead, Kovalainen has maintained a sense of proportion during recent months. &apos;I don&apos;t think about this first race all the time,&apos; says Kovalainen, who lists pasta and girls as his main interests on his website. &apos;If I did that, my life would be a bit sad! Of course, I feel very lucky that I&apos;m in such a good team in F1. But when I wake up in the morning, I don&apos;t think about the first race and nothing else. I have other things in my life. When we go testing and when I&apos;m at the factory, then we are focused on the job. But, otherwise, I really don&apos;t think it&apos;s healthy to be thinking about F1 all the time. &apos;Until now, pressure has never affected my driving, not at all. There is obviously more pressure associated with F1 because the team wants good results. But so do I. If I don&apos;t do that, then I will not be happy and so, yes, the pressure will increase. But I see that as part of being in F1. You have to deal with it.&apos; While Kovalainen has been learning about his team, the roles have been reversed as experienced eyes size up the first young driver to follow in Alonso&apos;s footsteps. There is no one better qualified to comment than Pat Symonds, Renault&apos;s director of engineering, as he worked with Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher in their early days. &apos;I really do believe Heikki has a big future,&apos; says Symonds. &apos;Over the years I have worked with many world champions and many fast drivers. I guess over that time I started to realise some of the less obvious things that make a driver. I&apos;m really pleased that I see so many of them in Heikki. &apos;It goes without saying that, for a guy to get into F1, he can drive a racing car fast, he can go around corners fast. But these days that&apos;s only part of it. To be honest, it has always only been a part of it, but it has become more and more apparent these days that you need a little bit more. &apos;You need all your race craft, you need to understand a race, you need to know when to push a car and when to look after a car so it is in a better condition to push at a different stage. What I see in Heikki is an awful lot of intelligence. He has been coming to the races with us throughout last year. Every Saturday night we would sit down together and go through what we had learned. He was like a sponge. He is perhaps a little bit rusty in terms of race craft after a year&apos;s testing, but I think it&apos;s a very natural thing that will come back to him. &apos;I would not put it past him to win a race this year, even as a rookie: it could happen. We will also look at some spectacular mistakes, thinking, &quot;Why on earth did he do that?&quot; But that is part of the learning process. The focus of attention may be elsewhere on the grid during the early races, but I have a feeling that the name Heikki Kovalainen is going to become very familiar.&apos;", "sentences": ["As the team worked flat-out to complete the first 2007 car for the launch in Amsterdam, it was typical of Kovalainen that he should be present in the factory in Oxfordshire at 7.30pm in order to greet and encourage the night-shift."], "title": "Maurice Hamilton on the grand-prix debutantes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/11/formulaone.motorsports1", "tags": ["Formula One", "Sport", "Motor sport", "Lewis Hamilton", "Formula one 2007"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-12T08:48:21Z", "article": "Going to Iraq was a frustrating business from the start for Steve McQueen.

And I know it is one thing to show your son or daughter in a cabinet in a library, another to put them on a stamp that you can buy and stick on a letter. But I think the majority do want it. When the families came to the unveiling, it was one of the most humbling experiences of my life. People were very moved. &quot;This is the hardest thing I ever did,&quot; says McQueen, who was first invited to be the war artist by the Imperial War Museum&apos;s Art Commissions Committee in 2003. &quot;Even after four years, we are not there yet. The problem is that you think people are supporting you, then you discover they&apos;re not.&quot; Resistance to McQueen&apos;s project has taken the form of delay, back-tracking and obfuscation. As soon as one obstacle disappears, another is invented. The artist went to see Leighton to discuss having the stamps used for real. &quot;The temperature dropped as soon as we walked into the room. The next thing you know, you&apos;re on the street.&quot; What isn&apos;t obvious is where McQueen stands in relation to the war. &quot;Like everyone else in the country, I have my feelings about the war. But the project is the project. Strangely, it seems that for those who are against the war, my project is regarded as a good thing. For people who support the war, it is regarded as a good thing too. It is not pro or anti-war. This work is like a sphere - roll it this way, roll it that way. In the end, it is an art work. &quot;When we hear about all the men, women and children killed in Iraq, we are numbed to it. I&apos;m pointing out that these people are all victims, too. What happened to them all was a consequence of their participation. The MoD try to say that such and such many soldiers died in action - they don&apos;t include or count all the people who died in friendly fire, in traffic accidents and so on. Some were suicides. They chopped them all out. They deleted them. They&apos;re all part of this war. &quot;Nor do I think that soldiers have to have been manning a gun emplacement with one arm tied behind their back and doing a double somersault in order to be remembered or to get a medal. An 18-year-old kid gets killed by a landmine or catches a bullet. He has contributed his life.&quot; Logistically, how many different stamps can there be? &quot;Why not use all of them? What&apos;s the problem? All first class. The Royal Mail will make money. Give some to the families.&quot; A recent McQueen exhibition in Paris included an installation, Pursuit. In a dark basement, the walls were lined with mirrored plastic sheeting, and a screen in the middle of the room was lit by odd flickers that bounced off the walls. You lost yourself in the occasional reflections that come at you from all sides. There were sounds, as if someone were fighting their way through tangled undergrowth. It was utterly disorientating. McQueen has never said what he was filming. As with Queen and Country, he makes us do the work, provokes us into deciding where we stand. It is a complicated business. But it remains difficult to fit Queen and Country into the larger context of McQueen&apos;s art. &quot;Maybe it doesn&apos;t fit. But I have never wanted anyone tripping over my tail. If people anticipate my next move, thinking I&apos;ll turn right, I&apos;ll go left. I have never been interested in an easy narrative.

A former communist and member of the avant-garde CoBrA group - famous for his expressionistic art of childlike distortion and lurid colour - Pedersen worked in the 1980s on a project that was altogether more conventional. He decorated a church. But even then he could not avoid controversy: &quot;I had painted it as a celebration of life. And then this clergyman said that I was a pagan ... And if he had known ... he&apos;d have done what he could to prevent it.&quot; It is fortunate that the disapproving cleric did not manage to thwart Pedersen, since the murals, painted glass and mosaics that he completed at Ribe Cathedral in 1987 are some of the most remarkable religious images of the 20th century. Vividly coloured, with wide-eyed, floating figures, they tell familiar Biblical stories - the Flood, the Dream of Jacob, the Ascension of Elijah - but with a freshness that inevitably shocked the more conservative churchgoers. As Pedersen put it, his paintings belong not to religion but to &quot;the world of fairy tales&quot;. Indeed, despite the greater liberties that he took with human anatomy, Pedersen became known as the &quot;Scandinavian Chagall&quot;, a title that he accepted, though with some ambivalence. His own early life was less than a fairy tale. Born in Copenhagen, he was brought up in the slums off Vigerslev Alle, which he was never able to idealise: &quot;No Chagall violin players or any other romantic figures have ever floated above them.&quot; Indeed, Pedersen&apos;s youth was dominated not by art, but radical politics, until in 1933 he met Else Alfelt, a self-taught painter, at the progressive International Folk high school in Elsinore. Else, whom he married in the following year, encouraged him to paint, and in 1936 he made his debut at the Artists&apos; Autumn Exhibition in Copenhagen. Unfortunately, Pedersen&apos;s modernist style was incompatible with the socialist realism supported by his communist comrades. He even had a row about it with Bertolt Brecht (in exile from Nazi Germany), who was so annoyed that he sent Pedersen away without giving him lunch. The insult rankled decades later. Released from his political responsibilities, Pedersen concentrated on developing an almost abstract language of flat, coloured planes and thick dark lines, exemplified by Bird Which Eats in 1939. Fascinated both by cubism and the work of Paul Klee, he made his first visit to Paris a few months before the outbreak of war, stopping on the way back in Frankfurt, where he visited the infamous Nazi exhibition of modern &quot;entartete Kunst&quot; (degenerate art). His conclusions were not those intended by the organisers. Even during the German occupation of Denmark, Pedersen threw himself into his art, joining the group Harvest, for whose periodical, Helhesten, he wrote an influential article on medieval Danish murals. After the war this interest in pre-Renaissance and folk painting played an important role in the development of CoBrA, the organisation named in 1948 after its three centres, Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam. Although not as celebrated as his compatriot Asger Jorn or the Dutchman Karel Appel, Pedersen made a significant impression with his mythical interweaving of cosmic imagery and dreamlike creatures. In Horses By the Star (1949) the beasts browse by a sun blazing at their feet, while The Sun Man (1952) wildly stares beneath violent purple rays. Above all, Pedersen&apos;s painting was dominated by otherworldly &quot;godlike&quot; birds, archetypes whose symbolism always remained unexplained. Despite the break-up of CoBrA in 1951, Pedersen&apos;s career continued to flourish. Prizes and major exhibitions included a retrospective at the Carnegie institute in Pittsburgh in 1961, and an appearance as Denmark&apos;s representative at the Venice Biennale in the following year. He also travelled extensively in the Indian sub-continent and south-east Asia, evolving the personal philosophy that shines through his most lyrical work. Most importantly, Pedersen embarked on the monumental schemes which culminated 25 years later in the decorations at Ribe Cathedral. In 1959 he began Cosmic Sea, a mosaic for the Institute of Physics at Copenhagen University, followed in 1966 by The Play of Fantasy around the Wheel of Life, a 200-metre crescent wall, decorated with ceramic tiles, in the grounds of a museum in the city of Herning. It was at Herning that a new museum, named after Pedersen and Else, was opened in 1976, two years after Else&apos;s death. Notoriously unwilling to sell his art, Pedersen endowed the collection with a large number of his own paintings, to which in 1982 he added a magnificent mosaic of The Creation. By this time Pedersen was based in Burgundy, although most of his commissions were still in Denmark. As well as working at Ribe, in 1983 he translated his vocabulary of luminous, swirling forms to painted glass for The Light of Liberty, a window in the Museum of the Danish Resistance in Copenhagen. Pedersen remained a vital, prolific artist for most of the last two decades. Often resting his canvas on the floor, applying dynamic, flowing strokes with a prodigiously long brush, he expressed his poetic, at times metaphysical, themes with all the energy of an American action painter. As well as using oil, tempera and watercolour, Pedersen also produced some striking bronze sculptures: their subjects - The Visionary (1998) or Guardian of the Sea (1999) - recall many of his pictures, while their spiky, punctured forms look more like creatures washed up on a beach. Just two weeks before he died, Pedersen&apos;s achievements were celebrated by a ceremony at the national Museum of Fine Art in Copenhagen, when 40 of his works were given to the Danish state. Sadly, the artist himself was too unwell to attend. He is survived by his second wife, Sidsel Ramson. \u00b7 Carl-Henning Pedersen, artist, born September 23 1913; died February 20 2007", "sentences": ["After the war this interest in pre-Renaissance and folk painting played an important role in the development of CoBrA, the organisation named in 1948 after its three centres, Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam."], "title": "Obituary: Carl-Henning Pedersen", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/13/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries", "tags": []}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-15T23:54:03Z", "article": "If you&apos;ve ever had to wait for a bus, the name JC Decaux will probably be familiar to you. That&apos;s because it appears on the bus shelter under the advertising poster. It probably also appears on every hoarding you see from the bus, because JC Decaux is Europe&apos;s &quot;number one outdoor advertising company&quot; (and number two in the world). It&apos;s a good business to be in. Founder Jean-Claude Decaux, semi-retired at 69, is ranked by Forbes magazine at 154th in its 2006 world&apos;s richest list, with a net worth of $4.2bn. Not for nothing does French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration refer to him as &quot;le roi du mobilier urbain&quot; - that&apos;s &quot;the king of street furniture&quot; to you. And the latest bit of street furniture to catch his eye for its commercial potential is the bicycle. Two years ago, in his home town of Lyon, JC Decaux teamed up with the city authorities to launch a radical new bike-rental scheme. Dubbing the system V\u00e9lo&apos;V (now more catchily rebranded as Cyclocity), JC Decaux was essentially updating earlier efforts at bike pools with improved technology to overcome the problem of theft and ensure a return on investment. Thus, what began with the 60s, anarchist-inspired White Bike Plan in Amsterdam, where bicycles were provided by the city, unlocked and free for public use, was reinvented as an electronic swipe-card subscription service with a less utopian motive. But if it gets people on bikes, then all well and good. In May 2005, JC Decaux installed 2,000 bikes, deposited at 175 drop-off points in France&apos;s second-largest city. Within weeks, 20,000 people had signed up for the scheme, which makes the first half-hour of use free. The number of subscribers has since risen to 60,000. Up to 16,000 rentals occur daily, equivalent to each bike being used by 15 people, who, on average, travel 1.7 miles in 17 minutes. Or a total distance of 25,000 miles every day. A good result, you would think. On the back of this success, other cities followed Lyon&apos;s lead and Vienna, Cordoba, Brussels and now Dublin are pursuing the same track, in partnership with JC Decaux - with London viewing the initiative &quot;with interest&quot;, according to Transport for London. But Jean-Claude is nothing if not ambitious: he wanted to showcase the bike-rental scheme in Paris. But then Clear Channel, another outdoor advertising company, spoiled his plans with a bid on a grander scale. JC Decaux&apos;s response was typically tenacious: halt the original tendering process with an obscure legal challenge, and triple the number of bikes it had first thought of, trumping the American competitor. As Lib\u00e9ration sardonically reports, JC Decaux&apos;s revised bid would have given Paris a bike park every 200m: overkill, perhaps. Now Clear Channel has launched its own suit, and the whole business is stalled. What has got slightly lost in all this is whether bike pools really work. Invariably greeted with initial enthusiasm, these schemes often fail down the road: the bikes are heavy and not much fun to ride, and end up being poorly maintained, vandalised or stolen. The risk is that &quot;visionary&quot; local politicians end up footing the bill for an expensive white elephant foisted on them by the operator, while the local bike trade suffers in the meantime from the publicly subsidised competition. So, the question not yet answered is whether it&apos;s really true that people are not cycling just because they don&apos;t have a bike to hand. Bike doc Dear Matt,  I&apos;m a 56-year-old, out-of-practice cyclist who has signed up to do a sponsored 11-day cycle ride in November, from Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam to Angkor Wat in Cambodia, in aid of Christie&apos;s Hospital cancer appeal fund. Could you give me any advice/tips about training and preparations for the ride. John Ager, via email I believe you&apos;ll be riding a maximum of about 90-100km a day - not too testing if you have all day to do it. First, get your bike serviced (assuming you&apos;ll be taking and riding your own). Second, get yourself a couple of pairs of cycle shorts - you&apos;ll want a padded seat for this outing. And then you can work on your fitness. Try to fit in at least one long ride a week (at least 30 miles, or 2-3 hours). Don&apos;t shun the hills; they will make you stronger. If you can manage another, shorter ride mid-week, once the clocks have changed, so much the better. Do an hour at a higher intensity, and your fitness will soon come on. Finally, get in at least a couple of rides of 100km nearer the time; that will build your confidence.

I&apos;m hugely disappointed.&quot; Newcastle&apos;s inability to show composure in the opening half-hour gave the Dutch the necessary early encouragement and, three weeks after his 34th birthday, the former Rangers striker Shota Arveladze led Alkmaar from the front. With Newcastle as brittle defensively as Alkmaar were last week, Arveladze scored the all-important first goal. That set the tone and, though Newcastle made it to half-time only 1-0 down, Danny Koevermans headed in the merited second 11 minutes into the second half. Koevermans had drilled in a 73rd-minute goal at St James&apos; Park that Louis van Gaal had said kept his team&apos;s hopes &quot;alive&quot;. Last night Van Gaal said afterwards that &quot;the most important quality of a manager is to make his players believe in what he&apos;s doing&quot; and Newcastle&apos;s obvious lack of that, allied to a fervent atmosphere in this compact new stadium, with Boney M booming out and a recording of Winston Churchill stoking the fans, made an immediately imposing impression. Newcastle did not. Though they would end the game having had three one-on-one chances with the AZ goalkeeper, Boy Waterman, the Geordies never suggested that they would quell Alkmaar. Obafemi Martins missed an 83rd-minute chance, but that was his first on-target shot. He was as underwhelming as the rest. Yet as Roeder had said beforehand, Newcastle did not have to score. This game was about defending and Titus Bramble and the talked-up Steven Taylor failed in their duties. Grace under pressure is not a quality Newcastle&apos;s defence exhibit too often and, even before Arveladze&apos;s 14th-minute opener, there were moments of alarm from Bramble and Damien Duff. The Irish winger&apos;s presence in defence showed how far back Newcastle were being pushed. Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, a substitute at St James&apos; because of injury, was largely responsible for this. The burly 19-year-old midfielder was operating just behind Arveladze, forcing Nicky Butt to sit virtually on top of Bramble and Taylor. Van Gaal said Newcastle&apos;s midfield was &quot;swimming&quot;, a Dutch football term equivalent to &quot;all at sea&quot;. Thirty seconds before Arveladze scored, he lured Taylor out to the right-back area and then swivelled away. Shay Given made his first save but the ball remained in play and Koevermans collected it on the right flank. His centre along the ground bisected Given, Taylor and Bramble and, from barely four yards, Arveladze pounced to slide the ball in. It could have been worse as two minutes before the interval, AZ had a reasonable penalty claim, Paul Huntington appearing to catch Julian Jenner. In the 54th minute Kieron Dyer went close with Newcastle&apos;s first really dangerous effort, but although he steered his shot beyond Waterman it slid a foot past the far post. In AZ&apos;s next surge Koevermans was more accurate. The big striker won a corner and was there at the near post when Maarten Martens sent it in. Climbing highest, Koevermans&apos; header was powerful and gave Given no chance. Emre Belozoglu replaced the anonymous Duff but the tide was still going the other way. Given made a block from Jenner, Koevermans had a shot scurried off the line by Taylor and, with Given again beaten, Huntington headed clear a 77th-minute Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 effort. Tyneside is now sure to host an inquest into Roeder&apos;s future, some of his players&apos; and that of the club as a whole.

We rarely get to meet them. Half an hour after the final words of our play the theatre has been hastily returned to the cold, black box it was before we arrived five hours earlier. Probably in preparation for tomorrow night&apos;s Twelfth Night or Was Ihr Volt. Nothing remains of what has passed across the stage during the two-hour traffic of our show - there was blood, water, fire, war, birdsong, moonlight. Now a few men are pulling up the gaffer tape. We say dankesch\u00f6n to the techies and we&apos;re off to the next town. There is a romance to speeding off in the night, Weizenbier in hand, job done. But it&apos;s all too easy to forget what we have done, and why we&apos;ve done it. Eight weeks into the tour and the job - as ever - has become an exercise in keeping the thing alive - often at 10 in the morning, sometimes after a weekend in Amsterdam! We&apos;ve performed the show more than 60 times in 38 different venues. Sometimes we invent games. (How many equestrian references can we make throughout the show? Offenburg Theater was a former horse training ring.) We make a special effort to surprise each other. I might introduce a new fireman to our fire crew; Gehane sends birthday greetings from the off stage microphone. Tonight I plan, as Professor Faber, to produce a magnifying glass when Glyn is least expecting it. The silliest, smallest things can make all the difference. On Wednesday at the Park Theater Iserlohn, I spent the whole show inspecting people&apos;s shoes. This was not to take away from the dramatic objectives of the scene, but to add to them; simply to try to notice things. After eight weeks it is very easy not to notice things. This week we had a mid-tour show meeting, a useful way of sitting back and looking and what we&apos;ve now got, how it&apos;s changed and what&apos;s become loose or flabby. We talked through the show in detail in the sunny courtyard of the Hotel J\u00e4gerhof in D\u00fcren. That evening&apos;s performance was the sharpest for some time and our thinking about the play as a new thing reminded us that we&apos;re still developing, making tiny adjustments all the time; that we still care. Apart from the discussion, all we really have to go on to check the pulse of the show is the sense we get of audience reaction. Our student audiences vary between the extremely attentive, who we suppose are studying Bradbury&apos;s book, and the \u00fcber-enthusiastisch - wolf whistles and all. German audiences tend to go with you all the way: they laugh loudly if it&apos;s funny, give silent stillness if it&apos;s serious, and appear to be able to do both at the same time if necessary. At curtain calls we&apos;re often greeted with whooping and the peculiarly German, somewhat disconcerting, communual rhythmic clapping. We four clap back. A play is not made by the end of rehearsals but continues to grow, kicking, screaming and breathing. This is the reason to repeat. Every day we start afresh, hoping to grow with the show.", "sentences": ["Eight weeks into the tour and the job - as ever - has become an exercise in keeping the thing alive - often at 10 in the morning, sometimes after a weekend in Amsterdam!"], "title": "The Fahrenheit diaries - growing with the show", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2007/mar/16/thefahrenheitdiariesgrowing", "tags": ["Stage"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-17T00:06:44Z", "article": "Because last week&apos;s column was kidnapped by my wife, Lisa and I are still in Borders on Oxford Street, where she&apos;s just told me that there&apos;s a &quot;sexual issue&quot; with Andrew.

Chunks of cast iron protruded from the sides of the room, with long browny-orange beards of rust staining the walls beneath them under a vast girdled roof of criss-crossing metal. The blog described the venue as &quot;beautifully industrial&quot;. Somehow, I agreed.  A few weeks later, I was standing in Amsterdam&apos;s Westergasfabriek, getting the guided tour of the city&apos;s unlikeliest cultural hotspot. &quot;This room was a purification hall when the gasworks were first built in 1883,&quot; explained the Westergasfabriek&apos;s Jacqueline Verheugen, &quot;and remained so until they found cleaner gas in the north of the country in the 60s, after which the whole thing was shut down.&quot; What did they do here after that? &quot;They played table-tennis mainly.&quot;  It took the local authorities 30 years to realise that the space was rather wasted on ex-factory workers playing ping pong, and in the early 90s they invited local theatre impresario Liesbeth Jansen to keep an eye on the place while they worked out what to do with it. Jansen stayed, and in 2003 the culturally restored Westergasfabriek was opened for business - a mini-sprawl of industrial redbrick containing a hive of creative enterprises. In one of the chambers flanking the purification hall is the newly opened Hot Ice Gallery (copyrite.nl), where Gerdur Palmadottir led me around the latest collection of wares by local cartoon art celeb Dadara (dadara.nl), unable to resist plucking the odd model off its stand to, well, hug it. Backing on to the northern end of the complex, the Pacific Parc restaurant and bar (pacificparc.nl) was buzzing in the early evening. Punctuated by elaborate fabric-and-rope chandeliers, the peaked stuccoed roof is pinned by iron fixings lined with dim orange and yellow bulbs, illuminating a glossed timber bar, DJ booth and dozens of candlelit tables scattered in between. A projector screen by the windows played 1940s film Mrs Miniver accompanied by the DJ&apos;s own playlist of big band jazz. I&apos;ve seen hip types pose the hell out of these kinds of places, yet the crowd here were refreshingly varied. I dined on braised duck and mash with an orange sauce (cost a tenner) surrounded by families, bearded fortysomethings, and the occasional, inevitable bereted trendy. A whistle-stop tour of the other buildings around the main complex followed. In the Ketelhuis Cinema (ketelhuis.nl) gangs of film buffs loitered in the bar waiting for screenings to start in one of the two 50-seat auditoriums. In food design studio Proef (proefamsterdam.nl), where local gastronome Marije Vogelzang experiments with food formats and recipes, I was introduced to her chickens, tasted some meringue before it was sculpted into an installation, and was invited back for the summer, when over the weekends a mobile kitchen is wheeled into the centre of the room to allow guests to watch their food being made. Jansen explained that one of the challenges of the Westergasfabriek&apos;s success (local estate agents now use it in their sales spiel) is to maintain &quot;a little bit of anarchy&quot; alongside the complex&apos;s more refined offerings. One solution was to invite in local techno troupe Awakenings (awakenings.nl) to use the vast, empty cylindrical gasometer looming over the north side of the complex as a site for their monthly, 3,500-strong all-night raves. They&apos;ve even designed a site-specific sound system to overcome the gasometer&apos;s tricky acoustics.  The grotty weather deprived me of a proper tour of the surrounding park, designed by Katherine Gustafson, the architect responsible for the Diana Memorial in Hyde Park, and my timing ruled out any cozy coffee slurping in De Bakkerswinkel (debakkerswinkel.nl) - the little traditional Dutch bakery by the complex&apos;s entrance was closed for refurbishment. I was also a few months early for the drinks terrace they are carving out of the old transformer building next to the gasometer, and a year early for the theatre which will be built in the second purification chamber - the Westergasfabriek is still very much a work-in-progress. I finished my day watching a local funk band entertain a small crowd in the Flex Bar, built out of the collection of rooms on the southern end of the purification halls, quietly pleased that I had plenty of reasons to come back. \u00b7 Westergasfabriek, Haarlemmerweg 8-10 (0031 2058 60710, westergasfabriek.nl).

But Steve McClaren will have to do without first-choice right-back Gary Neville, who injured ankle ligaments against Bolton and his understudy, Micah Richards, who suffered a similar injury in Manchester City&apos;s win at Middlesbrough. Johnson, like Aaron Lennon, is a pacy player who excites McClaren but has had frustratingly little opportunity to show what he can do. He was not taken to the World Cup, was asked to play on the right in a front three in Amsterdam before Christmas, and missed the last friendly through injury. Now he and Lennon are available at the right time, games today and tomorrow permitting, and have been selected in the roles they presently perform for their clubs. McClaren was able to announce quite proudly that only one player will be out of position, though capable as Jamie Carragher might be as an emergency left back the absence of the suspended Ashley Cole, the injured Wayne Bridge and the unfancied Gareth Barry leaves the team once again without a natural left-sided player to go along with the problems at right-back. In those circumstances, and with tomorrow evening&apos;s FA Cup replays a further complication England do not need, McClaren is surely right to revert to the tried and usually trusted 4-4-2. There is a time for trying new formations and asking players to do slightly different things, and this is clearly not it. Not so soon after the experiment with three at the back in Croatia cost England three points and put McClaren&apos;s neck on the line in Israel, though naturally the coach denies this could be his defining moment. &apos;It&apos;s a big game, but we are not going to qualify or get knocked out in Israel,&apos; he said. &apos;No one qualifies in March, there are eight games left and four of our last five are at Wembley. Teams will take points off each other in this group, I&apos;m sure about that, in fact they have already started. We dropped two by drawing at home against Macedonia.&apos; When it was put to McClaren that a draw might not be a bad result in Israel he said he did not even want to think about it. &apos;We are going to win this game,&apos; he said. &apos;We have the experience, the talent and the capability to get the job done. I trust these players, whatever happens in the replays we will join up on Tuesday and get on with it. We need to put up a performance of true English character, backs to the wall if you like, and I think we can. People might say 4-4-2 is rigid and limited, but if we have Aaron on the left and Steven Gerrard on the right I don&apos;t think anyone could accuse us of playing in straight lines. This is a time to be pragmatic. We&apos;ve tried other things, but this is what we know best.&apos; So, a good result in Tel Aviv and people will be asking what is the point of Terry Venables. A bad one, and McClaren will have nowhere left to turn. . The time has come, in other words, for McClaren&apos;s England to stand up and be counted. For the players to show that their coach knows what he is talking about, and is not merely a propagandist for the Premiership&apos;s big names. If England don&apos;t walk the walk this time, McClaren will end up talking the talk to himself. Which will be a pity, because he does it so well. When, for example, did we ever hear Sven-Goran Eriksson wax as lyrical as McClaren when doting on Lennon? &apos;We haven&apos;t had that type of player for a while, someone who can take the ball right down the length of the field and change things in an instant,&apos; McClaren said. &apos;We all know about Aaron&apos;s pace, but he&apos;s mentally strong too. He&apos;s at home with England, relaxed about it. You can always tell by the way players react when they join their first squad. I had a little look at Aaron in his first training session, and he was enjoying himself. It was as if he&apos;d been there all the time. That&apos;s a great sign. Wayne Rooney was just the same, and so was Micah Richards. I think Aaron has the temperament and the talent to be a very good England player.&apos; Love poem, prayer, or just wishful thinking? Quite possibly all three, but mainly a coded message. What McClaren would really like to say Lennon boils down to just four heartfelt words.

Vintage \u00a37.99 After the success of Suite Francaise, the allegations of anti-semitism, the pious hand-wringing and the column inches devoted to the &apos;unknown&apos; Irene Nemirovsky, the promised new translations of her many novels will be welcomed by readers eager to make up their own minds. David Golder was, deservedly, her first success. Golder, like the author, is a Jewish emigre in interwar Paris. A ruthless tycoon in declining health, he now faces death tormented by a grasping, adulterous wife, a spoiled daughter and his numbed conscience. There are no pleasant characters here, yet the book develops into an affecting, even tragic, drama. Like her model, Chekhov, Nemirovsky was a master of detailed compression and this novella reverberates well beyond its page count. Van Rijn, by Sarah Emily Miano. Picador \u00a37.99 By page 37 of Van Rijn, Rembrandt has begun to speak in his own voice, through imagined diary entries. Among his most intimate recorded thoughts: &apos;Ha! I&apos;ll chew on this rind of cheese, then I&apos;ll take a shit. There is no better place to muse than on the chamber pot.&apos; Sarah Emily Miano&apos;s fictional portrait of the artist maintains its grimy scatological bent to the end, with the dying Rembrandt watching the bottom of a maid carting off his bedpan &apos;brimming with vomit, piss and flegm&apos;. The canals of Amsterdam smell of &apos;garbage and afterbirth&apos;. Atmosphere is laid on more thickly than the artist&apos;s pigment. Nevertheless, Miano&apos;s period-pastiche is unconvincing, and the Old Master, musing at stool, never approaches the authenticity of his surroundings - or his paintings. The Match, by Romesh Gunesekera. Bloomsbury \u00a37.99 Slowness is part of the appeal of cricket. The game moves in cycles of leisurely preparation and moments of action, and its background presence in The Match, a charming, rhythmic novel, is well-chosen. Having moved with his father from Sri Lanka to the Philippines, the teenage Sunny Fernando puts together a scrappy cricket game with friends. Thirty years later, middle aged, unsuccessful, now a father himself, he watches Sri Lanka lose to India at the Oval, complete with hi-tech action replays ruining the excitement. Sunny, a photographer, is keenly aware of how moments can be prised from the here and now, as souvenirs or as obsessions, and his rediscovery of how to live happily in the present rings true. Gunesekera writes the sedate prose of summer afternoons, but the pay-off is quietly satisfying. Electricity, by Ray Robinson.

It&apos;s 1979, and the novel&apos;s eponymous heroine is 15 years old, holidaying with her warring parents and squabbling younger siblings in a remote, run-down Northumbrian cottage. The scent of damp, paraffin and Sanilav pervades. There is no running water, the toilet is a bucket outside and mice droppings are everywhere. When Ruth&apos;s overwrought mother, Lizzie, complains, her art critic father, John, accuses her of being bourgeois - the ultimate crime in a family in which it&apos;s fine to swear (just not in front of granny) but the words &apos;nice&apos; and &apos;cute&apos; are banned. Lizzie is convinced that John is having an affair and the air is tense with her effort to hold on to him. As summer ripens, the distance between them becomes more pronounced. Having it spelt out so clearly, Ruth reflects, is far worse than knowing secretly, &apos;picking up the rags and bones of it in the quiet and dark&apos;. Things look up for her when she sights the local farmer&apos;s son, Robbie, who charges around the hillsides on a motorbike, topless and irresistibly troubled. About Ruth&apos;s age, he&apos;s precociously burdened with a tragedy that weighs on his family. Soon, they&apos;re listening to singles together up in his room and she&apos;s daydreaming about how, back in London, it&apos;ll get around at school that &apos;she&apos;s seeing a boy&apos;. Feaver then opens up the narrative, supplementing Ruth&apos;s solipsistic teenage voice and viewpoint with Robbie&apos;s parents and Lizzie&apos;s. Though the shifts are handled well, it feels unnecessary, diluting the novel&apos;s intensity, which is one of its most compelling features. As a portrait of a time and a place, it&apos;s pitch-perfect. Ruth&apos;s hippyish mother feeds them on nettle soup and dandelion salad, while disco and mod divide her classmates. The country, too, is vividly evoked - not the city dwellers&apos; dreamt-of retreat, but the tough world that farmers know. Most memorable is Feaver&apos;s language - burnished and sturdily poetic, with a saving comic streak. The novel&apos;s close fast-forwards into the present, offering a snapshot of the restless woman that Ruth has grown into, a casualty of ramshackle parenting, adrift in her own life and clinging to fragments of the past. It&apos;s through telling her story that she&apos;s finally able to let go. Gail Lim, the late heroine of Madeleine Thien&apos;s moving first novel, produced radio documentaries in Vancouver. Before her death, she became fascinated by her parents&apos; past, and Certainty (Faber \u00a314.99, pp320) splices her efforts to unravel its mysteries with her own story, resulting in a polyphonic narrative that darts between continents and eras, from war-torn Malaysia to Amsterdam, Borneo and Australia. A nuanced study of love, displacement and the quicksilver nature of certitude, its prose gleams with emotional clarity. Bryan Malessa delves into another chapter of Second World War history in The Flight (Fourth Estate \u00a314.99, pp256). Between the end of the conflict and 1948, some 12 million ethnic Germans fled their homes to escape the advancing Soviet army. Among them is Malessa&apos;s fictional mother of three, Ida, who leaves their village in East Prussia, traversing the forests of the Baltic Peninsula in the hope of finding safety in Berlin. Rendered in understated prose, this vividly imagined landscape becomes all the more powerful. As their journey west grows increasingly perilous, the story of Ida&apos;s eldest son reveals the East Prussians&apos; role in the extermination of their Jewish neighbours. Rachael King&apos;s The Sound of Butterflies (Picador \u00a312.99, pp354) fuses Edwardian gentility with obsession, murder and a glimpse of the giddy excess of the Brazilian rubber boom. It opens in 1904, as Sophie Edgar prepares to welcome home Thomas, her butterfly-collector husband, from his trip to the Amazon. The man who returns is barely recognisable however: thin and sick, he&apos;s been left mute by the horrors he has seen. It&apos;s convincing, told in prose as opulent as one of Thomas&apos;s specimens. New York in the late Seventies forms the backdrop to Sheridan Hay&apos;s debut, The Secret of Lost Things (Fourth Estate \u00a314.99, pp304), which tells the story of an 18-year-old Tasmanian girl&apos;s coming of age. Moving there alone following the death of her mother, Rosemary Savage gets a job in a sprawling second-hand bookshop called the Arcade, where she meets a crowd of kooks and oddballs and is enlisted to help acquire a lost Melville manuscript. Though it&apos;s a novel with plenty of charm, the tale of literary adventure never quite meshes with that of a young girl in a big city. Finally, Steven Hall&apos;s The Raw Shark Texts (Canongate \u00a312.99, pp368) begins when a man wakes with no idea where, or who, he is, and becomes increasingly surreal after he learns that he&apos;s been attacked by an invisible force.

If a deal were to go ahead, the combined group would be valued at around \u00a380bn making it the fourth or fifth largest bank in the world and allowing Barclays to eclipse Royal Bank of Scotland as Britain&apos;s second biggest bank. Neither side would comment last night but it seems likely City regulators could force an announcement from Barclays as soon as today, requiring it to admit to any preliminary and exploratory approach to the Dutch bank. Discussions are believed to be taking place at the highest level within both organisations with John Varley, the Barclays chief executive, personally involved in the early negotiations. Mr Varley, who is fond of saying that he regards mergers and acquisitions as &quot;the servant of strategy not the master&quot;, may face accusations of reversing his approach to major deals. But a deal with the Dutch group would put Barclays, which is often cited as a target for Bank of America, on the front foot among the world&apos;s global banks. If successful it would be the biggest European cross-border deal to date in which a British bank has been in control. The discussions come amid a frenzied wave of mergers and acquisitions around the globe. Until now few of these have touched the financial services sector but the talks may create a fresh wave of speculation about other transactions. Barclays would not be the first bank to have approached ABN Amro about a possible deal. In the past it has been regarded as a partner for Lloyds TSB. But City sources say that more recently the likes of acquisition-hungry Spanish bank Santander have been interested as well. But it is now thought that Barclays, for the time being at least, is in the driving seat in any takeover of ABN Amro, with which it is also reported to have had merger talks two years ago. The Dutch bank&apos;s local rival ING was thought to have been pursuing a deal until last week when the reality about competition issues made it decide not to proceed. Mr Varley has made no secret of his desire to make Barclays more international. In 2006 the bank made 50% of its profits internationally for the first time and he wants to increase this proportion further. A takeover of ABN Amro would achieve this goal although it would leave Barclays trying to rebuild ABN&apos;s domestic retail banking franchise - where its own track record in the UK is also relatively poor - and implementing the merger of two such large entities. While their geographic spreads do not overlap too much there may be some questions about how ABN Amro&apos;s investment bank, built up with the acquisition of Hoare Govett, would fit inside the fast-growing capital markets business of Barclays known as Barclays Capital. Any deal would involve some tricky negotiation with financial services regulators and might require a dual listing in London and Amsterdam to satisfy their requirements. Barclays does not have the cash to pay for such a large deal and it seems most likely that some type of share deal would need to be arranged. Backstory Rijkman Groenink has been chairman of ABN Amro since 2000 - a period of under-performance for the bank that one shareholder, the Children&apos;s Investment fund, wants to end. The London-based hedge fund wants the bank to sell or demerge some of its operations and find a way to return cash to shareholders. Claiming the support of many of ABN Amro&apos;s shareholders, it wants the proposals to be put to the annual meeting on April 26. ABN Amro has been building up its fire power against any aggressors by hiring advisers from four investment banks - Lehman, Rothschild, UBS and Morgan Stanley.", "sentences": ["Any deal would involve some tricky negotiation with financial services regulators and might require a dual listing in London and Amsterdam to satisfy their requirements."], "title": "Barclays plans \u00a380bn merger with Dutch bank", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/19/frontpagenews", "tags": ["Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-20T00:16:42Z", "article": "Now we know what John Varley, Barclays&apos; chief executive, meant by his oft-repeated remark that acquisitions are &quot;the servant of strategy not the master&quot;. It meant he wanted total freedom to bet his reputation on a huge cross-border deal that would make Sir Fred Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland look timid. Judged on its power to amaze, Barclays&apos; tilt at ABN Amro is up there with Bank of Scotland&apos;s hostile bid for NatWest. That attempt failed but, as RBS, the eventual buyer, demonstrated, the thinking behind it was spot-on. NatWest, despite confusing its own management for years, scrubbed up well in no time. So maybe one should resist the screaming instinct to be sceptical about Mr Varley&apos;s big idea. Except that the events of yesterday illustrate perfectly the cultural chasm between the two banks. It took all day for London and Amsterdam to agree a simple statement confirming talks. Dutch sensitivities should not be dismissed lightly. Barclays&apos; management would clearly be in the driving seat, but Varley&apos;s crew cannot simply bag all the best jobs. As it is, they risk inflaming local opinion in the Netherlands by hacking at costs in ABN&apos;s retail network, a task that has been perpetually deferred by the bank&apos;s own management. Not that Barclays will present the deal as a cost-cutting exercise. Instead, it is likely to emphasise that ABN brings a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to enter Latin America and expand in Asia, where Barclays&apos; interests are largely confined to India. But, come on, buying ABN is a highly circuitous route to gaining exposure to emerging markets. Progress in developed markets, notably the US, would determine the success of the deal. Nobody achieved anything by standing still, will be the rejoinder. That&apos;s true, but it may be no coincidence that Barclays is enjoying its best years in ages because it has deployed its capital in a targeted manner. Bob Diamond has expanded Barclays Capital, the investment banking division, at electric pace but in organic fashion. The best acquisitions, like Absa in South Africa, have been easy add-ons. Those successes, of course, give Barclays a platform to contemplate a deal the size of ABN, but the risk for Mr Varley is that he fails to deliver, which is a real possibility. The Dutch don&apos;t obviously want to be bought and any rival bidders have the advantage of keeping their powder dry for now. The scale of Mr Varley&apos;s ambitions, on the other hand, can never be put back in the box. Kremlinoilogy One part of BP&apos;s empire has not been overwhelmed by the company&apos;s sea of troubles over the past 12 months. The joint venture in Russia, TNK-BP, has continued to gush profits and improve production volumes. True, the Kovykta gas project in Siberia has met problems from local environmental agencies but there has been nothing to compare with Shell&apos;s headache at Sakhalin. In short, TNK-BP seemed to be an example of how Lord Browne, the chief executive, having been burnt the first time by Russian oligarchs, got it right at the second attempt. He invested directly in a Russian company and avoided fancy footwork such as production-sharing agreements; TNK-BP is a straightforward joint venture in which BP has 50%. Unfortunately, nothing in the Russia energy industry stays straightforward for long. Remarks by the TNK-BP chief executive, Bob Dudley, which we report today, suggest the Kremlin is taking a close interest in the company and would like to see a restructuring of the 50% held by Russian interests. Out would go BP&apos;s long-standing partners, in would come a state-backed mega-enterprise such as Gazprom or Rosneft. Mr Dudley professes to be sanguine; BP investors are unlikely to be so relaxed. Many were uncomfortable at the way BP was pressured, or encouraged if you prefer, to write a $1bn cheque to support last year&apos;s flotation of Rosneft. If the joint venture is now to be with Gazprom, which takes instruction directly from the Kremlin, the political risks will escalate, however many times BP tells us the safest place to be in Russia is in bed with the government. The good news is BP has recouped its TNK investment in only a few years. The bad news: the Kremlin may see that as a cue to increase its slice of the pie.

The UK&apos;s third biggest bank, after HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland, would be incorporated in the UK but headquartered in Amsterdam, according to an outline of how the merger would proceed. The new combined bank would be regulated by the Dutch central bank and have a Dutch chairman. The post of chief executive, however, would be filled by Barclays and the enlarged group would have its primary stockmarket listing in London. If the deal goes ahead it would be Europe&apos;s biggest financial services merger. However, there could be substantial job losses in London if Barclays&apos; head office functions at Canary Wharf are relocated to Amsterdam. Trade union Amicus today gave a broad welcome to the merger proposal, which would &quot;allow Barclays to become the truly global organisation it has long aspired to be&quot;. However it was also &quot;seeking assurances from Barclays that if an agreement is reached it will not result in job losses from Barclays UK operations.&quot; The details of where the new group would be located and how the top jobs would be shared out - if the deal goes ahead - were outlined in a statement to the stock exchange released just after the market closed and less than 24 hours after the two banks confirmed they were in exclusive talks. Barclays is expected to be the dominant partner. Barclays and ABN Amro described the details as &quot;broad objectives&quot; around which they would attempt to stitch together a merger agreement. However, they added that the negotiations were still &quot;at an early and exploratory stage and there can be no certainty that they will lead to a transaction or the form it will take&quot;. The statement added: &quot;The ultimate outcome of these discussions generally, and in regard to these specific objectives, will depend on the consultation with and the approvals of the multiple regulators and other stakeholders in the various jurisdictions&quot;. Barclays shares had surged by more than 4% at one stage today, reflecting a growing belief that Barclays could itself become a bid target. They closed up 25p, or 3.7%, at 702p. At that level the bank - Europe&apos;s biggest credit card company - is valued at nearly \u00a346bn. One analyst said Barclays had put itself &quot;in the shop window&quot; with the proposed deal. Potential bidders for Barclays are said to include Citigroup and Bank of America. Shares in ABN, which has a value of some \u00a340bn, rose 3.5% to end at \u008031.00 (\u00a321.04). Analysts remain divided on whether the talks will eventually lead to a merger between the two. Analyst Alex Potter at Collins Stewart noted the phrasing of last night&apos;s statement: &quot;One interesting element is noticeable: the transaction is aiming to &apos;create value for both sets of shareholders&apos;. &quot;We wonder whether Barclays are backing away from their hurdle of a transaction having to beat a share buyback in return terms and simply moving to a &apos;value creative&apos; hurdle, ie beating cost of capital. This latter hurdle is materially lower at the moment - circa 9% rather than circa 11% for a share buyback comparator.&quot; Mr Potter believes Barclays could bid around \u008032 a share, which is only marginally above the current ABN price, although it is materially above the \u008025 a share level at which the Dutch bank was trading before activist investor the Children&apos;s Investment Fund emerged as a shareholder a month ago. The worst case scenario, says Mr Potter, is that Barclays wins control of ABN Amro, which could see a dilution in earnings of 6%. All the other scenarios are significant buying opportunities in Barclays. Either the UK bank is left as a standalone or alternatively the bid is broken up by a third party bidding for Barclays &quot;which would be clearly beneficial to Barclays&apos; shareholders&quot;. &quot;If the Barclays bid for ABN does go ahead and Barclays is outbid for ABN, then this still leaves Barclays &apos;in play&apos; in our view,&quot; he said. &quot;Management has acknowledged at least openness to, if not the requirement for, a deal to further its strategic aims.&quot;", "sentences": ["The UK&apos;s third biggest bank, after HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland, would be incorporated in the UK but headquartered in Amsterdam, according to an outline of how the merger would proceed.", "However, there could be substantial job losses in London if Barclays&apos; head office functions at Canary Wharf are relocated to Amsterdam."], "title": "Amsterdam move beckons for Barclays", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/20/5", "tags": ["Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-21T08:33:50Z", "article": "And for its next trick Barclays will drop its turquoise branding and adopt orange. The bank would have caused less of a stir with such an announcement than yesterday&apos;s bombshell. A head office in Amsterdam and regulation by the Dutch central bank are extraordinary concessions to make in the first round of negotiations with ABN Amro. Two messages are unmistakable: the Dutch will demand a high price for swallowing their pride and Barclays is terrified that a counter-bidder will emerge. As Barclays tells it, there is nothing to get excited about. John Varley, Barclays chief executive, would be in the hot seat, even if the chairman, Marcus Agius, would be obliged to fall on his sword after just a few months in the job. Nor would there be a fiddly two-tier continental board structure. Good old Anglo-Saxon virtues would reign and Barclays would remain a FTSE 100 company incorporated in Britain. Well yes, but the compromises illustrate how messy this tale could become. If the Amsterdam head office is to be a substantial operation, then there is a recipe for confusion. If Amsterdam will really be a brass plate, then the Dutch management will feel they&apos;ve been mugged. A bigger issue, though, is the identity of the main regulator. As Barclays admits and ABN will know, the regulators will decide that question for themselves. Again, there is room for ill-feeling to breed if the Dutch don&apos;t get their way. All these issues are sideshows to real point of the negotiations: the price Barclays would pay. The horse and cart don&apos;t seem to be properly arranged. Here we go again It&apos;s been at least a fortnight since the launch of the last investigation into the evil deeds of BSkyB, so it must be time for another. Sure enough, Ofcom went the whole hog yesterday and announced an inquiry into the whole pay-TV market. That makes three, or perhaps it&apos;s four, inquiries. Amid it all nobody has provided a clear answer to this question: what, specifically, has Sky done wrong? It can&apos;t be the purchase of 18% of ITV; that possibility was debated in parliament and led to the &quot;Murdoch clause&quot; in the 2003 Communications Act permitting holdings of up to 20%. It can&apos;t be pulling Sky News from Virgin Media; the channel, and the others that left cable, are exempt from regulations forcing Sky to make its sport and movie content available on a wholesale basis. And surely it can&apos;t be Sky&apos;s ambition to offer pay content via the Freeview platform; that&apos;s what Top Up TV does and nobody bats an eyelid. Yet the feeling persists - encouraged loudly by Sir Richard Branson - that Sky is engaging in bully-boy behaviour. In one sense, Branson&apos;s arrival is the only new element here because the cable industry has been complaining about Sky for a decade, usually fruitlessly. In the last major inquiry, in 2002, the Office of Fair Trading had to revise its initial opinion that Sky was abusing its dominant position and ended up saying there was no hard evidence. The credit-rating agencies, whose job is to assess risk coldly, are betting on a similar outcome. Ofcom&apos;s investigation &quot;is unlikely to materially change the structure of the UK&apos;s pay-TV industry, or fundamentally alter the credit profile of any of the key rated players,&quot; said Fitch. That is probably a fair assessment but Branson has certainly succeeded in changing the mood of the debate. The most immediately damaging outcome for Sky would be a delay to its digital platform on Freeview. Even the mere announcement of a competition inquiry might be sufficient for that, and Sky is clearly worried by the possibility. Yet the big one remains the stake in ITV , which falls outside this inquiry. The shares were bought at 135p, against a current market price of 108p. In a forced sale, the loss to Sky might be \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m. It would a very big cheque to demand. Indeed, it would look like a declaration of war against Murdoch. Be realistic, it&apos;s not the way to bet. Great deal of frenzy Private equity hunters are surrounding Alliance Boots, Sainsbury&apos;s and who knows who else. Barclays is trying to buy ABN. These are deal-a-minute times and it&apos;s tempting to think the sheer weight of money looking for a home offers good support to stock markets. This line of thought is perfectly sensible but Richard Lake, chart-watcher at stockbroker Brewin Dolphin, makes the useful counter-argument that there was a deal frenzy just before the market peaked last time. Guardian Royal Exchange, Asda, Orange, NatWest, Thames Water, Norwich Union and Woolwich were taken out in 1999 and 2000. You have to admit, it&apos;s a long and diverse list. nils.pratley@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["A head office in Amsterdam and regulation by the Dutch central bank are extraordinary concessions to make in the first round of negotiations with ABN Amro.", "If the Amsterdam head office is to be a substantial operation, then there is a recipe for confusion.", "If Amsterdam will really be a brass plate, then the Dutch management will feel they&apos;ve been mugged."], "title": "Viewpoint: Putting  the cart before  the horse", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/21/viewpointcolumn", "tags": ["Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-21T09:26:43Z", "article": "Barclays, Britain&apos;s third largest bank, is preparing to shift its headquarters to Amsterdam and allow the combined entity to be regulated by the Dutch central bank as part of its \u00a380bn negotiations with Dutch bank ABN Amro to create the world&apos;s fifth largest financial firm. The concession to the Dutch is likely to raise fears about thousands of jobs in Barclays&apos; new headquarters in Canary Wharf and spark concerns about the regulation of one of the biggest firms overseen by the Financial Services Authority. The two parties to the negotiations in what will be Europe&apos;s biggest cross-border deal were forced to reveal their early thinking on the structure of the group by the Dutch regulators yesterday. Shares in both companies rose as some investors bet their talks would fall apart and they would fall into the hands of other suitors. Barclays closed 25p higher at 702p while ABN ended at \u20ac31, 3% higher, on top of a near 10% gain on Monday, when the talks were confirmed. The combined group would be incorporated in the UK as a plc with a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing in Amsterdam. It would also have a boardroom structure familiar to British investors with a single chairman and chief executive. Dutch companies often have two boards and two sets of management. The group&apos;s first chairman is to be nominated by ABN Amro while the first chief executive will be nominated by Barclays. John Varley, Barclays&apos; chief executive who was yesterday attending a longstanding Barclays board meeting in New York, is widely expected to be chief executive of the combined group. The chairman&apos;s position is more controversial as ABN Amro&apos;s head, Rijkman Groenink, is unpopular with shareholders. This has prompted suggestions that he may be nominated as chairman with a timescale attached to appease investors who want him to leave. The FSA was quick to respond to the suggestion that the combined group would be &quot;lead&quot; regulated by the Dutch Central Bank, meaning Dutch rules would overrule those of another jurisdiction in which the bank operates. The FSA said it had &quot;requested further information from both parties&quot;. &quot;Before this information has been received and assessed, no decision can be reached about the appropriate regulatory arrangements,&quot; the FSA said. Regulation will be hotly debated in the coming days and the views of the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, will also need to be factored in. The outcome may also have implications for retail customers of Barclays and clarity will be needed on whether they would be covered by deposit schemes that pay out in the unlikely event that banks go bust. The FSA is expected to fight hard to remain lead regulator. A combined ABN Amro/Barclays would be incorporated in the UK and although it might be nominally headquartered in Amsterdam, it is likely to keep a heavy presence here, if only because of its capital markets operations run by Barclays Capital. Several large British banks are based outside the capital. Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS are based in Edinburgh and Lloyds TSB is registered in Scotland. Finance union Amicus broadly supported the merger, saying &quot;it will allow Barclays to become the truly global organisation it has long aspired to be&quot;. However, spokesman Keith Brookes said it would fight to avoid compulsory redundancies. Barclays is believed to have tried to clinch a deal with ABN Amro on a number of occasions and both sides continued to say yesterday that there was no certainty of a deal. Two of the four investment banks retained by ABN Amro are continuing to work on alternative strategies if merger talks fail and it is not yet clear whether the Children&apos;s Investment Fund (TCI), which owns 1% of ABN Amro and has been agitating for change by next month&apos;s annual general meeting, will support the transaction. In a rare statement, the secretive London-based hedge fund said: &quot;Until there is a formal proposal to evaluate, we are unable to comment on the merits of a prospective deal. While TCI are encouraged by this development, which may result in creating value for shareholders, we hope that the exclusivity granted to Barclays PLC will not prevent the board of ABN Amro from employing a process that considers bids by other credible institutions in order to produce the best result for shareholders.&quot; 300 years in capital The UK&apos;s third biggest bank, and the biggest credit card operation in Europe, Barclays traces its origins back more than 300 years. It was founded by John Freame and Thomas Gould in Lombard Street in 1690 and adopted the Barclays name after James Barclay became a partner in 1736. At that time private bankers safeguarded their clients&apos; gold deposits and lent to merchants. Barclays was known as the Quaker Bank after the tradition of its founding families. By 1896 it had 182 branches and deposits of \u00a326m. By 1926 it had more than 1,800 branches and had acquired three overseas banking groups. Barclays acquired Martins bank in 1969 and took over the Woolwich in 2000. In 1981 it was the first foreign bank to file with the US Securities and Exchange commission and in 1986 created an investment banking business. Barclays now has operations around the world and in 2005 it took control of the ABSA group, South Africa&apos;s largest retail bank with more than 7 million customers. The deal marked the bank&apos;s return to the country nearly 20 years after it was forced to withdraw following widespread protests about its involvement in a country maintaining an apartheid regime. The group employs more than 100,000 staff and recently reported record annual profits of more than \u00a37bn.", "sentences": ["Barclays, Britain&apos;s third largest bank, is preparing to shift its headquarters to Amsterdam and allow the combined entity to be regulated by the Dutch central bank as part of its \u00a380bn negotiations with Dutch bank ABN Amro to create the world&apos;s fifth largest financial firm.", "The combined group would be incorporated in the UK as a plc with a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing in Amsterdam.", "A combined ABN Amro/Barclays would be incorporated in the UK and although it might be nominally headquartered in Amsterdam, it is likely to keep a heavy presence here, if only because of its capital markets operations run by Barclays Capital."], "title": "Barclays plans to switch headquarters to Amsterdam", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/21/money.frontpagenews", "tags": ["Business", "Money"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-21T09:53:09Z", "article": "WHAT WILL BE IN THE BUDGET? When reporting something due to occur several hours after you expect your paper to be read, tense is all important. The Guardian, in straightforward future tense, says Gordon Brown &quot;will announce&quot; an extra \u00a31bn to combat child poverty in his budget. The FT manages to cram both the immediate and medium term future into its opening; Gordon Brown &quot;will today bid farewell to the Treasury with what senior officials have described as &apos;a big budget&apos;&quot;, concentrating on education, and including changes to corporate and personal taxation. The Telegraph, perhaps seeking to soften a Brown-friendly story, is grammatically more conservative, stretching only to a present tense. It says Mr Brown &quot;is today expected to unveil a high-profile tax cut for business in a bid to trump David Cameron&quot;. The Times dispenses with all this, and catapults us into the past, both immediate and distant. Its headline, above a smiling but jowly picture of Mr Brown, reads &quot;Black Tuesday&quot;. The intimation is clear: Black Wednesday was the fateful day in 1992 that ended the career of a previous jowly chancellor, Norman Lamont. Black Tuesday, in the Times&apos;s view, is what the current chancellor experienced yesterday, when &quot;some of Britain&apos;s highest-ranking officials said that they supported the devastating attack&quot; by Lord Turnbull, who as Wrap readers will know, has accused Mr Brown of &quot;Stalinist ruthlessness&quot;. Compare and contrast.

Steve Bell delves into cartoon history to recreate Low&apos;s famous depiction of Hitler and Stalin meeting over a corpse. The original had them greeting each other as &quot;The scum of the Earth, I believe?&quot; and &quot;The bloody assassin of the workers, I presume?&quot;. Bell&apos;s has Hitler - possible resemblance to Lord Turnbull unclear - addressing a silent Mr Brown: &quot;Nyaaa Nyaardy Nyaaa Nyaaa. You look like Stalin.&quot; The Times wonders what Mr Brown can do to improve his image, and consults experts from the fields of medicine, management, psephology and hairdressing. They all conclude that he should be a bit nicer to people, and scrub up a bit better. Let&apos;s hope, for the sake of history, he&apos;s reading. Demonstrating the law of unintended consequences, the Times also does one of those gradual photomorphs from Gordon to Uncle Joe. In the second step, with a tidy moustache and slightly bushier eyebrows, he looks a lot like Des Lynam; you get the feeling people would like him more. But the best comment of the day comes from Zoe Williams in the Guardian&apos;s G2, who quotes Harriet Harman&apos;s defence of her party colleague: All I can conclude is that not all civil servants admire strong political leadership.&quot; Here, says Williams, &quot;she makes a good defence for Brown, since if he really was like Josef Stalin, he would not allow himself to be defended in such an idiotic way.

Burglars wear dark clothing and use crowbars. These men&quot; - Lord Black and his co-defendants - &quot;dressed in ties and and wore a suit.

A guy walks down the street, knocks you down, and takes your wallet. There&apos;s no difference, but you&apos;re doing it with memos and documents and a few lies.&quot; Mr Cramer said that the victims were shareholders investing for &quot;pensions and college funds&quot;.

The FT makes no mention of the Guardian&apos;s understandable worry that this would involve job losses in the UK. That&apos;s not what the FT is there for. Instead the Lex column wonders whether the concessions that Barclays will have to make to persuade ABN&apos;s shareholders to accept the deal will alienate its own investors, &quot;a bunch typically rather distrustful of cross-border banking mergers&quot;.

Britain&apos;s third biggest bank has raised the prospect of shifting its head office to Amsterdam as part of its negotiations with Dutch bank ABN Amro to create an \u00a380bn financial services company that would be in the top five globally. The financial services industry contributes 25% of the tax take in the UK even though its contribution to GDP is lower at 10%. John Cullinane, tax partner at accountants Deloitte, said: &quot;The UK [tax take] is vulnerable to cross border banking deals. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s just Barclays and ABN Amro. We are on the verge of an explosion in cross-border deals.&quot; Barclays paid \u00a31.9bn in tax last year, on profits of \u00a37bn, at a headline tax rate of 30%. Its annual report for 2006 shows that some \u00a31.3bn of that total tax bill was paid in the UK. The initial impact on Barclays&apos;s tax bill by moving its headquarters to the Netherlands may not be large as the combined group plans to remain incorporated in the UK. But, over time, the group could push more business into branches, which receive more lenient treatment in the Netherlands. The Dutch bank&apos;s total tax rate was 21% last year. Tax experts warn that assessing a major company&apos;s tax bills is extremely complex and it is too early to tell what the precise impact would be. Executives from both banks continued to thrash out the terms of their record-breaking deal on Wednesday amid speculation that Barclays would be unable to afford little more than \u20ac32 (\u00a321.7) a share for the Dutch bank \u2014 barely above its \u20ac31 share price. The Barclays board was in New York, at a meeting arranged before news of the current talks leaked, but was in close touch with the negotiations. Analysts at Citigroup noted that out of 14 potential buyers for ABN Amro, Barclays ranked 10th in terms of the possible synergies that could be achieved. The amount of synergies \u2014 essentially cost savings and revenue enhancements \u2014 can affect the price that Barclays is able to pay. Banks that could achieve higher synergies would be HSBC, JP Morgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, BNP Paribas, ING and Santander. Scepticism began to emerge about Barclays&apos;s motivation for the transaction, following recent statements by its chief executive John Varley which appeared to indicate a major deal was unnecessary. James Eden, banks analyst at brokers Dresdner Kleinwort, said in a research note: &quot;Barclays claims it is motivated by shareholder value.

Britain&apos;s third biggest bank has raised the prospect of shifting its head office to Amsterdam as part of its negotiations with Dutch bank ABN Amro to create an \u00a380bn financial services company that would be in the top five globally. The financial services industry contributes 25% of the tax take in the UK even though its contribution to GDP is lower at 10%. John Cullinane, tax partner at accountants Deloitte, said: &quot;The UK [tax take] is vulnerable to cross border banking deals. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s just Barclays and ABN Amro. We are on the verge of an explosion in cross-border deals.&quot; Barclays paid \u00a31.9bn in tax last year, on profits of \u00a37bn, at a headline tax rate of 30%. Its annual report for 2006 shows that some \u00a31.3bn of that total tax bill was paid in the UK. The initial impact on Barclays&apos;s tax bill by moving its headquarters to the Netherlands may not be large as the combined group plans to remain incorporated in the UK. But, over time, the group could push more business into branches, which receive more lenient treatment in the Netherlands. The Dutch bank&apos;s total tax rate was 21% last year. Tax experts warn that assessing a major company&apos;s tax bills is extremely complex and it is too early to tell what the precise impact would be. Executives from both banks continued to thrash out the terms of their record-breaking deal yesterday amid speculation that Barclays would be unable to afford little more than \u20ac32 a share for the Dutch bank - barely above its \u20ac31 share price. The Barclays board was in New York, at a meeting arranged before news of the current talks leaked, but was in close touch with the negotiations. Analysts at Citigroup noted that out of 14 potential buyers for ABN Amro, Barclays ranked 10th in terms of the possible synergies that could be achieved. The amount of synergies - essentially cost savings and revenue enhancements - can affect the price that Barclays is able to pay. Banks that could achieve higher synergies would be HSBC, JP Morgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, BNP Paribas, ING and Santander. Scepticism began to emerge about Barclays&apos;s motivation for the transaction, following recent statements by its chief executive John Varley which appeared to indicate a major deal was unnecessary. James Eden, banks analyst at brokers Dresdner Kleinwort, said in a research note: &quot;Barclays claims it is motivated by shareholder value. We suspect the truth is more about ego and politics.&quot; &quot;In 1981 John Varley married into the Pease family, whose bank became part of Barclays in 1902.

But the cut in corporation tax to 28% is designed precisely to encourage big, highly profitable multinationals - many in the booming financial services sector - to stay in Britain. This is not in the pure sense of keeping their head offices here, which is a slight red herring in the debate over corporate competitiveness. Rather, it&apos;s in the sense of where big corporations locate their high-earning staff and so choose to generate profits. So banks, insurers, pharmaceutical and media companies - which can all be considered mobile - will be prime beneficiaries. They will pay less corporation tax in Britain while largely avoiding the main clawback, namely a squeeze on capital allowances on plant, machinery and buildings. The losers are immobile companies. Think utilities, property companies, retailers, pubs, airports, hoteliers and even the state-owned Post Office. These businesses now find the definition of what counts as plant and machinery in Britain, and so qualifies for the most generous level of tax relief, has moved against them. The size of the clawback should not be underestimated. The detail in the Red Book shows that the cut in corporation tax will cost the Treasury \u00a32.23bn in 2009-10, but that there will be a gain of equivalent size from capital allowances. Treasury officials insist the impact on the losers will be on their cash flows, not their profit and loss statements, but it&apos;s a sizeable impact nonetheless. Indeed, at the margin, it may dampen the current investment enthusiasm for infrastructure assets, whose appeal is supposed to be the reliability of the cashflows. Those flows look marginally less reliable today. The new owners of BAA and Thames Water, for example, will be re-examining their spreadsheets. Still, the corporation tax change alone obliged the business lobby to be enthusiastic yesterday. Richard Lambert, director general of the CBI, said last year that a 30% rate of corporation tax was unsustainable and Gordon Brown has agreed. Competitiveness is on the political agenda again and, for the first time in years, the government can make a few boasts on the subject. At 28%, the rate will be below that of Germany, even after a reduction there, and substantially below that of France. Yet Britain will still be above the EU average of 25%, which has fallen not simply because of the arrival of low-tax accession states. Corporation tax in the Netherlands is 25.5%. In Ireland the rate is 12.5% and the attraction of Dublin as a site for back-office processing for financial services will not disappear. The CBI will continue to bang its drum. The debate, it should be said, will seem academic to small businesses whose rate of corporation tax will rise from 20% to 22%. The pay-off is meant to be annual investment allowances of \u00a350,000. But there are many small companies which don&apos;t need to invest that much and they won&apos;t all be the Treasury&apos;s prime target - taxi drivers, hairdressers and the like who have incorporated themselves to take advantage of tax differences.", "sentences": ["It wasn&apos;t, of course, Barclays&apos; talk of a move to Amsterdam that made the difference."], "title": "Business viewpoint: Big and mobile: the business beneficiaries", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/22/viewpointcolumn", "tags": ["Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-23T13:28:28Z", "article": "Finally, after five weeks and over 500 submissions, Big Blogger has come to an end. And it finishes with a bang: because this week&apos;s entries were by far the strongest. The writing was hugely improved, the subjects more varied and interesting, the decision about who to shortlist harder than ever. Picking an overall winner hasn&apos;t been easy - the pieces by Richard Koss (Niew Amsterdam) below and James Baron (Octavemouret) in week two were outstanding, while several others, including Tim Hill (timmyhilleh), A Hirst (Brazil Branch) and James Andrews (FourTurntables) have impressed. In the end, however, we felt that the consistent quality of Jonathan Jones&apos; (JohnnyBoy71) work made him a worthy winner of Big Blogger. Well done, Johnny: a paid commission is coming your way. Over the last few weeks, we&apos;ve had several emails asking a) whether Big Blogger will return, and b) how to improve as a writer. The answer to the first question is a definite yes - maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon ... ish. The answer to the second question is harder to answer, but reading great writers (Orwell, Waugh, Fitzgerald, say) and/or great sportswriters (Engel, Samuel, Humphries to pick three out of thin air) and dissecting their flow, rhythm and structure will pay dividends. And we can&apos;t recommend Put It in Writing by John Whale highly enough: it is a treasure trove of simple advice on what makes good writing. Anyway, for the last time, here goes ... Goat: Greatest Of All Time - Richard Koss (Niew Amsterdam) Old school&apos;s in session around the bar at Showman&apos;s in Harlem, where the talk turns to basketball. The game ain&apos;t the same, runs the consensus, with today&apos;s stars being all bling and no substance. New jacks like LeBron are dismissed with sneers, while the jury on Kobe and Shaq is not only out but engaged in extended homages to past heroes. I throw in my own nostalgic two cents and am stunned to find the respect for Michael and Magic grudging. So, who was better? The ensuing roll call ignores the past two decades and rambles inconclusively until someone mentions Earl &quot;the Goat&quot; Manigault. It&apos;s a name I haven&apos;t heard in ages. I never saw the Goat play. A streetball hero of the late 1950s and 60s, Manigault boasted a vertical leap (no running start) of more than four feet and spellbinding body control. He was celebrated for his &quot;double dunks,&quot; an original move in which he&apos;d sky to the basket, jam the ball through with one hand, catch it below the basket with the other, then slam it again before joining the mere mortals down on the court - all the more impressive when you consider that, at six feet tall, he was short by basketball standards. Tales of him picking coins off the top of the backboard (about 10 feet off the ground) are still the stuff of legends at the Rucker League, a Harlem summer tournament that features teams of local playground stars often sponsored by hip-hop celebrities, with the odd cameo from pros seeking street cred and willing to risk loss of face. Manigault himself never made it to the pros. Though he lit up the playground and his high-school league (where he set city scoring records), he also sparked a few too many blunts and got booted from school for repeated marijuana use. He finished high school in the safer confines of North Carolina, where he subsequently enrolled in a small black college rather than a major university programme that could have led to NBA stardom. Sadly, he dropped out after a few months after struggling with classes and a coach with no appreciation for his streetball flash. Returning home from North Carolina, the Goat fell prey to the heroin epidemic that ravaged ghetto America in the 60s and 70s, doing time for possession and for robbery. His reputation later earned him a try-out with a pro team in Utah, but his time was past. He was able to clean up his life, the rest of which he spent haunting the hood and presiding over a youth tournament with an anti-drug message at the playground that now bears his name. Unperturbed at never attaining the fortune he seemed destined for, he once told a reporter: &quot;I am a rich man. Just look at my arms: all of my money is in my veins.&quot; He died in 1998 at the age of 53. It&apos;s impossible to measure the genius that never makes it out of the favelas to grace the pitches of the world. That Earl Manigault makes the informal pantheon of hoop legends at Showman&apos;s is not surprising: he&apos;s a native son, after all, and the drugs that derailed his train to stardom plagued much of the community. The old heads at the bar aren&apos;t bothered that his greatness was never more widely acknowledged, that his potential was never realised. The hero&apos;s a local one, even if the tale is not. The Wait Continues by Tim Hill (timmyhilleh) It is 13 years since a Canadian team won the Stanley Cup. Soon, probably, it will be 14. Admittedly, Vancouver currently lie third in the Western Conference of the NHL, and Ottawa are doing fine, but Montreal, Toronto and Edmonton sit outside the play-off zone, with little realistic chance of lifting Lord Stanley&apos;s mug in June. The fact is, Canadian teams are no longer very good at ice hockey. The Canadiens, the most successful outfit in NHL history, have not won the Stanley Cup since 1993; the Maple Leafs, the second most successful, not since 1967. The league&apos;s American sides now have all the money, take all the best players, and clubs in Winnipeg and Quebec have long since moved to Phoenix and Denver. Yet, in many ways, none of this matters to the Canadian people. Although their clubs have gone through a barren spell in the NHL, silverware has never been the barometer on which the sport&apos;s success is gauged. Hockey will continue its glorious reign as Canada&apos;s favourite pastime, because it forms an intrinsic part of the Canadian identity. When we think of Canada, we think of ice hockey. The game is probably the most recognisable expression of Canada there is, and other areas in which Canada leads the world - multiculturalism, social welfare, robust winter pantaloons - have never really taken off as spectator sports. The country breathes hockey. It appropriates every aspect of Canada&apos;s popular culture, and is a huge part of the national discourse. Take a walk in downtown Toronto on a winter evening and you&apos;ll see scores of youngsters playing the game in and around Nathan Phillips Square. Of course, the success of ice hockey has much to do with the weather. For six months a year, Canada is freezing - perfect conditions for a sport played on ice - but hockey would position itself as Canada&apos;s national game regardless. Canada sees an image of itself through its hockey. Its players are quick and skilful but also capable of dishing out a pounding, and perhaps the perception of Canada as naturally cautious, somewhat insignificant and wholly overshadowed by America, irks them somewhat. Maybe a kind of self-expression is harnessed through the game. They&apos;re not egotistical basketball players or temperamental footballers; not Americans or Europeans. They&apos;re Canadians. Canadians probably don&apos;t enjoy the game for its pleasurable aesthetics. Ice hockey, for all its qualities, remains a flawed spectator sport, and unlike the Russians and the Czechs, Canadian players are hardly famed for their individual skills. However, Canadians can identify with its core components of beauty and belligerence. Small wonder the vast majority of NHL players hail from north of the border. Canadians don&apos;t like hockey because it&apos;s a good game; they like it because it&apos;s their game. Seeing a hockey player is how, ideally, you&apos;d like to see yourself - an artist, perhaps, an athlete, certainly; but someone worth being taken seriously. With or without the Stanley Cup, it remains an important expression of Canadianness. Why Football Hooliganism Isn&apos;t All Bad by A Hirst (Brazil Branch) As liberal-minded Guardian readers, is it any of your business what two (or more) consenting adults get up to in the privacy of their bedrooms? Correct. And is it any of your business if consenting adults like to relax by smoking the leaves of a herb that they&apos;ve grown themselves and don&apos;t harm anybody else while doing so? True. So is it any of your business if consenting adults like to fight each other if they don&apos;t harm anybody else? It isn&apos;t. So why all the holier-than-thou attitudes when it comes to football hooliganism? Journalists always search for the underlying socio-economic reason for hooliganism, reasons that dovetail nicely with their political agenda. It doesn&apos;t occur due to poverty though, or a lack of inner-city funding, but for one simple reason: the British love fighters. For centuries, our leaders have expected the young men of the country to be willing to fight their battles for them in far-flung corners of the world, and by and large they&apos;ve have done so. Thankfully, for the last 60 years or so, that&apos;s changed, but these tribal feelings remain deeply ingrained. Some people like to fight. As with the debate over the legalisation of drugs, that should be your starting point. When it comes to the legality of boxing, one pro-argument states that boxing will continue regardless, so the safest course of action for everybody is to organise it properly. Why not apply the same logic to football hooliganism? There are ways to organise it, make it safer and entertain people at the same time. Ban weapons, make participants fight naked with huge gloves, or dress them up in huge outfits in the style of the club mascot. Take the best 200 from every club and let them fight it out on the pitch for an hour before the match until the last man is standing, a hybrid of It&apos;s A Knockout and Gladiator. Let them hurt each other if they want, and if martyrs&apos; deaths occur, so be it. We probably didn&apos;t lose the cancer cure, to paraphrase Bill Hicks, and the benefits are many: people arrive early at stadiums; thugs get the aggression out of their systems in a controlled environment; fans of Middlesbrough and Manchester City are guaranteed at least some entertainment; leagues can be organised, points awarded; you could even use it to settle drawn cup ties instead of penalties (but never drawn league matches, Mr Mawhinney). This way, you can really make a difference to your club, leading to a stronger emotional attachment, and also get the aggression out of your system along the way. Nothing else is going to work. As the brawl between Chelsea and Tottenham fans outside one of my old locals recently proved, it isn&apos;t going to go away. Not for a long time.

Among those involved in the discussions were thought to be Marcus Agius, Barclays chairman, John Varley, Barclays chief executive and ABN Amro chairman Arthur Martinez.   The final terms are still some way from being agreed - demonstrated by the fact that Britain&apos;s third biggest bank is yet to have detailed discussions on the issue with the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator. As part of the negotiations Barclays has conceded that the combined group would have its headquarters in Amsterdam and would be regulated by the Dutch Central Bank.   But, the regulatory issues are far from clear. The FSA wants information about the legal and management structure of the combined entity, but said yesterday: &quot;To date, the FSA has had no substantive discussions with Barclays about the structure for the combined entity.&quot;   Shares in Barclays have risen 11% since news of the discussions emerged a week ago and ended today at 658p, up 19p.

Well, not exactly. BA&apos;s share price rose 1% yesterday, which tells you that the revolution in the skies will be more of an evolution, whatever the EU commissioners say. BA&apos;s chief executive, Willie Walsh, having raged at the injustice of it all, sounded almost cheerful as the EU approved the deal. &quot;I don&apos;t see a massive change in the market dynamics,&quot; he said, and, in the short term, he is probably right, at least as far as life at Heathrow is concerned. The hard facts are that the airport is 99% full and there is no obligation to relinquish landing slots. The juiciest route is to New York JFK and an airline needs a frequent service to be taken seriously by business travellers, the lifeblood of the likes of BA. It will be slow and expensive for rivals to Heathrow&apos;s main squatters - BA, Virgin, American Airlines and United Airlines - to build a meaningful presence. The loose piece in the jigsaw is BMI, which has a shade over 10% of the slots at Heathrow but doesn&apos;t fly long-haul to the US - yet. But it requires a leap of imagination to believe BMI will reinvent itself as a low-fare transatlantic carrier. Economy class fares to the US have fallen substantially in real terms for years and there is little meat to be picked off that bone. The battle is in business class, and it is the sustainability of the 50%-ish premium for flying from Heathrow, as opposed to Frankfurt or Amsterdam, that concerns BA. For now, with London booming as a financial centre, the line of investment bankers crossing the Atlantic is long. But in leaner years, that 50% premium will surely be chipped away. For those of us at the back the plane, \u00a3250 return to New York, which has been widely available in recent months, may be as low as it gets. After all, the next big aviation agreement could be a tax on the industry&apos;s pollution. Suits booted Here is David Jones, the man who lifted Next towards its current heights, talking in 1999 about why it would be dumb to put the chain&apos;s Directory catalogue on the web. &quot;By the time people have gone through 600 pages online we could have sent them one in the post,&quot; he said. The internet is &quot;a useful little tool&quot; but &quot;of limited use&quot;. Ho, ho. Next&apos;s online sales, naturally, are booming these days. They account for half the turnover at Directory, which last year kept the wagon rolling with an extraordinary 48% surge in profits to \u00a3144m. By contrast, comparable sales in the stores fell 7% and profits were down 4% at \u00a3317m. At this rate, profits from the two sides of the business will pass in the night sometime around 2009. Simon Wolfson, the current chief executive, intends nothing of the sort. He recognises that 7% off like-for-likes is a crisis in the making. So the stores will get a facelift and the clothes will get &quot;excitement.&quot; It was what the City wanted to hear and the shares bounded up another 7% on the principle that Next usually gets these makeovers right. But it doesn&apos;t always. Retail watchers will recall the last time Next, spiritual home of the sensible skirt and jacket, attempted excitement. There was a major profits warning in March 1998 when Mr Jones confessed to being left short of &quot;the type of merchandise which is bought by my wife and my secretary&quot;. A glance through the fashion shots provided yesterday by the company makes one wonder whether the same mistake will be repeated. To the eye untrained in fashion, the new look appears more Topshop than M&amp;S. There must be a danger of alienating core customers. We shall see. Some in the market think they smell a bid story at Next, in which case the plot changes entirely. What is certain is that M&amp;S is waking to the possibilities of online retailing and is set to launch its own assault. As Mr Jones knows, the web can be unpredictable. For Next, despite that soaraway share price, it&apos;s a risky moment. Boots suitors Shouldn&apos;t we have seen a higher bid for Alliance Boots by now? It&apos;s a fortnight since Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman, and KKR were told by the remaining members of the board that \u00a310 a share &quot;fundamentally undervalued&quot; the company. The whisper is that KKR will not return quickly, or with a big improvement in terms. It would rather like shareholders to apply pressure on chairman Sir Nigel Rudd to open the books. That is asking a lot. Sir Nigel surely won&apos;t allow himself to be strong-armed into recommending any price below \u00a310.50. If Mr Pessina won&apos;t go there, the time is approaching to get back to work - or quit. nils.pratley@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["The battle is in business class, and it is the sustainability of the 50%-ish premium for flying from Heathrow, as opposed to Frankfurt or Amsterdam, that concerns BA."], "title": "Nils Pratley: Noise of squabbling is coming from front cabin", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/23/viewpointcolumn.travelnews", "tags": ["Business", "Travel", "British Airways"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-24T00:08:43Z", "article": "1.

Among those involved in the discussions were thought to be Marcus Agius, Barclays&apos; chairman; John Varley, Barclays&apos; chief executive, and ABN Amro&apos;s chairman, Arthur Martinez. The final terms are still some way from being agreed - demonstrated by the fact that Britain&apos;s third-biggest bank is yet to have detailed discussions on the issue with the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator. As part of the negotiations, Barclays has conceded that the combined group would have its headquarters in Amsterdam and would be regulated by the Dutch central bank. But the regulatory issues are far from clear. The FSA wants information about the legal and management structure of the combined entity but said yesterday: &quot;To date, the FSA has had no substantive discussions with Barclays about the structure for the combined entity.&quot; Shares in Barclays have risen 11% since news of the discussions emerged a week ago and ended yesterday at 658p, up 19p.", "sentences": ["As part of the negotiations, Barclays has conceded that the combined group would have its headquarters in Amsterdam and would be regulated by the Dutch central bank."], "title": "Barclays and ABN hammer it out", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/24/1", "tags": ["Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-25T00:12:32Z", "article": "There is a long list of reasons why Barclays should want to bid for ABN Amro: its chief executive has ambitions to get back into the banking top 10; it is striving to increase its international operations; its management team is packed with hungry Americans desperate to make their mark on something; and it has a swagger born of being the fastest-growing British bank in 2006. The reasons why it should go for ABN Amro in particular can, however, largely be summed up in one: it is available. For all that Barclays advisers talk up the strategic logic of BarcAmro, the reality is that ABN Amro is no better a fit than any of a number of other European banks. None of the others, however, has an aggressive hedge fund breathing down its neck, pressing for a break-up of the business and the return of the proceeds to shareholders. That does not mean Barclays will get what it wants; while it is the only public suitor at the moment, most other global banks will also have worked out that opportunities like this are rare. Regardless of whether the 30 days of exclusive talks Barclays has been granted end with a merger agreement, some of these others are almost certain to muscle in. Banking analysts have been assessing which figures will add up best and, while they all come up with slightly different answers, one conclusion is universal: Barclays comes well down the list when ranked by how much international banks can afford to pay to acquire ABN. Fve other banks - including HSBC, Santander and Royal Bank of Scotland - could afford substantially more than Barclays without affecting their future earnings. Indeed, Mark Thomas, banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, thinks that Royal Bank of Scotland is very likely to make an offer, although it is more likely to be couched as an invitation to talks rather than a hostile bid. &apos;Royal Bank of Scotland has a lot more synergies with [ABN Amro&apos;s] North American business,&apos; said Thomas. &apos;And its management has the credibility of having brought in the IT integration with NatWest [which RBS acquired in 2000] ahead of budget.&apos; Barclays&apos; integration of Woolwich, which it also acquired in 2000, was poor by comparison. Barclays is clearly aware both of its likely rivals and of its inferior financial firepower: in return for the exclusive talks, it has conceded to shifting its headquarters and regulation - assuming the Financial Services Authority agrees - from London to Amsterdam. It boasts that it has kept the top jobs, with John Varley chief executive designate and its team of executives, led by Bob Diamond, likely to be responsible for integration. In truth, however, a management whose strategy has come under such fire from shareholders as Amro&apos;s was unlikely to be sticking around anyway. Barclays is already working hard to talk up BarcAmro&apos;s attractions. It is, said one adviser, the new Standard Chartered, pointing to its operations in fast-growing areas such as Brazil and Asia. Securitising ABN Amro&apos;s corporate loan book - parcelling together the individual loans and then selling them on to other investors, one of the fastest-growing parts of the financial markets at the moment - could &apos;keep Barclays Capital&apos;s securitisation department busy for months&apos;. Barclays Global Investors (BGI), the bank&apos;s fund management business, could build its relatively weak European business by selling its products through ABN&apos;s retail banking operations in Italy as well as in the Netherlands and elsewhere. Investors, however, have yet to be convinced. One fretted that the key attraction of Barclays is the rapid growth of BGI and of BarCap, its investment banking arm - the two parts of the business that would be the most exposed to the risk that integration would go wrong. Others agree: &apos;While Bob Diamond may be extremely good at driving BarCap forward, we would worry about the distraction of having to integrate, fix and, in all probability, shut down large amounts of the ABN Amro investment bank,&apos; said Antony Broadbent, banking analyst at Sanford Bernstein. &apos;This could divert BarCap from its current growth path, which we would otherwise expect it largely to maintain.&apos; Certainly, the two investment banking businesses have few similarities. While BarCap has expanded in a controlled way by adding on related products, ABN Amro offers a much broader investment banking service - including a mergers and acquisitions business and an equities business, Hoare Govett in London, both of which Diamond has so far avoided. Another shareholder wondered whether the Asian and Latin American businesses were a sufficient reason for doing a deal: he pointed out that investors could buy banking companies in these countries directly, more cheaply than Barclays&apos; proposed price for ABN - and without incurring the risks that go with mergers and acquisitions. Certainly, Barclays claims to have earned its acquisition spurs in recent years, having successfully integrated Spanish bank Banco Zaragozano and - so far - South African bank Absa. But investors point out that both of these were far smaller and simpler businesses than ABN Amro: its revenues last year were \u00a315.5bn, compared with \u00a322bn for Barclays, and the \u00a343bn or so Barclays could have to pay is only \u00a35bn less than its own market capitalisation. Barclays could try to recoup some of the cost by selling assets: LaSalle, ABN&apos;s Chicago-based retail bank, is one favourite - although its performance has been lacklustre recently, which might affect the price it could achieve. One adviser pointed out that investors were nervous about the risks of Royal Bank&apos;s acquisition of NatWest, but the cost savings from that far exceeded expectations. That was a purely British deal, however, with considerable overlap between head offices and other administrative functions. Cross-border deals are far harder to manage, particularly when they involve European companies where political sensitivities are greater than here and employment rights much stronger. And, as Bernstein&apos;s Broadbent points out, there is only limited overlap between the two businesses, which restricts the potential for cost savings: &apos;Although Banco Santander certainly seems to have had considerable success reducing costs in its own market as a result of that deal [the acquisition of Abbey National], Barclays does not enter this transaction with a particularly strongly performing retail bank. &apos;With the announcement that the combined group&apos;s head office would be in Amsterdam, and our assumption that BarCap would continue to operate out of Canary Wharf, the scope for cost savings from the complete closure of either head office also seems limited.&apos; KBW&apos;s Thomas puts Barclays&apos; chance of success at one in three, with a similar chance of a counter-offer from another bank, and a one-in-three chance that nothing will happen at all. The Children&apos;s Investment Fund, the hedge fund that is pressing for change at ABN Amro, makes it clear it expects the bank to consider all options. &apos;While TCI is encouraged by this development, which may result in creating value for shareholders, we hope that the exclusivity granted to Barclays PLC will not prevent the board of ABN Amro from employing a process that considers bids by other credible institutions in order to produce the best result for shareholders,&apos; it said in a statement. Barclays will have to hope that it can do enough to please TCI boss Christopher Hohn. The big risk is that, if its approach fails, it could end up being conquered rather than the conqueror.

The bank&apos;s Canary Wharf nerve centre will still loom large, but Varley&apos;s physical presence by the canalsides would send a powerful message that he is taking his new partners seriously.

Setting up his personal office in Amsterdam would be a signal of respect for his new partners and is designed to help allay fears in the Netherlands over handing one of the country&apos;s largest banks into overseas control. One of Varley&apos;s key lieutenants, finance director Naguib Kheraj, who was due to stand down next Sunday, is to stay on to help the bank prepare its bid. The decision to keep Kheraj on reflects the urgency with which Barclays is working to secure a deal before rival suitors can intervene. ABN has agreed to give it 30 days for exclusive talks about a deal, but there is already speculation that Citigroup of the US and fellow Dutch bank ING are considering a bid, while some banking investors believe Royal Bank of Scotland should also consider entering the fray. Many of Barclays&apos; shareholders have welcomed its interest - Guy de Blonay, who runs a financials fund at New Star, called it a &apos;once in a lifetime opportunity&apos; but said 30 days was a short time to assemble a deal. &apos;The risk is that if Barclays is not quick enough in putting a deal together, someone else with better synergies or a better valuation estimate will come in.&apos; That, he said, could put pressure on any Barclays offer for ABN - and make it a bid target itself.

Despite painful calluses and the disapproval of his children, he persists with the Rolling Stones covers until a recognisable tune at last emerges. After some expert tuition from PJ Harvey and Johnny Marr, not to mention an ill-fated attempt to sell his soul to the devil at a Mississippi crossroads a la Robert Johnson, Hodgkinson forms a band, masters the art of the psychedelic pop song and plays his gig to tumultuous applause, clad in a three-piece maroon suit once belonging to the bass player of the Who. Never has the purchase of a Fender Telecaster seemed quite so tempting. Murder in Amsterdam by Ian Buruma Atlantic \u00a38.99 When Theo van Gogh was stabbed to death by a Muslim fanatic in the streets of Amsterdam, it seemed that the Netherlands&apos; dream of a multicultural society also perished. Van Gogh was murdered for his part in the film Submission, a collaboration with Somali-born Dutch politician and anti-Islamic activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, against whom a fatwa had been declared. Buruma uses the murder as a starting point for a consideration of multiculturalism, national identity and the possibilities of tolerance in an age when adherence to religious beliefs may directly contravene the law. Scornful of political correctness, Buruma turns to the denizens of the &apos;dish cities&apos; themselves to see how incomplete assimilation creates an alienated underclass hungry for the certainties of fundamental religion. Paris by Andrew Hussey Penguin \u00a39.99 The student riots of 1968 were just one more violent uprising in the history of Paris. The City of Light has been home to agitators and provocateurs since the Middle Ages and, despite the romantic iconography, its past was often brutal and bloody. In this beguiling book, Hussey pries into the shadows, ricocheting through wars, plagues and occupations with a compelling verve. Take the tale of Francois Ravaillac, an ascetic monk who murdered Henri IV, only to be roasted and eaten by a furious mob. But Hussey is not immune to the &apos;old whore&apos;s seductive and fatal spell&apos;. Gore aside, the real pleasure lies in his ability to find traces of the past lingering in the boulevards of the contemporary city, preserved in street signs, architectural oddities and football chants. Send in the Idiots by Kamran Nazeer Bloomsbury \u00a37.99 As an autistic child, Nazeer attended a special school in New York where, in common with his classmates, he struggled to find coherence in an intolerably chaotic world. Now a policy adviser in Whitehall, he recrosses the Atlantic to see how his former companions have fared in adult life. Inevitably, not all have thrived and there is one suicide among the cohort. But this is in no way a misery memoir. Nazeer is interested in the bold and individual strategies by which each has navigated a place in the world: from using puppets to communicate difficult emotions to learning to ride a bike. Though his insights into autism are striking, what stands out is Nazeer&apos;s tenderness. As he ponders the lives of his friends, he reveals a degree of empathy as rare as it is captivating. Black Shirt by Stephen Dorril Penguin \u00a39.99 When English aristocrat Violet Trefusis met Mussolini, she dropped her bag, spilling its contents across the floor. Ever the gentleman, the dictator stooped to gather the scattered lipsticks and love letters, prompting an impressed Violet to exclaim: &apos;Oh God, why had we interfered in Abyssinia?&apos; Disturbingly, Trefusis was not the only Briton to be so seduced by the uber-masculinity and &apos;blood and soil&apos; rhetoric of fascism. In this meticulously researched biography, Dorril considers the broader question of British fascism via a damning account of the life of Oswald Mosley. These days, Mosley is mostly remembered in terms of the black-shirted rabble he roused in London&apos;s East End. In fact, his influence on British politics was considerably more extensive and his romantic and inhumane vision won over criminals and royalty alike.", "sentences": ["Murder in Amsterdam by Ian Buruma Atlantic \u00a38.99 When Theo van Gogh was stabbed to death by a Muslim fanatic in the streets of Amsterdam, it seemed that the Netherlands&apos; dream of a multicultural society also perished."], "title": "Non-fiction: Mar 25", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/25/features.review1", "tags": ["Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-25T13:20:21Z", "article": "Europe&apos;s transport ministers have finally agreed to an &apos;open skies&apos; deal with the United States, sweeping away restrictions on where EU and US airlines can fly.

My yellow jumper is also from a vintage shop in Brick Lane in east London. My purple jumper is from Fenwick, and I bought my skirt in Amsterdam - I travel a huge amount. I saw my shoes in Primark and I thought they would go really well with it. And the accessories? The brooch is made from Bakelite. It was \u00a33 from the Vintage Fashion Fair in Hammersmith. My bracelets are actually what clerks used to use to roll up their sleeves. They sell them in twos and I bought masses of them - everyone asks where they are from. They were only \u00a33 a pop. I&apos;ve seen them sold in New York for much more. How much time and energy do you spend shopping? I usually shop at the end of the day, or when I&apos;m travelling and I see something I&apos;ll nip into the shop and buy it. I&apos;m a bit of a shopaholic but I have so little time to shop, so I often buy things that I don&apos;t even try on. What&apos;s the most money you&apos;ve ever spent on clothes? Not much - perhaps \u00a3200 - because I like chopping and changing my clothes regularly. Actually it might have been much more - it was a Nicole Farhi coat. I did once buy a Nicole Farhi jacket from a thrift store in upstate New York - it was amazing - but I met Nicole at a party and I made the biggest boo-boo. I said, &quot;Do you like my jacket? It&apos;s one of yours, but I picked it up for 10 dollars.&quot; I thought, &quot;No, I shouldn&apos;t have said that.&quot; She was very nice, though, she just laughed. Do you dress differently depending on who you are with?  I suppose, a little bit. Most people in the art world wear black all the time and I like to be slightly different from that. This is the calmest I&apos;ve ever had my hair - for the last 25 years I&apos;ve always had very different hair. When the Stirling Building opened at the Tate gallery I remember having about five different colours in my hair and some people who knew me just wouldn&apos;t talk to me. They said, &quot;How could you come to something like this with hair like that?&quot; They would never say it now, but that was in the 80s. Do you think people have certain preconceptions about you because of your appearance? Possibly, but I don&apos;t want to be predictable. Often I go to the hairdresser and people wonder what I&apos;m going to come back with. I&apos;ve had to train hairdressers over the years. I tell them to treat my hair like a sculpture and paint it as well. You only live once so it&apos;s about having fun. I like looking a bit cheeky. I trained as an artist, and sometimes that comes out. I often just cut clothes or draw on them. If I had more time I&apos;d be far more inventive. Do you always were makeup? Not necessarily always during the day, though I do if I go out. I like wearing lipstick. Do you have any style icons? Hussein Chalayan. I have worked with him - I commissioned him to do a fine art piece, rather than a fashion thing. I think he&apos;s amazing. He&apos;s one of the people who can cross over from fashion to fine art. He&apos;s a thinking person&apos;s fashion designer, which I really like. On what occasion do you think you looked your best? I don&apos;t know! I&apos;m really not sure about that. Like an artist, you are always aspiring to do something better. I&apos;m 58 now but I see women who look amazing in their 80s. The extraordinary thing about fashion at the moment is that an 80-year-old can dress like a 20-year-old. Are you happy with the way you look? No. I feel far too fat. I would love to lose weight. My husband is an artist and I exercise with him and a trainer. Twice a week we gallivant around his studio but it doesn&apos;t seem to do anything. www.artwisecurators.com", "sentences": ["My purple jumper is from Fenwick, and I bought my skirt in Amsterdam - I travel a huge amount."], "title": "Imogen Fox: The close-up", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/26/fashion", "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-26T23:39:05Z", "article": "Steve McClaren&apos;s increasingly perilous position as England&apos;s manager has been dealt another significant blow after revelations that serious cracks have appeared in his relationship with Terry Venables. The problem is thought to be so bad that Venables wants talks with McClaren after tomorrow&apos;s Euro 2008 qualifier against Andorra to air his grievances. Venables has complained that he feels increasingly marginalised in his position as assistant manager and he has been disappointed by the frequency with which his tactical recommendations have been overlooked. He is said to be disillusioned and wants his role to be clarified after tomorrow&apos;s game at the Estadio Ol\u00edmpico. McClaren seemed taken aback when it was put to him yesterday, describing it as &quot;absolute rubbish&quot;, but it is known that Venables has contrasting views about the best way to take England forward. In particular, he is keen for the team to revert to a 3-5-2 system incorporating Jamie Carragher as a third centre-back. McClaren is a firm believer in 4-4-2 and had his fingers badly burned when he took his colleague&apos;s advice for the qualifying match against Croatia in Zagreb last October, a 2-0 defeat that set in motion the &quot;McClaren Out&quot; campaign led by many England supporters and several newspapers. McClaren&apos;s priority is to ensure England improve their goal difference against an Andorra side ranked No163 in Fifa&apos;s world rankings and who have already conceded 19 in Group E. Their limitations were summed up last night by one of their players, Toni Lima, declaring: &quot;If we don&apos;t get massacred, it will be a victory for us.&quot; The indication from the Football Association is that the chief executive, Brian Barwick, wants to give McClaren as long as possible in the job. However, the opposition to McClaren has become so loud and widespread it is inconceivable that the men in power at Soho Square are not considering whether they have made a dreadful mistake, one that would cost them around \u00a32.5m if they decided to sack the former Middlesbrough manager seven months into the job. It reflects badly on McClaren that his attempts to bring some discipline to the England dressing room after the scoreless draw against Israel on Saturday - the former Middlesbrough manager exaggeratedly slammed the door before remonstrating with Wayne Rooney - has apparently been a source of humour for some of the players and it will also count against him that he has been unable to form a strong working alliance with Venables. After the game in Tel Aviv the two men left the pitch separately, with 30 yards between them. Venables looked thoroughly isolated, his hands stuffed in his tracksuit pockets, and it has subsequently become apparent that he feels his role in the squad has not been as influential as he was originally led to believe. The two men will try to hammer out their alleged differences and McClaren, choosing his words carefully, spoke highly of Venables when asked yesterday if there was a &quot;rift&quot;. Having denied one, McClaren said: &quot;I brought him in because of his experience and the advice he can give to me. I take that advice on board. We talk all the time about football and this team. We are trying to get the best out of this team.&quot; Sources close to Venables, however, have indicated that the former England manager believes his advice is being ignored and is questioning whether the two men share the same philosophies about the sport. McClaren&apos;s appointment of Venables was a surprising one in the first place. They had never worked together and could not be classified as friends, and one of the few things Venables had never done in nearly 50 years in the game was work as a No2. His appointment was not an easy one for the FA to make - he left enemies behind when he finished as England manager in 1996 - and there will be consternation among Barwick and his colleagues that there are signs it is not working out. The experiment with 3-5-2 against Croatia, with John Terry playing as sweeper, was a tactical embarrassment for which McClaren, not Venables, took the blame and it is probably only to be expected that the manager is wary of taking advice to change the team&apos;s formation from 4-4-2 again. Venables has not done McClaren any favours either in his weekly column for the News of the World, particularly when he revealed after the Croatia game that Middlesbrough&apos;s winger Stewart Downing needed time out of the national team because his confidence had been shattered in the wake of criticism from the media and supporters. This was a different account from McClaren&apos;s and, when the manager faced the media before the 1-1 draw against Holland in Amsterdam last November, he was visibly embarrassed and uncomfortable when asked about the discrepancies between the two stories.", "sentences": ["This was a different account from McClaren&apos;s and, when the manager faced the media before the 1-1 draw against Holland in Amsterdam last November, he was visibly embarrassed and uncomfortable when asked about the discrepancies between the two stories."], "title": "Isolated Venables seeks urgent talks over role as cracks appear at the top", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/27/newsstory.sport", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Steve McClaren"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-27T11:25:33Z", "article": "UK hotel prices are the highest in Europe, with London room rates rising 22% last year, it was revealed today.

Researchers said the difference was down to smokers&apos; poorer underlying health and overall riskier attitude to life. Ill-health due to smoking - including lung cancer, asthma and fertility problems - is well established. As a result, the associated medical costs make up a small but important part of the total healthcare burden in developed countries - 8% in the US, 3.8% in Canada and 3.7% in Germany. The indirect costs, in terms of the loss of working days, are also a major burden for the economy. &quot;Smokers are older, less educated, have more chronic diseases, are more likely to report bad health ... compared with non-smokers,&quot; Petter Lundborg, of the University of Amsterdam, wrote in the Tobacco Control journal today. To work out a measure for this economic burden, he analysed the working records for more than 14,000 people in Sweden between 1988 and 1991. Of the sample, 45% had never smoked, 29% were current smokers and 26% were former smokers. Across the whole sample, people took an average of 25 days off every year. Those who had never smoked took an average of 20 days off a year, former smokers were close to the overall average at 25 days off, and current smokers had an average of 34 days off. When the data was adjusted for socio-economic factors and smokers&apos; poorer underlying health, Dr Lundborg found that the difference in sick days between smokers and non-smokers was eight days. &quot;The results in this paper provide some of the strongest evidence to date of the relationship between smoking and sick leave,&quot; he wrote. The link between smoking and sick leave can be explained by several mechanisms. Smokers are generally unhealthier than non-smokers, but Dr Lundborg also cited previous research showing that smokers tend to be more frequently involved in risky activities such as drinking alcohol or driving without a seatbelt. &quot;This means that a positive correlation between smoking and sickness absences may partly reflect smokers&apos; tendency to choose riskier jobs and activities than non-smokers, which, in turn, may make them more likely to be absent,&quot; he wrote. He suggested that policies to reduce or prevent smoking could make a significant impact on reducing useful working days. &quot;However, the results also suggest that much of the higher number of days of sick leave among smokers may be explained by factors other than reduced smoking-related health,&quot; he added. &quot;Further research should aim at improving our understanding of the mechanisms by which smoking correlates with sick leave. This is crucial to assess the cost effectiveness of various smoking cessation policies and the societal costs of smoking.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;Smokers are older, less educated, have more chronic diseases, are more likely to report bad health ... compared with non-smokers,&quot; Petter Lundborg, of the University of Amsterdam, wrote in the Tobacco Control journal today."], "title": "Smokers take more sick days, study shows", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/29/smoking.science", "tags": ["World news", "Science", "Work & careers", "Money", "Medical research", "Smoking", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-29T22:57:32Z", "article": "House price surge abates with rise below 10% House price inflation has fallen back below 10% this month, the Nationwide reported yesterday in the latest sign that cracks may be starting to appear in the country&apos;s long-running housing boom.

And it&apos;s pretty straightforward: there are no rules, just a few common-sense guidelines. A humus-rich ground is all-important, so compost all you can to use in following years. As for site, you might not have much choice, but light is vital: a small raised bed in full sun will be more fulfilling than a plot double the size but in shade. Always site tall crops - climbing beans, broccoli and their ilk - on the north side of other crops. Concentrate on what you like to eat and make full use of the ground by interplanting catch crops (veg such as lettuce, spinach and rocket that mature rapidly, both before your next crop goes in and after it has been harvested). Seed can be sown in modules or cell trays, and be waiting in the wings, ready to take over when other crops are spent. Try filling in gaps with herbs (chervil and dill will give you a quick crop) and companion plants such as French marigolds, which will discourage pests while encouraging pollinating insects. Vegetables are thirsty, so conserve water where you can. Planting intensively will mean there is less bare earth from which moisture can evaporate; any remaining ground can then be covered in compost or chipped bark, locking water into the soil. And don&apos;t forget to use pots: veg in containers can be very productive. Here are my top six choices for a patio, balcony or small plot: Carrots Carrots are prone to attack from carrot fly, but the flies never reach more than a foot or so above the ground, so you can beat them by growing in elevated pots or raised beds. Carrots prefer light, sandy soils and can be sown successionally (a few seeds at a time, every few weeks) in separate pots from spring onwards (I like Amsterdam Forcing and Resistafly). In the garden, sow early or late (ie, not June to August) to avoid carrot fly, and erect physical barriers to dissuade it. Or grow beetroot: much easier. Potatoes Spuds are a doddle. Chit seed potatoes now by standing them in a cool, light place in an egg box and allowing them to develop short, sturdy shoots. They take a lot of space in the open garden, but can be grown in big pots, old compost bags and even black refuse sacks. Half-fill your container with compost, push in a chitted spud and, as it starts to grow, keep topping up with compost. In the garden, cover emerging shoots with soil from between rows (this is known as earthing up). Eventually, plants will flower, and from then on the spuds can be harvested a few at a time or all at once. Salad potatoes are a good choice, because they are expensive to buy - favourites include Pink Fir Apple, Ratte, Charlotte and International Kidney. After harvesting, get in a salad crop. Salad The numero uno of home-grown veg. You can grow it as a catch crop, in containers or as baby leaves, sowing tray after tray a fortnight apart and harvesting carefully with a sharp knife. I go for spinach (pictured tied up with string), lettuce (cut and come again), mizuna and rocket. Courgettes Just two plants will yield an ample crop for months. This is a tender vegetable, so start plants in pots of compost in April and keep them on a windowsill or in a cold frame or greenhouse until after the first frosts. A strong cardboard box on plastic with a sheet of clear plastic over the top makes a good frame. Courgettes can be grown in pots, but open ground is best. Harvest while they are young, from May onwards, and keep on picking - they turn into marrows overnight. Before the courgettes go into the ground, use the space for salad or early young beetroot. Beans Runner beans can become too prolific in a small space, but climbing French beans (pictured) are less prodigious. To help retain moisture, dig a trench where you are to plant them, then fill it with newspaper and cardboard (this can be done in winter, or any time up to planting). Just before planting, cover over with soil. French beans are tender, so start them in pots under glass in April - good varieties include Rob Splash, Purple Teepee and Rocquencourt. French beans can follow leeks or other overwintering crops. When you cut them down in October/ November, leave their nitrogen-fixing roots in the ground, then sow or transplant late spinach or winter salads such as endive and mizuna. Tomatoes If you don&apos;t have a greenhouse, make sure you choose an outdoor variety. Useful in a small space are the varieties developed for hanging baskets. And remember, if you grow tomatoes in containers, watering and feeding are especially important. Start your tomatoes under cover in seed trays. You can do this in February, but now is still OK. Once two leaves appear, pot them on into 3.5-inch pots. As they get bigger, they can move into larger pots, or into the ground in late May. Try Gardener&apos;s Delight and Golden Sunrise. Three sisters bed  Follow the age-old tradition of the Iroquois people by planting a &apos;three sisters&apos; bed made up of a trio of staple crops: maize (sweetcorn), climbing beans and squash. Start all three in individual pots in April and plant out when frost is no longer a danger. First, put in the sweetcorn, planting 60cm apart on a mound. Plant a French bean close by and put the squash (or courgette) in between, in the hollow created by making the mounds. The sweetcorn and squash benefit from the nitrogen that the bean&apos;s roots release, the bean uses the sweetcorn to climb up, and the squash&apos;s leaves suppress weeds and help retain moisture.", "sentences": ["Carrots prefer light, sandy soils and can be sown successionally (a few seeds at a time, every few weeks) in separate pots from spring onwards (I like Amsterdam Forcing and Resistafly)."], "title": "Small space, big taste", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/31/shopping.gardens1", "tags": ["Life and style", "Gardens", "Homes", "Gardening advice"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-31T16:24:33Z", "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday April 3 2007  The Manchester dealership selling the Hummer car is Bauer Millett and not Bauer Mitchell as we called it at one point in this article. This has been corrected. Just when you thought the clumsy, fuel-hungry army of Chelsea tractors was reeling from higher taxes and social embarrassment, an even bigger monster is about to invade Britain&apos;s streets. General Motors has decided to launch a right-hand drive version of the American military&apos;s favourite vehicle, the Hummer, targeting UK consumers who want something large, different or just well-armoured. The H3 model is priced at a relatively modest \u00a325,000-\u00a330,000. The first of an estimated 1,000 a year was flown under wraps to Amsterdam last week from South Africa, where the cars will be made under a tax-friendly deal. It was then trucked to Manchester, home to Britain&apos;s first authorised Hummer dealer. Mitch Millett, of the Manchester dealership Bauer Millett, will lose his monopoly within the year, as four new outlets are planned: in London, Birmingham, central Scotland and probably Northern Ireland. Manchester&apos;s success with left-hand drive H3s, especially in the A-streets of Wilmslow&apos;s Wagland, has convinced the company that a market is here for the taking. Premiership footballers have been a mainstay of Bauer Millett&apos;s success, after more than 30 years of experience with other striking and &quot;different&quot; American cars. &quot;Becks bought his from my counterpart in Spain but he&apos;s used it over here,&quot; said Mr Millett, whose earlier coups include a 1977 Chevrolet Corvett sold to club owner Peter Stringfellow. &quot;We&apos;ve been getting plenty of others, and they like customising them.&quot; Recent sales, all of left-hand drive models, include one Hummer with \u00a325,000 worth of extras, including white spraypaint inside and out, and a pick-up for Bolton Wanderers&apos; star El Hadji Diouf which is entirely matt black. More than 95% of buyers have been men but the ratio may be changing; Mr Millett recently landed a prep school headmistress. &quot;They&apos;re never primary cars. They&apos;re for people who want something which is fun and different,&quot; he said. The H3s will be dramatically cheaper - and more practical - than the older H2s and especially the H1, a massive vehicle which is little different from US military workhorses in Iraq. Mr Millett has sold some of the 40 to 50 currently registered in Britain and still expresses wonder at their width. &quot;I&apos;m a tall man but if I sit in the driver&apos;s seat and stretch out my left arm as far as possible, I still can&apos;t touch the front seat passenger,&quot; he said. The H1 sells for around \u00a3120,000 when available and the H2, almost as big but a little more civilian-looking, for between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000. Lumbering along at between 18 and 24mpg, the latest Hummers appear conclusively carbon-dreadful, but their sales pitch will contest the case.

But this show from Michael Pennington sounds more original than most, combining a study of Shakespeare&apos;s life and plays with a masterclass on working with Shakespearian text.

For many people, their main experience of theatre takes place in village halls, schools and tiny theatres. The rural touring consortium does a great job of sending shows out and about, and Eastern Angles is a company which regularly gets to places that other companies don&apos;t just neglect but have probably never heard of. It has a strong regional following and should do well with this play which spans 35 years and travels from north Essex&apos;s pea fields in the early-60s to mid-90s Cambridge where high-flying academic Daryl is attending a conference on genetics. Nicola Werenowska&apos;s play considers genetic inheritance and nature versus nurture in a tale of one man&apos;s journey to find himself.LG \u00b7 Boxted And Hartest Institute, Hartest, Sat 31; Maddermarket, Norwich, Mon 2; Brentwood Theatre, Tue 3, Wed 4; Village Hall, Creeting St Mary, Thu 5 Life Of PiNewcastle upon Tyne The movie version of Yann Martel&apos;s Booker Prize-winning novel won&apos;t be hitting our screens until 2009, but Twisting Yarn gets in first with a stage version of the story of the Indian boy who sees all his family perish in a shipwreck as they attempt to travel from India to a new life in Canada. Pi manages to survive and ends up sharing a 26-foot lifeboat with an orang-utan, a hyena, a zebra and a 450lb Bengal tiger. Can Pi survive this menagerie, or will he become someone else&apos;s dinner? Martel&apos;s book is a lively and often magical meditation on religion and spirituality that can be read on many levels.

His family is horrified, but the government makes ominous moves to make it happen. Public accountability and private qualms about the morality of weapons manufacture feature prominently as Ned tangles with the might of the global arms trade.

Clearly the 20th century&apos;s intellectual heavyweight had days when he needed a little light relief. Plays about actors being actorly haven&apos;t been in fashion for a while: this one hasn&apos;t been seen since a 1990 Old Vic production directed by Sam Mendes and starring Derek Jacobi.

At first, there is nothing otherworldly about the plot; it begins with a shocking crime, a little girl&apos;s nightmares and former LAPD patrol cop Jack Whalen&apos;s search for his wife, Amy, who has gone missing in Seattle. There is also an unexpected visit from an old school friend. But as the book unfolds, the connections between the events become clearer and the reader is slowly drawn into an uncomfortable understanding that the intruders referred to in the title are not burglars breaking into houses, but invaders of the human psyche. What&apos;s impressive is that the book remains a good, taut thriller, with lots of action and a very gripping ending; Marshall takes the reader with him on the investigation with a great deal of guile and style. Scavenger, by David Morrell (Headline, \u00a319.99) David Morrell gave us Rambo in his 1972 novel First Blood (infinitely better than the film), and many subsequent bestsellers. His latest hero is the resourceful former policeman Frank Balenger, who first appeared in the thriller Creepers and is now plunged into an adventure that will delight anyone who has ever used a Playstation or X-Box joystick. Balenger and his main squeeze are kidnapped by a crazed millionaire computer-game designer and forced to play a very real game in a remote desert valley, where progressing from one level to another is full of lethal traps. The goal, if they are to survive, is to find the mysterious Sepulchre of Worldly Desires. The book is impressively researched, but I was a little disappointed for the same reason that computer games leave me cold - I am unable to suspend my disbelief when plots become so improbable that they make me want to giggle instead of hold my breath. Pictures, by Robert Daley (Quercus, \u00a312.99) Vince Conte is a disgraced former New York police captain, forced to resign after beating up his boss (for sleeping with his wife). Now divorced and working for a private security company, he is sent to a tiny European duchy, where the ruling family has been engulfed in a sordid scandal. The duke&apos;s naive new son-in-law&apos;s marriage seems to be over and he has been photographed in compromising circumstances with another woman, too. Conte is hired to find out who was behind the sexy photo-shoot; naturally, he starts by looking for the beautiful girl in the pictures, a quest that takes him to Italy and Amsterdam. The plot is a decent one and there are surprises in store for Conte. In the end the trail leads closer to home than anyone could have imagined. It&apos;s a shame the book is marred by a very clumsy, not to say ludicrous, ending. Bad Luck and Trouble, by Lee Child (Bantam Press, \u00a314.99) English-born Lee Child certainly has a flair for action, tension and a good story. But his hero, Jack Reacher, the drifter who owns nothing in the world but a folding toothbrush and the clothes he stands up in, is hard to stomach. Apart from the fact that he never shaves, seldom changes those clothes and never washes his pants, he is just too damn perfect to be even halfway believable. In this caper, Reacher hooks up with the remnants of his old army special investigations unit to probe, and exact revenge for, the deaths of four of their number who were thrown out of a helicopter. &quot;You do not mess with the special investigators&quot; is their catchphrase, and they proceed to demonstrate its meaning while also scuppering a terrorist plan to shoot hundreds of planes out of the sky. Here&apos;s a typical extract: &quot;Two against seven or more. No time. No element of surprise. A fortified position with no way in. A hopeless situation. &apos;We&apos;re good to go,&apos; Reacher said.&quot;", "sentences": ["Conte is hired to find out who was behind the sexy photo-shoot; naturally, he starts by looking for the beautiful girl in the pictures, a quest that takes him to Italy and Amsterdam."], "title": "Thrillers: Mar 31", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview22", "tags": ["Books", "Crime fiction", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-03-31T23:02:46Z", "article": "Even for Los Angeles, a city inured to violence, the double slaying of drug dealer Arthur Davodian and his girlfriend Kimberley Crayton was exceptional in its brutality. It seemed evident to the detectives who surveyed his apartment in the northern LA hills that Davodian, 22, was murdered first - stabbed 17 times in the body - before his head was severed with a butcher&apos;s precision and removed. It was found ten days later, wrapped in a carrier bag in the front yard of a Masonic lodge, by a schoolboy who was puzzled by its overpowering smell. Crayton, 21 - who suffered terrible wounds on her hands and arms - had locked herself in their bedroom while her lover died. But the killer or killers smashed down the door and dispatched her with equal ferocity. Only her baby Kaylee, aged 14 months, survived. This summer, nearly six years after his arrest, Neil Revill, a semi-blind dyslexic from Consett in Co Durham, will face a jury in the downtown LA courthouse which once hosted the trial of O.J. Simpson. He is accused of both murders and the prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. His face pasty and drawn, Revill, 33, sat in a white breeze-block room in the North Los Angeles County maximum security jail last week and gave an exclusive interview to The Observer, conducted via a video link. &apos;All these years I&apos;ve kept thinking that something was about to happen: that there would be some new piece of evidence that would make them drop the charges and set me free,&apos; he said. &apos;Maybe that&apos;s a delusion.&apos; Revill, who has no previous convictions and has always protested his innocence, spoke in the tones of middle England, his voice betraying few signs of his years in America or of his origins in the north east of England. His emotions surfaced visibly only once, when he described the effect of his being charged with a capital murder on his relationship with his mother, Brenda, and his father, Graham, a retired RAF mechanic. &apos;One good thing has come of this,&apos; he said. &apos;We&apos;ve become a lot closer. They visit whenever they can and they&apos;re going to be here for the trial, though it&apos;s expected to last four months. We were never a very close family. Now we are.&apos; This week Clive Stafford Smith, the director of the London-based human rights group, Reprieve, will write to Tony Blair, asking him to support a new petition by attorneys from the LA Public Defender office asking the prosecutors to drop their insistence on the death penalty. They will point out that the case against Revill is circumstantial and far from conclusive. There were no eyewitnesses, nor a confession, no murder weapon has been recovered, and while there were samples of Revill&apos;s DNA at the crime scene he has always said that Davodian was a friend, and that he went to his apartment as an invited guest on the night before the killings. Meanwhile, evidence has emerged that Davodian was a police informant, whose information led to the arrest of powerful figures in the Armenian and Israeli mafias - gangs whose signature punishment for snitches is decapitation. Neil Revill and his alleged victim Kimberley Crayton shared an unfortunate characteristic. Both had been lured from secure, law-abiding backgrounds to the deeper reaches of the LA drug scene, seduced by its illusory glamour. Neither really belonged. Crayton, a niece of the jazz singer Al Jarreau, was brought up amid the sunny affluence of Orange County, south of LA. Having married her high-school sweetheart and given birth to his child, she abruptly changed direction, abandoning her husband to use substantial quantities of crack cocaine and the still more powerful crystal methamphetamine. When she died, she had been living with Davodian for only a month - the last of several brief relationships that revolved around drugs. Revill&apos;s trajectory was longer and less direct. He spent several years in Germany, where his father was based: later, when he turned 18 and his father was posted to Cyprus, he elected to stay with his grandfather, a retired miner, in Consett. His dyslexia meant that his only GCSE was in metalwork, while his blindness from birth in his right eye deprived him of fulfilling his dream of following his father into the RAF. For 18 months he lived with a woman in Sunderland, working in kitchen and bathroom sales. Finally, he said, in the summer of 1996 and at the age of 23: &apos;I began to get bored and kind of upped sticks. I bought a ticket to Amsterdam and hitch-hiked to Munich.&apos; He stayed at a hostel, securing free board and lodging in return for a little work. Already in residence was a woman he would shortly marry, a slim American law student on vacation. Revill&apos;s ex-wife, now a partner in an international LA law firm, agreed to talk to The Observer on condition of anonymity. &apos;I still care a lot about him, and I guess I always will,&apos; she said. &apos;Even when we separated, I made sure we stayed friends. He was always a good guy. I can&apos;t believe he is capable of these murders, physically or psychologically. He was always so gentle. He watched out for me. And Neil is a little clumsy. He just doesn&apos;t have the kind of precision you&apos;d need with a knife to be able to sever a man&apos;s head.&apos; Davodian, meanwhile, was a muscley, tattooed strongman. At the time of the murders, Neil, who is six foot three, weighed only 11 stone. &apos;Quite frankly,&apos; his former wife said, &apos;if he had attacked Davodian, it should have been Neil who ended up on the slab.&apos; If ever a marriage were made from opposites, this was it. While his driven, focused partner completed her studies at law school, Revill made money as a rock concert roadie and as a guinea pig for drug trials. Over the following year he made several trips to visit her in America and eventually asked her to marry him. She said yes. Her parents laid on a grand wedding at their home in Athens, Georgia in November 1997. Revill and his wife lived there too for more than a year. In December 1998, the couple moved to LA - where their relationship started to fall apart. From the beginning, Revill and his wife dabbled in the club and drug scene. &apos;We were just experimenting. No one we knew was really hardcore back then,&apos; she said. &apos;It was very rare we&apos;d ever do drugs outside the weekend. But it was a big underground scene; a lot of new places were opening up. We had a lot of fun.&apos; The problem was that &apos;if you know what you&apos;re doing, LA is a little playground. But if you don&apos;t, you can easily get lost. That&apos;s what happened to Neil&apos;. While she hunted for the perfect attorney&apos;s job, he worked in a delicatessen and later sold mobile phones. When his wife began an affair, they split up in the spring of 1999, only to be reconciled before Christmas. But &apos;the spark and the trust had gone,&apos; Revill said, and they separated for good the following May. For a while he did well on his own: promoted to phone store manager, he got his own apartment, a car and a high credit rating. Two months later the US Immigration Service started asking questions about the status of his marriage, and whether he was still entitled to work. &apos;That was when my world crumbled,&apos; Revill said. &apos;I lost my job and I had a broken heart. I went on a party rampage. I took out four new credit cards, borrowed on them to the limit and blew the lot on drugs. I was already using ecstasy and speed and had tried crystal meth in small quantities. I started going on four-day binges, immersing myself in the club scene. When the money ran out, the only thing I thought I could do was to start to sell drugs.&apos; Before long, Revill was friends with Davodian, who lived in a yellow concrete condominium at 10149 Commerce Avenue in Tujunga, a scruffy, working-class neighbourhood beset by gangs. Four months before the murders, Revill was arrested, driving some of Davodian&apos;s drugs to a dealer who lived across town in Glendale. He was bailed and told to expect a sentence of six months. &apos;I thought, OK, I&apos;ll do my time, get deported, and then the party&apos;s going to be over: it&apos;s time to move on and grow up,&apos; said Revill. &apos;What worried me most was how to tell my parents.&apos; Davodian and Crayton were murdered in the early afternoon of 11 October, 2001. Revill was arrested on 22 November - the fourth anniversary of his wedding. In his 20 years as an LA public defender, Doug Goldstein, Revill&apos;s lead lawyer, has never known a case like Revill&apos;s. &apos;Usually death penalty trials are about mitigation, trying to get them life,&apos; he said. &apos;The evidence of guilt is pretty clear-cut: there&apos;ll be eyewitnesses, a confession, DNA and fingerprints. This is different. It&apos;s like a Chandler mystery. And I&apos;ve never had a client like Neil, either. He&apos;s pleasant, polite and articulate; the kind of guy you&apos;d invite home to dinner. He&apos;s goofy, kind of humble. It&apos;s very hard to imagine he did something like this.&apos; The extraordinary delay in bringing the case to trial has arisen because new evidence has regularly been discovered suggesting that someone else - probably at least two people - killed Crayton and Davodian. Each new disclosure has required further investigations by both prosecution and defence while the scientific evidence - which turns on the exact interpretation of DNA from the crime scene - is extremely complex. There was blood in Davodian&apos;s flat from at least two unknown males. And long after Revill was charged, documents emerged that showed Davodian had made dangerous enemies. Four months before his murder, he had been busted but made a deal with prosecutors known as &apos;snitch three, go free,&apos; which meant that, if he gave information that led to three successful prosecutions, he would avoid going to prison. One of the three was Revill. There was also at least one much bigger fish - Andre Bolandi, a leader of a gang called Armenian Power, and Davodian&apos;s main supplier. Thanks to his information, Bolandi is now serving a long sentence. Other witnesses interviewed by police have said that Davodian snitched on drug kingpins still further up the supply chain, including a leading figure in LA&apos;s Israeli mafia. Davodian&apos;s neighbours have cast further doubt on whether Revill is the murderer. One, who lived in the house opposite, says he heard men shouting at Davodian a day or two before the murders, including a threat to cut off his head. Michael Gregorian, who discovered the bodies, says he saw two Armenians wearing uniforms from a carpet-cleaning firm leaving the building a short while earlier. No carpet cleaners had been working there officially at the time. Finally, the man who lived and worked in the flat below the room where Davodian was killed says he saw two men entering the condo and heard sounds of a struggle. Revill said that, as the trial approaches, he is starting to feel nervous. &apos;All these years I feel like I&apos;ve shut myself down. I&apos;ve dealt with this by taking it day by day; I measure my life by the passage of each eight-hour guard shift. When I first got here, it was an enormous culture shock. Shutting myself down was the only way I could cope, especially with so many delays. But I&apos;m still optimistic.&apos; Revill might be home by Christmas. &apos;But I&apos;m not a fool. I know I could lose and be sent to death row. And if I do, I understand what might happen.&apos;", "sentences": ["I bought a ticket to Amsterdam and hitch-hiked to Munich.&apos; He stayed at a hostel, securing free board and lodging in return for a little work."], "title": "Who killed LA dealer in knife frenzy?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/01/usa.uk", "tags": ["World news", "US news", "UK news", "Los Angeles"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-01T22:34:59Z", "article": "Who says business is boring?

A report by Dutch newspaper Dagblad that investment bank Goldman Sachs had resigned as an adviser to rival Dutch bank ING sparked the talk as the Wall Street firm is regarded as having close links to RBS. Goldman, which would not comment yesterday, is closely associated with RBS as it was a key adviser to the Edinburgh-based bank during its hostile takeover of NatWest in 2000. Merrill Lynch, another investment bank, not yet linked to any other potential bidder for Abn Amro, was also a crucial adviser in the NatWest deal. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said: &quot;In the current situation, every move by advisers will receive intense scrutiny. Nine investment banks are tied up with Barclays and ABN, and this move [by Goldman Sachs] may be perceived to raise the odds of a counter-bidder. Our view remains that RBS is the most likely and it has regularly used both Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, neither of whom are currently tied.&quot; RBS would not comment but there is speculation that it may work with Spanish bank Santander, which owns Abbey, to carve up the Dutch bank. Barclays and ABN Amro are still thrashing out the terms of their combined company which they have said will be headquartered in Amsterdam and regulated by the Dutch Central Bank. John Varley, the Barclays chief executive who is expected to have the same role in the merged group, met the Dutch markets regulator AFM this week. AFM chairman Arthur Docters van Leeuwen told news agency reporters that he and Mr Varley discussed the rules that apply when making a bid for a Dutch company, among other regulatory issues. Although the AFM regulates market activities in the Netherlands, the Dutch Central Bank has regulatory authority over banks. Mr Varley is not yet thought to have held any detailed talks with Barclays&apos; current key regulator, the Financial Services Authority. ABN Amro, which is under pressure from London-based hedge fund TCI to improve its performance, has agreed to period of exclusive talks with Barclays which runs out on April 18. Barclays&apos; credit card arm Barclaycard yesterday sold off part of its Monument business, which targets customers with lower credit histories.

Barclaycard is keeping \u00a3130m of the balances - and some 100,000 customers. It is not yet clear what will happen to the 600 employees based in the Monument operation in Crawley although 250 will transfer to CompuCredit in June.

The aim: to see if it&apos;s possible to form meaningful human relationships in a technologically mediated setting. By way of research I&apos;m joining Second Life, a 3-D digital world where you interact in real time with other virtual characters. It&apos;s been in the news a fair bit recently- Radio 1 staged a gig there, Reuters have set up a news desk purely for covering &apos;In World&apos; stories and the ultra-right wing French politician Le Penn has built an office there. So it&apos;s an important marketing tool, but what&apos;s the social life like, can you even call it a social life? Only one way to find out. To get going I need to install an application which I download in about two minutes. Within moments I&apos;m taking my first tentative steps onto what looks like a tropical island. I strike up a conversation with another new arrival called Charlene Balzane. At first it&apos;s strangely real - awkward in a way it might be with any stranger - especially one of the opposite sex. Then mid-conversation - she begins staring into space and I realise the real Charlene must have stepped away from her computer perhaps to make a cup of tea, possibly to write her own blog (as I write mine). Weirder and weirder. The graphics are pretty good and there&apos;s no delay when I flick between the game and Word. Day two Today I&apos;m working out how to be a good citizen in Second Life. I&apos;ve mastered walking, running and flying, as well as gestures like waving, laughing and even dancing. I&apos;ve also worked out how to change my appearance. Now rather than being a dweeby clone of all the other guys on Orientation Island, I&apos;m sporting baggy trousers and an afro. If only thick hair and the ability to pirouette into the splits were as easily attainable in my first life. Sigh. All this I&apos;ve achieved during my lunch-hour in a caf\u00e9 round the corner from my work.

The trouble is there are so many distractions, and I haven&apos;t even worked out how to teleport to Amsterdam yet... I&apos;m going to photograph the scene and post it up on the web, just to test the Core 2 Duo processor, like. Sorted, see it here. I&apos;m the one with jeans and a white top sitting opposite the purple haired nymph. Day four I purchased a router today for my home. So for my last few days with this laptop I&apos;ll be able to access the internet while reclining in bed or sitting in the back garden. I think a month of being almost constantly wired into this machine has proved it&apos;s in my company&apos;s interest to buy one for me, at least that&apos;s what I&apos;m going to put in the next email I write when I get into work. If I&apos;m unable to edit speech by the pool, load audio in the taxi and cut film in the airport, what kind of employee am I? Day five It&apos;s around midnight BST and it&apos;s just got dark (7pm Eastern Standard Time). The radio station is now featuring an interview with one of Second Life&apos;s creators who is complaining about all the virtual paperwork on his virtual desk. Pretty good interviewee. I make a note of his name and resolve to seek him out for the programme. I should probably tidy up and go to bed, but when it&apos;s a choice between picking my daughters cornflakes off the floor and exploring a strange new island paradise, you get to understand why there are over 400,000 users logged on. That&apos;s four times the number of people you&apos;d get into Wembley stadium all shirking housework (and face to face interaction) simultaneously. Cool. Day six My girlfriend has recently set up a website for her business and as my time with this laptop comes to an end I pledge to help sharpen up her image. Trouble is my website building skills are not as good as they could be. In fact they&apos;re non-existent. If the one thing needed to save the planet from global warming was a website, I couldn&apos;t help. Still like any self-respecting male, I agree to &apos;take a look&apos;. The one thing going for me is that the domain name was purchased through a service called mrsite.co.uk which for a one off payment claims to provide the easiest DIY website package there is. An hour later we&apos;re still trying to work out how to resize the flower on the homepage and I start becoming despondent. Damn machine I say and begin muttering something about upload times. We both know the problem here is not the processor... Lara goes to bed and I struggle on, determined to make her business look a bit more bling and less budget. See the results for yourself here. Any enquiries for website design... speak to my agent. Day seven Writing a couple of proposals for Radio 4 programmes, I have my headphones on and am currently downloading realplayer which will enable me to listen to the any BBC programme from the last week. OK it&apos;s been ten minutes now and I&apos;ve yet to get Real Player up and running. Something seems to be happening whereby each time I try to use realplayer it cuts the internet connection. Which is OK if I want to listen to an MP3 file from itunes but slightly annoying for listening to web radio. However I&apos;m not going to get upset as I received some good news today (my last with this sweet laptop). My company has agreed to give me a brand new laptop to replace my dated desk-based computer - with my choice of processor.", "sentences": ["When director and presenter of &apos;Liquid Life&apos; Paul Bennun advised me to find an equivalent building &apos;In World&apos;, I assumed he was joking, until I realised he wasn&apos;t.

But it is a bright idea of the Young Vic to remind us of the Marxist magpie&apos;s vim and vigour by reviving some of his shorter plays in adjacent studio spaces; and the opening pair, in new translations by Martin Crimp and Rory Bremner, make for a cracking double bill. The Jewish Wife, one of the 24 playlets that make up Fear and Misery of the Third Reich written in the mid-1930s, is the more obviously substantial. The eponymous heroine is a bourgeois doctor&apos;s wife packing frantically to leave Berlin in the face of Nazi persecution. As she phones friends and relatives, she keeps up the pretence she is simply going to Amsterdam for a couple of weeks; and, although she tries to maintain the fiction with her returning husband, both know it is a lie. Critics often speak of the Brechtian &quot;gestus&quot;: the physical embodiment of human and social relationships. And there is a classic example here - when the heroine knows that, if her husband hands her a winter coat, it will be a tacit admission of the finality of their parting. But the power of the play lies in its metaphoric realism and its suggestion that such scenes are being enacted all over 1930s Germany. Katie Mitchell&apos;s excellent production, Hildegard Bechtler&apos;s stunningly detailed design and Anastasia Hille&apos;s wonderfully febrile performance, also bring out not just the situation&apos;s poignancy but the political anger under the evasive mask. For A Respectable Wedding we move from The Clare to The Maria, which is the Young Vic&apos;s other studio. We also move back to 1919, when the young Brecht wrote this buoyant farce about a bourgeois wedding in which everything goes disastrously wrong. The bride is three months pregnant. The groom&apos;s home-made chairs and cupboards fall apart at the slightest touch. And the insults flow freely among the rampantly disorderly guests. By updating it, Joe Hill-Gibbins&apos;s production and Bremner&apos;s translation sacrifice the period portrait of Germanic respectability. But it would be churlish to complain about a biliously funny play which, in Ultz&apos;s witty design, is set in a hideously cramped living room evoking the cabin scene in A Night At The Opera. There is also something timelessly true about the bride&apos;s father, a splendid Lloyd Hutchinson, telling ramblingly awful jokes, and the best friend, ripely incarnated by James Corden, reading out smutty poems. The orchestrated panic of a nuptial fiasco makes us laugh; and it is salutary to be reminded that Brecht, so often viewed as hectoringly didactic, was a wicked ironist with a sharp eye for bourgeois calamity. \u00b7 In rep until May 5.

Most of what will be on show has been trumpeted in advance: the restoration of many of the original 1950s design features that previous refurbishments have altered or covered up, hugely enhanced front-of-house facilities for concert-goers - including shops, restaurants and bars - and state-of-the-art accommodation for performers backstage.  What remains the biggest unknown quantity, though, is what the hall will actually sound like - whether the money spent will finally give London a concert hall with truly world-class acoustics, an auditorium that enhances great performances in the way that the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and the Musikverein in Vienna do. An improvement on what was there before seems virtually guaranteed, however. The dry, unforgiving sound of the RFH before its closure in 2005 was only tolerated by those who performed there regularly, and effectively discouraged several of the world&apos;s leading conductors from visiting London more often. Yet though designing concert-hall acoustics is big business nowadays, it still seems as much an art as a science, for all the advances in computer modelling, and the huge range of materials that can be used to modify the results. Though I&apos;m sure those who have had responsibility for fine-tuning the Festival Hall&apos;s acoustics over the last two years have a good idea of what they have produced, I&apos;d bet that until the first concert takes place with a full orchestra on stage and a capacity audience, there will be a little apprehension about whether they have got the recipe exactly right. Even if everything turns out as planned, though, it&apos;s a fair bet that not everyone will be satisfied. Britain currently has just one hall whose sound seems to get universal approval. That&apos;s Symphony Hall in Birmingham, which was exactly the right combination of analytical clarity and tonal warmth, and whose resonance can be adjusted to suit whatever is being performed. The other halls built recently in the UK have been much more hit and miss. The sound of the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester has certainly been improved since it opened a decade ago - everything is much more focused now, if still not particularly alluring. That of the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow, though, still leaves a lot to be desired, while the changes made to the Barbican in London during its recent renovation have certainly made its sound more immediate, but has also given it a rather brassy edge that can make even the most refined orchestras like the Royal Concertgebouw and the Berlin Philharmonic sound raw and raucous.

The large box contained a &quot;scary collection&quot; of articles to assist him and his Dutch partner, Ester, with the birth of their first child. Large plastic sheets, huge birthing pads, a bottle of alcohol and the alarming sounding navel streng klem (umbilical cord clamp) were among the items inside. All Dutch parents-to-be receive a similar home birthing kit from their health insurance companies. &quot;We haven&apos;t told them we want to have a home birth,&quot; says Duncan, 38, who is from Poole, Dorset, and now lives with Ester, 38, in Amsterdam. &quot;They just take it for granted that that&apos;s what everyone here wants, so they send the box.&quot; He and Ester have had misgivings, but decided to &quot;go with the flow&quot;. He says: &quot;We figure that if the insurance company, whose business is to assess risk, is encouraging you to do it at home, it must be a fairly safe option.&quot; Around 30% of births in the Netherlands take place at home, by far the highest rate in the western world, leaving Britain - with 2% - far behind. &quot;It&apos;s miraculous that we&apos;ve kept up this tradition if you look at the development of medicalisation,&quot; says midwife Beatrijs Smulders, the Netherlands&apos; leading advocate of home births, who has delivered about 5,000 babies. Much of the reason for the popularity of having baby in huis has to do with Dutch women&apos;s willingness - based, says Ms Smulders, on the protestant ethic - to &quot;take the pain&quot;. Epidurals and other forms of painkilling are frowned on and rarely administered at hospital births. At home, because of the lack of equipment to monitor the effect on a baby&apos;s heartbeat, they are not allowed. Instead, hot water and breathing exercises are all a woman has to depend on. &quot;We consider the pain to be essential to ensure that the birth process is normal,&quot; Ms Smulders says. She speaks enthusiastically of the &quot;orgasm of birth&quot; - the final rush of hormones that the woman feels as she gives the often excruciating final push, which an epidural would destroy. But the UK health secretary, Patricia Hewitt, should take note. Home birth, say its Dutch supporters, needs a proper infrastructure. It depends on a thorough screening process, on cooperation between the midwife and the obstetrician, on the proximity of hospitals so a woman can reach one quickly in an emergency, and on an efficient ambulance service. Under Dutch rules, a midwife must never be more than half an hour away from her patient. Confident, autonomous midwives with maternity aide nurses as back-up, are also vital. Central to the popularity of home births in the Netherlands are the midwives themselves. Most of the country&apos;s 2,000 midwives work independently, running their own businesses as well as delivering 120 babies each a year. Unlike many countries, in the Netherlands they are not viewed as subordinate to the obstetrician, but as competent childbirth experts. A vroedvrouw (midwife) is a woman&apos;s first port of call when she becomes pregnant, and she is the one who will see the pregnancy through until the end. Gynaecologists and obstetricians are consulted only if complications occur. Women are under strict instructions only to call the midwife when contractions are one minute long with a three or four minute interval, and have been present for two hours or more. For some this is not hands-on enough. One of the few critics is Hein Bruinse, a gynaecologist at Utrecht&apos;s University medical centre. &quot;I think midwives are too powerful,&quot; he says. &quot;They like to keep control over a birth, to the extent that they often wait too long before deciding that a labouring women should go to hospital. Often the patient and her uterus are exhausted and we have no option but to give her an epidural, use forceps or even do a caesarean so she can deliver safely.&quot;", "sentences": ["At an antenatal class in south-east Amsterdam, Petra de Buins tries to persuade her students of the advantages of home birth.", "&quot;We haven&apos;t told them we want to have a home birth,&quot; says Duncan, 38, who is from Poole, Dorset, and now lives with Ester, 38, in Amsterdam."], "title": "Midwives central to Dutch belief home is best", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/apr/07/health.medicineandhealth", "tags": ["Health", "Politics", "Life and style", "Society", "UK news", "Midwifery"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-07T23:00:50Z", "article": "What will Fred do? The City is obsessed with the question of whether Sir Fred Goodwin, the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, is about to gatecrash the planned \u00a380bn merger between Barclays and ABN Amro. At Barclays, people have been pondering whether Goodwin might be placated if they could sell him ABN&apos;s Chicago-based outfit, LaSalle, which is the most tempting part of the business for the Scotsman. Goodwin is unlikely to move in haste, and almost definitely not before Barclays&apos; exclusive talks with the Dutch runs out this month. Those with long memories will recall that it took him two full months to barge in on Bank of Scotland&apos;s bid for NatWest back in 2000. His technique then was to stand back and allow the frontrunner to pile up some mistakes, and only then to show his hand. If he does move, I expect it to be a hostile bid. It is hard to imagine he would countenance the concessions Barclays has made to the Dutch - in particular, chief executive John Varley&apos;s agreement very early in the game to move his headquarters to Amsterdam, out of respect for national sensitivities in the Netherlands. No, there is only one place for Fred&apos;s HQ, and that is its vast modern campus in Edinburgh. The idea of retaining some senior ABN Amro management, as Barclays is proposing, would also be anathema. On past form, he would view keeping on the Dutch executives, who are responsible for its weakened state, as tantamount to leaving the foxes in charge of the henhouse. At NatWest there was a management purge, with the highly respected Gordon Pell, the only man left standing. Goodwin has previously signalled to shareholders, who were rattled by his foray into China a couple of years ago, that he was not plotting more mega-deals. But the Chinese venture has so far been a great success, and opportunities like ABN Amro do not come up every day. One much-mooted possibility is for him to team up with Banco Santander of Spain, which helped him win the battle for NatWest. The two banks have a very close relationship and until recently held reciprocal shareholdings and seats on each other&apos;s boards. Although the cross-shareholdings have been unravelled, Goodwin still has a personal friendship with Santander chairman Emilio Botin and its dealmaker-in-chief, Juan Inciarte, and was recently to be found trying out the golf course at the Spanish bank&apos;s grandiose new corporate nerve centre near Madrid. The thinking is that the pair would divide the spoils. Chicago-based LaSalle is a good fit with Goodwin&apos;s existing American interests, and he would also be keen on its European corporate banking. Santander, which has a huge presence in Latin America, would scoop up ABN&apos;s Brazilian operations and its Italian assets. A trickier question is what would be done with the Dutch retail banking side, which is not an obvious tempter for either. If Goodwin did bid, he would probably face competition, not only from Barclays but possibly from the likes of Bank of America, or Citigroup. The latter is advising Barclays, but not everyone is convinced that will rule it out. Much has been made of the fact that Goldman Sachs, which advised RBS on the NatWest takeover, has positioned itself so it can act for Goodwin in a bid this time. Merrill Lynch, the other NatWest adviser, is also free. The stage may have been set for a repeat performance, though it is always possible the City audience could be waiting for Godot. The leading man will certainly not be in any rush to make his big entrance. Sainsbury sums up Lord Sainsbury may have dealt a fatal blow to the private-equity takeover bid for the supermarket chain that bears his name. The bidders are ranged against the might of the Sainsbury family and the pension trustees, who are demanding huge sums for the retirement fund. If the bidders are sent packing, Sainsbury will have to prove that anything the private-equity consortium can do, it can do better. Lord S reckons the consortium could unlock \u00a31.6bn of value if the business grows at a rate of 5 per cent for four years, of which they would take \u00a3500m in fees. He sees no reason why the whole lot should not go to existing shareholders instead. The implication is that he envisages the group will leverage its property portfolio, just as the consortium would have done. It is intriguing to speculate on what might be the role in this of Robert Tchenguiz, the property entrepreneur with a 5 per cent stake. It could also result in the group having to inject more cash into its pension fund, since the new corporate structure would weaken the covenant to pensioners. But perhaps the trustees will be more amenable with the company than they have been with the private-equity bidders.  Brown hindered when he should have helped I have been writing about the harmful effects of Gordon Brown&apos;s 1997 pension tax raid ever since it happened - long before it became fashionable to fulminate on the subject. After initial fury over revelations that he acted against expert advice, there has been a backlash in the Chancellor&apos;s favour, suggesting the \u00a35bn a year he creamed off is a mere gnat-bite compared with other problems: longevity, costly new regulation and accounting rules that put a spotlight on shortfalls. The reality, as I see it, is this. His removal of the tax concession - which incidentally, also hurts charities - sent a message to companies that he was no great respecter of pensions. That gave another excuse to executives worried about costs to ditch their schemes. Brown knew, or should have known, that funds were under strain. It is no secret that people are living longer, or that there are regulatory and accounting issues. Yet instead of helping, he added another negative. It is true that his tax-grab was not the only, or even the most important, factor in the wholesale collapse of final salary pensions in this country. But it still showed reckless disregard for funds and their members.", "sentences": ["It is hard to imagine he would countenance the concessions Barclays has made to the Dutch - in particular, chief executive John Varley&apos;s agreement very early in the game to move his headquarters to Amsterdam, out of respect for national sensitivities in the Netherlands."], "title": "Ruth Sunderland: Will Fred be an unwelcome guest at the ABN party?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/08/observerbusiness.royalbankofscotlandgroup", "tags": ["Business", "Royal Bank of Scotland", "Fred Goodwin"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-07T23:17:03Z", "article": "Barclays is mulling a sale of ABN Amro&apos;s US division to Royal Bank of Scotland, in the hope of averting the threat of a rival bid from RBS boss Sir Fred Goodwin for the Dutch bank. Goodwin has not yet indicated whether he intends to gatecrash Barclays&apos; \u00a380bn planned merger with ABN. But those inside the Barclays camp believe the main prize for him is LaSalle, based in Chicago. &apos;That is the thing Fred wants,&apos; said a source. &apos;If he can get that anyway, why should he bother getting involved in a fully blown bid?&apos; There has already been speculation that Barclays would seek to offload LaSalle. However, RBS would not have a clear field. Others, including Bank of Montreal, are thought to be interested, and it would not be feasible - or ethical - for Barclays to stitch up a sweetheart deal with Goodwin. Barclays&apos; chief executive, John Varley is thought likely to take full advantage of a 30-day grace period during which he is holding exclusive talks with ABN. Sources said the exclusivity period might be extended until 26 April, when both Barclays and ABN have their annual meetings. The Barclays bid team is poring through ABN&apos;s books, looking at where it can make cost savings and boost revenues. This is a complex and time-consuming process, but the British bank is under pressure to put a firm offer on the table before too long, or it will appear to have lost the initiative. ABN wants to be able to make an announcement ahead of its shareholder meeting, where it faces calls for a break-up or an auction from dissident shareholders led by hedge fund TCI. Another investor on its register is hedge fund Tosca, which bought a stake around two years ago and now holds around two per cent. Its chairman is George Mathewson, who previously held the same position at RBS. Fred Watt, until recently RBS&apos;s finance director, is also at Tosca. Both men were close associates of Goodwin. RBS has refused to rule out a bid for ABN. Analysts believe the Scots might participate in a joint assault with Banco Santander of Spain. Any such move would be looked upon with fear both by Dutch trade unionists and ABN&apos;s management. Barclays has gone out of its way to make concessions, including a pledge by Varley to base his personal office in Amsterdam, in the hope of shutting out other bidders. Varley has held a number of meetings with Dutch central bank president Nout Wellink and believes he will get a green light from regulators. ABN would be highly unlikely to receive such kid-glove treatment from Goodwin or Santander. The prospect of a counterbid is likely to drive up the price Barclays will pay, but Varley has indicated he will walk away rather than shell out too much. Barclays has been in on-off talks over a merger with ABN for several years. They were rekindled in January when Varley met his Dutch counterpart, Rijkman Groenink, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and then a week later in Geneva. However, TCI is keeping the pressure on ABN to leave its doors open to all bidders, to ensure it is sold at the highest possible price, rather than tying up a cosy merger with Barclays. The merger plan is a high-stakes game for Varley, who has been seen by some in the City as living under the shadow of his talented head of investment banking, Bob Diamond - who, with a \u00a322m paypacket, earns far more than his boss. Failure would leave Varley&apos;s job on the line, and the bank vulnerable to a takeover.", "sentences": ["Barclays has gone out of its way to make concessions, including a pledge by Varley to base his personal office in Amsterdam, in the hope of shutting out other bidders."], "title": "Barclays mulls  sale in US to head off Fred", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/apr/08/business.accounts", "tags": ["Money", "Business", "Current accounts", "Savings"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-07T23:25:06Z", "article": "British Airways boss Willie Walsh has a thorny issue to consider this Easter - what to do about Iberia. The company is examining the structure of Air France/KLM as a template for a possible merger with the Spanish airline. The UK flag carrier is maintaining a neutral position on whether to forge a deal with its Spanish counterpart or to sell the 10 per cent stake it holds in the carrier. But its adviser, UBS, is looking at whether adopting the complex structure that brought together the French and Dutch airlines in 2004 could allow a UK-Spanish deal. Iberia has made it clear that it is open to offers and is expected to authorise opening its books to US private equity group TPG at a board meeting on Wednesday. TPG last month tabled a $4.5bn offer for the Spanish carrier and has made contact with BA to see if it is interested in joining a bid. UBS is understood to have had approaches from other private equity funds since then. TPG&apos;s approach for Iberia is seen as the first significant move in a long-awaited restructuring of Europe&apos;s aviation sector. BA has long had close operating links with Iberia, but even as the two carriers&apos; relationship deepened, BA was always keen to emphasise a bid was not on the cards. That may change now. The attraction of Iberia is the position it holds in routes between Europe and Latin America. Some 42 per cent of its revenues come from long-haul traffic. The key problem for bidders is that ownership rules mean the airline must remain in Spanish control for the bilateral treaties that permit these valuable long-distance services to remain valid. Similar concerns led to the construction of the complex organisational superstructure that governs Air France/KLM. It comprises a holding group with two subsidiaries - the two airlines. Although Air France is dominant, the structure ensures that control of the KLM subsidiary remains Dutch. It is this arrangement that UBS is examining. Despite reports that BA&apos;s chief executive, Willie Walsh, has ruled out a deal, BA maintains that it is considering all options. TPG has bid \u20ac3.60 (\u00a32.45) a share. Some analysts reckon BA could afford \u20ac4, although they also warn that Iberia is exposed to low-cost competition on its short-haul routes. Iberia&apos;s shares finished last week at \u20ac4.03, suggesting investors expect a higher offer. However, others point out that the Air France/KLM deal was criticised for creating an overcomplicated group without the synergies that might be expected, and for not being in the interests of shareholders. BA&apos;s investors would be unlikely to sanction such a move. One analyst says: &apos;To make it work you would need to make big changes to working culture. Iberia has a heavily unionised workforce, so would Willie Walsh want to add foreign industrial relations problems to those he has at home?&apos; Regardless of the outcome, TPG&apos;s approach is seen as only the first move in a round of European consolidation. Now most airlines are considered &apos;in play&apos;, either as the buyers or targets. Aer Lingus last autumn attracted an unwanted approach from Irish rival Ryanair; Alitalia, the Italian carrier, is in the middle of an auction process that has attracted three sets of bidders (including TPG and Aeroflot) that will conclude in July; and privately owned UK carrier BMI has been linked with both BA and Virgin in recent weeks. The trigger to the bidding frenzy is that, until last month, airlines considered that the strict regulations surrounding route rights and ownership acted as a block to consolidation. Last month&apos;s &apos;open skies&apos; agreement between the US and EU meant restrictions in these areas began to be removed. Before March, only four airlines - BA, Virgin and US carriers United and American - were allowed to fly between Heathrow and the US; now all European carriers can. This has been seen as a long-term threat to BA that might prompt it into some kind of &apos;strategic&apos; response - such as a merger with Iberia. Also, the rules restricting control of airlines to owners of the same nationality as the carrier have been relaxed to allow ownership within the EU as a whole (although this rule does not apply to Iberia&apos;s Latin American routes). Analysts are divided over the impact open skies will have. One says: &apos;It changes nothing except it opens up Heathrow, and therefore BA, to competition.&apos; Another says: &apos;Ownership rules will allow deals between European carriers that would have been impossible before.&apos; On top of this, analysts believe the aviation cycle is peaking. In a recent note on BA, Andrew Lobbenberg of ABN Amro said: &apos;The threat from open skies arrives at a time when we are very cautious about network airlines. We think we are at the top of the cycle for corporate travel and that premium traffic growth will slow in 2007.&apos; None the less, other carriers, such as Lufthansa and Air France/KLM, have indicated they want to play their part in the drive for consolidation, and Europe&apos;s mid-sized airlines - such as Aer Lingus - could be in their sights. The most enticing target now, however, is BMI, seen as the big winner from open skies because it owns some 12 per cent of the take-off and landing slots at Heathrow. These can now be deployed for lucrative transatlantic traffic. A spokesman for Sir Michael Bishop, BMI&apos;s owner, says he does not want to sell. But BMI is 30 per cent owned by Lufthansa and Bishop has a &apos;put option&apos; - the right to sell at a pre-determined price - with the German carrier that runs out at the end of the year. After that, Lufthansa can &apos;call&apos; the shares - force a sale at a fixed price. So there is likely to be activity over the capital structure this year, if only to renegotiate these arrangements. That could lead to Bishop rethinking his determination not to sell. Alternatively, Bishop could offer capacity to Lufthansa - they are both part of the Star Alliance group of carriers - and &apos;code share&apos; on Heathrow-to-US routes. Beyond Lufthansa and BMI, analysts point to the Skyteam alliance, in which Air France/KLM has a total of 27 London slots operating to Paris, Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Allowing alliance partners Delta, Northwest and Continental to make use of these for transatlantic routes is seen as a logical next step by Air France executives. For BA, the key partner is American, but its current pre-eminence at Heathrow, makes slot trading unlikely now. BA faces perhaps the most difficult decision of any EU airline. A loser from open skies, its rationale for consolidating is at least as compelling as for others - yet the issue arises just as BA is moving operations to a new terminal, with all the technical and industrial relations risks that poses.

A 55m-high nest of red-brick flats, it is the most dominant - and provocative - new building on Marcanti Island in Amsterdam&apos;s up-and-coming Westpark district. Its twin ziggurats rise from a low tide of dull grey 20th-century apartment housing in an area that was once industrial and productive, and is now home to some of the Dutch city&apos;s hippest nightclubs, as well as choice flats. Well off the tourist track, the building is, nevertheless, a very good reason for a trip out to this distant neck of Amsterdam. The Pyramid certainly makes you smile. It is at once a flag-waving tribute to traditional Dutch housing - that suggestion of stepped gables - and to the spirit of a far more ancient architecture, as well as a way of saying: &quot;Just look at the low and dreary new Dutch housing all around me.&quot; Dutch housing of the past decade has been held up as the very model of modern - and modest - domestic design. Architecture magazines worldwide are brimming with the stuff. I&apos;m pretty sure that, like wholemeal bread and low-fat cottage cheese, it&apos;s somehow good for you; yet it seems so very glum, a goody two-shoes architecture in danger of being not just a little too pleased with itself, but plain dull. In the 1980s, the predecessor to this matter-of-factness was a wave of candy-coloured postmodern housing that saw architects plundering architectural history, dressing up otherwise straightforward blocks of offices and flats in coats of too many colours, and more ornamentation than even a Russian princess could bear. The Pyramid might seem a little postmodern at first glance, yet its highly resolved form, unified colour scheme and crisp character suggest it is something else again. Its architects, Soeters Van Eldonk, suggest, in an Alice in Wonderland way, that it might be &quot;unmodern&quot;. This idea of unmodern architecture has been fiercely debated in the Netherlands in recent years. Since the mid-1990s, an increasing number of Dutch architects and other Europeans with commissions in the country have been struggling, with occasional success, to find a new voice for Dutch buildings - an antidote to the safe, flat neo-modernism that steals all those pages in the magazines. Sjoerd Soeters, who set up in practice with his wife Merle Soeters-Stefels from their Amsterdam flat in 1979, believes the problem with a lot of contemporary architecture is its sameness. Consistency of style, he believes, is a misguided if well-intended limit on the architectural imagination, making new quarters of cities increasingly uninteresting. Soeters believes, instead, in what he calls &quot;flexible response&quot;. An opera house shouldn&apos;t look like a railway station; a block of flats shouldn&apos;t be mistaken for an office block; a house in Amsterdam should be different from one in Groningen. No one can accuse Soeters and his design partner, Jos van Eldonk, of failing to put theory into practice. In recent years, his 80-strong practice, based in a converted church, has conjured a galaxy of unexpected designs. In Heerenveen, he has created apartment blocks in a park based on French-influenced plans drawn from the era of Louis XVI; two blocks boast cartoonish cut-out metal swans gliding along their parapets. In Noord-Holland, he has built a farmhouse-style villa that belongs both to the distant past and to today. In Den Bosch, he has shaped a block of flats in the guise of a castle (although perhaps this contradicts his own belief that one building type should not be mistaken for another). The Pyramid is the most striking of this extraordinary assortment, in turns questionable, bizarre and decidedly clever. Interestingly, Soeters suggests that the chance to enliven new Dutch housing has come about through the swing from public to private commissioning. Throughout much of the 20th century, the public sector led the way in housing; while much of this was dryly modern, it was about as much fun as sitting through King Lear in Dutch. And yet the most intriguing and colourful apartment blocks ever built in Amsterdam were by the public sector, for blue-collar workers. Designed by the precociously talented Michel de Klerk in 1917, Het Schip (The Ship) was the third of a trio of extraordinary blocks of council flats. Why the name? Well, perhaps this block does look a little like a ship; but, more importantly, De Klerk insisted it was built to the same quality as the great Dutch merchant ships of the past, because the block was home to shipbuilders and railway workers. Soeters has learned a lesson from De Klerk. Like the Ship, the Pyramid rises from a triangular site, and offers gardens, daylight and views to all its inhabitants. The Ship, however, was savaged by Holland&apos;s earnest young moderns. Its spire, which served no obvious purpose other than to draw attention to itself, was denounced as irrelevant and decadent, its swooping tiled roofs branded anachronisms, and its rich detailing considered gratuitous. De Klerk&apos;s point, though, was this was a home rich in beautifully crafted design details, appropriate for highly skilled working-class residents who, he believed, deserved such special treatment. The Ship incorporates a school and a post office as well as communal gardens and superb, warm, imaginative architecture. It stands as a riposte to those who say it doesn&apos;t matter what housing for ordinary people looks like as long as it is warm and dry. A bit of &quot;unmodernism&quot;, though, may well be necessary as a corrective to the march of bland global &quot;nothingness&quot;. If the whole of Marcanti Island was covered in ziggurats, it would look a little bonkers; but, rising like the housing equivalent of a lighthouse, or silo, or church, or civic monument, the Pyramid adds some real spirit to this grim-looking waterside stretch of Amsterdam. And lucky are those who will live there. There are 114 underground parking spaces for the 82 apartments. Each has its own balcony roof garden. From the sixth floor up there are views right across Amsterdam, all the way to the sea, where those mighty merchant ships once set sail.", "sentences": ["A 55m-high nest of red-brick flats, it is the most dominant - and provocative - new building on Marcanti Island in Amsterdam&apos;s up-and-coming Westpark district.", "Well off the tourist track, the building is, nevertheless, a very good reason for a trip out to this distant neck of Amsterdam.", "Sjoerd Soeters, who set up in practice with his wife Merle Soeters-Stefels from their Amsterdam flat in 1979, believes the problem with a lot of contemporary architecture is its sameness.", "An opera house shouldn&apos;t look like a railway station; a block of flats shouldn&apos;t be mistaken for an office block; a house in Amsterdam should be different from one in Groningen.", "And yet the most intriguing and colourful apartment blocks ever built in Amsterdam were by the public sector, for blue-collar workers.", "If the whole of Marcanti Island was covered in ziggurats, it would look a little bonkers; but, rising like the housing equivalent of a lighthouse, or silo, or church, or civic monument, the Pyramid adds some real spirit to this grim-looking waterside stretch of Amsterdam.", "From the sixth floor up there are views right across Amsterdam, all the way to the sea, where those mighty merchant ships once set sail."], "title": "Jonathan Glancey discovers new Dutch architecture", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/apr/09/architecture", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-09T15:22:31Z", "article": "Preamble Hello. Most people think life is about what is, what was and what will be. But as any student of self-loathing will tell you, it&apos;s really about what might have been. Look at today: we could be anticipating a humdinger that goes by the name of Pakistan v New Zealand; instead we await a contest whose result we know already. This is not to belittle the Irish, an honest team not without talent etc etc; it&apos;s just a fact. We all celebrated their victory over Pakistan, and Bangladesh&apos;s over India, but really we were wrong to do so. In sporting terms, romance is dead - cup upsets are a bad thing because they mean that the integrity of the later rounds, the big stuff, is often irrevocably compromised, as we saw at the last World Cup, the football World Cup of 2002 and the FA Cups of 2004 and 1992. Sporting tournaments are not unlike orgasms: for the majority there can only be one real peak of excitement and, while it is human nature to want that to moment to come as soon as possible, the fact is that the longer you wait, the bigger the thrill. What is better: a giant-killing or a seismic contest between two superpowers in a later round? (For example, had Zimbabwe beaten Australia in the Super Sixes in 1999, as they threatened to at one stage and as the whole of England desperately wanted them to, we would not have had the semi-final between the Aussies and South Africa). All of which is a farcically long-winded way of saying that, on this deliciously sunny Easter Monday, I wish I was nursing a pint of Irish cider rather than cursing the sight of the Irish side, er. While you wait Why not read The Spin, Lawrence Booth&apos;s peerless weekly cricket email? Or have a listen to our half-decent World Cup podcast? Sickening news New Zealand, in my opinion the only team that can stop Australia winning this whole thing, have won the toss and will bat first, which means we will almost certainly get the full 100 overs. It makes sense in terms of giving their batsmen time in the middle, but what&apos;s more important: the World Cup or me getting home at a decent hour to watch the second half of Intolerable Cruelty? Presactly. Ireland team Bray, Porterfield, Morgan, O&apos;Brien (wk), O&apos;Spin, White, Gillespie, O&apos;Brien, Johnston (c), McCallan, Langford-Smith, Rankin. New Zealand team Fulton, Fleming (c), Marshall, Styris, McMillan, Oram, McCullum, Vettori, Franklin, Bond, Patel. Things that make you go grrrrr Watford 4 - 2 Portsmouth 2 - 1 Manchester United. It&apos;s not a funny old game; it&apos;s a bitter and twisted one. 1st over: New Zealand 0-0 Right, let&apos;s get this wake started. Langford-Smith gets some early swing on a blissfully sunny day in Guyana, and his fourth ball curves beautifully past the groping Fulton, who was on the walk but beaten completely. A maiden, and a very good one. &quot;Something to talk about,&quot; says Damon Gough, aka Paul Rawes. &quot;Words whose use should merit an instant custodial sentence or, at the very least, ostracism.&quot; I&apos;ll start: dystopian. 2nd over: New Zealand 6-0 The gangling Rankin, who&apos;s had an excellent tournament (combined figures of 7 for 86 against Pakistan, England and South Africa), bowls a fairly ragged first over, including three wides and a flurry of singles. &quot;What do you reckon our chances are of actually getting to the semis now?&quot; says Hackett spokeswoman Rachel Clifton. &quot;I have this horrible feeling that the Windies will manage to rouse themselves to beat us, if no-one else ...&quot; The perverse thing is that England could conceivably qualify by winning only two of the remaining three games, and three out of seven overall. The World Cup has been a benevolent parent to them: no matter how many times they do something really bad, they are always forgiven and offered another chance. 3rd over: New Zealand 10-0 Dystopian stuff in Guyana, as New Zealand quietly assert their superiority by negating the swing of Langford-Smith with some diligent forward thrusts. &quot;Afternoon Rob (have I beaten Naylor?),&quot; begins Andy Bradshaw, who has. &quot;If we&apos;re allowed to discuss England, can I start the witchhunt to get Kevin Shine removed as a bowling coach and replace him with someone who can actually improve our bowlers? I mean Mahmood is a great prospect but he&apos;s not improved that much since he came into the clutches of Shine.&quot; It&apos;s difficult to criticise specialist coaches - how do we know what work they do? - but it&apos;s nonetheless fairly reasonable to assert that Cooley was brilliant, maybe the biggest factor in our Ashes victory, and that Shine has, ironically, taken the gloss off a number of raw talents such as Anderson and Mahmood. Not only are they pretty ineffective, they are becoming automata. 4th over: New Zealand 19-0 Rankin is taking the Harmison comparison too far with some errant stuff, and when he pushes one too full Fulton times it through midwicket for the day&apos;s first boundary. Then he repeats the shot later to conclude the over. &quot;Custodial words,&quot; begins Micah Ayache. &quot;Obloquy,&quot; Oh don&apos;t be so obloquial. 5th over: New Zealand 30-0 Fulton (20 from 23 balls) is flying at the moment, and creams Langford-Smith through mid-off for another boundary. &quot;Nuts to seismic battles late in the contest,&quot; says Rupert Good. &quot;I&apos;d take an early drop-out for the Aussies over giving them the World Cup any day. Particularly today. Smug mothers.&quot; He didn&apos;t say mothers but, y&apos;know. WICKET! Fleming c Porterfield b Rankin 10 (New Zealand 35-1) Rankin is not quite in Scott Boswell territory, but he&apos;s moving towards the relevant zip code: after one leg-side wide - his fifth - the next ball is a shocker, and would have been an off-side wide had Fleming not flailed at it and sent it flying to third man off the toe of the bat. And then, from nowhere, he takes a wicket. It wasn&apos;t much of a delivery, well wide of off stump, but Fleming went reaching for it again and skewed a drive to point, where Porterfield took a sharp catch. Well well. 6th over: New Zealand 38-1 Rankin looks a bit like Bela Lugosi after an incident with a cattle prod. Dead eyes and flushed cheeks. &quot;I disagree with your comments on the minnows, tongue-in-cheek or not,&quot; says Sam Blackledge. &quot;If we never allowed teams like Ireland to play in tournaments like this, they would never grow. People seem to have forgotten that Sri Lanka were an international joke at the end of the 1980s, then they went and won the World Cup in &apos;96 and have a pretty good shot at doing it again this year.&quot; I&apos;m not saying they shouldn&apos;t be allowed to play, I&apos;m just saying that we should be careful what we wish for: we celebrate giant-killings without thinking of the consequences. Korea 2002 is a perfect example. I hooted my oversized strawberry-blond head off when South Korea beat Italy; I also slept through the semi-final because we all knew they had no chance of winning. A great semi-final/final &gt; a memorable giantkilling. Fact. 7th over: New Zealand 46-1 The two batsman, Marshall and Fulton, are, as Ian Smith points out, playing for one position when Ross Taylor is fit again, so watch out for a hilarious run-out. No need to run there, however, as Marshall square-drives Langford-Smith really crisply for four. Two balls later he leans into another beautiful drive, this time through extra-cover, and it skids away for four more. Too full from Langford-Smith; too good from Marshall. &quot;Words whose use should merit an instant custodial sentence or, at the very least, ostracism,&quot; says Kate McDonald. &quot;Automata.&quot; Droll. Real droll. 8th over: New Zealand 50-1 (Fulton 23, Marshall 11) A decent over from Rankin is ruined by the last ball, a leg-stump shocker that Fulton lifts up and over square leg for four to bring up the fifty. &quot;Attention: Winner,&quot; says Jose Luis and, while the contents of his email suggest it is spam, the stunning insight of those first two words makes me think otherwise. 9th over: New Zealand 53-1 Marshall, who with his corkscrew curls looks a little like Juice Terry of Irvine Welsh fame, or so I would imagine, back-cuts a couple in an over that brings three. 10th over: New Zealand 57-1 Johnston replaces Rankin and his first ball, a full leg-cutter, beats Marshall&apos;s almighty flail. That&apos;s as good as it gets, however, and New Zealand&apos;s gentle progress continues. It&apos;s fairly sleepy stuff, like that &apos;Kevin Finnerty&apos; episode of the Sopranos. What the marmite was that all about? &quot;&apos;If we never allowed teams like Ireland to play in tournaments like this, they would never grow,&apos; says Sam Blackledge And the female viewers would never be allowed the pleasure of rejoicing in the beauty that is Boyd Rankin,&quot; says Kate McDonald, lustily pawing her laminated picture of Frankenstein. &quot;PS Are you really a strawberry blonde, Rob, or just a plain old ginger trying it on?&quot; I&apos;m not a girl, Kate. WICKET! Marshall c Morgan b Langford-Smith 16 (New Zealand 59-2) What a miserable piece of cricket from Marshall. He was restless after four dot balls in five and went flying down the pitch to carve one over the covers. But he didn&apos;t get hold of it at all - it was just too short for that shot - and Morgan at cover took an awkward, leaping catch with aplomb. Well bowled by Langford-Smith, who dragged his length back after a bit of a mauling earlier on, but it was a shocking shot. 11th over: New Zealand 59-2 Sky have just put up an interesting statistic: before this tournament, the World Cup with the highest strike-rate was ... 1987. Bizarre. How can we explain that? 12th over: New Zealand 62-2 (Fulton 27, Styris 3) The new batsman Styris times his first ball down the ground for a couple. Then Fulton is almost done by a slower grubber from Johnston that went just wide of his off stump. Had it been straight, he was a goner. &quot;Discombobulate,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;That&apos;s not a contribution, it&apos;s an instruction (especially to Ponting).&quot; 13th over: New Zealand 66-2 Nearly another one for Ireland: Styris threw the toilet sink at a delivery from Langford-Smith that started wide and swung wider, but his edge flew through the vacant first-slip area and away for four. No slips. &quot;Your fault,&quot; says Aamir Sohail as the camera homes in on an aggrieved Trent Johnston. But New Zealand are skittish here and they will be thankful for the sober presence of Fulton, who is playing both to win this game and to cement a place in the team. &quot;What tosh is being talked about concerning strike rates,&quot; spits Gary Naylor. &quot;The reason that strike rates have risen in the last few World Cups are: (i) shorter boundaries; (ii) powerplays; (iii) more Associate Members involved; (iv) bat technology; (v) massed ranks of medium pacers; (vi) bouncer rules; (vii) wides called for anything down leg-side; (viii) wicketkeepers who are really batters with gloves on.&quot; So how do you explain 1987, then? 14th over: New Zealand 70-2 Sublime shot from Fulton, who walks into a full delivery from Johnston and times it wide of mid-on for four. &quot;Surely the sight of Boucher, Nel, Gibbs et al looking sick as parrots after they got gubbed by the mighty Bangladesh is worth sacrificing a few (hundred) games between the more established countries?&quot; says Paul McMillan. You make a decent point. Has a schadenfreude sandwich ever tasted as good as it did on Saturday night?  15th over: New Zealand 73-2 Dean Sinclair has put Barnet 2-0 up against Rochdale. &quot;&apos;So how do you explain 1987, then?&apos;&quot; says Kate McDonald. &quot;Gingers.&quot; You should do stand-up, you. 16th over: New Zealand 81-2 Fulton pirouettes to pull a short one from Johnston through midwicket for four, and then skims another past point. He&apos;s playing economically, and very well. With so many hitters and strokeplayers in this New Zealand side it&apos;s good to have a straight man. &quot;Custodial words,&quot; begins Sam Jordison. &quot;Can I nominate an entire part of the language? I&apos;d like to see the utter destruction of the present participle. That&apos;s to say, &apos;ing&apos; words. I&apos;m thinking about all those New Labour slogans: &apos;Making Britain a better place&apos;. And those meaningless company mission statements you see so often nowadays: &apos;Striving for the fulfilling of your needs.&apos; Oh yes, and: &apos;Ponting&apos;.&quot; WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE RICKY PONTING?! WICKET! Styris c O&apos;Brien b Langford-Smith 10 (New Zealand 83-3) Maybe we could have a game here after all. Styris, uncertain throughout his short innings, reaches for a curving slower delivery (59.5mph) from Langford-Smith and snicks his drive through to the tumbling O&apos;Brien. Nicely bowled but, again, New Zealand have been punished for their absent-mindedness: Fleming, Marshall and Styris all got to double figures and all got themselves out. 17th over: New Zealand 84-3 &quot;Surely schadenfreude should be on the banned list,&quot; says Clare Davies. &quot;Along with zeitgeist.&quot; I remember the words &apos;Levellers&apos; and &apos;zeitgeist&apos; being used in the same sentence once. How we honked. 18th over: New Zealand 88-3 &quot;Some the bowlers we think of as greats were missing or out of form in the 1987 tournament,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;McDermott, Steve Waugh and O&apos;Donnell led the way for Champs Australia; England&apos;s attack was led by Hemmings, DeFreitas and Foster; India&apos;s by Maninder Singh, Prabhakar and Shastri. The Windies had no Marshall, nor Ambrose, Garner, Holding, Croft, Roberts, Clarke etc etc. New Zealand had no Hadlee. It was a paradise for flat track bullies who cashed in before fast reverse swing and wrist spin found them out.&quot; With the exception of wrist-spin, I don&apos;t buy that - was there even a 300+ total in the tournament apart from when West Indies hammered Sri Lanka? Reverse swing wasn&apos;t particularly relevant in 1996, when they had the same conditions, the addition of pinch-hitting, fielding restrictions and more useless, Associate bowling attacks. I supposed that&apos;s counterbalanced by useless, Associate batting line-ups, but still. 19th over: New Zealand 91-3 Langford-Smith, an Ian Austin-like bowler who has been impressive today, has Fulton feeling and missing for one outside off stump. Fulton&apos;s response is a flustered, feckless whap off middle stump to fine leg for three. Langford-Smith then beats McMillan on the inside with a lovely off-cutter, the final ball of a fine spell: 10-1-41-2. &quot;You, me, Shaun Pollock, Colly, Belly, Nicole Kidman, the Weasley family, Irish setters - what can&apos;t we achieve if we put our red heads down, arses up?&quot; hics Kate McDonald. &quot;Umm ... I&apos;ll get back to you on that one.&quot; Professional curiosity: what are you drinking? 20th over: New Zealand 94-3 (Fulton 47, McMillan 4) Rankin replaces Johnston and it&apos;s a quiet over - three from it - as Fulton continues to anchor and McMillan plays himself in for the later assault. &quot;I&apos;ll tell you when a schadenfreude sandwich tasted as good as it did on Saturday night,&quot; says Rupert Good. &quot;It was when Bangladesh beat Australia in 2005. I had the good fortune to see Shane Warne in person in London a few days later. I pointed and laughed.&quot; As he contemplated the 40 English batsmen and numerous busty beauties he was going to conquer that summer, I am sure he was devastated at being so eloquently belittled by your Good self. 21st over: New Zealand 96-3 It&apos;s the offspinner McCallan to pick up where Langford-Smith left off. He has impressed me in this tournament - a little like Graeme Hick in style, tall and wicket-to-wicket, and with really good discipline. Two from a good first over. &quot;Word list,&quot; begins Jeff Naylo - I DON&apos;T BELIEVE IT, HIS SURNAME&apos;S SLATER AND I&apos;VE CALLED HIM NAYLOR, the OBO equivalent of addressing your wife incorrectly in the bedroom. &quot;Why not rethink this paradigm and add paradigm to the list? What does that even mean anyway?&quot; 22nd over: New Zealand 109-3 A massive blow from the bearded McMillan, who charges the first ball of Rankin&apos;s over and flays it over extra-cover with a horizontal bat for six. Then he slashes four more past point; 13 from the over in all - a &apos;biggie&apos;, to use the parlance of our times. &quot;&apos;What are you drinking?&apos;&quot; quotes Kate McDonald. &quot;Relentless, dearest, but you knew that. By the way, I concur with your Frankenstein imagery concerning young Rankin, but, like all men, once you put a bag over his head he looks up to the job, don&apos;t you think?&quot; Sorry, what was that? I can&apos;t hear very well under this bag. 23rd over: New Zealand 111-3 A prosaic work to leg brings Fulton his first fifty of the tournament, a controlled 65-ball effort that will probably keep him in the side for the forseeable. Two from another solid McCallan over - he&apos;s not easy to nurdle. &quot;Here&apos;s betting my humble pie (cold) on Sunday morning tasted somewhat worse than your schadenfreude sandwich,&quot; says Duncan in Johannesburg. &quot;Can I add &apos;wellness&apos; to the banned list? Not sure about in the UK, but in SA wellness clinics and seminars have become the catchphrase for anything that people can&apos;t justify using English as she was s&apos;posed to be spoke.&quot; 24th over: New Zealand 116-3 Offspin at both ends, as Andrew White replaces the bruised Rankin (6-0-43-1), and Ireland are happy to hustle along at three and four an over. New Zealand, too, are happy to deal in ones and twos against the spinners for now. Five from the over. &quot;Could I just point out to all those laughing at South Africa&apos;s rather amusing demise on Saturday that we have to play Bangladesh soon,&quot; says Andy Bradshaw. &quot;Let&apos;s be smug after we&apos;ve beaten them, not before. Especially as they have three decent spinners and we&apos;ve ably demonstrated that we can&apos;t play against anything remotely resembling spin. Kate missed out Elizabeth I and Boudacia.&quot; You might say Bangladesh have a &apos;phalanx&apos; of spinners. That&apos;s a word I could listen to all day. WICKET! McMillan c Johnston b McCallan 22 (New Zealand 118-4) McMillan loses patience and pays the price, backing away to a quicker one from McCallan and slicing a heave to Johnston at short third man. It was smart bowling, because McCallan saw him back away and so speared it in, but New Zealand really are making a bit of a mess of this. 25th over: New Zealand 118-4 &quot;On the subject of verboten words, I used to work for a prominent design magazine, and our list of banned words included &apos;sleek&apos;, &apos;slick&apos; and &apos;lexus&apos;,&quot; says Kieran Long. 26th over: New Zealand 121-4 Three from White&apos;s over, and we have to go through the same process of a new Zealand batsman playing himself in for five overs, biffing a couple of boundaries and then getting out. &quot;Is there something there between you and Ms McDonald,&quot; says Thomas Hopkins. &quot;A bit of ginger loving on the cards?&quot; It&apos;s a little thing I like to call &apos;nobody else bloody well emailing me at all ever all day&apos;. 27th over: New Zealand 123-4 Two from McCallan&apos;s over. New Zealand are in no hurry, because Fulton is one-paced and Oram in first gear, so we could be in for a dull 20 minutes. &quot;Rob, as this subject of banned words has cropped up again on an OBO, can I have another go at getting MOIST on the list?&quot; shouts Clare Davies. Surely that should be on the Good Words Which Are Inadvertently Erotic list, along with phalanx? 28th over: New Zealand 127-4 Oram misses a reverse sweep at O&apos;Brien and the ball goes wide of his leg stump for three byes. Here&apos;s Gary Naylor. &quot;Re 1996 vs 1987, the following bowlers were around in 96, but not 87: Warne and McGrath; Kumble and Srinath; Ambrose; Mushtaq Ahmad and Waqar; a phalanx of Saffers headed by Donald and Pollock; and a couple of useful Lankans called Vaas and Muralitharan. Strike rates were marginally lower in 96 because the bowling was sufficiently better to offset improvements in batting techniques and tactics - fielding was better too. Should I get out more?&quot; Once would be a start. There were still some very good bowlers in 1987 - McDermott, Walsh (fair enough, he had a shocker), Qaqir, Patterson, Wasim, Imran, Reid, Manzoor Elahi ... OK, the attacks were pretty shoddy but I would still have thought the effect of pinch-hitting etc would outweigh that factor. But then I also thought Dawson&apos;s Creek was criminally underrated. 29th over: New Zealand 132-4 New Zealand are getting bogged down but they don&apos;t look particularly troubled: they would back Oram and McCullum to go ballistic towards the end. But if they were to lose another one now we really might have a game. McCallan thought he had one then when Fulton pushed at one on his pads. Steve Bucknor decided, probably correctly, that there was no bat involved and called wide. 30th over: New Zealand 138-4 &quot;OBO always seems to turn into a discussion of dislikes,&quot; says Jonny Sultoon, shrewdly painting me as some kind of misanthropic, mirthless ginger goon. &quot;What about words we do like? To that list I&apos;d add &apos;sausage&apos;, &apos;leak&apos;, &apos;job&apos; and &apos;buttress&apos;.&quot; 31st over: New Zealand 142-4 New Zealand are now going at four or five an over without significant risk, which is as much as you can ask for. As admirably accurate as McCallan (6-0-17-1) is, you can only really see him taking wickets through unforced errors. In other news, the OBO has turned into Facebook. &quot;Could you ask Kieran Long if he&apos;s the same Kieran Long who played for the English Society football team at Cardiff Uni, normally in a state of some rage, as &apos;a prominent design magazine&apos; is exactly the sort of phrase he would use,&quot; snorts Dennis Johns. &quot;This is a man who boldly proclaimed to me, when I was young enough to be impressed by proclamations that &apos;Ernest &amp; Julio Gallo is the Piat d&apos;Or of the 90s&apos;. It was quite a while ago, yes. I am aware that OBO is not Facebook.&quot; 32nd over: New Zealand 147-4 (Fulton 70, Oram 8) With every defensive stroke, Oram somehow looks more ominous, because you know those big shoulders will open very soon. For now he has 7 from 22 balls. it&apos;s a nurdlathon, with little to commend it. Interestingly, all of New Zealand&apos;s partnerships have been between 24 and 35 - no lies in that statistic. &quot;I&apos;m new to OBO, and I can&apos;t help noticing that your desktop scoreboard spends much of its time advertising Guardian Soulmates,&quot; says Pratheeban Nambyiah. &quot;Is this a sly dig at OBO readers?&quot; It&apos;s not really very sly, is it? About as stealthy as piles, in fact. 33rd over: New Zealand 154-4 McCallan&apos;s quicker ball shoots down the leg side for three wides, before Fulton misses a slow-motion hoick at a full delivery that wasn&apos;t there for the shot. In other news, yet another person asks whether Gary Naylor actually exists. It can only be a matter of time before he does a Richey Manic on his forearm. 34th over: New Zealand 158-4 More of the same - four no-risk singles from White&apos;s over. Oram has 12 from 29 balls, Fulton 74 from 99. 35th over: New Zealand 164-4 (Fulton 79, Oram 13) There&apos;s a used lolly stick on an adjacent desk, and suddenly I&apos;m debating how much effort it would take to use said stick to scoop out my eyeballs. This really is shocking stuff. Oop, saying which, Fulton drags McCallan flat and hard from outside off stump for four. &quot;Please tell Dennis Johns that I am indeed said Kieran Long,&quot; says Kieran Long. &quot;But, as he fails to mention, I captained the English Soc football team at Cardiff Uni. I remember him as a hirsute and highly effective goalkeeper.&quot; This is fascinating stuff. 36th over: New Zealand 166-4 Johnston replaces White, and his first ball almost brings a wicket. Oram pushed the ball into the off side and Fulton was more than halfway down the pitch when he invited him to get back in his box. He was miles short when the throw, from a player whose name I cannot reveal for legal reasons (and because I haven&apos;t a clue who it was), missed the stumps. Just two from a good over. RAIN STOPS PLAY: New Zealand 169-4 (Fulton 81, Oram 14) Even if I had been marooned in a desert for 10 years with nothing but a string vest and a bespoke Wilson Phillips iPod for company, I could not imagine rainfall ever being more welcome. These last 10 overs have been absolutely gruesome. GAH They&apos;re coming back on. It was a seriously brief spurt, a Jim Levenstein. 37th over: New Zealand 170-4 McCallan rounds off his penultimate over and has figures of 9-0-34-1. From memory he has only gone for a single boundary, which is testament to his accuracy, the slow pitch, and New Zealand&apos;s sedate approach. 38th over: New Zealand 172-4 Johnston has a really big shout for LBW against Oram. It looked pretty close, but there were two doubts: height, and where did it pitch. The latter was enough to negate the appeal - it was indeed outside leg stump, and the impeccable Taufel got it spot on again. As Ian Smith points out, it&apos;s a shame that, because of Australia&apos;s form, he will probably have to wait at least another four years for a World Cup final. &quot;You might be bored witless watching this tosh, but at least you are not listening to TMS,&quot; presumes Rachel Clifton. &quot;If one more f*#king person asks Colin Croft how tall he is, I will be puncturing my ear drums. And the Irish team manager - lovely man, I am sure, but he makes Alec Stewart sound positively devilish and brimming with life in comparison ...&quot; It&apos;s not Father Paul Stone from Father Ted, is it? &quot;Father Stone was a lot more interesting, believe me ...&quot; retorts Clifton. WICKET! Fulton LBW b McCallan 83 (New Zealand 172-5) McCallan traps Fulton in front moments before the players go off for rain again. It was a good delivery - slightly quicker and pitching just outside off before beating the attempted sweep and zipping into the pad. It would have hit off-and-middle and, after contemplating the meaning of Noel Gallacher&apos;s lyrics in &apos;Talk Tonight&apos; for a few seconds and then a few more, Bucknor raised the finger. McCallan has bowled very nicely and the tantalising prospect of one of those forgettable, unwanted, meaningless giant-killings still lingers. Come on Ireland! 5.12pm The rain is much heavier than before, so we might be off for a little while. In the meantime, Kate McDonald is on one. &quot;Now, I was born in one of these countries, and spent six of my 34 years in the other (meanwhile ending up spending many years growing up in Australia, thereby adding to my knowledge of exactly how a ginger turns into a strawberry blonde) so I feel thoroughly validated in our summation that this game is, as you so rightly state, a load of gruesome $hite. Validated - another word for the Linguistic Hall of Shame.&quot; I still don&apos;t get how Australia turns a ginger boy into a blonde girl. 5.17pm The covers are coming off. 39th over: New Zealand 173-5 We&apos;re back on, and the new batsman McCullum almost runs out Oram by sending him back. New Zealand have been really sloppy today. &quot;Rob, for some reason, I really don&apos;t know why, I have a fondness for the word &apos;febrile&apos;,&quot; apologises Clare Davies. &quot;Strange.&quot; 40th over: New Zealand 178-5 McCullum is oozing urgency, as is his wont, but Oram is still pottering along, dealing exclusively in singles. Five from Johnston&apos;s over. WICKET! Oram c Morgan b White 20 (New Zealand 181-6) One offspinner for another, White for McCallan, and he strikes straight away to get rid of the dangerman Oram, who charged down the track and drove to long-on, where Morgan, on his knees, judged a low catch beautifully. That was a rancid, apathetic little innings from Oram - 20 from 48 balls, all in singles - and New Zealand will be glad they bat a long way down because they have had a minor shocker so far. 41st over: New Zealand 182-6 (McCullum 6, Vettori 1) &quot;Errr,&quot; says Yvonne Reilly. &quot;Earlier you said: &apos;All of which is a farcically long-winded way of saying that, on this deliciously sunny Easter Monday, I wish I was nursing a pint of Irish cider rather than cursing the sight of the Irish side, er.&apos; And now you&apos;re saying &quot;Come on Ireland&apos;? Care to shed some light?&quot; You shouldn&apos;t take anything I say seriously, today even more than usual - I&apos;ve gone cold turkey on the Relentless. 42nd over: New Zealand 185-6 Do we have a shock on here? It&apos;s hard to appraise because, apart from yesterday, totals of over 200 have been very hard to chase on these anaesthetised surfaces. But if Ireland can wrap this up for around 217 - and they almost had another one there, when the returning Rankin went past Vettori&apos;s outside edge - it&apos;ll be a nervous lunch for New Zealand. I quite fancy McCullum to do the nasty and get them up to a matchwinning 240, although he too was beaten by a jaffa from Rankin to end that over. &quot;You can&apos;t really beat &apos;fecund&apos;, can you?&quot; muses Andrew White. &quot;Definitely goes on to the &apos;moist&apos; list in my opinion.&quot; WICKET! Vettori c O&apos;Brien b White 5 (New Zealand 189-7) Vettori, with the delicate, sensual touch of an entirely legal Amsterdam masseuse, late-cuts White for three - but then he falls as well, gloving an attempted sweep that was really smartly taken down the leg side by O&apos;Brien. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going off out there. 43rd over: New Zealand 189-7 The new batsman Franklin has a Test hundred, so New Zealand aren&apos;t in among the filth yet. But, like Richard Ke - sorry, like a werewolf&apos;s undercarriage, it&apos;s all a bit too hairy for comfort. 44th over: New Zealand 198-7 Excellent, button-bright hustling from the lightning-fast McCullum, whose scampering prompts a misfield and ultimately brings nine from Rankin&apos;s over, including one from a straight drive that crashed into the stumps at the non-striker&apos;s end. While everyone else was watching, McCullum was almost through for the single. &quot;In the next World Cup, I think Niall O&apos;Brien will be keeping for England and Boyd Rankin will be opening the bowling (with Stuart Broad),&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Is this a good or bad thing?&quot; If it means Nixon and Saj aren&apos;t around, I&apos;d have thought it&apos;s a fiercely good thing. I agree about O&apos;Brien. Rankin&apos;s a movie of the week, all lank and no trousers. 45th over: New Zealand 204-7 Six from the over, including yet another mix-up that almost did for Franklin. The bowler White was actually in the way of the throw, although it was well wide anyway. 46th over: New Zealand 210-7 O&apos;Brien is the new bowler and his first over goes for six, all in ones and twos. Ireland are continuing to restrict New Zealand impressively in the field - there hasn&apos;t been a boundary for nearly 12 overs. 47th over: New Zealand 218-7 White continues - gone are the days when spinners weren&apos;t let anywhere near the death overs - and still there are no boundaries. Eight from the over and he finishes with 10-0-45-2. Well bowled. &quot;Why isn&apos;t the non-striker out when the ball hits his wicket with him out of the crease? (No, not a riddle - I just want to know),&quot; says Colum Farrelly. It has to get a touch off a fielder (the bowler) before it hits the stumps for it to be a run-out. 48th over: New Zealand 234-7 (McCullum 32, Franklin 20) Finally a boundary, as Franklin jams down on a yorker for Johnston and sends it away to fine leg for four. Then he makes it two in two with a healthy clump back past the bowler. The first person to use the words &apos;London&apos; and &apos;buses&apos; will pay big. A really good over for New Zealand, 16 from it when McCullum swivels to clout the last ball behind square on the leg side for four. &quot;Hello, I am pretty russian girl, bored tonight,&quot; says Debra. &quot;would you like to chat with me and see my pics?&quot; Well, this has been a great game of cricket, one of the best, but I have to go meet Debra now, so enjoy the rest of the game on a rival site of your choice. 49th over: New Zealand 248-7 Splendid hitting from Franklin (31 from 20 balls), who whips O&apos;Brien to leg for four and then drives the last ball miles over mid-on for a gloriously clean six. Fourteen from the over. WICKET! McCullum c Morgan b Johnston 47 (New Zealand 260-8) After swiping Johnston for four and six from successive deliveries, McCullum drags a slower ball to deep midwicket to end a superb innings of 47 from 37 balls. 50th over: New Zealand 263-8 (Franklin 34, Bond 0) Fifteen from the final over from Johnston, which makes it 45 from the last three. Ireland did really well for the most part, but the late hitting from Franklin and McCullum has surely settled this match.

Almost a sixth of first-year UK university students from European countries other than Britain plan to visit home &quot;often&quot;. That is what they told pollsters Opinionpanel Research, which quizzed almost 300 of them last November. And &quot;often&quot; now means as regularly as once a week. Budget airlines, with their cheap and frequent flights, make a Eurocommute financially and practically possible for many students. Modular degree courses, which make timetables more flexible, also play their part. So, too, do the completion rates, which are higher at British universities than at European ones. If you add to those factors the fact that university places at European institutions outside Britain are becoming scarcer and that our degrees take less time, it is not difficult to see why this breed of student Eurocommuters has come into existence. But some say they show, most of all, how highly prized degrees from British universities, and qualifications taught and assessed in English, are. &quot;The UK brand of higher education is highly popular and well respected across the world,&quot; says Professor Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor of Bedfordshire University. His institution - a five-minute taxi ride from Luton airport - attracts many student Eurocommuters. &quot;It might seem unusual to some, but Eurocommuting is fast becoming regarded as normal, particularly for postgraduates,&quot; says Dr Paul Temple, a lecturer in higher education management at the Institute of London. &quot;This is part of the internationalisation of higher education. &quot;There is now the feeling that graduates need to show they have an international perspective, whether they want to work for the private or public sector, and taking a degree abroad is a good way of doing that.&quot; But is UK higher education doing something wrong if so many of the 74,000-odd EU students on undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses jump on the first flight home every weekend? &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s particularly to do with UK higher education that they go home at weekends,&quot; says Temple. &quot;They may well have family commitments of various kinds, say, or even work commitments - and, of course, they may not go back every weekend.&quot; Yet surely these Eurocommuters make it harder to create a student community on campus? &quot;On the contrary,&quot; says Ebdon. &quot;They bring the global village into the university and contribute a lot to university life. Students are choosing to study eight miles closer to home every year. Without these Eurocommuters, they would not get so much out of university.&quot; Life on the move Most people find studying for one full-time undergraduate degree enough. Simar Selezov is doing two - and in different countries. He is currently studying for a BA in marketing at the University of Bedfordshire and an economics degree at the Tallinn University of Technology in Estonia. Selezov, 22, is in his third year of both degrees and will graduate from both institutions this September. He travels between Tallinn and Luton two to three times a month. &quot;It is very challenging to do two degrees. My friends think I am a bit crazy, but I do it because England is one of the most important centres in Europe for finance and I thought it would be a great challenge to study here. &quot;It works well. Our approach in Estonia is more theoretical; in Bedfordshire, it is more practical. The overall experience is excellent. Luckily, in Estonia, university timetables are very flexible and the university moved things around for me. &quot;But being a Eurocommuter is certainly not easy and it is expensive. I have friends I stay with when I am in Luton, and friends who work for easyJet, so I get a discount. Two of my Estonian friends have a house and I pay them rent when I am there. The government pays for my degree in Estonia because I got a scholarship. I also have a bursary. &quot;The advantage is that I know about travelling and how to manage my time. In the future, if I work for an international company, I could be a very good manager of international affairs. &quot;I have to plan very carefully when I am going to be able to do everything. I also feel that Stansted airport is my home. I have been there between 30 and 50 times in the last year. I almost always have my laptop wherever I go. I read lecture slides in the airport. Sometimes I email tutors and send assignments from there. Of course, I have to stop when the plane takes off and lands.&quot; Journey: bus to Talinn airport, flight to Stansted, coach to Luton, walk. Time: 5 hours 20 minutes. Cost: approximately \u00a3700 a month. Carla Cl\u00e9 says being a Eurocommuter is more worrying than glamorous. The 24-year-old from Antwerp, Belgium, is in the third year of her PhD, but studies at the John Innes centre at the University of East Anglia. She goes home every three to four weeks to see Jan, her partner of two years. &quot;The centre here is scientifically much better than what we have in Antwerp, but I get fed up with my eurocommute. It is not just the 45-minute flight, it is the waiting in the airport. There is always the worry that you might miss the train or plane. I used to take my PhD work and look at it in the airport. You always think you&apos;ll be able to do it. Now I have realised I can&apos;t, and I take a magazine. &quot;I try to make up the time I have lost travelling by working the weekends when Jan and I don&apos;t see each other. &quot;I think being a Eurocommuter does affect your social life at university. I miss parties in Norwich and in Belgium. And I feel that I live nowhere. &quot;There are more and more Eurocommuters, because the world is getting smaller and young people want the independence that living abroad as a student gives. I feel completely independent and faced with a culture that challenges my preconceptions. Another good thing is that the Eurocommuters begin to recognise each other at the airport and we make friends.&quot; Journey: bus to Norwich airport, flight to Amsterdam, train to Antwerp. Time: 6 hours. Cost: between \u00a3125 and \u00a3250 a month. Svenja Kreyenhop commuted between her home town of Bremen in Germany and Luton last year. The 25-year-old was studying for an advertising and marketing communications degree at the University of Bedfordshire. It was linked to her course at the Academy for Marketing and communications in Hamburg. &quot;Some of the Chinese students said that they were jealous of me because it was impossible for them to go home so easily. Fortunately, easyJet started offering flights that were very convenient for me just a few months before my studies in Luton started. I used to have a boyfriend back home and I was also playing hockey for my German team. I commuted back and forth, every weekend sometimes, and very often every fortnight. &quot;I would go straight from university to the airport to catch my flight home on a Friday evening and only return to Luton late Tuesday evening. So sometimes I would only actually stay in Luton for three nights before going back home. &quot;Going back home meant staying back at my parents&apos; place, on their expenses.When I managed my time badly, it was due to laziness, not the commute.&quot; Journey: taxi to Luton airport, flight to Bremen, car home.

I was only gone for two days, but when I returned to the German capital, I was shocked to see that a piece of the Berlin Wall, which I walk past regularly, had gone. Overnight government workers had come along and yanked it out of its foundations, to make way for a new environment ministry which is being built on the site on Erna-Berger Strasse just off Potsdamer Platz.  You may think the less that remains of that monstrosity which divided a country for 28 years, the better. But it is getting ever harder to imagine what that division might have been like. This is of particular importance to young people and visitors to the city, and for Berlin itself, whose identity is inextricably linked to that of the wall.  Bits of the structure remain dotted around the city, but they are getting fewer and fewer each year. I was particularly fond of the 18-metre stretch near Potsdamer Platz as it was the section I stumbled across one cold October night in 1990 on my first visit to Berlin. The environment ministry promises it will restore and then re-erect the missing piece, displaying it behind a glass window for all to see. But the &quot;cloak and daggers&quot; action, as it was referred to by one particularly irate citizen who claims he bought that section from a former border guard, has reignited a perennial debate about preserving the remaining sections of the wall, which snaked for almost 27 miles through East and West Berlin between 1961 and 1989. The longest section is on M\u00fchlenstrasse, a 1.3km stretch on the river Spree known as the East Side Gallery which artists from 21 countries were invited to decorate in 1990. But that is visibly crumbling, and last year a 45-metre stretch was removed from the Gallery at the request of a mobile phone company because it blocked their view. Around 212 metres have been listed on Bernauer Strasse - the only section still displaying all the grisly elements - such as the death strip, guard posts and barbed wire - that formerly made up the Cold War barrier.  There&apos;s also a sad and very crumbling piece running alongside the former Nazi headquarters of surveillance and persecution (containing the Gestapo and SS) just off Stresemannstrasse. It&apos;s one of the best examples of the many raw displays of history that are to be found in Berlin. Building historian Johannes Cramer of the Free University has been openly critical of the lack of a comprehensive plan for the wall&apos;s preservation. &quot;I find it scandalous the arbitrary way in which this historical monument, one of the last original pieces of wall that we still have, is dealt with,&quot; he said.  The Green party plans to bring up the issue at the next government cultural committee meeting. They are among those who fear that if a comprehensive preservation plan isn&apos;t decided upon soon, in another 20 years there will be nothing left to see.

The owner of Airbus, which went into the red for the first time last year with a loss of \u20ac572m, is leaving it up to shareholders to decide whether to distribute the net \u20ac99m it made in 2006 in full, in part or not at all when they meet in Amsterdam on May 4. In documents issued to investors ahead of the annual meeting, the board said: &quot;Given the extraordinary circumstances and the important challenges that came to light during 2006 ... the board unanimously agreed that the amount of the proposed cash distribution should be substantially reduced.&quot; However, directors could not finally agree on a dividend after a year that saw shares fall 18%. It is understood that the two main private sector shareholders, French media group Lagard\u00e8re and German-US vehicle group DaimlerChrysler, wanted a dividend while the French state insisted it was politically inexpedient to pay out. On last year&apos;s sorry financial performance the gross dividend would be \u20ac0.12 compared with \u20ac0.45 in 2005. French ministers, including presidential front-runner Nicolas Sarkozy, have said it is unethical to distribute a dividend when Airbus is discussing 10,000 job losses and plant closures or disposals with its unions under a \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.3bn) annual cost-cutting plan. This has prompted several strikes. The board is also split over the need for a rights issue to help fund the \u20ac10bn A350, the new long-haul jet due to enter service in 2013. The French state favours one to increase its control, given by its 15% holding, while Daimler and Lagard\u00e8re and executive directors are opposed. EADS retains \u20ac4.2bn in cash despite the drain imposed by delays to its A380 superjumbo. Airbus received a boost when Willie Walsh, British Airways&apos; chief executive, said he could imagine BA ordering 10 to 15 A380s under plans to renew its long-haul fleet from 2014. The airline is due to place an order for 34 aircraft later this year. Mr Walsh told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung that the superjumbo was technologically a fantastic plane but could never replace its entire long-haul fleet of 114 Boeings. Airbus is desperate to have BA as an A380 customer, with a decision due in August or September, according to Mr Walsh.

BA offers to help elderly or disabled passengers carry their bags at the airport, but that is not the point. Disabled or not, unless you are going straight to a hotel, and stay there until you go home, you have to carry a heavy bag each time you move from place to place.

The figure was revealed by the Anglo-Dutch energy group after it offered to settle damages claims of $352m with European investors and hoped to find a similar solution with a smaller number of US shareholders at a cost of $96m. Shell&apos;s head of legal services, Beat Hess, said the $352m offer had been made to shareholders who bought stock between April 1999 and March 2004. It had been accepted by major investors but was still subject to approval by the Amsterdam court of appeals. In addition, Mr Hess said the company &quot;intends to offer the same proportional settlement to investors in the United States, provided the US court overseeing the case approves.&quot; Shell said it would &quot;request&quot; that the US securities and exchange commission (SEC) pay US shareholders out of the $120m fine that the company paid the SEC in 2005 to resolve the Wall Street watchdog&apos;s inquiry into the scandal. The Dutch Investors&apos; Association (VEB), which represents small shareholders and helped negotiate the settlement, said Shell would be expected to pay the $96m itself if the SEC refused to hand over the money. In that case, the company will have paid a total bill of $700m through a series of payments to pension and derivative funds, the Financial Services Authority in the UK, federal regulators and the state of California. Additional damage to the company was done by a fall in the share price, which lagged behind its competitors for 18 months after the debacle caused by Shell logging discoveries that were ineligible for inclusion under the SEC rules. Shell shares fell more than 10% on the day the reserves problem was first made public in January 2004, and several smaller declines followed later that year as Shell was forced to adjust the size of its estimated reserves five times in all, cutting them by about a third in total. The gaffes badly dented the company&apos;s image and led to the departure of both Sir Phil Watts, who was in effect the chief executive, and his exploration boss, Walter van de Vijver. In January 2006, investors including the VEB and the massive Dutch pension fund ABP filed a class-action suit against the company in the US district court in New Jersey. Shell said then it would &quot;vigorously defend itself&quot; but in the second quarter of 2006 it took a $500m charge against potential payments. The $700m total cost of the reserves fiasco is high but small in relative terms for Shell, which had 2006 earnings of a record $25.4bn.

Why not have their distinguished writer Geert Mak travel around the continent throughout 1999, reporting on the history of the century just closing from the very places where that history was made? Verdun to Vichy, Amsterdam to Auschwitz, Guernica to Gdansk? &quot;It was to be a sort of final inspection,&quot; Mak writes. They gave him a camper van, with bunk and cooking ring, from which he filed many of the reports which his paper carried on its front page every day for a year. He has reworked them, with additional material, into this fascinating book. A &quot;final inspection&quot; was an ambitious aim, but Mak had unusual qualifications. He was the author of Amsterdam, a brilliant portrait of that city, and of Jorwerd, perhaps the best single book on the slow death of the European countryside. He was a journalist of a scholarly and even philosophical bent. And he was an intellectual from a country with wide international connections but rather parochial preoccupations. The Netherlands had only a few years before been shocked into a degree of self-examination, and of awareness of the outside world, by the disaster of Srebrenica, where hapless Dutch troops could not prevent a massacre. Self-examination and awareness, on the one hand, the refusal to know or care, on the other - these turned out to be the dominating themes of his reporting and his book. Let the stones speak! That was the plan, but the stones did not give up their tale so easily. Partly, of course, this was the result of what Abraham Lincoln called &quot;the slow artillery of time&quot;. Mak visited Couco, one of the many Portugese villages where peasants seized the land in 1975. They were filmed on their way to take over the local estates in their tractors and decorated carts. It was, he writes, &quot;one huge rolling celebration&quot;. But in 1999 he found only two people left who had been there on that day. The peasant co-operatives had long since been dismantled, the people gone to the cities, the land returned to private use. The revolution which had turned Portugal upside down seemed very distant as Mak reluctantly joined in conversations about the profits to be made from growing tomatoes. Mak found that the open book he had hoped to read while standing in a square, a church, or a concentration camp was often closed or half closed. Europe was like a school blackboard at the end of the day, with much that had once been clear erased. Deliberate suppression he expected. Mak stays in the hotel in the Bavarian Alps from which Ernst R\u00f6hm and other SA leaders were dragged in June 1934 to be executed. In a brochure he reads about the founders of the hotel, about colourful characters among its employees over the years, and about the &quot;wonderful world on the Tegernsee&quot;, the lake it overlooks. The R\u00f6hm putsch is not mentioned. He settles down in a room in which one of R\u00f6hm&apos;s men might well have slept. &quot;The true sense of living history would not come ... the most industrious of chambermaids, after all, have been scrubbing here for the last sixty years, and scrubbing washes away the evil, snow covers everything, stillness and time do the rest.&quot; The Tegernsee inn was also an example of a special kind of forgetting which Mak not infrequently encountered: what is nationally admitted, analysed, and publicly regretted, is locally denied. The place where it happened may thus sometimes be the last place to grasp the reality of what happened. Sometimes the past has been physically removed. Destroyed, like old Warsaw, like most of Dresden, like the buildings of the once gay little town of Vukovar in what was once Yugoslavia. Sometimes the buildings remain but people have disappeared, as in Pripyat, close to Chernobyl. There, the hammer and sickle still marks public buildings, the children&apos;s shoes are still in their racks at the daycare centre, and not a soul is to be seen in &quot;the Pompei of the twentieth century&quot;. In other cases, all but the most immoveable items have even been carted off to another continent. American officers, Mak notes, took away as souvenirs every single picture, ornament and piece of furniture - save for a gigantic table they could not get out of the door - from the court house where the Nuremberg Trials were conducted. Then there is what might be termed the shopping-mall effect. Commercial development may not only erase historic buildings, it may also erase the idea of history itself. How can real poverty be understood in a Brussels where the nuns who run the soup kitchen hand out leftover designer sandwiches from Eurostar? How can the struggles for independence against Russia and Germany be understood now on the main street of Vilnius where, Mak observes, &quot;Western vacuity has descended with a vengeance&quot; and &quot;Adidas, Benetton and other familiar spirits smile down on you as you walk.&quot; There is no history here, unless it be the history of Western consumerism. How eloquently Mak rails against the alliance of consumerism and bureaucracy! In Brussels he contemplates the glass and steel fa\u00e7ade of the new European parliament, and concludes it is the kind of architecture which makes you feel like an ant. The parliament&apos;s shiny cliff overshadows Leopolds Wijk Station, a likeable 19th-century building flanked by small shops and cafes. He just knows that the station will be the next thing to go. &quot;And roll on it will, there can be no doubt about that. In half a year, or in five years, the little station - like cheese made from unpasteurised milk, like French bread ... like real chocolate, untagged cow&apos;s ears, and thousands of other things that an ant-person values, will have been erased by Europe.&quot; Mak has, in his descriptions of cities, something of the cinematic sweep of Joseph Roth, one of his favourite authors. He has a great eye for telling detail, whether it is a single mouldy rose on Salazar&apos;s grave, the last of the Goldene Hausnummern (the East German mark of distinction for model tenants) being unscrewed from doors on East Berlin housing estates, or the young Vladimir Putin trying to burn so many files in the KGB office in Dresden in 1989 that the stove exploded. In Europe hardly breaks new ground historically. It has some longueurs, when Mak crams in so much that we get no more than a catalogue of events. And he tends, at least in the first two-thirds of the book, mainly to track the spoor of the Beast, the story of war and violent upheaval, to the exclusion of other aspects. But, in a work like this it is the sensibility of the writer that matters most. Only a powerful, humane and serious mind could give coherence to a mass of detail which, however arresting piece by piece, would otherwise soon become wearying. In Europe is, as he implies in the quotation from Borges which he places at the start of the book, as much a journey around Geert Mak&apos;s head as it is a journey around Europe.", "sentences": ["Verdun to Vichy, Amsterdam to Auschwitz, Guernica to Gdansk?", "He was the author of Amsterdam, a brilliant portrait of that city, and of Jorwerd, perhaps the best single book on the slow death of the European countryside."], "title": "Review: In Europe by Geert Mak", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview29", "tags": ["Books", "History", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-14T23:11:58Z", "article": "Royal Bank of Scotland is prepared to launch a hostile bid for ABN Amro if it is unable to secure an agreed deal for the Dutch bank. The Scots this weekend gate-crashed exclusive merger talks between ABN and Barclays. RBS, which has teamed up with Banco Santander of Spain and Fortis of Belgium, wrote a letter to the Amsterdam-based bank inviting it to begin talks. In the letter, they have asked for a response by Tuesday evening, when the period of exclusivity enjoyed by Barclays comes to an end. The trio want access to ABN&apos;s books, as Barclays has had, and are keen to secure a friendly deal. However, the Scots camp is extremely unlikely to back off if it meets with opposition. ABN itself will be under pressure from shareholders, including hedge fund TCI, to secure the best possible price. That will make it difficult to refuse RBS&apos;s request for access, but the Dutch could still indulge in delaying tactics. Barclays has offered a raft of concessions, promising to locate the chief executive&apos;s office in Amsterdam and to dole out some top jobs to ABN executives. RBS and its partners are not likely to be so obliging. &apos;I doubt you will find Fred on the canal side, smoking wacky baccy,&apos; said one observer. The three-way consortium is understood to have been put together by Matthew Greenberg, an investment banker at Merrill Lynch, which is advising the banks. The plan is to break up ABN&apos;s \u00a344bn assets into equal thirds. RBS would take LaSalle, its US operation, plus its Asian interests and corporate banking. Santander, which has a long association with the Scottish bank, would be given ABN&apos;s Brazilian and Italian divisions, and Fortis would get retail banking in Holland and Benelux, plus asset management and private banking. Analysts believe the three could afford to offer more than \u20ac40 (\u00a327) a share for ABN because they have more geographical overlap and could therefore squeeze out more cost savings and revenue benefits than Barclays, which is thought to have a ceiling of about \u20ac35 a share. RBS and its allies will also argue that they have a better track record on integrating takeovers.

Barclays may yet demand that its period of exclusivity with the Dutch management, which runs out on Wednesday, is extended, possibly to April 26, when ABN Amro and Barclays hold their annual general meetings. But the Barclays board is under pressure to name its price for ABN Amro or walk away after Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander of Spain and Belgian operation Fortis revealed late last week they were attempting to thwart Barclays&apos; plan to be one of the top five banks in the world. The battle for ABN Amro is regarded as crucial as it could spark a wave of financial sector consolidation. If Barclays were to win control, it would be catapulted above RBS as Britain&apos;s second largest bank and jump from around 15th in the world league. If it failed, Barclays itself could be the subject of takeover speculation. RBS, Santander and Fortis have not told ABN Amro how they intend to structure their deal but have asked for the same information that is being provided to Barclays. ABN Amro appears reluctant to open up its books to the consortium. It is thought they are proposing to carve up ABN Amro and give its shareholders a package of shares in each of their institutions. This is crucial for RBS which could face a backlash from its investors if it were to embark on a fundraising to pay for its \u00a310bn to \u00a315bn portion of ABN Amro. While some bankers believe that the ABN Amro management, led by Rijkman Groenink, will resist the break-up bid, it is thought that the Dutch bank will today publish an upbeat trading statement to force up the price. The Dutch bank is likely to say that it is beating its initial forecasts for earnings per share and has had a strong start to its financial year. An indication about the price for ABN Amro could be reflected in the performance of the Dutch bank&apos;s shares today which will trade in Amsterdam for the first time since the RBS consortium revealed its interest. Its shares have been trading between \u008033 (\u00a324.50) and \u008034 a share - around the price that Barclays was likely to have to pay. But, any jump towards \u008040 - the rumoured break-up price - may be taken as signal by the Dutch management that they should seriously consider the consortium&apos;s proposal, however complex it might appear at the outset. On Friday, ABN&apos;s US shares reached \u008036 which may not bode well for Barclays which is also under pressure from its shareholders not to overpay. It is thought that the consortium plans to split ABN Amro three ways. RBS would take the US subsidiary LaSalle and its investment banking business, which is largely based in London. The bank&apos;s operations in Brazil and Italy would be sold to Santander, while Fortis is interested in its Dutch retail bank, as well as its private banking and asset management operations. Such a radical break-up plan is likely to face scrutiny by investors and regulators as well as politicians in the Netherlands who may be concerned about the implications for jobs. The investment group which in effect put ABN Amro up for sale - the London-based hedge fund TCI - called on the Dutch management to hand over information to the RBS consortium. TCI managing partner Christopher Hohn said: &quot;As ABN Amro shareholders, we believe that the fiduciary duties of the supervisory and management boards require that the Royal Bank of Scotland consortium is allowed to proceed immediately with due diligence on a basis equivalent to Barclays for there to be a fair and transparent process which maximises shareholder value.&quot;", "sentences": ["An indication about the price for ABN Amro could be reflected in the performance of the Dutch bank&apos;s shares today which will trade in Amsterdam for the first time since the RBS consortium revealed its interest."], "title": "Barclays races to seal ABN Amro deal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/16/frontpagenews", "tags": ["Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-16T17:39:40Z", "article": "ABN Amro, the Dutch bank at the centre of a two-way cross-border takeover battle, has played an important role in the current and pending wave of consolidation in the pan-European banking sector. It owes its emergence as the world&apos;s 13th largest bank to a series of mergers and acquisitions over the past 40 years. Under Rijkman Groenink, chief executive since 2000, the bank spearheaded the campaign against national protectionism by taking on the Italian authorities and entrenched financial interests in its ultimately successful bid for Banco Antonveneta two years ago. Italy&apos;s central bank governor and chief banking regulator, Antonio Fazio, paid the price for resisting the takeover with all manner of scheming and subterfuge by being forced to resign. Ironically, his Dutch counterpart, Nout Wellink, helped trigger the actual battle for ABN by calling the break-up moves by hedge fund TCI as a &quot;bridge too far&quot; earlier this year. The bank owes its origins to the heyday of Dutch imperialism in the East Indies in the 1800s. It was set up by King William I in 1824 as the Netherlands Trading Society to revive national trade and industry after the Napoleonic incorporation into France. The company extracted taxes in what is now Indonesia, in the form of tea, coffee, rubber and sugar for fuelling Dutch trade and became the state banker. Its banking activities, which really date from the 1880s, expanded significantly after the second world war. In 1964, the same year Rotterdam Bank and Amsterdam Bank merged to form Amro, it took over Twentsche Bank to form ABN. The two merged entities completed their own marriage, designed to benefit from the EU&apos;s single market, in 1991. Using LaSalle Bank, first bought in 1978, it established a strong foothold in the American mid-west, primarily Chicago and Detroit, through acquisitions worth $4.75bn and secured the merger with Brazil&apos;s Banco Real in 1998 to create its third main market. It took over City stockbrokers Hoare Govett in 1992 and Swedish investment bankers Alfred Berg in 1996. It is now seeking the takeover of Pakistan&apos;s Prime Bank. But its 2006 results, showing a \u00801.2bn provision for bad loans and \u00804.8bn in net profits boosted only by asset sales, prompted TCI to make its break-up move for the annual meeting next week.

The prime minister called for a new &quot;amending treaty&quot;, which could be pushed through without a referendum in Britain. But critics said such a treaty would in effect restore the constitution via the back door. After talks in Downing Street with his Dutch counterpart, Jan Peter Balkenende, the prime minister urged EU partners to eschew grand symbols in favour of practical, incremental steps. The proposed EU constitution has been ratified in 18 countries but was rejected by voters in referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005. Britain was committed to a referendum on the constitution and is desperate to avoid holding one on its replacement. Germany, current holder of the EU presidency, is organising a series of bilateral meetings in an attempt to reintroduce a major constitutional treaty. Even if Britain gets its way on a more limited treaty, the next UK prime minister will face renewed pressure for a referendum. That will increase if it can be shown that most of the measures in the old constitution have been included. &quot;It is important we go back to the idea of a conventional treaty where the idea is to make Europe ... work more effectively, because we now have a Europe of 27 countries rather than 15,&quot; said Mr Blair. &quot;I think the important thing is that if we want to get this resolved, then we have to understand that even though there are 18 of the countries that have ratified the constitutional treaty, there are other countries that really will have a difficulty with a constitutional treaty rather than a treaty, say, in the tradition of the treaty that we negotiated in Amsterdam some 10 years ago.&quot; A senior British official said they would try to encourage Germany to find common ground before bringing proposals to the EU summit in June. &quot;What has very little value is something that 23 countries sign up to but four of them won&apos;t.&quot; Open Europe, the Eurosceptic thinktank, warned last night that the proposals had little value. Its deputy chairman, Derek Scott, said: &quot;The government is spinning that the new treaty will no longer be called a constitution but everyone knows it is likely to contain exactly the same proposals: an EU president, EU foreign minister, and plans to reduce our right to say no to EU regulations. Just changing the name isn&apos;t going to fool anyone, and we intend to hold the government to its promise to hold a referendum.&quot; Mr Blair insisted he wanted the treaty to avoid &quot;the things that could give rise to a European superstate which we do not want - or could give rise to misapprehensions that that is what the purpose is&quot;. He added: &quot;It is not just about the presentation of this ... we have to take an in-principle decision first of all that it is going to be an amending treaty rather than a constitutional treaty.&quot; The prime minister&apos;s official spokesman said the kind of treaty he had in mind could be ratified without the need for a referendum in Britain. &quot;This would be a different kind of animal, if the rest of the 27 agreed, in that this would be simply an amending piece.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;I think the important thing is that if we want to get this resolved, then we have to understand that even though there are 18 of the countries that have ratified the constitutional treaty, there are other countries that really will have a difficulty with a constitutional treaty rather than a treaty, say, in the tradition of the treaty that we negotiated in Amsterdam some 10 years ago.&quot; A senior British official said they would try to encourage Germany to find common ground before bringing proposals to the EU summit in June."], "title": "Blair plan to avoid referendum by calling for amended EU treaty", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/apr/17/uk.eu", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "European Union", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-16T23:03:04Z", "article": "Bruce Bennett, who has died aged 100, was, as Herman Brix, an Olympic shot-putter and screen Tarzan, and, as Bennett, he was a stolid, lanky supporting actor of the 1940s and 1950s.

Seven years after winning a shot put silver medal at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics , the 6ft 2in Brix was picked by Edgar Rice Burroughs to star in the author&apos;s The New Adventures of Tarzan. But MGM, whose own Tarzan series starred another Olympic champ, swimmer Johnny Weissmuller, blocked it out of most theatres and the Brix film, while it was the only talking picture until the 1960s to present the character accurately as a sophisticated polyglot English nobleman, also featured pathetic battles with stuffed lions, and lifeless acting. Brix had already appeared as Hercules, a college rower, in the Jimmy Durante comedy Student Tour (1935), and went on to become the hero of cherishable 12-episode kiddie matinee serials in which wooden acting hardly mattered. In Shadow of Chinatown (1936), Brix battled mad Oriental scientist Bela Lugosi; in Hawk of the Wilderness (1938), he was a &quot;white savage&quot; reared by natives who saves his people from a witchdoctor; in The Fighting Devil Dogs (1938) he was a marine tracking down a master criminal, and in Daredevils of the Red Circle (1939), he was a circus performer hunting a dangerous lunatic. He then took acting lessons, changed his name to Bruce Bennett, signed with Columbia and returned to the screen in 1940 in a suit and hat. That year he made four B pictures - two with Boris Karloff, The Man With Nine Lives and Before I Hang - and as the lead in The Secret Seven, he was a former crook who forms a secret society of forensic scientists. Bennett was the handsome but dour hero of further competent B pictures, including three movies in which he tracked down Nazi agents: Underground Agent and Sabotage Squad (both 1942), and U-Boat Prisoner (1944). In 1945, Bennett moved on to Warner Bros where he appeared in more prestigious films in good supporting roles. Bennett brought dignity to the role of Joan Crawford&apos;s first husband in Mildred Pierce (1945), restraining himself from punching his successor, no-good playboy Zachary Scott. There followed three pictures in which he lent dullish support to three of Warners other &quot;sacred monsters&quot;: Bette Davis in A Stolen Life (1946), Ida Lupino in The Man I Love (1947) and Ann Sheridan in Nora Prentiss (1947). He was again lumbered with thankless &quot;other man&quot; roles in Dark Passage (1947), starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and in the western Silver River (1948) where Errol Flynn in love with Bennett&apos;s wife (Ann Sheridan), sends him out on a fatal mission. But Bennett was good as a doggerel-spouting robber in Raoul Walsh&apos;s Cheyenne (1947), and as the wandering Texan prospector in John Huston&apos;s The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). Freelancing during the next decade, he was Joan Crawford&apos;s lawyer in Sudden Fear (1952), warning her against her husband Jack Palance, and, looking elegant in the saddle featured in westerns like The Younger Brothers (1949), The Last Outpost (1951), where he played Ronald Reagan&apos;s brother, and Three Violent People (1957). Towards the end of his film career Bennett returned to the kind of stories that Herman Brix had handled in the 1930s. In The Alligator People (1959), he portrayed a doctor who operates on scaly-skinned Lon Chaney Jr, cutting off the reptile man&apos;s tail to get him into a pair of trousers. Bennett then co-wrote The Fiend of Dope Island (1961), starring as a dictatorial self-proclaimed baron of a Caribbean island, living off blackmarket arms and marijuana. After retiring from films, Bennett became a sales manager of a vending machine company, and went into real estate. Bennett&apos;s wife died in 2000. He is survived by two children. \u00b7 Bruce Bennett (Herman Brix), film actor, born May 19 1906; died February 24 2007", "sentences": ["Seven years after winning a shot put silver medal at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics , the 6ft 2in Brix was picked by Edgar Rice Burroughs to star in the author&apos;s The New Adventures of Tarzan."], "title": "Obituary: Bruce Bennett", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/apr/17/guardianobituaries.obituaries2", "tags": ["US news", "World news", "Film"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-16T23:57:10Z", "article": "Step off the streets of Soho, down a flight of stairs where the warm, glowing walls whisper sweet nothings to you and enter Amora, London&apos;s first permanent sex exhibition. Pay your \u00a312 (\u00a315 in the evening) and learn about the mechanics of the perfect kiss, the biology of an orgasm, and how hard to spank so it hurts. But despite its location in the basement of the tourist trap the Trocadero, its connections with Madame Tussauds, and the stag nights which will inevitably frequent it, Amora is billing itself as an &quot;academy for sex and relationships,&quot; with a mission to educate the public in the ways of love. Sarah Brewer, director of exhibits, said: &quot;There&apos;s a need for sex education which isn&apos;t boring and information which isn&apos;t sleazy. We want to improve attitudes. There was a play and film, No Sex Please, We&apos;re British. I think that&apos;s changed to sex please, we&apos;re British.&quot; But one Relate counsellor with connections to the project says: &quot;The question is how much is educational and how much is titillation, how much is going to be for the furthering of human interest and how much is for commercial gain.&quot; Johan Rizki, Amora&apos;s French founder, brought in an advisory board of counsellors, GPs and sex experts to oversee the exhibits and has courted sexual health charities during its three-year development, leading to a falling-out when they claimed endorsement by leading charities, including the Terrence Higgins Trust, which turned out to be unfounded. The Guardian reported the row a year ago and now has been invited in for a tour ahead of the public opening tomorrow. The &quot;academy&quot; title is aimed at avoiding sleazy comparisons with the sex museums of New York and Amsterdam. Its interactive video exhibits are explicit and it has a resident sex therapist. It aims to be entertaining and educational, though it&apos;s hard to tell which first. A wall of sex toys - oddly including a range of silicone breast implants - is accompanied by videos of models demonstrating their use. A model of a man bent over invites you to spank him with a paddle, with lights showing whether you&apos;ve gone too far, like a fairground test-your-strength machine. A plaster cast of a man and a women invite you to feel inside for their G spot or prostate. &quot;That&apos;s it,&quot; they say encouragingly when you hit the right spot. Some ask whether the great British public is ready for a sensible discussion about sex in such explicit terms. Kaye Wellings, a social scientist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who undertook one of the largest studies of sexual behaviour and attitudes in the UK in 2000, says: &quot;We can&apos;t handle it in the way that the Danes or Dutch can, in a matter-of-fact, down-to-earth way. But at the same time we are desperately in need of down-to-earth sex advice. &quot;One problem is that we&apos;ve glamorised sex to the extent that ordinary people feel uncomfortable when they don&apos;t live up to their imagination. If the Sex Academy does that it&apos;s a shame.&quot; At Amora the walls heave with images of men and women, the majority young and toned. Dr Brewer, whose day job is GP and sexual health specialist, says: &quot;We&apos;re trying to be entertaining and educational at the same time. We need that balance to attract people and try to help them improve their sex lives as well. We have worked hard to ensure that it&apos;s inclusive. We refused funding from the porn industry.&quot; Funding comes from Mr Rizki&apos;s investment bank background. Amora expects 500,000 visitors in the first year, spending \u00a320 a head on tickets, in the gift shop and bar: a \u00a310m income, with \u00a32m running costs. A roadshow is planned to take parts of the show round the country. Dr Brewer maintains the time is right for Amora. &quot;We have Channel 4 showing some interesting programmes, Scarlet magazine, an erotica exhibition which attracts 75,000 people every year; the time is very apt.&quot; Genevieve Clark, of the Terrence Higgins Trust, the HIV charity, said: &quot;We&apos;re British - it&apos;s easier to have sex than to talk about it. This kind of thing [a sex academy] can be a little Benny Hill but we need more things to get people talking sensibly about sex.&quot; Paula Hill, a Relate relationship counsellor, says: &quot;When I first heard about it I thought it was a great idea. But I think it has become more of a commercial enterprise. If the images are too glamorised it continues the myth that sex is for healthy, fit, active people and that only those people can enjoy it.&quot; Changing times 1950 Average age for a woman to lose virginity is 21.

Although Barclays secured another crucial 48 hours to try to hammer out a \u00a380bn merger agreement with ABN Amro, it became clear that even the announcement of an agreed deal would not stop the Dutch bank&apos;s management from talking to rival suitors.   ABN Amro had originally granted Barclays a 30 day period of exclusive talks - which expires tomorrow - to try to create a top five global bank but has now agreed to extend that exclusive period until the end of Friday.   This suggests that despite 30 days of intense negotiations, Barclays and ABN Amro are yet to agree the terms of a deal that would propel both banks in to the premier league and earn the title of the biggest cross-border deal in Europe.   Amid speculation that the talks were running into trouble, both sides cautioned today that there was still &quot;no certainty&quot; that the talks would lead to a deal or what form any transaction would take.   The two sides are thought to still be discussing the terms of any deal, regulatory issues and the structure of the combined entity&apos;s board. They have already admitted that Barclays will chose the chief executive - widely expected to be the existing Barclays chief executive John Varley - and that ABN Amro will name the chairman. This is thought likely to be Arthur Martinez, the chairman of the Dutch bank.   There is also speculation that Barclays is also willing to consider carving up ABN Amro in an attempt to secure the highest possible offer price for the group.   It needs to convince the management of ABN Amro - and perhaps more importantly its disillusioned shareholders - that its can top any proposal by the three-bank consortium led by RBS which analysts have estimated could pay as much as euro40 a share. ABN Amro&apos;s shares closed yesterday 2.3% higher at \u20ac36.40, above the \u20ac34 that many believe is the maximum Barclays can afford to pay. ABN Amro has risen 25% since the talks with Barclays leaked a month ago. Barclays, which could fall prey to a takeover itself if the bid talks fail, fell 8p to 748p.   Few details are available about how RBS and its co-bidders Santander of Spain and Fortis of Belgium would structure their audacious and complex approach to the Dutch bank to split it into three parts.   ABN Amro said today that it had agreed to a request to a meeting with the trio next week - after the extended exclusive period with Barclays had ended. It has &quot;invited all signatories [to a letter] to a meeting in Amsterdam early next week to seek clarification of their intentions and interests&quot;.   It is thought that the three banks plan to use their shares and some cash to table an unprecedented three-way bid for ABN Amro, which is under pressure from shareholders to conduct a merger or split itself up.   The London-based hedge fund TCI, which has been pushing for change at ABN Amro, used the announcement of the extension of the exclusivity period as a rallying call to other shareholders to support its attempt to break up the Dutch bank.   At next week&apos;s annual meeting of ABN Amro shareholders, TCI has tabled five resolutions ranging from selling or merging business and returning any proceeds to investors.   Christopher Hohn, head of TCI, said: &quot;Voting for these corporate governance-related agenda items and will send a clear message to the board: shareholders expect the board to pursue the best transation - merger, sale or break-up - which will maximise shareholder value&quot;.   &quot;Although we applaud the board for holding merger talks with Barclays, the approach made to the ABN Amro board by the Royal Bank of Scotland consortium makes it imperative that shareholders insist on an open and fair process, whether it is a merger, sale or breakup,&quot; he added.

It owes its emergence as the world&apos;s 13th largest bank to a series of mergers and acquisitions over the past 40 years. Under Rijkman Groenink, chief executive since 2000, the bank spearheaded the campaign against national protectionism by taking on the Italian authorities and entrenched financial interests in its ultimately successful bid for Banco Antonveneta two years ago. Italy&apos;s central bank governor and chief banking regulator, Antonio Fazio, paid the price for resisting the takeover with all manner of scheming and subterfuge by being forced to resign. His Dutch counterpart, Nout Wellink, helped trigger the actual battle for ABN by calling the break-up moves by hedge fund TCI as a &quot;bridge too far&quot; earlier this year. The bank owes its origins to the heyday of Dutch imperialism in the East Indies in the 1800s. It was set up by King William I in 1824 as the Netherlands Trading Society to revive national trade and industry after the Napoleonic incorporation into France. The company extracted taxes in what is now Indonesia, in the form of tea, coffee, rubber and sugar for fuelling Dutch trade and became the state banker. Its banking activities, which really date from the 1880s, expanded significantly after the second world war. In 1964, the same year Rotterdam Bank and Amsterdam Bank merged to form Amro, it took over Twentsche Bank to form ABN. The two merged entities completed their own marriage, designed to benefit from the EU&apos;s single market, in 1991. Using LaSalle Bank, first bought in 1978, it established a strong foothold in the American mid-west, primarily Chicago and Detroit, through acquisitions worth $4.75bn and secured the merger with Brazil&apos;s Banco Real in 1998 to create its third main market. It took over City stockbrokers Hoare Govett in 1992 and Swedish investment bankers Alfred Berg in 1996. It is now seeking the takeover of Pakistan&apos;s Prime Bank. But its 2006 results, showing a \u20ac1.2bn provision for bad loans and \u20ac4.8bn in net profits boosted only by asset sales, prompted TCI to make its break-up move for the annual meeting next week. The bank, which sponsors the declining football asset Ajax, had fallen far short of Mr Groenink&apos;s target of being in the top five for return on equity and became vulnerable to a takeover.", "sentences": ["In 1964, the same year Rotterdam Bank and Amsterdam Bank merged to form Amro, it took over Twentsche Bank to form ABN."], "title": "Amro: child of the Dutch empire that grew into a world bank", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/17/8", "tags": ["Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-17T22:50:45Z", "article": "The three banks trying to spoil Barclays&apos; attempts to merge with ABN Amro to create a top five global bank are no strangers to mergers and acquisitions. Royal Bank of Scotland has clinched so many deals over the years that its chief executive, Sir Fred Goodwin, has been dubbed a &quot;megalomaniac&quot;. Spanish bank Santander, with which RBS has a close relationship and which is run by the deal-hungry Emilio Botin, owns Abbey in the UK. Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch bank and insurer slated to take over ABN Amro&apos;s retail banking operations in Holland, was itself created through a merger. Speculation that RBS and Santander might work together on a joint bid for ABN Amro had mounted shortly after Barclays first declared its hand. Until Santander took over Abbey in 2004, the two banks had joint holdings in each other and representatives on each other&apos;s boards. Fortis, with headquarters in both Brussels and Utrecht, was less expected but its inclusion has helped answer analysts&apos; questions about what would be done with the Dutch retail banking operations of ABN Amro. Even so, it has also led to discussions about whether Dutch regulators might ask questions about the combined market shares of Fortis and ABN Amro in the Netherlands, where the merged operations could end up with 40% of the market. Fortis is also the institution whose shares may prove to be least attractive in any share-cash offer put together by the consortium. Its shares are listed primarily in Amsterdam and Brussels, it is subject to both countries&apos; corporate governance codes and will hold annual meetings on the same day, May 23, in both its headquarter cities. Forged from the 1990 merger of Dutch insurer AMEV with Dutch bank VSB and, later that year, Belgian insurer AG group, it claims that its corporate ancestors helped the US finance its acquisition of Louisiana from the French and traded with Catherine the Great of Russia - and it was the first cross-border banking merger in the EU. The group, which made a net profit of \u20ac4.4bn (\u00a33bn) in 2006, has a twin-headed strategy: expansion through acquisition in the Benelux countries and in the rest of the world, especially Asia and the US. Some City sources suggested that by entering the fray for ABN Amro, Fortis might find itself the subject of a bid. RBS, interested in ABN&apos;s US business La Salle and its London-based wholesale bank, is the institution likely to face the toughest questions from its investors. Sir Fred Goodwin, the bank&apos;s chief executive, recently told reporters he felt he was out of the &quot;sin bin&quot; with regards to his takeover record - sparked by disquiet about the price paid for Charter One in the US and a presence in China. But he admitted he might not have done enough to get support for a deal. His track record on other acquisitions is proven, though. He was a crucial part of the team that launched a hostile bid for NatWest in 1999 and stole the underperforming bank from arch-rival Bank of Scotland. Santander again played a crucial role in supporting RBS during this arduous bid. Based in Santander, Spain, it has been built through a series of acquisitions in Europe and Latin America.", "sentences": ["Its shares are listed primarily in Amsterdam and Brussels, it is subject to both countries&apos; corporate governance codes and will hold annual meetings on the same day, May 23, in both its headquarter cities."], "title": "Three spoilers are used to the rough and tumble", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/17/12", "tags": ["Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-17T22:50:45Z", "article": "Cross-border banking deals in Europe used to be considered next to impossible on the grounds that management egos, currency complications or national pride usually got in the way. Now, apparently, a consortium of banks from Britain, Spain and Belgium can contemplate carving up the Netherlands&apos; financial champion. It&apos;s a fast-moving world or, put another way, there are a lot of City investment bankers whose bonuses this year depend on them being at the front of the pack when ABN Amro is sold. The Dutch bank represents a large carcass. ABN, no doubt, would prefer there still to be some doubt about whether there will be a transaction at all but, frankly, it&apos;s a bit late for that. When it opened its books to Barclays, it put itself into play. That&apos;s just the way the brutal world of takeovers works. Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Fortis will surely be granted similar access to Barclays in a matter of days. All of which threatens to make Barclays&apos; charm offensive - including the offer to move the headquarters to Amsterdam - look like a waste of time. If Barclays can&apos;t offer as much as the consortium, then the softer considerations only become relevant if the Dutch financial regulator objects to a carve up. That is not impossible but is not the way to bet. The consortium has the considerable advantage that it should be able to pay more. Barclays and ABN have little overlap - that&apos;s part of the appeal as Barclays&apos; chief executive, John Varley, sells it - but RBS et al should be able to extract substantial cost savings from their chosen pieces. If the result is an offer of \u20ac34 a share from Barclays and \u20ac38 from the consortium, it&apos;s not really a contest. RBS and its pals still have to find an acceptable currency in which to pay but that, presumably, is where the investment bankers earn their millions. Varley should pitch his best price immediately, promise to complete at electric speed and pray the momentum lasts. Unfortunately for him, RBS&apos; shareholders, who normally suffer panic attacks at the mention of acquisitions, seem to like this one. Sir Fred Goodwin, chief executive of RBS, will take that as an invitation to go for the jugular. Sound as a pound The $2 pound, or the 50p dollar, has happened twice in the past 25 years, and, after 9.30am today, we could be there again. Data for the consumer price index - the measure of core inflation - will be released this morning and consensus opinion holds that a strong number for March, say 3% or even 2.9%, would be enough to deliver the necessary upward kick to sterling from yesterday&apos;s level of $1.99. A stronger inflation figure would mean that an interest rate rise in May would be regarded as a dead cert, rather than merely highly probable, and that more increases might follow. Sterling, goes the theory, could then be off to the races, given the mixed signals from the Americans about which direction their interest rates are going next. Except that a $2 pound is one of those rare situations when the normally vacuous phrase &quot;psychologically significant&quot; means something. It is not just currency speculators who swear by the wisdom that nobody ever lost money by buying dollars at two to the pound. British companies importing from the US would be highly tempted to lock in future profits by hedging their exposure. In the same spirit, British travellers to the US have been paying for hotels in advance, Virgin Atlantic says. All, no doubt, know that the last time sterling hit $2 was in 1992 when it was propped up by membership of the ERM. When that support collapsed, $1.45 followed within the year. If currency markets were so simple to read, of course, we would not be at $1.99 now. Indeed, a certain slice of hot money will be betting against the crowd, on the principle that if $2 is passed then the break may not be a matter of a cent or two. But that&apos;s a gamble for the professionals. The rest of us can reflect that the UK economy has not become un-coupled from activity in the US. The experience of the past 25 years is still relevant. Wind of change A diary item in the weekend papers reported that Matt Barrett, the former chairman of Barclays, had sold his Chelsea home and moved into rented accommodation, having decided that an offer of 25% above the asking price was too good to miss. The tale may or may not be exaggerated but it does chime with the idea that some smart people are taking money off the property table. In the US, Sam Zell sold his Equity Office empire. Over here, Sir John Ritblat sold most of his British Land shares.

While the champagne was flowing, the real celebrations were being kept on ice. Kheraj, who is keen to leave Britain&apos;s third biggest bank to try his hand at something new, has been persuaded to stay on to mastermind Barclays&apos; attempts to pull off a historic \u00a380bn marriage with Dutch rival ABN Amro. The next 24 hours could help to determine whether Barclays executives crack open the champagne again soon. The talks to create what would be the world&apos;s fifth biggest bank and catapult Barclays from its current ranking outside the top 10 have been given a new urgency since a trio of rivals, led by Royal Bank of Scotland, revealed a break-up plan for ABN Amro. The clock is also ticking on Barclays&apos; 30-day exclusivity period which ends tomorrow, with the Dutch bank&apos;s management piling pressure on Barclays to announce a deal to combine with ABN Amro and leapfrog RBS to become Britain&apos;s second biggest bank. If Barclays fails to come up with an agreement that suits the Dutch bank, it could find itself at the end of speculation that it too will be taken over - an eventuality Barclays&apos; management will want to avoid. One banker believes the coming hours are a &quot;test of character&quot; for John Varley, Barclays chief executive, and other members of his aggressive management team. The indicators - notably ABN Amro&apos;s share price - suggest to some analysts that Barclays should walk away. Emotionally, rival bankers wonder whether the egos of the Barclays team will make such a hard-headed decision more difficult. Mr Varley, who is married into one of the founding families of the Barclays empire, has made it clear many times that he regards acquisitions as the servant of his strategy rather than the master. After the rise in ABN Amro&apos;s share price yesterday the City will be watching for evidence that he is true to his word. Banking analysts believe Barclays can offer up to \u20ac34 (\u00a323) a share for ABN Amro - below yesterday&apos;s closing price - which suggests that if a deal is agreed, it may have to be pitched against the prevailing share price. Speculation is mounting that Barclays may try to form a consortium - or at least sell off bits of ABN to help boost the price it can offer. &quot;In our view, in order to remain in the competition, Barclays will need to go back to its drawing board and consider either selling some ABN assets in a competitive tender or construct its own consortium,&quot; analysts at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods said. They did not rule out other joint bids being tabled. Despite increasing scepticism among City analysts, major investors cautioned that little was known about the plan of the RBS-led consortium and that it may be too intricately structured to succeed. Barclays and ABN Amro were pressing on with their negotiations last night and while tomorrow&apos;s deadline may pass without announcement, neither side seems ready to give up on their grand plan just yet. Next week&apos;s annual meeting of ABN Amro - coincidentally on the same day as Barclays&apos; - seems to be another obvious deadline by which any deal will need to be clinched. For Barclays it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity - despite the concession to the Dutch to move its headquarters to Amsterdam. Barclays executives are expected to dominate the management team of the combined group - though possibly excluding Mr Kheraj&apos;s successor, Chris Lucas, who joined this month. Alex Potter, analyst at stockbroker Collins Stewart, said: &quot;Barclays is playing this right. If ABN Amro is giving you the opportunity [to have talks] you are an idiot not to talk to them. It doesn&apos;t mean you are desperate.&quot; That is unlikely to stop tongues wagging that a big American bank such as Bank of America or JP Morgan or one of the large French banks such as BNP Paribas will try to pounce on Barclays if the talks fail.

In a surprise move, the Dutch central bank made it clear it had made its concerns over a carve up known to the consortium which comprises RBS, Santander of Spain and Fortis of Belgium. The strongly worded statement appeared to contradict previous remarks in which it suggested it would not stand in the way of ABN Amro being carved up. The heads of the three suitor banks have been invited to a meeting with the management of ABN Amro early next week after a period of exclusive talks with Barclays runs its course.  Barclays has been in talks with ABN Amro since March but the two sides are yet to agree the terms of any deal which would create one of the top five banks in the world. The consortium has yet to reveal how it would structure any bid for ABN Amro but it is believed to be planning to split the bank up, allowing RBS to take its La Salle bank in the US, Santander to take operations in Latin America and southern Europe and Fortis to buy the Dutch banking business. The Dutch central bank said: &quot;From a prudential point of view, an offer by a consortium would constitute a strong risk-increasing and complicating factor, both in the preparation of the transaction and in its execution and implementation.&quot; It continued: &quot;Given its role as prudential supervisor and central bank, [the Dutch central bank], responsible for the soundness and prudence of banking policy, will assess a concrete proposal, should one be made, with meticulous care. &quot;[We] will, among other things, examine whether the parties have succeeded in adequately addressing said risks.&quot; The regulator is also in talks with Barclays and ABN Amro about their merger.  Under their proposal, the Dutch central bank would be lead regulator of any combined entity. The enlarged group would be headquartered in Amsterdam rather than London suggesting that the Financial Services Authority would have to take a secondary role. An exclusive period of talks - due to run out tonight - has been extended to Friday to allow ABN Amro and Barclays to thrash out the price at which the deal could be done.  Barclays is under pressure from its investors not to overpay for ABN Amro, which, at the same time, needs to find the highest price it can.  Barclays is estimated to be able to pay little more than \u008034 a share for ABN Amro but is now considering selling off La Salle, ABN Amro&apos;s US bank, to try to bolster any offer price.  The RBS-led consortium could offer as much as \u008040 a share, according to analysts, which has helped to push ABN Amro&apos;s shares to record highs in recent days.  However, they slipped back almost 1% to \u008036.13 yesterday after the Dutch central bank&apos;s remarks.

Although Barclays secured another crucial 48 hours to try to hammer out an \u00a380bn merger with the Dutch bank, it became clear that even the announcement of an agreed deal would not stop ABN Amro&apos;s management talking to rival suitors. The embattled Dutch bank had originally granted Barclays a 30-day period of exclusive talks - expiring today - to pursue its aim of creating a top five global bank. But it has now agreed to extend that exclusive period until the end of Friday. Despite a month of intense negotiations, Barclays and ABN Amro have yet to agree the terms of what would be the biggest cross-border deal in Europe, which would propel both into the banking elite. Both sides cautioned yesterday that there was still &quot;no certainty&quot; of a deal or what form any transaction would take. The two sides are thought to be still discussing the terms of any deal, regulatory issues and the structure of the combined entity&apos;s board. They have already admitted that Barclays will chose the chief executive - widely expected to be the existing Barclays chief, John Varley - and that the Dutch bank will name the chairman. This is thought likely to be Arthur Martinez, ABN Amro&apos;s chairman. There is also speculation that Barclays is willing to consider carving up ABN Amro in an attempt to secure the highest possible offer price for the group. It needs to convince the management of ABN Amro - and perhaps more importantly its disillusioned shareholders - that it can top any proposal by the three-bank consortium led by RBS, which analysts have estimated could pay as much as \u20ac40 (\u00a327) a share. ABN Amro&apos;s shares closed yesterday 2.3% higher at \u20ac36.40 - above the \u20ac34 that many believe is the maximum Barclays can afford to pay. Barclays, which could fall prey to a takeover itself if the bid talks fail, fell 8p to 748p yesterday. Few details are available about how RBS and its co-bidders, Santander of Spain and Fortis of Belgium, would structure their audacious and complex approach to the Dutch bank to split it into three parts. ABN Amro said yesterday that it had agreed to a request to meet the trio next week - after the exclusive period with Barclays has ended. It thought that the bank felt obliged to agree to a meeting because of the pressure it was facing from its own investors. It has &quot;invited all signatories [to a letter asking to talk] to a meeting in Amsterdam early next week to seek clarification of their intentions and interests&quot;. It is thought that the three banks plan to use shares and some cash to table an unprecedented three-way bid for ABN Amro, which is under pressure to conduct a merger or split itself up. The London-based hedge fund TCI, which has been pushing for change at ABN Amro, used the announcement of the extension of the exclusivity period as a rallying call to other shareholders to support its attempt to break up the Dutch bank. At next week&apos;s annual meeting of ABN Amro shareholders, TCI has tabled five resolutions on selling or merging businesses and returning proceeds to investors. Christopher Hohn, head of TCI, said: &quot;Voting for these corporate governance-related agenda items will send a clear message to the board: shareholders expect the board to pursue the best transaction - merger, sale or break-up - which will maximise shareholder value ... it [is] imperative that shareholders insist on an open and fair process.&quot;", "sentences": ["It has &quot;invited all signatories [to a letter asking to talk] to a meeting in Amsterdam early next week to seek clarification of their intentions and interests&quot;."], "title": "Barclays gets two more days to agree merger with ABN", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/18/14", "tags": ["Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-18T23:00:01Z", "article": "The Dutch central bank waded into the battle for control of ABN Amro yesterday by objecting to plans being proposed by a Royal Bank of Scotland consortium to carve up the Dutch bank. In a surprise move, the Dutch central bank made it clear that it had made its concerns known to the consortium, which comprises RBS, Santander of Spain and Fortis of Belgium. A strongly worded statement appeared to contradict previous remarks in which it suggested it would not stand in the way of ABN Amro being carved up. The heads of the three suitor banks have been invited to a meeting with ABN Amro management early next week after a period of exclusive talks with Barclays runs its course. Barclays has been in talks with ABN Amro since March but the two sides have yet to agree the terms of a deal that would create one of the five biggest banks in the world. The consortium has yet to reveal how it would structure any bid for ABN Amro but it is believed to be planning to split the bank up, allowing RBS to take its La Salle bank in the US, Santander to take operations in Latin America and southern Europe and Fortis to buy the Dutch banking business. The Dutch central bank said: &quot;From a prudential point of view, an offer by a consortium would constitute a strong risk-increasing and complicating factor, both in the preparation of the transaction and in its execution and implementation. &quot;Given its role as prudential supervisor and central bank, responsible for the soundness and prudence of banking policy, it will assess a concrete proposal, should one be made, with meticulous care.&quot; The regulator is also in talks with Barclays and ABN Amro about their merger plan. Under their proposal, the Dutch central bank would be lead regulator of any combined entity. The enlarged group would be headquartered in Amsterdam rather than London, suggesting that the Financial Services Authority would have to take a secondary role. An exclusive period of talks, due to run out last night, has been extended to Friday to allow ABN Amro and Barclays to thrash out the price at which the deal could be done. Barclays is under pressure from its investors not to overpay for ABN Amro, whichmust find the highest price it can. Barclays is estimated to be able to pay little more than \u20ac34 (\u00a323) a share for ABN Amro but is considering selling off La Salle to try to bolster any offer price. The RBS-led consortium could offer as much as \u20ac40 a share, according to analysts, which has helped to push ABN Amro&apos;s shares to record highs in recent days.

On the road it is different. No longer is there fear surrounding the smiling assassin. This Sunday Gebrselassie, the greatest distance runner of his generation, competes in the London Marathon for the third time. He is one of the favourites, but he has yet to triumph in a race which looked made for him. Gebrselassie&apos;s record of finishing third in 2002 and then ninth 12 months ago bears no comparison with his amazing reign on the track in which he won two Olympic 10,000m gold medals and four World Championship titles and broke 22 world records. Even now, with three international marathon victories behind him, he is here without an aura. &quot;I respect him for what he has done; he is a great athlete,&quot; the defending London champion, Felix Limo of Kenya, said yesterday. &quot;But I do not fear him. If you start fearing someone before the start then you lose already. He has run a number of marathons and he must have learned something. Saying he has not adapted is not a big issue, but maybe he knows himself. We have to respect the marathon.&quot; Gebrselassie was 34 yesterday. He is the third fastest man in the race and he will compete with a record of winning marathons in Amsterdam in 2005 and in Berlin, where he ran a best time of 2hr 05min 56sec, the fifth quickest in history, and in Fukuoka last year. But for an Ethiopian athlete so dominant no matter the opponent on the track, Gebrselassie has yet to deliver when confronted with the best marathon runners in the world. On Sunday his credentials for the 26.2 miles at this level will again be put to the test when he will meet Paul Tergat of Kenya, the world record-holder, and the Olympic champion, Stefano Baldini of Italy, among others, with the level of competition again looking his biggest problem. &quot;Every time he has run in London he has not had a good day,&quot; said Limo. &quot;I never know why he has not won in London. Maybe it is because they are tough guys.&quot; Gebrselassie&apos;s ability to show he has the endurance for the marathon in a race which is run fast and is packed with as many leading contenders as Sunday&apos;s is still in doubt, despite his three wins over the distance. As Limo said: &quot;In Berlin there was no challenge; in Fukuoka there was no challenge; in Amsterdam there was no challenge. You tell me who was in Berlin or Amsterdam or Fukuoka. He has proven he can run 2:05, but with the challenge? &quot;The key is to relax and focus and respect the marathon itself. The top cream of the world is here and anyone is a winner. You can never underestimate your colleagues. They are all strong.&quot; Whether Gebrselassie can now deliver provides one of the fascinating themes of the men&apos;s race. He has targeted the marathon at the Olympic Games in Beijing next summer, but as he said: &quot;The marathon is not an easy thing. It&apos;s not like the 10,000m or 5,000m. The marathon is very special.&quot; Yet David Bedford believes this may be Gebrselassie&apos;s year. &quot;You have to remember that in 2002 he was close to the world record run in the race by Khalid Khannouchi and that was Haile&apos;s international debut at the distance,&quot; said the race director of the London Marathon. &quot;That performance indicated to me that he has a world-record run in him. He has been learning his trade. This year we will see an amazing performance from him.&quot;", "sentences": ["He is the third fastest man in the race and he will compete with a record of winning marathons in Amsterdam in 2005 and in Berlin, where he ran a best time of 2hr 05min 56sec, the fifth quickest in history, and in Fukuoka last year.", "As Limo said: &quot;In Berlin there was no challenge; in Fukuoka there was no challenge; in Amsterdam there was no challenge.", "You tell me who was in Berlin or Amsterdam or Fukuoka."], "title": "London Marathon: Gebrselassie must rise to challenge of the road", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/apr/19/athletics.sport", "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport", "Haile Gebrselassie"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-19T08:14:15Z", "article": "4.30pm update: It&apos;s blood on the carpet time after one radio chap offers such a devastating critique of a fellow radio man&apos;s Sony award-winning business that I almost feel sorry for him. We&apos;re talking about show prep services. What&apos;s a show prep service? These are companies that put together bundles of gags, quotes, birthdays, brainteasers and so on for DJs to use when they can&apos;t think of anything else to say. Brett Harley of Murf Media runs one of these things - it is called Bitz and Pieces - and he is understandably quite proud of it. It offers 15 pages of new material every day. Oh, and Chris Tarrant likes it. But fellow speaker Trevor Jordan, breakfast producer on Emap&apos;s Key 103, doesn&apos;t. Here&apos;s what he thinks of Brett&apos;s 15 pages of material. &quot;We only read the first one, we only read the gags.&quot; Okay then, so what does he think of it? &quot;Twenty pretty lame one-liners and watered down puns.&quot; Oh. Trevor says show prep is like &quot;generic voices on sticks. Radio on autocue. It is killing creativity. I do love you Brett, but it really annoys me. Don&apos;t take it personally.&quot; I can&apos;t tell if Brett has taken it personally or not - he has had the same fixed grin for the last 10 minutes. I would have had more sympathy for the Bitz and Pieces man if hadn&apos;t used phrases like &quot;fail to prepare, prepare to fail&quot;. Still, perhaps an audience vote can cheer him up. Who in the audience uses prep services? Only one person puts his hand up, and I think he is kidding. Who hates them? Lots of hands go up. Oh dear. Moving swiftly on, to podcasting! Thanks, by the way, for all the responses to my request for your 100 favourite podcasts yesterday. We will return to that anon. Just for a laugh someone plays a Daily Telegraph podcast from 2005 - it is someone reading out the business pages, word for word. Ah, how times have moved on. Chrysalis content manager Paul Sylvester says podcasting boosts listener loyalty and drives revenue - LBC&apos;s paid for podcasts have 10,000 subscribers and counting, at \u00a34 a month (or \u00a312 for six months. Not only that, suddenly your whole schedule is available around the clock. Well, at least the bits without music in. &quot;Most people who listen to Russell Brand are outside a youth club drinking White Lightning when his Radio 2 show is on,&quot; says Sylvester. Good point. Apart from that, podcasting is a fantastic marketing tool. Take Chris Moyles - please - who is regularly at the top of the iTunes chart. That&apos;s the sort of promotion money can&apos;t buy. But this warning from Sylvester: &quot;Don&apos;t put any old crap on a podcast becasue if they find it on iTunes and it&apos;s rubbish they will not listen to the radio station.&quot; A very good point. Just as it can spread the word of your radio station, it can also do untold damage to the brand if it is not up to scratch. Virgin Radio digital tsar James Cridland suggests a change of name would help. Let&apos;s not call them podcasts, he says, what about free digital downloads? Hmm, that&apos;s not very catchy either. But the word &quot;free&quot; always helps shift stuff, in my experience. Your suggestions please! 1.45pm update: In which we hear from Jamie Theakston, talk about Johnny Vaughan, and give thanks we are not two floors below. Heart FM breakfast man Jamie Theakston is the hottest property in the London breakfast show market at the moment. Top of the Rajars, along with his co-host Harriet Scott of course. So what does it feel like? Theakston says he is happier doing radio than at any time in his career. What, even The Priory on Channel 4? He once asked Radio 5 Live controller Bob Shennan if he could be a sports reporter on the station. Shennan told him to go and get some local radio experience instead. Ah, how things could have turned out differently - Theakston could have been the original Arlo White. But working at commercial radio was something of a shock to Theakston&apos;s sytem. All those graphs and data and attention to Rajar figures, which his Heart boss Mark Browning absolutely loves, apparently. It wasn&apos;t like that at the BBC. Talking of Rajars, GCap group programme director Dirk Anthony reveals when he first arrived at the group people were frightened to tell Johnny Vaughan his latest listening figures. Well, it&apos;s never fun to be the bearer of bad news, is it? I should point out that in the latest set of Rajars, the Capital breakfast man did rather better. Roll on next month! Anyway, back to Theakston, who you may be able to tell wasn&apos;t in the most revelatory of moods. At least, not when I was in the room. So how long does he expect to be with Heart, asked Gaby Logan. Will he last longer than Chris Tarrant did at Capital? &quot;Only after five or six years do people really feel comfortable with the show,&quot; says Theakston. We&apos;ll take that as a maybe. Still, if Theako wasn&apos;t full of scoops, at least we&apos;re not on the second floor of the Cafe Royal, where another conference is taking place, signposted &quot;Tax treatment of trusts post finance act 2006&quot;. Phew. That makes debating the finer points of digital rights management sound positively sexy. Which, I should add, we are not doing today. Back on planet radio, a big shout out to Radio 5&apos;s Phil Williams, co-host of today&apos;s event who bravely tried out a few gags as he introduced today&apos;s conference - and promptly died on his arse. Ten out of 10 for trying Phil, but radio types are the toughest crowd in the business. Even worse than the Bafta craft awards. Co-host Gaby says how glad she is to be back doing radio (she&apos;s been on Radio 5, like everyone else here, it seems). She says she was &quot;sucked in by ITV&quot; who wouldn&apos;t let her go on the wireless. Let it go, Gabs, let it go. Oh, and a note to memememe (below). Not so much technical problems as geographical ones. Still, they say anticipation is half the fun. Note for your diary: expect another update around 4-sh. 12.30pm update: Ah, the joys of dealing with talent! Which is what this session is all about. Behaviour expert Tracey Cox - you might remember her from Channel 4&apos;s Sex Inspectors - has some tips on how to deal with difficult people. Here goes. Don&apos;t treat people like a child, she says. Telling people to cheer up is the last thing to do - it will make them more miserable. &quot;Ignore bad behaviour and encourage good behaviour,&quot; she adds. &quot;You have got to have eye contact. If they look away when you are talking to them, stop talking. If they ask why you have stopped talking, say you need their full attention.&quot; Wow, this is great, I might try this at home. Carry on! &quot;If they give you bad body language, give them some back. Play with something on their desk. Or sit on their desk.&quot; Hmm. And if you&apos;re talking to Chris Moyles, make sure he doesn&apos;t sit on your desk, she doesn&apos;t add. Talking of Moyles, his agent Vivienne Clore is here. She says there is no such thing as &quot;difficult talent&quot;, just bad communication. Former Radio 1 music boss Trevor Dann begs to differ, saying DJs need the equivalent of a &quot;naughty step&quot;. Did he hear the bit earlier about not treating DJs like children? I should add at this point that it is either incredibly cold in here, or I am sitting under a giant air vent. Also the sound is terrible - never very good at a radio event - and it is really getting Trevor&apos;s goat. Naughty chair ahoy! Just so you can plan the rest of your day around this blog, Jamie Theakston is up next - read all about him here around 2-sh - and Chris Tarrant a bit later, being interviewed by Virgin Radio big kahuna, Paul Jackson. Midday update: So who have we heard from so far? Rod Liddle on Today, Kelvin MacKenzie on Northern Irish accents, and the student who was given an unlikely present by his parents for passing his exams (clue: it was in Amsterdam). First up were former Today editor Liddle and MacKenzie, ex-TalkSport boss and former Sun editor among other things, who were talking about... talk radio. Liddle doesn&apos;t like phone-ins. MacKenzie does, well, some of them, especially if they are about football. &quot;I don&apos;t give a toss what Des from Roxbourne thinks,&quot; says Liddle, thereby condemning most of the output of half the people in the audience. &quot;No disrespect but I like expensive radio. When I was at Today they said we had to &apos;enfranchise&apos; the listener. No you fucking haven&apos;t.&quot; So no listener text messages on Today, then, unlike, say, Radio 5 Live, where it sometimes feels like you are never more than 60 seconds from the next one. Listeners, says Liddle, want to hear from cabinet ministers and journalists who are expert in their field, not so-called &quot;ordinary&quot; people. Liz Barclay of Radio 4&apos;s You and Yours finds a lot of local radio utterly boring. Uh-oh - more offended people in the conference hall! No walk-outs yet. Ah, but hang on. Barclay says phone-ins can also throw up moments of magic radio. Example. She remembers a phone-in on BBC WM where a chap who had just done his exams revealed the reward his parents had given him - sleeping with a prostitute in Amsterdam. It was a story that the station was then able to follow up. And no doubt many others as well. MacKenzie says football phone-ins are great because fans often know a great deal more about their club than the manager does. But he says phone-ins are over-regulated so don&apos;t touch on the issues that people really care about - race, for example. We then hear a clip of Radio 5 Live and BBC Northern Ireland&apos;s phone-in king Stephen Nolan, who I find utterly unlistenable. Still makes a change to hear more than five seconds of him. MacKenzie isn&apos;t a fan either, but for different reasons. &quot;Have you got a translater?&quot; he asks. Busy making friends as usual, Kelvin says there are too many Northern Irish voices on the radio, and too many from the black country as well. Hang on a minute, Liddle&apos;s got a good thing to say about phone-ins. They do have a role, he says, in offering an alternative view to the mainstream, metropolitan mindset that dominates the BBC and much of the media. MacKenzie agrees. Two peas in a pod those two, even when the ex-Sun man is making unkind references to Liddle&apos;s &quot;first marriage&quot;. But MacKenzie is not so keen on the grand old man of phone-ins, Brian Hayes. &quot;He seemed like a bad tempered old git to me. I was glad he buggered off.&quot; 9am: It is the Radio Academy&apos;s Production 07 conference today at the Caf\u00e9 Royal in Central London. The name of the event doesn&apos;t quite do it justice, with Chris Tarrant, Rod Liddle, Kelvin MacKenzie, Jamie Theakston, Mark Story and Ben Cooper in attendance. There will even be a Dragons&apos; Den style opportunity for five producers to pitch their work to Radio 1 and Channel 4.

In his light-filled study at the top of his north London house, he is surrounded by scores of the Italian operas he has made his own over the past three decades: works by Verdi, Donizetti, Bellini and Rossini. And yet there&apos;s something strange about hearing this from a conductor who has become one of the most important figures in the British musical establishment. Ever since he began his 14 years as music director of English National Opera in 1979, creating the so-called &quot;powerhouse&quot; era with director David Pountney and general director Peter Jonas, Elder has been one of the iconic English musicians of his generation. Since 2000, he has transformed the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in Manchester, turning it from an also-ran - it was financially bankrupt and artistically moribund at the end of the 1990s - into arguably the most exciting of any in Britain. No orchestra plays Elgar better than the Hall\u00e9 at the moment, and no conductor seems to empathise with this quintessentially English music as profoundly as Elder. At the end of the month he returns to his first love, 19th-century Italian opera, with a new production of Verdi&apos;s rarely staged Stiffelio - &quot;a masterpiece&quot;, according to Elder - at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. It&apos;s a work that he&apos;s loved for nearly 40 years. &quot;It goes back to my time at Cambridge. Stiffelio was then hardly known, but the Rowe Music Library had a vocal score. I&apos;d only read about this work in history books, that it was a total failure, and that it was only interesting because it prepared the way for Rigoletto. A friend of mine was in the library, and my eye alighted on this vocal score of the piece. I said, &apos;Wow, look at that!&apos; The music has been inside me since 1969, and I always knew that it could make an impact in the theatre.&quot; Stiffelio is the story of a Protestant pastor whose wife betrays him, turning him from a reserved man of the cloth &quot;into a wild animal&quot;, as Elder says. It was a story that was massacred by the censors at its first performance in Trieste in 1850. Verdi wanted the libretto to stay as it was - &quot;nothing should be changed, nothing emasculated&quot;, he wrote - but the story offended the Italian authorities because of the final scene, which takes place in a church. &quot;But now we can reveal it as one of the most powerful dramas you can imagine,&quot; Elder says. &quot;Stiffelio is not some cul-de-sac in the Verdi canon that we have to be embarrassed about. It&apos;s absolutely in the centre of his art.&quot; Elder&apos;s love affair with opera goes back to his earliest musical memories. The second child of a large family, he grew up in north London and was sent to Bryanston in Dorset, where he was a chorister. &quot;Singing has always been primary for me. An orchestra that can&apos;t sing can&apos;t really communicate the soul of the music.&quot; While still a chorister he took up the bassoon and piano, and later harpsichord and organ, as well as acting. At Cambridge, he realised that conducting could be the thread that tied together all of his musical and theatrical enthusiasms. He also met David Pountney there, &quot;and he and I had a dream that we would run an opera company together in Manchester. Of course, the dream was a bit blurred when it came true, as the opera company was in London, and I&apos;ve ended up with the orchestra in Manchester.&quot; During one summer holiday at university, he had another propitious encounter, making his professional debut in Donizetti&apos;s Anna Bolena at Glyndebourne - not in the pit, but on stage: &quot;That&apos;s where I met Peter Jonas. We both had non-singing, walk-on parts. I was a sheriff, he was captain of the guards, and he had a big sword. I had a hugely expensive costume, but couldn&apos;t see anything that was going on as I had to take my specs off.&quot; Back at Cambridge, the first symphony he conducted was Beethoven&apos;s fourth, in his second year (&quot;the best thing that happened that year - apart from losing my virginity&quot;), and then he had a decision to make about how to pursue a career in conducting. &quot;There are basically two ways you can do it: either set up an orchestra, like Thomas Beecham and John Eliot Gardiner did, or get into it through the opera house, and that was obviously the way for me.&quot; After stints as a r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur at Glyndebourne and Covent Garden, playing for conductors Reginald Goodall and Georg Solti, Elder was taken under the wing of Edward Downes, arguably Britain&apos;s greatest ever Verdi conductor, who has done more to promote forgotten Verdi operas than anyone else. Downes took Elder with him for the opening seasons of the Sydney Opera House in 1973, where Elder conducted a huge variety of opera: Prokofiev&apos;s War and Peace one night, Verdi&apos;s Force of Destiny the next. And yet the man he says he&apos;s learnt most from is not a conductor, but a language coach: Ubaldo Gardini. &quot;When I first met him, he was the Italian coach, both at Glyndebourne and Covent Garden. And there are many people in the profession who, like me, owe him an incalculable amount. He gave me a fundamental awareness of the relationship between the heart and the brain in music-making. One without the other is a total disaster: academic performances that are completely dry, and performances that are all fire, which are indulgent and wildly over-emotional.&quot; More than any other music, Italian opera forces the conductor to achieve this elusive psychological and emotional balance. &quot;The Italian temperament gave the world naked works of art,&quot; Elder says. &quot;These operas are so pure and transparent and vulnerable, and in the theatre that vulnerability is something we&apos;re all conscious of. We&apos;ve all sat through appalling performances of Verdi, of Donizetti. The thing is, it&apos;s much easier to conduct Wagner&apos;s Tristan und Isolde than an opera by Donizetti or Bellini. Tristan is an instrumental tour de force, so even if the tenor is failing in the third act, you can still give the audience a fantastic experience of the piece. But the Italian works of the first half of the 19th century need to be ignited by the conductor. They will never go by themselves, you have to strike the match at every rehearsal and every performance. They won&apos;t produce any effect unless passion and rigour are integrated.&quot; It&apos;s a combustible combination that Elder&apos;s Verdi, Rossini or Donizetti performances have unerringly managed to achieve, whether at ENO, Glyndebourne, Covent Garden, or on record. &quot;I feel so in touch with the excitement and beauty of the music, and not all northern people do. Sometimes it&apos;s hard to get a northern European orchestra to make the simplicity of Italian music eloquent; it&apos;s as if they&apos;re thinking, &apos;God, this music&apos;s shit, there&apos;s nothing in it, it&apos;s just thin&apos;, whereas when I&apos;ve worked with Italian orchestras, they don&apos;t make you think that. They know that it&apos;s great music.&quot; Just as Elder does. Yet, strangely for someone so steeped in everything Italian - he, his wife and their daughter have often decamped to Umbria in the summer - Elder&apos;s other main passion is Wagner. He recently conducted the Hall\u00e9 in the third act of Wagner&apos;s Siegfried, performances that were universally acclaimed and gave a tantalising insight into what an Elder Ring cycle might sound like. But Elder&apos;s career with Wagner has not always been so happy. In Bayreuth in 1981, Elder was the first British conductor to conduct a new production there, that season&apos;s Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. It was an opportunity that the 34-year-old Elder couldn&apos;t refuse, but one that presented unique challenges in the crucible of the Wagner myth. An already intimidating atmosphere was made even more oppressive since the production&apos;s director was Wagner&apos;s grandson, Wolfgang. &quot;It was a great experience 10 years too early,&quot; he says. Does he regret going? &quot;Yes, because it affected the way my general career didn&apos;t get started until much later on. And Bayreuth is a very special place; it&apos;s a very unusual, very tricky theatre in which to conduct. And although I knew the piece very well, I just wasn&apos;t ready for that particular circus ring.&quot; Bayreuth&apos;s loss was ENO&apos;s gain throughout the 80s and early 90s, and Elder&apos;s career in Germany is now finally picking up momentum: he made his debut with the Berliner Philharmoniker last November; has just given his first concerts with the G\u00fcrzenich Orchestra in Cologne; and has an ongoing relationship with the Munich Philharmonic - as well as regular dates with the Chicago Symphony, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, and a close relationship with the London Philharmonic. But whatever the glamour of these international concerts, it&apos;s Manchester and the Hall\u00e9 that are at the centre of his musical life. &quot;I see the Hall\u00e9&apos;s role as so much more than a group of musicians who do concerts, but rather to be part of the personality of the whole north-west of England. There is a need for the orchestra to be part of its community, a central attraction, not just a sideshow.&quot; There&apos;s a commitment at the Hall\u00e9 to taking the music out of the concert hall. One scheme involves the players going into prisons, putting instruments in the hands of young offenders, letting them become part of the musical experience, and another takes the whole orchestra into schools. &quot;We play the best music, we don&apos;t play Star Wars,&quot; he says. &quot;Most recently we played the Force of Destiny overture, William Tell, and parts of Shostakovich&apos;s first symphony, which I told them I think of as a dreamlike accompaniment to a silent movie, and got them to imagine what&apos;s going on. There&apos;s no sense of dumbing down. And by God it&apos;s loud, with the full orchestra in a gym. None of those kids will be able to say that they don&apos;t know what a symphony orchestra sounds like.&quot; As he enters his seventh decade (he turns 60 in June this year), Elder has no thoughts of stopping: &quot;Conductors go on developing. Like claret. I dream that my relationship with the Hall\u00e9 will go on for years yet, to be fulfilling and challenging, for them as much as for me. I don&apos;t set a ceiling on that, I just take each period of time as it comes.&quot; But there are other ambitions, too. &quot;If there were at some point the chance to run an opera company somewhere, and if it seemed like the right team of people were going to be there to make it a success, then I would love that. I would like to travel more, to fulfil the restless part of my personality. Life is full of dreams coming true. So perhaps some of these dreams could one day be realised.&quot; Inspirations St Matthew Passion by JS Bach The Italian landscape G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung by Richard Wagner Symphony No 3 by Gustav Mahler Verdi, man and music", "sentences": ["And although I knew the piece very well, I just wasn&apos;t ready for that particular circus ring.&quot; Bayreuth&apos;s loss was ENO&apos;s gain throughout the 80s and early 90s, and Elder&apos;s career in Germany is now finally picking up momentum: he made his debut with the Berliner Philharmoniker last November; has just given his first concerts with the G\u00fcrzenich Orchestra in Cologne; and has an ongoing relationship with the Munich Philharmonic - as well as regular dates with the Chicago Symphony, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, and a close relationship with the London Philharmonic."], "title": "A life in music: Mark Elder", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview12", "tags": ["Classical music", "Books", "Music", "Culture", "Giuseppe Verdi", "Mark Elder", "Hall\u00e9 Orchestra"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-20T23:10:55Z", "article": "1 Berlin The sea may be a couple of hundred kilometres away but that doesn&apos;t stop Berliners donning their bikinis at the first sign of sunshine.

Clutching a can of vodka mix, he shook slightly as he described one of five jails hidden in the bowels of the ship, where he had slept: &quot;It&apos;s a box with a toilet and a little button you press for water.&quot; Freshly freed after a nine-hour stint for an alleged altercation over drinks, Alex was showing his friends the marks of the handcuffs. &quot;They took my pants away, so I was cold,&quot; he said. &quot;When they told me what I had done, I said: &apos;That&apos;s kind of ugly - I&apos;m sorry.&apos; Nine hours in a lockout makes you say anything!&quot; For Alex and most of the 600 Finnish economics students on yesterday&apos;s party cruise the drinking had begun at 7pm the previous day. As soon as the 660ft (202 metre) long Silja Europa departed Turku, in southern Finland, and started weaving its way through a pine archipelago towards Stockholm, the mainly student cargo formed giant queues in the duty free shop for cut-price drink. By the early hours the lower decks were carpeted with bottles, cans, toilet roll, wigs, cigarette butts and vomit stains. Student cruises have proved all the messy rage with Scandinavian students and, for better or worse, they are now on route to the UK if Ian Bishop and David Blyth, two 23-year-old business administration graduates and founders of Britain&apos;s first Student Cruise, get their way. &quot;It was just get on board, get wrecked, and have a good time,&quot; said Bishop, recalling his experience of a Norwegian student cruise. &quot;I enjoyed it, but in a geeky way I actually saw it as a business idea. I called up David on Skype from Oslo and said, &apos;Mate, we&apos;ve got to do this&apos;.&quot; Yesterday, dressed in sailor outfits, the pair began a tour of 15 campuses to promote 2,800 places for two October voyages they are planning from Newcastle to Amsterdam and Portsmouth to St Malo. They insist their trips, backed by their parents, will be more sophisticated than the Scandinavian model. Whereas yesterday&apos;s Finnish cruise cost as little as \u20ac2.50 (\u00a31.70) each for four sharing a third-class cabin, the Portsmouth and Newcastle overnight parties, both planned for Monday night departures during term time, are priced at \u00a370 and \u00a395 respectively. &quot;It&apos;s expensive enough to make sure we&apos;re attracting the right clientele,&quot; said Bishop. &quot;We&apos;re going for the &apos;it&apos; girls, the &apos;it&apos; guys, and the people around them - more affluent students - it&apos;s a slight cocktail of sociability with maybe a touch of arrogance.&quot; To this ambitious end their company, BB Events, is planning to offer at least one university rugby team free boarding to help lure, Bishop said, a &quot;slightly public school&quot; crowd. Dressed in university haalarit [coloured overalls] and, for some reason, sunglasses, yesterday&apos;s Finnish student partygoers were relatively well behaved, mingling with the older passengers on the upper decks. By most accounts, this was a tame crossing, compared with the infamous &quot;Goom&quot; cruises, reputed to have taken more than 100,000 Finnish students to sea since the mid-1990s. As midnight approached in the warren of third-class cabins, Karl Rehn, 22, from Vaasa, summed up the appeal. &quot;It&apos;s a feeling of togetherness,&quot; he said, wrapping his arm round a fellow student. &quot;We study the same - we feel a sense of being the same. On a cruise ship you have the infrastructure, you have bars, and you don&apos;t have to walk home.&quot; Leena Niskanen, a 21-year-old marketing student in a blonde Afro wig, said Finns were normally a timid people. &quot;We really don&apos;t like to talk to the opposite sex,&quot; she said, &quot;but when we drink everything changes. You&apos;ll see everywhere there are passed-out people and a lot of happy couples. These are people at university - intelligent people - but look at them: they don&apos;t look it!&quot; By 3am the less hardy were asleep, slumped on chairs like dribbling rag dolls. Most though were awake throughout the night, pounding the floor in the Moonlight Disco, playing drinking games or just sitting on the floor, howling songs at passers-by. Doing just that at 5am, Sari Haavisto, 24, the organiser of the Turku School of Economics contingent, said she was doubtful upmarket UK cruises would work. &quot;The reason people love this is because it is so cheap,&quot; she said. &quot;There&apos;s no reason to care.&quot; The drinking, singing and dancing continued on all afternoon. BB Events is keen to stress its product will comprise far more than cheap booze, and promises activities from stand-up comedians, dancers and poker to beauty pageants. But that&apos;s not to say there won&apos;t be &quot;shot girls&quot; - waitresses selling sharp doses of alcohol - and sponsors providing drink discounts. Speed-dating will ensure chances of romance on the ship are &quot;good to firm&quot;, promises Bishop, and students will have condoms waiting for them in their cabins. &quot;All the girls we&apos;ve spoken to have said they&apos;re coming to meet the guys on board. It will be one of those things: fit guys equals fit girls.&quot; &quot;The potential for it to grow is huge,&quot; added Blyth. &quot;But we are firmly focused on making sure this first year is a complete success.&quot; Organising the UK&apos;s inaugural student cruise, however, will not be plain sailing. Throughout Scandinavia there have been complaints about riotous behaviour on student cruises. In the US concerns have been raised about rowdiness aboard Spring Break Caribbean cruises, the American equivalent, and in Australia P&amp;O has abandoned this year&apos;s &quot;schoolies&quot; cruises, which last three nights and have culminated in arrests and allegations of sexual assault. A little optimistically, perhaps, promotion for Bishop and Blyth&apos;s cruises is now in full swing, even though the two operators running their routes, Brittany Ferries and DFDS Seaways, have yet to sign contracts. It is understood both companies have concerns about raucous behaviour on their ships, and at least one of the two is looking to Scandinavia for advice. Both ferry companies said they had not signed a contract and there is no guarantee they will do so, although they are in discussions. Bishop, however, remains confident the cruises will go ahead. He is in &quot;final negotiations&quot; and contracts will be signed next week, he said. &quot;They [students] might get pretty drunk, but they are not going to go around ripping the ship to shreds. They&apos;ll probably have a raging hangover the next day, but they&apos;ll love it.&quot; Celebrating after his incarceration yesterday, his second in his student cruising career, Alex was in no doubt that student cruises would prove a hit in the UK. &quot;The only country in the world with similar drinking habits to us is England,&quot; he said. &quot;Of course it will work.&quot;", "sentences": ["I called up David on Skype from Oslo and said, &apos;Mate, we&apos;ve got to do this&apos;.&quot; Yesterday, dressed in sailor outfits, the pair began a tour of 15 campuses to promote 2,800 places for two October voyages they are planning from Newcastle to Amsterdam and Portsmouth to St Malo."], "title": "Raves on the ocean wave", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/21/highereducation.students", "tags": ["UK news", "Higher education", "Students", "Education", "Travel", "Cruises"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-21T22:59:38Z", "article": "Talks about the choice of chairman of a combined Barclays-ABN Amro and whether parts of the merged entity should be sold off, were taking place last night as the two banks raced to reach an agreement on their record-breaking deal by early next week. The exclusive period of negotiations granted to Barclays by ABN Amro ran out at midnight last night without the terms of the \u00a380bn deal to create the world&apos;s fifth biggest bank being finalised. It is thought that after more than a month of negotiations, the two banks were moving towards final terms but some crucial issues were still to be determined. If the deal can be clinched, it is expected to change the landscape of European banking and prompted speculation yesterday - which was later denied - that Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale of France was in talks with its Italian rival UniCredit. The identity of the chairman of the merged group to be picked by ABN Amro was still not certain last night. It is thought that a decision on whether to sell off La Salle, the US banking group, and other parts of the ABN Amro business, is also pending. Such a sale of parts of the ABN Amro business would help to boost the price that Barclays is able to offer to the ABN Amro management. ABN directors will meet the rival bidders led by Royal Bank of Scotland on Monday. The RBS consortium, which includes Santander of Spain and the Dutch-Belgium group Fortis, wants to carve up ABN Amro and is expected to be offering up to \u20ac40 (\u00a327) a share for the Dutch bank which is under pressure from investors to boost its performance. Analysts believe Barclays can justify paying little more than \u20ac34 a share without incurring problems from its shareholders. ABN Amro&apos;s shares were propelled above a record \u20ac36 earlier in the week when news of the RBS-led consortium first emerged and yesterday remained above the \u20ac36 level. But, the consortium&apos;s offer has already caused controversy, running into opposition from the Dutch central bank which would need to sanction any deal for ABN Amro. Yesterday, the Dutch finance minister tried to defuse any suggestions that the Dutch central bank was motivated by protectionism in its warning about the risks of the consortium&apos;s proposal. &quot;[Nout Wellink, the central bank governor] has reassured me that he will be objective and unbiased,&quot; Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos was quoted as saying. The RBS-led consortium insists it can reassure regulators about any risks identified in any break-up of ABN Amro and is urging the Dutch bank&apos;s management to consider its proposal alongside any proposals from Barclays. The presence of the consortium has led to speculation that John Varley, Barclays&apos; chief executive, will be forced to walk away from the talks because of the potential higher price that the rivals can offer. Mr Varley is widely expected to become chief executive of the combined bank, which is to be headquartered in Amsterdam and lead-regulated by the Dutch central bank rather the Financial Services Authority. More controversial is the choice of chairman. Rijkman Groenink, the chief executive of ABN Amro, is thought to be unpopular with investors in the Dutch bank who have been pushing for change. They are thought to prefer Arthur Martinez, the chairman, for the top seat in a boardroom that is expected to be dominated by the Barclays&apos; management team. Backstory ABN Amro, the second largest bank in the Netherlands, was criticised by hedge fund TCI for its underperformance. TCI has tabled five resolutions at next week&apos;s annual meeting, including splitting up the bank. Pressure from TCI appears to have opened the door to Barclays and has now brought interest from others. A Barclays and ABN Amro deal could create a top five global bank, possibly setting off a wave of consolidation.", "sentences": ["Mr Varley is widely expected to become chief executive of the combined bank, which is to be headquartered in Amsterdam and lead-regulated by the Dutch central bank rather the Financial Services Authority."], "title": "Battle over likely chairman as banks race to agree Barclays-ABN Amro deal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/21/8", "tags": ["Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-21T23:02:21Z", "article": "During a week in which man&apos;s inhumanity to man has been particularly lurid, a little affirmation, from whatever source, of our capacity for nobler behaviour would be welcome. It is to be found a thousand times over at the registration centre for today&apos;s Flora London Marathon. Steve O&apos;Keefe, for one, has a story that is as worth telling as any deranged gunman&apos;s. On 23 October 1990, O&apos;Keefe was catapulted 60 feet when the van in which he was travelling as a passenger crashed near his home in Egham, Surrey. &apos;The van hit a kerb. It just happened,&apos; he says, his speech still distorted as a result of the terrible brain damage he suffered. &apos;I landed on my head in the woods somewhere.&apos; At the hospital, doctors thought he would die that night. He did not, and a month later he came out of a coma. He could not remember a thing about the accident and can recall little about his thoughts on regaining consciousness. &apos;I thought it was a bad dream, a nightmare. Every single morning it was like, &quot;I want to wake up in the morning, I really will wake up in the morning.&quot; I couldn&apos;t believe it was happening to me. I really couldn&apos;t. It was horrible, terrible. &apos;I couldn&apos;t talk, I couldn&apos;t feed myself, I couldn&apos;t wipe my own bum. There were so many things I couldn&apos;t do. The doctors said they didn&apos;t have a lot of hope. It was really bad. I was no good.&apos; This morning, O&apos;Keefe, 35, who was in hospital for a year after the accident, will be on the starting line in Greenwich for his second marathon inside a week, having run the Boston last Monday. He will run three more marathons later in the year - in Stockholm, Berlin and Amsterdam - and says he has something planned for next year but does not want to say what it is just in case it does not come off. Excited by what he has in mind, he cannot keep it a secret for long. He is doing two marathons in a week - the Boston took him four hours 56 minutes - to prepare for an ultra-distance race in 2008, although he has still to decide which one. He considered the 56-mile Comrades race in Durban, South Africa, the best-known of the ultra events, before deciding it would probably be too hot. &apos;I&apos;ve got ginger hair, so I burn easily.&apos; Once the medical professionals had put O&apos;Keefe on the long haul back from his near-vegetative state, the rest was a collaborative effort. He was an only child but says the support of his extended family and friends was crucial. &apos;When you have a head injury, it&apos;s very hard. You&apos;re left to yourself. But I&apos;ve got a strong family and everyone about me has been absolutely brilliant.&apos; He says it is easy to underestimate what is involved in recovering from brain damage, particularly if you watch too many soap operas. &apos;It&apos;s not like watching somebody on EastEnders or one of the other soaps who has had a head injury and all of a sudden in a few months they are better. It took me 10 years and I&apos;m still getting better. &apos;It&apos;s just been a long process of rehabilitation: speech therapy, physiotherapy and my own occupational therapy, things like word processing and floristry just to get dexterity back in my fingers. I had no use of my fingers after the accident. I also did a lot of voluntary work for old people.&apos; After nine years of painstaking rehabilitation, O&apos;Keefe had to cope with another bad experience when his mother, Kathy, was diagnosed with bowel cancer and it was this that gave him the idea to run marathons. He said he wanted to do something to make her feel proud of him and running marathons to raise money for cancer research &apos;seemed a cool thing to do&apos;. He has not missed a London Marathon since his first in 2003 - his fastest was 4hr 18min 2sec in 2005 - and he has also done New York and Boston, raising more than \u00a356,000 for the Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK, a figure that is poised to go past \u00a360,000 after today. His mother&apos;s cancer is now in remission. Among the many who have been generous to him is the businessman Richard Caring, who owns Wentworth Golf Club, where O&apos;Keefe works as a doorman and is a popular figure. So, too, have the Indian hotelier Surinder Arora, the club&apos;s vice chairman, and celebrities who play there, such as Michael Parkinson and the 2002 Open champion Ernie Els, whose fitness trainer Josh Saltzman has helped O&apos;Keefe to regain strength. O&apos;Keefe, who was training to be a river-boat skipper before the accident, was a keen sportsman in his previous life: a better-than-average triple jumper, basketball player, distance runner and golfer who had a handicap of nine within a year of first swinging a club. All this was taken away in 1990 and only some of it has been regained; the running, of course, and he plays a little golf at Wentworth, although he is no longer the player he was. He would like to break 100, which he could once do easily. He has taught himself to run again in defiance of medical opinion that rated his chances of even walking as slim. &apos;Someone once said to me, &quot;Steve, you&apos;ll never run 26 miles, it&apos;s a long way.&quot; I said to him, &quot;No, 26 miles is not a long way - two steps is a long way when you can&apos;t walk.&quot; That statement I think is the best statement. When you can&apos;t walk, 26 miles is nothing. That&apos;s why I want to run ultra marathons.&apos; O&apos;Keefe still has a limp because of the ataxia, a loss of movement common to stroke sufferers, down his left side and describes himself as &apos;a bit lopsided&apos;. He says, though, that, strange as it may seem, he now finds it easier to run than walk. &apos;It&apos;s like a pendulum - once it&apos;s going it just keeps on going. Once I&apos;m up and started and get into the flow and movement I&apos;m all right.&apos; The question of whether he is a driven person is superfluous, worth asking all the same to hear precisely what he sees as the purpose of this drive, beyond the obvious one of raising money for cancer research. The answer spills out, chopping between his desire to help others and himself. &apos;Oh yes, I&apos;m completely driven. I know what I want, I know what I want to do, I know what I want to achieve.&apos; What do you want to achieve? &apos;I want to run a long way. I&apos;ve got a goal.&apos; Which is? &apos;I hope I can inspire a lot of people who have had head injuries that there is a life. &apos;It&apos;s taken me nearly 20 years. It&apos;s hard. I want to keep pushing myself. I can get better, you know what I mean. I feel that my running is making me better, mentally and physically. I&apos;m breathing better. I want to inspire other people.&apos; He pauses before saying one last thing. &apos;Please make me a good interview.&apos;", "sentences": ["He will run three more marathons later in the year - in Stockholm, Berlin and Amsterdam - and says he has something planned for next year but does not want to say what it is just in case it does not come off."], "title": "Athletics: Dead man up and running", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/apr/22/athletics.news", "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-21T23:12:11Z", "article": "As the sun set on the gathering crowds, the dust rose. And the more they came, the more they kicked up that dust along the track leading to the arena, into which they packed for what they all agreed to be the biggest event of their lives in Bangalore, southern India: the night Iron Maiden came to town. &apos;It is my one dream I thought would never come true,&apos; said Praveen Baruah, a graphic designer, crammed against the front row barrier, having arrived at dawn, &apos;especially not in my own city.&apos; The event was India&apos;s first Metalfest, headlined by the emperors of the genre, for which 20,000 tickets had sold out within two days, although the multitude swelled to perhaps 35,000, some finding the means to scam a way in, thousands content to remain outside the fencing and merely listen, even after travelling long distances. The occasion was also a monument to the defiant durability and apparently infinite expansion across the changing industrial world of metal music in general but more importantly of the most singular - and singularly followed - heavy rock band on the planet. How many other groups are selling, after 32 years, more albums that ever before - due mainly to new, young audiences in places like India and South America? Of how many bands can it be said that a 14th studio album, kernel of the current tour, went straight into the top five in 23 countries (including India), although the burgeoning new fan base is in developing countries that specialise in bootlegging? Perhaps this is because A Matter of Life and Death, an album on the theme of warfare, is the most critically acclaimed record that Maiden - now in their late forties and fifties - have ever made. Certainly it&apos;s the most gargantuan and apocalyptically Wagnerian, as performed in Bangalore. &apos;Why Maiden?&apos; says Payal Rameesh, gnawing corn-on-the-cob before making his way through the corrugated iron ticket barrier. &apos;Because they sing about things that matter, serious things. Because they sing about what is happening in the world, like war and famine, not &quot;I love you, baby&quot;. And because it is a big noise.&apos; This night in Bangalore was also one of the biggest events in the long trajectory of a band, a group of people, who have played together for decades but never seem to think they&apos;ve &apos;done it all&apos; - because they haven&apos;t. A band whose self-confidence is charged by a balance between success and curiosity: Maiden were among the first groups to breach the Iron Curtain back in the 1980s, and India is a different kind of exploration into a different kind of uncharted territory, the new global industrial landscape to which heavy rock is soundtrack; the second fastest-growing economy in the world, the country whose population will soon overtake that of China. Rod Smallwood, who has managed Maiden since 1979, admitted that this one-off excursion to India, with the unmatched scale of Maiden&apos;s air-freighted stage set, made no financial sense at all. &apos;We just wanted to do this,&apos; he says. &apos;We had a gut feeling we needed to play this place. If they&apos;re buying the albums, we want to play for them.&apos; Sunset gave away to dusk, dusk to twilight, the impenitent tropical pyrexia cooled slightly, but the temperature of the crowd was rising, as Iron Maiden prepared to introduce themselves to the country that was once the Jewel in the Imperial Crown, but is now something very different of its own, ready and waiting for the first crashing chords of the opening number, &apos;Different World&apos; ... Everyone in the party affectionately expected Maiden&apos;s vocalist and co-songwriter, Bruce Dickinson, to arrive last at Heathrow&apos;s Terminal Four to board the plane to Bangalore, and he was. But even before we took off, Dickinson&apos;s conversation veered immediately towards our common compulsion, the theme of the new album and many of Maiden&apos;s anthems: war, and the pity, terror and glory of war. He launched into a vivid description of how - during a brief solo respite from Maiden - he had been among the few acts to perform in besieged Sarajevo, entered not with the usual UN escort usually afforded to visiting dignitaries, but down the perilous slopes of Mount Igman in a yellow bus decorated with Smurfs and organised by something called the &apos;Serious Road Trip&apos;. His first-class meal eaten, Bruce comes back to cattle class to join team photographer John McMurtrie, Dave Pattenden from Maiden&apos;s management and myself to lean over the back of a seat for a six-hour chat over cans of London Pride (&apos;my local beer&apos;) until it runs out, thereafter Heineken. The last thing Bruce wants to talk about is his music. &apos;You can intellectualise about metal as much as you want,&apos; he says, &apos;you won&apos;t succeed. It comes from right here&apos; - and he jabs the pit of his stomach. &apos;Whatever you say will not describe the feeling of what it&apos;s like to be there, listening to this music&apos;. A challenge, I think to myself, but probably a statement of fact. Rather like an uneasy passenger in a car, Bruce is not accustomed to being flown like this. Indeed he is a qualified pilot, and talks more passionately about flying than about music. His life as a pilot for Astraeus Airlines has taken him to India before. Flying into Agra to see the Taj Mahal, Bruce was initially refused permission to land on auto-pilot because of &apos;blue bulls&apos; on the runway. In Sierra Leone, he was unable to land because a tribal chief had positioned himself on the runway. He also flies Maiden fans to concerts on charters known as &apos;Bruce Air&apos;; this very week, preparing to land in Belgrade, he had been told from the control tower: &apos;I&apos;m not going to let you land unless you play &quot;Wrathchild&quot;&apos;. To which the pilot replied: &apos;Let me straight in on runway one, and I&apos;ll play it.&apos; &apos;Bruce Air&apos;s&apos; flight number, he says, is always 666. Bruce Dickinson has a rapacious, gratifying and almost exhausting interest in everything. The conversation shifts from his scathing contempt for political leaders in contemporary Britain (all of whom shall remain nameless) to recollections about decline and decadence in Amsterdam, &apos;my obsession with time as a dimension&apos; and his noteworthy dictum that &apos;life is not a rehearsal. You have to get it while you can.&apos; But above all, Bruce likes talking about warfare. He tells blood-curdling stories from Sierra Leone and drives on with his detailed Bosnian narrative, recalling a visit to a town called Sanski Most, where he and some American soldiers were advised not to bathe in the river because of the &apos;DNA remains of 300 people&apos; whose bodies were dumped by the Bosnian Serbs into a nearby mine shaft. These would be victims of the Omarska concentration camp, which I found while working for ITN back in 1992 - and (how weird can life get?) here I am talking about them with the singer from Iron Maiden aboard a flight to India. We remembered Airfix kits of fighter planes we made as kids, and those tiny plastic soldiers that came in boxes of 48 for two shillings. &apos;I think men are hard-wired to confront each other,&apos; Bruce says. &apos;But this does not apply to the feminine. I wanted to be a soldier, I wanted to fight people,&apos; confides Bruce. &apos;But did I want to kill people? No.&apos; What Bruce really wanted to be, he says, was a fighter pilot. He had a &apos;godfather/uncle&apos; in the RAF who &apos;had flown a Hawker Hunter&apos; and took him to air shows. &apos;I was captivated. If I&apos;d been any good at physics or maths, that&apos;s what I&apos;d have done; I&apos;d never have become a musician.&apos; He then recalls how at the medical for his examination to qualify as a pilot, he was told &apos;you&apos;d have made a great fighter pilot&apos; because of a perfect balance between his eyes (rare, apparently) - &apos;I have no dominant eye.&apos; Suddenly Bruce looks downcast, lamenting the loss of a life he never lived, flying Tornados for the RAF. A lady objects to the duration and decibel rating of our conversation - poor soul; we are being rather a nuisance - telling Bruce that &apos;your voice is so projective&apos;. &apos;It&apos;s my job to be projective,&apos; he retorts, but even he looks sheepish when she informs him that she was a once head teacher. &apos;I&apos;ve no idea what to expect,&apos; says bassist Steve Harris, pillar of the band since 1975, as we assemble for a tour of Bangalore. &apos;It is a bit like going to Poland in &apos;84, a real adventure.&apos; In the van, one of Maiden&apos;s three lead and rhythm guitarists and another founder member, Dave Murray, makes the same association. &apos;In Poland, we were driving through villages like the aliens had landed. Then in Moscow it was all French fries and vodka, and people putting on ballgowns to come and see us - now this! Sort of organised chaos, isn&apos;t it?&apos;. Dave, who now lives in Hawaii, presses his face and camera against the van window like a boy on his first trip abroad - and rightly so as we drive up Siddaiah Road, crammed with little shops and stalls selling auto parts of every vintage imaginable - stockpile after stockpile of veteran crankshafts, transformers and shock absorbers. &apos;I wish we could get out and walk,&apos; sighs Dave. Like Bruce, guitarist Janick Gers reflects on concerts in the old Yugoslavia: &apos;Just think, some of those people we played to will not have survived what happened. It makes you realise that all this civilisation is just skin deep. We think life is all so fucking balanced, don&apos;t we? But it&apos;s not, we&apos;re just that far away from all that,&apos; he says, indicating a minimal space between his thumb and forefinger. First stop is the landmark Bull Temple, on the site of which the man who founded Bangalore, Kempe Gowda, awoke to find a bull keeping guard over him. The bull is also carrier of Lord Shiva the destroyer (thereby a good rock&apos;n&apos;roll character) and Supreme God in one of the four branches of Hinduism. Appropriately for a metal band, we inspect the serpent gods in the forecourt first, primordial symbols of both womb and phallus, poison and healing. The temple&apos;s attendant, Dyha Darajan, explains the significance of the &apos;Kundalini&apos; potency of the female snake, &apos;the most powerful force in the human body&apos;. &apos;Ah yes,&apos; remarks Dickinson, &apos;all that errant Kundalini energy running wild long ago.&apos; We enter the temple itself, before which shoes are removed so that the sandals of the faithful laid out on sun-parched concrete are added to by a pair of green suede winkle-pickers belonging to guitarist Adrian Smith. The priest applies the customary red mark on the forehead of each, as Maiden make their way - with an entwinement of jauntiness and genuine interest - round the back of the vast granite animal, said to be physically growing in size, past the void in which the spirit of Shiva abides, and out again into the heat. As we heave through Bangalore&apos;s unsurpassable traffic, a waif with a terrible wound to the side of her face taps on the window, begging a rupee or two. &apos;Hey, someone, have we got a fiver?&apos; chirps drummer Nicko McBrain. The promotion woman quickly insists: &apos;No, we don&apos;t do that. They&apos;re perfectly all right,&apos; to which Nicko objects: &apos;No she&apos;s not - look at her, poor little thing.&apos; Someone duly produces 100 rupees which Nicko puts into the child&apos;s rangy fist, skin like parchment. There was a hullabaloo about Maiden and Satanism - demonstrations by Christians in America - after their hit &apos;Number of the Beast&apos;, but I notice a crucifix around Nicko&apos;s neck. Is that what I think it is?, I ask. &apos;I love the Lord,&apos; he replies. Back at the hotel, there&apos;s time for a chat over a Kingfisher beer with the foursquare Smallwood. There&apos;s a story Maiden like to tell about Rod: when he won a management award from the International Monetary Fund, and, talking to &apos;some top American bloke&apos;, he said: &apos;You think I&apos;m in the music business, don&apos;t you? Well, I&apos;m not in the music business, I manage Iron fucking Maiden&apos;. As regards the status of my presence, Rod says, simply, &apos;it&apos;s all on the record&apos;, with a breezy self-confidence rare in what can be a control-freak industry. India, for Rod too, is akin to the adventurism that took Maiden across the Iron Curtain. New audiences excite him and the band, he says, &apos;because not many people in the UK understand what Maiden is about, and they do in these places. We&apos;re not trying to change the world, but we are trying to say to people [and here comes the Iron Maiden credo]: &quot;Get off your arse; hate reality TV; get a life and open your eyes.&quot; There&apos;s no one like us, except possibly Springsteen - you know, blue collar, serious following and serious commitment.&apos; There&apos;s a wind-down before dinner and a word with Steve Harris, bassist and Maiden&apos;s mainmast, aboard since the beginning. &apos;It&apos;s different to the Iron Curtain because it&apos;s a different political climate. But the feeling is the same - I don&apos;t know what the fans&apos; reaction will be, but what we do know is that they are Maiden fans, which is no small thing - they are hardcore.&apos; The music, he says, &apos;is the soundtrack to people&apos;s lives in places like this. We are not anti-establishment, but there is a bit of rebellion in it. We don&apos;t preach, we just ask questions, for people to answer for themselves.&apos; On the theme of warfare which will dominate the set, Steve says, &apos;I think it&apos;s a fascination with the decisions a person has to make in war. Some may say we are glorifying war, but we are not. It&apos;s about people being suddenly forced to take responsibility, make decisions and deal with that stuff.&apos; After all these years, &apos;we do think about some kind of half-retirement,&apos; admits Steve. &apos;But it seems the world won&apos;t let us.&apos; We are ferried to Bangalore&apos;s poshest restaurant, then adjourn to a hotel suite for a research session into Kingfisher beer, served by liveried butlers, the morning after which I, for one, could not contemplate delivering the biggest night in the recent history of burgeoning Bangalore. The day arrives, and the Hindu newspaper reports a scramble for tickets by local bigwigs, and their children, leading to corrupt distribution through the security services. Meanwhile, real fans arrive early - some off a special train from Delhi; others from as far as Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka - and Bruce Dickinson has taken a solo morning stroll along Mahatma Gandhi Road. He has been especially struck by the army recruiting office, along the walls of which are painted the extraordinarily elaborate qualifications required for different military positions. &apos;Recruitment Is Full And Transparent,&apos; reads one billboard. &apos;Do Not Be Misled By Touts and Agents.&apos; Upon his return, Bruce reflects in private, on the question of age and how long all this can go on. &apos;I think we&apos;ve achieved a kind of life-rock&apos;n&apos;roll balance,&apos; he says. &apos;We have other things to do, and that has been to our benefit and the benefit of our longevity.&apos; But, he says, he had met a rugby international who had told him he had &apos;exactly 17 international games left in him&apos;, and &apos;I&apos;m intrigued by someone who can gauge it like that. There is nothing so physical as a Maiden show. I need to bounce off the walls and rattle my cage. Yes, I probably could stand around and sing, but if I did, it wouldn&apos;t be Maiden. You see, I never wanted to be famous, I always only wanted to be Iron Maiden. We are the last eccentric bastion of English music, just needing to shove this down your throat. And you can&apos;t deliver that every night for ever.&apos; His demeanour is at once boyishly effervescent, and very mortal indeed. Iron Maiden proceed on the basis, he says, that &apos;a certain portion of humanity likes to listen to music which is aggressive and physical, but not confrontational&apos;, and that is what Maiden provide - but not in some gormless vacuum that many in the West presume it to exist in. Rather the opposite. Bruce, with his insatiable appetite for knowledge and history, discusses songs like &apos;The Trooper&apos;, about the Crimean War, and, on the new album, the remarkable &apos;Brighter Than a Thousand Suns&apos;, about the invention of the atomic bomb, and the shudder of realisation felt by those like Robert Oppenheimer at what they had done. &apos;Oppenheimer&apos;s confession!&apos;, Bruce enthuses. &apos;Do you remember it? Reciting the Bhagavad Gita? Fucking hell: &quot;I am Oppenheimer, Shatterer of Worlds.&quot; The magnificent folly of the mushroom cloud, in which I have a morbid fascination, and the insane logic of &apos;Mutual Assured Destruction&apos; which fuelled the Cold War during which I grew up, hanging over my generation like the Sword of Damacles. It was a time when mankind played God, became God.&apos; He talks more about flying. &apos;You can&apos;t turn the clock back, so I&apos;m glad I discovered flying after I discovered music. If I hadn&apos;t, none of this Maiden would have happened. . When I first flew, it was like Paul on the Road to Damascus - I got this sense that this is something I could do for the rest of my life.&apos; Then Bruce propels the conversation back to the inevitable theme: he wants to evaluate the best tank of all time, dismissing any American claim. For him, it was the Soviet T-34, with which the Red Army won the mother of all battles, against the Wehrmacht, at Kursk in 1943 ... And India? &apos;It&apos;s going to be one of the great economic powers, and Bangalore is its industrial capital,&apos; says Bruce. &apos;But do you remember that street with all those auto parts!?&apos; His father, he says, was in the car trade, and &apos;oh, he would have loved it. Nowadays, you go to the garage with a problem with parts and they get on their computer ... but here, all these crankshafts, piles and piles of them. I wish I could have got out, wandered around a bit and had my picture taken in front of a pile of fucking crankshafts.&apos; Whereas a Maiden audience in Europe tends to be what Valerie Potter of Metal Hammer magazine calls &apos;a family outing, father and son perhaps&apos;, the crowd tonight are almost all in their twenties and there are more girls than there would be in the West. It becomes clear that in India it is frowned upon for a Maiden fan to like any other band. There is particular loathing for Ozzy Osbourne, regarded by Payal Bal as &apos;a sell-out. Nothing to do with metal. It&apos;s got to be Maiden and only Maiden.&apos; &apos;We may listen to other music, and we all fall in love, but that&apos;s not the point,&apos; says Alidya Hara. &apos;We can get our love songs from any of the others. From Maiden we can get what we really feel - pent-up aggression, the right questions.&apos; Manou Singh, a bus driver, had come more than 100 miles to join the many thousands unable to afford a ticket, but determined to be there, outside the arena, seeing nothing but hearing as best they could. &apos;Our parents&apos; generation were completely subdued, to authority and respect for the British Empire&apos;, he says. &apos;But India has opened up, things are changing, and Maiden are British, but this is for us, not our parents.&apos; If the support band, Parikrama, don&apos;t soon make inroads in the West, the A&amp;R system is malfunctioning badly. During an entrancing instrumental called &apos;The Open Sky&apos;, the violinist, Imran Khan, played a hypnotic solo entwining heavy rock, Paganini and the chromatics of Ravi Shankar, while a huge, majestic but appropriately ominous jet-black house crow hovered above the stage. Offstage, Parikrama&apos;s vocalist Nitin Malik says with a knowing look: &apos;Yes, that number can often change the weather.&apos; He explains that &apos;heavy rock in India has been the preserve of the young intelligentsia until now. But it is filtering down to the blue-collar workers, becoming the music of a new generation in a new kind of country. But,&apos; he adds, &apos;there is nothing in the world like playing on the same stage as Iron Maiden.&apos; The brilliant violinist turns out to be an enigmatic and retiring, classically trained 23-year-old who speaks no English, sadly. But this is suddenly irrelevant as word reaches Parikrama&apos;s dugout that Janick Gers is wandering around outside. My interviews are abruptly halted as the Indian band hurry outside to collect autographs from Janick and others from Maiden who have come to pay their respects and congratulate the host band. So there is vocalist Malik, just 20 minutes ago strutting the stage as India&apos;s rock God, now a teeny-bopper leaving this little backstage huddle, kissing and holding aloft his Iron Maiden autographs like a schoolboy with the signed photo of his dream football team. And finally the moment arrives, announced by a tidal crescendo of sound from the crowd, a blinding bath of light, and the opening bars, like a declaration of war in themselves, of the first track on the new album, appositely entitled &apos;Different World&apos;. You would have to be a very dull person - a snob, or sad cynic - not to enjoy this show. There is the sheer voltage, the octane level with which Iron Maiden&apos;s music increases blood pressure and pumps adrenaline. The sound is of an epic, symphonic scale, and of course there is the spectacle, especially here, on and off stage - the sight of 35,000 Indians, arms aloft, singing every word of every song, while a backdrop of skeletal soldiers trudging through the muddy killing fields of some timeless Ypres or Somme accompanies the second number and, arguably, the best of the whole set: &apos;These Colours Don&apos;t Run&apos;, a poignant anthem to the universal soldier leaving home for a distant place &apos;far from the land of your birth&apos;. For &apos;The Trooper&apos;, Dickinson dons period military uniform and parades his union flag - a Maiden ritual which causes trouble in Ireland. Here in India there is a momentary frisson, but the song is beloved and understood, and, as a teacher called Navyn says, &apos;It&apos;s very ironic, but the flag of the new Indian mutiny of youth is the Union Jack.&apos; Bruce had met someone while on his walk who told him he intended to come to the gig, and would be at the front. &apos;Where are you?&apos; yells Bruce from the stage, &apos;Oh, there you are!&apos; The set returns to the new album for a couple more songs, then guns into the final stretch of old favourites, with puissance. &apos;Fear of the Dark&apos; has the entire crowd singing along and Bruce shouting the word &apos;BANG-A-LORE!&apos; over and over until it sounds like some metal mantra. Maiden&apos;s most virulent classic, &apos;Run to the Hills&apos;, about the slaughter of Native Americans, provides the night with its thermonuclear climax, for reasons I&apos;ll learn when exploring Bangalore next day. Maiden&apos;s giant, hallmark mascot Eddie, who appears on all their album covers, makes his usually part-monstrous, part-comic entrance, but he is this time a phantom mutation of some shell-shocked Tommy in a Wilfred Owen poem. &apos;We&apos;ll be back,&apos; promises Bruce, &apos;and I hope those of you outside will get in&apos; - and there is a distant roar from the ticketless hordes without, through whom we weave our way by minibus during a hasty getaway. Back at the hotel, there is a sense of relish at the whole adventure - &apos;wasn&apos;t that something?&apos; says Nicko, &apos;not your usual&apos; - tempered only by the urgency of Steve Harris&apos;s need to catch his beloved West Ham on television. By three in the morning, four of us are left on a sofa watching Bollywood movies, unable to understand a word but providing our own running commentary - &apos;Woah! Behind you, darling!&apos; - while the liveried butlers pour Kingfisher after Kingfisher. I remind Bruce that his flight leaves at six, and he needs to check in at four. &apos;Time for a quick last beer then,&apos; he says, defiantly, before heading off to pack. The question remains: who are these fans, where and how do they live? In Bangalore, glistening new buildings rise out of the bustle and sometimes squalor, surrounded by manicured lawns and protected by guards, barriers and signs prohibiting pretty much everything, including two-wheeled vehicles. And on each ultra-modern edifice, to which many of these fans commute, are the names of the new order: Motorola, Texas Instruments, Samsung and Oracle, where Vineet Joseph works as a software engineer, and for whom Iron Maiden &apos;sends a message to Indian youth which has been asleep and confused - to be independent, stand against the rules, against your parents, and think for yourself. There is heavy industry, too, and I think Bruce Dickinson would have enjoyed the Engine Division of HAL helicopters on Airport Road, where Gopal Katcher works as a technical designer, though he lives in a little street where children play called MV Garden, at the end of which is a smelly canal, a temple and row of shops: Dr. Ambed Kar Backward and Minority Vegetable Vendor, Bagpipe Wines and the Panesh Metal Mart. &apos;I&apos;d never thought of that,&apos; laughs metal fanatic Gopal at my obvious reference to the latter store, as we sit in the humble but spotless front room with his grandparents, parents and sisters, who ask delightfully: &apos;What is your good name, sir?&apos;. Gopal explains that &apos;Iron Maiden is the voice in my head at all times. Maiden is the bridge between my spiritual life and my sensual life.&apos; Abashef Santosh works at the squeaky-new Accenture call centre on Bannerghab Road, guarded by platoons of security men, and lives in a nearby street between Swastik Marble and a building marked &apos;This Property Under Dispute&apos;. I ask why he spends hard-earned money on official Maiden CDs, rather than the copious bootlegs at a fraction of the price. &apos;Because they are things to collect,&apos; says Abashef, &apos;You must have the real thing. It&apos;s a badge, to show you belong.&apos; Of an evening, the better-off among the Maiden tribe collect at Styx bar on Mahatma Gandhi Road, under a red neon sign and up a flight of silver metal steps. Deepak the DJ &apos;worked five years at a call centre collecting debts from people in Australia. Not good work at all, and I came here and spent all my money so I could listen to metal music. Eventually, they offered me the job.&apos; He serves up a diet of Slayer and Rage Against the Machine, before a serial run of Maiden - &apos;the best of all, the number one band, and on Saturday my dream came true.&apos; He plays &apos;Run to the Hills&apos;, and I ask why it seems to be Bangalore&apos;s favourite. &apos;Think about it,&apos; says Deepak. &apos;&quot;When the White Man Came Across the Sea&quot; - we know it&apos;s about the American Indians, but for us, it&apos;s our song about you guys [and your] history here. And played by an English band; isn&apos;t that weird?&apos; Maiden voyage: a history of the beast East Londoner Steve Harris formed Iron Maiden on Christmas Day, 1975. He attributes the band&apos;s name to the medieval torture device in the film The Man in the Iron Mask The group&apos;s first album, Iron Maiden, was released in April 1980; it reached number four in the UK album charts and bagged them support slots with Kiss and Judas Priest. Iron Maiden were the first band to play live on Top of the Pops since the Who in 1972 when, in February 1980, they performed their first single, &apos;Running Free&apos;. Vocalist Bruce Dickinson, previously of Samson, joined the band in 1981, replacing Paul Di&apos;Anno. The group&apos;s first album with Dickinson, 1982&apos;s The Number of the Beast, reached number one in the UK albums chart. The US leg of their 1982 world tour was marred by controversy stemming from a claim by a right-wing pressure group that The Number of the Beast betrayed the band&apos;s Satanic leanings. Dickinson quit the band in 1993 to pursue a solo career and train as a pilot. He was replaced by Wolfsbane&apos;s Blaze Bayley, before returning in 1999 to record Maiden&apos;s twelfth album Brave New World The band&apos;s skeletal horror mascot, Eddie, is a perennial feature on their album covers and a fixture of their live performances.", "sentences": ["The conversation shifts from his scathing contempt for political leaders in contemporary Britain (all of whom shall remain nameless) to recollections about decline and decadence in Amsterdam, &apos;my obsession with time as a dimension&apos; and his noteworthy dictum that &apos;life is not a rehearsal."], "title": "Maiden India", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/22/popandrock.features1", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Metal"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-22T23:49:27Z", "article": "Haile Gebrselassie rested his head against a crash barrier before rubbing his right hand against his stomach; 18 miles into the marathon the great Ethiopian was an athlete in distress. By the time he had recovered, the majority of the elite field were heading from the Isle of Dogs towards one of the best finishes in the race&apos;s 26-year history as Martin Lel of Kenya sprinted home to regain the title he won in 2005. &quot;Twelve months ago I did not have enough in the final stages and I was beaten,&quot; said Lel, who triumphed yesterday in 2hr 7min 41sec. &quot;But I had learned from then: I made sure I would not make the same mistake again.&quot; As Lel celebrated victory, Gebrselassie was being brought back to the race headquarters to contemplate how many more chances he will have to make up for what keeps happening to him in the capital. It was the legendary Ethiopian&apos;s third attempt to win here and once more he was left a forlorn figure. In 2002 he was third and in 2006 he was ninth. Yesterday he was nowhere. &quot;I had a stitch,&quot; the 34-year-old said afterwards. &quot;I&apos;m not injured, I just could not breathe. It is not the heat. Maybe it is something I ate but I don&apos;t know.&quot; He is a marathon champion in Amsterdam, Berlin and Fukuoka and was the fastest man in the world over the distance last year but still London eludes him. Earlier in the week Felix Limo, the defending champion from Kenya, who was third in 2:07:47, questioned whether Gebrselassie, a double Olympic 10,000 metres champion, was suffering from being surrounded by such a quality marathon field. &quot;I knew he would not win,&quot; Limo said yesterday. &quot;I know his weak areas. But I am not saying what they are, that is a secret.&quot; Gebrselassie was running smoothly when his pain struck and ended his latest confrontation with the world record holder Paul Tergat. Tergat was beaten for pace in the final two miles as the race became a sprint between a group of four: Lel, Limo and the Moroccans Jaouad Gharib and Abderrahim Goumri. With 200 metres left Lel took off to win by three seconds from Goumri. As Jon Brown pulled out after being taken ill with a fever, Dan Robinson, the Commonwealth Games bronze medallist, was Britain&apos;s leading man, ninth in 2:14:14.

The combined bank will be headquartered in Amsterdam but will drop any reference to the Dutch bank&apos;s name and be known as Barclays.   More than 23,600 jobs are at risk from the 217,000 combined workforce as a result of the record-breaking deal which was announced this morning after more than a month of intensive talks and despite an attempt by a Royal Bank of Scotland-led consortium to offer a higher, break-up deal to the Dutch management team.   However, a meeting scheduled between the RBS-led consortium - which includes Santander of Spain and Fortis of Belgium - has now been postponed. It had been scheduled for 2.30pm today but the consortium is asking for more information about a deal arranged by ABN Amro to sell its US business La Salle.   By announcing a side-deal to sell LaSalle to Bank of America, ABN Amro is raising $21bn (\u00a310.5bn) which then allows it to redistribute \u20ac12bn to shareholders of the combined group. But, La Salle is the part of the Dutch bank that RBS is particularly keen to buy through its three bank consortium.   The consortium said yesterday that it needed to understand the terms under which this sale could be terminated. &quot;The banks [in the consortium] are requesting this information today. Accordingly the banks do not consider it appropriate to meet with ABN Amro today,&quot; the consortium said.   Under the terms of the world biggest financial services transaction, Barclays is using 3.225 of its own shares to buy one ABN Amro share, which values each of the Dutch bank&apos;s shares at \u20ac36.25 (\u00a324.60) \u2013 more than the \u20ac34 that many City analysts had thought the British bank would be able to pay.   The deal values the Dutch bank at \u00a345bn which combined with Barclays stock market creates an institution worth around \u00a385bn.   If the deal goes through, Barclays would own 52% of the combined business and ABN Amro 48%.   Barclays shares were down 21.5p at 728.5p in mid-afternoon trading.   The transaction is a key plank of the ambition of the management of Barclays to make the bank a major player in the banking world. Without the deal, Barclays is the world&apos;s 15th biggest bank and Britain&apos;s third largest. If the deal is successful if will allow Barclays to leapfrog RBS to become Britain&apos;s second biggest bank and the fifth biggest in the world.   It allows John Varley, Barclays&apos; chief executive, to take the helm of a bank that will rival Citigroup, Bank of America and HSBC on the global stage. He will be chief executive of the enlarged group while Bob Diamond, the \u00a322m a year American investment banker who plays a key role in the British bank, will remain as president of the combined group.   Under the terms of the negotiations, ABN Amro was able to select the chairman. The Dutch bank selected Arthur Martinez, its current chairman, while Rijkman Groenink, the chief executive of the Dutch bank, will lose any day-to-day responsibilities and take a non-executive role. Mr Groenink has been the target of protests by shareholders \u2013 led by London-based hedge fund TCI \u2013 about the bank&apos;s underperformance. TCI said yesterday it was analysing the deal. Marcus Agius, Barclays new chairman, will be deputy chairman.   The combined bank believes it can make savings \u20ac3.5bn by 2010, approximately 80% of which is expected to result from cost synergies and the remainder from revenue benefits. The 23,600 fall in the headcount will be result of a cut in 12,800 jobs and 10,800 roles being off-shored to cheaper locations. Barclays has 123,000 employees and ABN Amro has 94,000 if La Salle is excluded.   The combined bank is to be lead regulated by the Financial Services Authority \u2013 rather than the Dutch central bank as originally planned \u2013 after the City regulator concluded more business would be conducted in London than Amsterdam.   As it announced the deal, Barclays revealed its 2007 first-quarter profits were up 15% on the same time last year and that Barclays Capital, the investment banking division built by Mr Diamond, had recorded its best year ever.   Mr Varley said: &quot;This proposed merger represents a unique opportunity to create a new competitive force in financial services, which will deliver benefits for our customers and clients and generate sustained growth and additional value for our owners. The proposed merger will significantly enhance stand-alone product development capabilities and distribution. Our combined geographic reach will ensure exposure to both developed and high growth developing economies.&quot; ", "sentences": ["The combined bank will be headquartered in Amsterdam but will drop any reference to the Dutch bank&apos;s name and be known as Barclays.", "The combined bank is to be lead regulated by the Financial Services Authority \u2013 rather than the Dutch central bank as originally planned \u2013 after the City regulator concluded more business would be conducted in London than Amsterdam."], "title": "Barclays agrees ABN Amro deal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/23/money", "tags": ["Business", "Money"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-23T22:59:55Z", "article": "Barclays and ABN Amro were locked in high-level meetings last night in an attempt to hammer out a final agreement on a \u00a380bn record-breaking deal to create the world&apos;s fifth-biggest bank with 230,000 employees around the globe. After more than a month of intense negotiations, an announcement seemed likely today despite the determination of a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland to spoil the proposal. The RBS consortium is scheduled to meet the management of the Dutch bank later today with a view to mounting a higher break-up offer although those talks, which will include Santander of Spain and the Dutch-Belgian group Fortis, could be delayed to allow for the Barclays announcement to be made. Under the terms of its approach, Barclays would move its headquarters to Amsterdam and report its financial figures in euros to broker the friendliest possible terms for the second-largest bank in the Netherlands. A promise that the combined entity would be regulated by the Dutch central bank will not be kept, though. The talks stumbled in recent days after the Financial Services Authority made it clear it was not prepared for the combined entity to be lead regulated by the Dutch authorities and the FSA is now expected to take the senior regulatory role. The three-bank consortium has also taken action to appease regulators. The Dutch central bank has concerns about the complexity of a break-up so RBS is to take charge of any discussions with the authorities going forward. It is also considering using only its shares to mount a bid if it helps to satisfy the regulator about the intricacies of any break-up proposal. Even so, the ultimate goal of the consortium will be to split ABN Amro into three - with LaSalle and the wholesale bank going to RBS; Latin American and southern European businesses to Santander and the Dutch banking operations to Fortis. Analysts believe that the consortium can pay more for ABN Amro by breaking it up, which is why Barclays is expected to admit that it needs to sell parts of any combined bank. The most likely operation to be sold is LaSalle. Investment bankers at ABN Amro&apos;s wholesale bank in London may also help raise the price since Barclays would sack hundreds of them in the search for overlaps with its Barclays Capital operation. If the deal is completed, Barclays would leap over RBS to become Britain&apos;s second-largest bank.

The deal, which puts 23,600 jobs at risk around the world, would be the biggest ever bank takeover, creating a group with a stock market value of \u00a385bn. But even as the terms of the ground-breaking deal with the Dutch bank were announced, expectations surfaced that the transaction would encounter hurdles from disgruntled shareholders and rival bidders. Much is at stake for Barclays, which would leap from the world&apos;s 15th bank to overtake Royal Bank of Scotland as Britain&apos;s second biggest. RBS is leading a rival consortium to bid for ABN Amro. John Varley, the Barclays chief executive, would take the helm of a bank that would rival Citigroup, Bank of America and HSBC on the global stage. Bob Diamond, the \u00a322m-a-year American investment banker who plays a key role in the British bank, would be president. Mr Diamond likened his position to that of deputy chief executive and stressed the transaction was not a change in the bank&apos;s strategy but accelerated its move to making more of its profits overseas - from 50% to 70% if the deal is successful. If the deal goes through Barclays will move its head office to Amsterdam, where Mr Varley will be based. The combined group will be known as Barclays, be incorporated and pay tax in Britain and be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its lead regulator will be the Financial Services Authority, the British City watchdog. The original terms of the deal suggested the Dutch central bank would take the lead role in regulation, but the change suggests the FSA believes the bank will be run from London rather than Amsterdam. A combined group will be chaired by Arthur Martinez, the Dutch bank&apos;s chairman, who will hand over to the Barclays chairman Marcus Agius at an unspecified date in the future. Rijkman Groenink, chief executive of ABN Amro, will not have an executive role and admitted yesterday ABN Amro had to take a &quot;junior role&quot; to achieve its dream of consolidation. Mr Groenink dismissed calls from shareholders, led by London-based hedge fund TCI, to break up the bank. The aim was to &quot;build not to break,&quot; he said. Even so, the deal involves hiving off LaSalle, ABN Amro&apos;s banking business in the US, to Bank of America for $21bn (\u00a310.5bn). This side deal, which will allow \u00a38bn to be distributed to shareholders of the enlarged group, was enough to force RBS to cancel yesterday&apos;s pre-arranged meeting with the Dutch bank to discuss a possible three-way break-up of ABN Amro. LaSalle is widely believed to be the part of ABN that most interests RBS. The three-bank consortium, which includes Santander of Spain and Dutch-Belgian group Fortis, requested more information yesterday on the terms under which the sale to Bank of America could be altered. Bank of America could receive $200m if the LaSalle deal is terminated, which drew protests from TCI . It has tabled resolutions for the annual meeting on Thursday which include a break-up of the bank. Questions were also raised yesterday about the \u20ac3.5bn cost savings Barclays and ABN Amro were claiming they could make by 2010. Analysts at investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort described them as &quot;difficult to believe&quot;. The plans involve cutting 23,600 jobs from the 217,000 combined workforce, excluding LaSalle. Some 12,800 jobs will go in their own right while a further 10,800 will be &quot;offshored&quot; to cheaper locations. About 3,000 of these could affect IT operations around Britain and the new Canary Wharf head office. The investment bank Barclays Capital expects to cut 4,500. Barclays is using 3.225 of its own shares to buy one Amro share, valuing the Dutch bank&apos;s shares at \u20ac36.25, more than expected. Barclays shares slipped 17p to 733p yesterday, indicating its chances of success were rising as ABN Amro&apos;s shares closed at \u20ac35.77, below the offer price. Tested, trusted and connected John Varley, the Barclays chief executive, was described by his counterpart at ABN Amro yesterday as an &quot;excellent banker and a trustworthy person&quot;. With his high-waisted trousers, braces and old-fashioned glasses, the 51-year-old certainly looks the part of the trusted banker. Educated at the Catholic boarding school Downside and Oriel College, Oxford, he qualified as a solicitor before joining Barclays in 1982 as a corporate financier. After a year off for stress in 1994, he returned to run Barclays&apos; asset management operations, then took control of the retail bank, walking straight into the crisis over branch closures and cash machine charges. He survived the furore, becoming finance director in 2000 before becoming chief executive in 2004. Now he is preparing to take the same role in the combined bank. Varley is married to Carolyn Pease, whose family sold their bank to Barclays in 1902, and he is said to have joined the bank on the advice of his father in law. Despite the historical connection, he has agreed to move the head office, and himself if not his family, to Amsterdam.

He&apos;d recently retired from football and was now a lorry driver,&quot; writes Mark Sellers. &quot;After a bit of chat David confessed that he didn&apos;t really like football (he&apos;d much rather watch a film on TV) and that he preferred his new life as a trucker. Has anyone else heard of any other footballers who don&apos;t really like football?&quot; There are plenty, Mark, such as former Tottenham and Watford goalkeeper Espen Baardsen. He became disillusioned with the game at 25, gave it up and completed an Open University degree, before becoming a financial analyst for London-based hedge fund Eclectica. &quot;It is a great myth that football is easy,&quot; he insisted. &quot;It&apos;s quite miserable compared to what I have now.&quot; Footballer-turned-boxer Curtis Woodhouse is another who disliked the game to such a extent. &quot;Everyone loves football, but I didn&apos;t. It felt like a job,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt empty playing, it got me angry. I could have carried on playing football until I was 35, making a nice wage and having a nice life, but that&apos;s not what I wanted to do.&quot; Pat Nevin&apos;s collaboration with psychologist George Sik for the book, In Ma Head, Son! also reveals a fascinating insight into footballers&apos; mentality, as the Scot declares that &quot;being a footballer is what I do. It isn&apos;t what I am. I&apos;d always known I was different from other players.&quot; Tottenham defender Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto shares this laissez-faire attitude to the game, as this interview proves. &quot;I don&apos;t watch football,&quot; he admits. &quot;Well, I play it enough don&apos;t I? I don&apos;t talk about football away from the game either. I suppose that is unusual. My interests are my friends and music, especially hip-hop. I like Ice Cube and 50 Cent.&quot; A recent article in the Scotsman also cited former Coventry and Celtic player Paul Telfer as being particularly detached from football. &quot;A friend told of [Telfer&apos;s] tendency not to talk about football during their regular four-ball on the golf course. He ended his insight with the quite damning, &apos;I sometimes get the impression he prefers playing golf to football.&apos;&quot; And another Sunday Mirror report from earlier this month revealed that the famously scintillating David Batty, former England and Leeds midfielder, has especial disdain for the international game. &quot;The national game is boring. And I&apos;ve not been to watch any match since I finished playing,&quot; he sniffed. &quot;I can never understand anybody paying to watch it, never mind going all the way across the world to see it. You want to be entertained.&quot; Finally, Richard West writes in to declare that &quot;we lived in a small village outside Oxford and our next-door neighbour was former Oxford Utd keeper Brian Sherratt. Brian confessed that his footballing talents had been a curse and a pox upon his life. He&apos;d never enjoyed the professional footballer&apos;s life and hated the training, the travelling and the hassle. In semi-retirement he was an obsessive handyman and would hammer away in his shed from dawn till dusk.&quot; Do you know of any other players with such antipathy for the game? Then let us know at knowledge@theguardian.com. FOOTBALL-INSPIRED ALBUMS (2) Last week we tried to give you a comprehensive round-up of football-inspired albums. As approximately 4,000,000 of you let us know - with varying degrees of indignation - we missed a few out. Here are the best of the rest ... &quot;A fine one you&apos;ve certainly missed is inspirational post-rock band Mogwai&apos;s recent soundtrack to the movie Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait,&quot; points out Bertil Wennerberg. &quot;The music is cosmic post-rock at its best.&quot; And before you ask why - if we&apos;re going to include soundtracks - we don&apos;t also mention those of such classic movies as Goal! and When Saturday Comes, it&apos;s because they were both compilations, and if we start including those this show will go on forever. Of course, while Zidane might seem our most obvious omission, it wasn&apos;t the first thing that came to everyone&apos;s mind. &quot;I immediately thought of local post-rockers Audiotransparent,&quot; raves Bas Vlaming. &quot;Their second album was named Nevland, after the hugely popular Norwegian forward Erik Nevland of FC Groningen.&quot; Yes, that would be the same Erik Nevland who trotted out for Manchester United in a few Cup games back in the late 90s. And scored twice as Viking FK Stavanger knocked Chelsea out of the Uefa Cup in 2002. It seems The Dentists, meanwhile, actually pre-empted our question by re-releasing their album Some People are on the Pitch They Think It&apos;s All Over It Is Now. &quot;Recorded in just a few days with The Prisoners&apos; Allan Crockford at the controls, SPAOTPTTIAOIIN was a brave departure from the rough &apos;n&apos; tumble &apos;60s garage rock of their peers, looking to The Smiths, REM and Go-Betweens as much as The Kinks, Byrds and Who for its inspiration,&quot; claims a press release from Revola, the label responsible for the re-release. But it&apos;s also most important that we don&apos;t forget legendary avant-garde reggae producer Adrian Sherwood&apos;s 1989 album The English Disease. &quot;Don&apos;t forget legendary avant-garde reggae producer Adrian Sherwood&apos;s 1989 album The English Disease,&quot; implores Matt Thompson. &quot;Released under the name of The Barmy Army, Sherwood sampled terrace chants as well as writing lyrics largely extolling the virtues of West Ham.&quot; Graham King, meanwhile, has fresh news from Germany. &quot;Pretty surprised that Herr Eberhard Spohd forgot about that ageing Teutonic rocker and actor Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer (from Das Boot fame),&quot; reckons Graham. &quot;He had a song/album named after his beloved VFL Bochum 1848, called simply Bochum on the album 4630 Bochum.&quot; Further nods go to Serious Drinking for their greatest hits album The Hits, Misses and Own Goals of Serious Drinking, British jazz band Acoustic Alchemy for The Beautiful Game, The Business for Hardcore Hooligan and Ted Leo and the Pharmacists for Hearts of Oak, which Rolando de Aguiar reckons is a nod to the Ghanaian football team of that name. Paul Crankshaw points us in the direction of The Proclaimers&apos; Sunshine on Leith - an album named after a slightly soppy song they penned about Hibernian. And, just because so many of you mentioned it, here&apos;s a nod to The Fall&apos;s Theme from Sparta FC, even though it is indeed a song, not an album. The Guardian&apos;s very own Chris Taylor also points out that another Fall track, Kicker Conspiracy, is possibly the most all-encompassing football song ever. It deals with players (&quot;In the booze club George Best does rule&quot;), the football authorities (&quot;In the marble halls of the charm school/How flair is punished/Under marble Millichip the FA broods/On how flair can be punished&quot;), the media (&quot;J Hill&apos;s satanic reign&quot;) and hooliganism. GREUT SCOT! &quot;To continue the theme of football clubs having unusual crests or logos, I have noticed than the German Bundesliga 2 club, Greuther F\u00fcrth plays in what we would consider the Glasgow Celtic strip (green and white hoops), and moreover, has a shamrock in its crest,&quot; explains David Smith. &quot;Wikipedia offers no explanation. How about you?&quot; &quot;There is no Irish connection,&quot; writes our esteemed German correspondent Raphael Honigstein. &quot;The shamrock is part of the code of arms of the city of F\u00fcrth (Greuther F\u00fcrth were founded in 1996, when TSV Vestenbergsgreuth and SpVgg F\u00fcrth merged), but the precise meaning and origin is unclear. It shows up in the code of arms of one leading family, others say it symbolises centuries of arguments of three local powers, who all laid claim to the city. Another theory says it symbolised the peaceful coexistence of Protestants, Catholics and Jews in the city.&quot; Interestingly, the first of F\u00fcrth&apos;s three league titles (in their original inception) was presided over by English coach William Townley, who later took charge of Bayern Munich and the Dutch national side, while one of the club&apos;s most famous members and fans is former US secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, seen here on a past visit to the club&apos;s fantastically named Playmobil-Stadion. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Regarding Italian side Hellas Verona, the word Hellas means Greece. Was the team originally founded by Greeks?&quot; wondered Lazaros Spiropoulous in 2005. Lazaros was on the right lines. &quot;In 1903, a group of students from the &apos;Maffei&apos; grammar school in Verona founded a football club,&quot; explained Robert Blyth, a senior researcher at the Universita&apos; di Lecce. &quot;They were aided by some of their teachers, notably the teacher of Greek, one Professor Corrubulo, who suggested the name &apos;Hellas&apos; for the team.&quot; For more information on Verona - and a cracking read, besides - check out Tim Park&apos;s excellent A Season With Verona.

Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, is insisting that the Barclays and RBS consortium bids fall squarely within her jurisdiction under EU merger regulations. Under Dutch law, both bids have to be submitted to the banking regulator, the Dutch central bank (DNB), and approved, on &quot;prudential&quot; grounds, by the finance minister, Wouter Bos. He and Nout Wellink, the central bank governor, must decide whether the transactions are financially &quot;healthy&quot; or whether they put ABN Amro&apos;s stability at risk. The Dutch regulators&apos; powers to block foreign takeovers have been curtailed under EU rules brought in after Antonio Fazio, former Italian central bank governor, colluded with local financial interests to block ABN&apos;s takeover of Banca Antonveneta in 2005. The Dutch authorities can ask Ms Kroes for parts of the proposed transactions to be referred back to them because of their impact on domestic competition. Sources in Amsterdam admitted regulators from other EU countries could take an interest. In the case of the RBS consortium, four countries - Britain, Belgium and Spain as well as the Netherlands - are involved. Mr Wellink, who supported ABN in its battle to acquire Antonveneta, ran into fire last week from Charlie McCreevy, the EU internal market commissioner, for appearing to suggest that the RBS-led consortium&apos;s break-up bid would be more complicated and risky than the Barclays proposal. He was warned against protectionist sentiment. Mr Bos rode to his rescue, saying this was all a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; and protectionism had no place in the Dutch open-market economy. The central bank governor gives his advice to Mr Bos on the financial soundness of both transactions.

What do you do? Change your plans, usually, or stump up several times face value for tickets from a tout, broker or eBay seller. If you&apos;re Eric Baker, on the other hand, you have a flash of inspiration and set up a business that makes you millions of dollars. &quot;I was living in Boston in 1999 and trying to get tickets for me and my girlfriend to see the Lion King on Broadway,&quot; Baker recalls. &quot;It was massively popular then, and to get tickets you had to go through a tout or a broker. It&apos;s not a very pleasant experience - you don&apos;t know what the prices are or where your seats will be. I thought &apos;gosh, why doesn&apos;t this exist on the internet?&apos;&quot; At the height of dotcom mania, many people were having ideas and thinking &quot;why doesn&apos;t this exist on the internet?&quot; Unfortunately, many of those brilliant schemes - hello, Pets.com - would prove within a very short space of time to be spectacularly ill thought-out. But Baker, a Harvard graduate then studying at Stanford Business School, knew he had the germ of an idea that addressed a need. With prior experience working in venture capital, he reckoned he could get it off the ground, so co-founded Stubhub with a fellow student. The premise was simple: provide a secure online ticket exchange where tickets could be re-sold at a set price or auctioned, with sellers guaranteed their money and buyers guaranteed an authentic ticket. Baker and his co-founder devised a business model whereby sellers were charged a 15% commission and buyers 10%, raised finance and launched the company, providing an exchange for theatre, gig and sports tickets. It sold more than $400m worth of tickets in the US last year and was bought in January by eBay, for $307m. It had been a rewarding trip to the theatre. Baker parted company with Stubhub in 2004 after a disagreement about how the company was being run, but wisely remained a shareholder. Now 33, he has brought the ticket exchange idea to Europe, initially operating in the UK and Germany. The new business is called viagogo. Can Baker recreate success on the other side of the Atlantic? &quot;Absolutely,&quot; he insists, in an accent that lies somewhere between the confidence of an Ivy Leaguer and the laid-backness of a native Los Angelino. &quot;But it&apos;s really important that you understand the local market and don&apos;t simply say: &apos;We have all the answers because this is how it worked in the US.&apos; This is not what we&apos;re doing.&quot; One of the keys to viagogo&apos;s early success - it launched in August last year - has been Baker&apos;s canny employment of expertise. The company&apos;s advisory board of investors is almost a who&apos;s who of European ecommerce talent. They bring not only cash to the table but also a vast amount of experience. The board includes the likes of lastminute.com founder Brent Hoberman, sports business expert Ian Todd and Tele-Munchen&apos;s Herbert Kloiber. &quot;Those guys have been totally essential,&quot; admits Baker. &quot;In each market it&apos;s so important to have investors and advisers who can really give you the lay of the land - who are the real e-commerce players? What&apos;s the best way to look at sports deals? It gives us an unbeatable advantage, not just in terms of the balance sheet. Our staff is also incredibly cosmopolitan. We have Turks, Brits, Swiss people - we like to think of ourselves as the UN, but we get things done.&quot; That local knowledge has indeed been invaluable. For example, customers in Germany tend not to use credit cards as much as their counterparts in the UK, so there needs to be a greater emphasis on offering online payment. In Britain, viagogo faced a unique challenge when it attempted to move into the field of reselling football tickets. Selling tickets through Stubhub for Lakers games was one thing. But under British law, unauthorised reselling of football tickets is illegal, a restriction introduced by the government to combat hooliganism. Baker&apos;s solution was to work with clubs to obtain authorisation to resell tickets to official supporter groups, thus effectively giving viagogo a government-protected monopoly. So far, the company has signed deals with Manchester United and Chelsea in the UK, as well as a number of top-flight rugby union clubs, and Bayern Munich in Germany. In return, viagogo signed sponsorship deals with the clubs involved. &quot;Music and theatre is a bigger part of the business,&quot; says Baker, &quot;But from a marketing perspective some of the biggest deals you can do are with football clubs.&quot; All well and good, but football fans are a notoriously prickly lot, and viagogo has come in for some stick from critics who suggest that this kind of deal is basically legalised exploitation by the football clubs. Fans should sell tickets to fans, at face value, goes the thinking. Baker has faced further criticism from music fans who cry foul at websites auctioning tickets snaffled up by touts. But he remains sanguine. &quot;The reselling of tickets is not going to go away, so the question is how do you make it a better situation for the world that we live in today? I believe this is it.&quot; &quot;One of the reasons I started the company is that I&apos;m really passionate about going to events: I love sports, I love concerts. Everyone has something they like, so everyone, I think, is a potential customer. You might like The Police or Take That, or The History Boys or Mary Poppins, but everyone has had the experience of buying a ticket at some point in their life. This makes it easier. It&apos;s a very intuitive business and it&apos;s a massive potentially multi-billion dollar market.&quot; The competition Another challenge to the fledgling business comes from auction site eBay and Ticketmaster. The latter is the pre-eminent primary ticket-seller in the US, and has a sizeable presence in the UK. It has itself moved into the secondary ticketing market. Could these well-established companies give viagogo a rough ride? Baker shakes his head. &quot;EBay just doesn&apos;t work well for tickets, because it doesn&apos;t work well for time-sensitive items. If you buy a table and it&apos;s chipped, you can put your money into escrow, get your money back, leave negative feedback. If you want to go and see The Killers and you don&apos;t get your ticket on time, you&apos;ll never see that show. As the seller, you have a time-sensitive perishable good.&quot; &quot;As for Ticketmaster, in 2002, they said they were getting into secondary ticketing. Five years on and they&apos;re nowhere near us. They&apos;re a very smart company in terms of their core business, but there are conflicts of interest if you&apos;re a primary ticketing company going into the aftermarket. &quot;Imagine you go to the box office and ask for a Christina Aguilera ticket. They say &quot;In my left pocket I don&apos;t have any tickets, but in my right pocket we have tickets at 300 quid.&quot; You&apos;re already wondering why tickets sold out in 30 seconds, and now you&apos;re being told you can buy them from the same source at an increased price. That creates conflicts of interest both real and perceived with the fan. &quot;We believe these issues are the same for any primary ticketing company in the world. If we ever colonise the moon and build a stadium, we believe there will be a secondary ticketing business for the stadium and the primary ticket company will have the same problems as before.&quot; The performance of viagogo so far suggests such confidence is not misplaced. Although Baker won&apos;t be drawn on precise figures, since its launch in August 2006, the company has sold millions of pounds worth of tickets and has hundreds of thousands of registered user. By year five, Baker estimates, it should have \u00a3100m of revenue. &quot;We have a lot of work to do but we&apos;re very happy about the path we&apos;re on,&quot; he adds. The hard work is paying off. viagogo was recently named one of Red Herring magazine&apos;s top 100 privately held technology companies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It has also just signed a ticketing deal with lastminute.com, further increasing its profile. But for an expat American - Baker has never lived outside the US - with a healthy bank account, Europe is a playground, and so he uses his free time to explore his new back yard. He talks of his European experiences, travelling to the World Cup and Cannes, Amsterdam, even Stamford Bridge, with the enthusiasm of the outsider. One can imagine him striding from his Knightsbridge apartment, in his well-cut blazer, open-necked shirt and chinos, thinking &quot;Where can I go today?&quot; (to paraphrase another successful American businessman). &quot;It&apos;s always fun when going to see a customer means going to watch Chelsea,&quot; he laughs. &quot;There are worse things. You never work harder, you&apos;re always on, but psychologically it doesn&apos;t feel like work because you&apos;re so invested in it and you&apos;re doing great things. I&apos;ve never sold shower tiles, but I&apos;d imagine this is more fun.&quot; A day in the life &quot;Each day tends to be pretty diverse. I start the day early at the office in Hammersmith [west London] with meetings with heads of the technical, marketing and business development divisions, basically to make sure everyone&apos;s on the same page, everything running smoothly. &quot;Then there&apos;s the whole aspect of meetings around business development - new deals in music and sport in the main. That oftentimes involves travel to Germany and across the UK, up to Manchester and Liverpool. Bringing those deals in is very important. &quot;Hiring and recruiting is the lifeblood of any business, so I&apos;m constantly looking to identify great people who can come in and proselytise for the company. At the moment we still have less than 50 people but they&apos;re a great bunch. &quot;We&apos;re a young company so a lot of time is also given over to PR and marketing to publicise the business and answer questions in the marketplace. There are always meetings with accountants and lawyers as well. &quot;I love what I do. There are new challenges every day and we believe in what we&apos;re doing. We&apos;re not curing cancer or feeding the homeless, but we do believe this is a product consumers like and in a small way, we think we&apos;re making life better for them. &quot;I&apos;m definitely driven. Anything I like to do, I like to do well. The one area that perhaps gets overlooked when you&apos;re doing all these exciting things is sleep, but it&apos;s all for a good cause. &quot;When you&apos;re an entrepreneur and you have a vision, you have to have fire in your belly to build it into. Hopefully that becomes contagious at your business and you build a positive, fun ethos where people are feeling like they want to win.&quot;", "sentences": ["He talks of his European experiences, travelling to the World Cup and Cannes, Amsterdam, even Stamford Bridge, with the enthusiasm of the outsider."], "title": "Interview:  Eric Baker", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/27/consumernews.money", "tags": ["Business", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Technology"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-04-27T22:59:15Z", "article": "As a contemporary choral composer, Brian Ferneyhough wouldn&apos;t immediately come to mind.

More than 20,000 jobs across the two banks are at risk and some campaigners are worried the merger could mean cuts to Barclays&apos; UK branch network. If it is approved, the new group will have its headquarters in Amsterdam. Derek French, of the Campaign for Community Banking Services, believes the merger will impact on Barclays customers. &quot;To the fifth-largest bank in the world, headquartered outside the UK, the UK high street will represent a much less significant profit contributor,&quot; he adds. Mr French says you only need to look at the example of Britain&apos;s biggest bank, HSBC, which has closed a string of branches this year. Hard-nosed sell: A bank in Lebanon is offering &quot;plastic surgery loans&quot; to people living in the notoriously image-conscious country, according to the BBC News website. First National Bank says its loans mean &quot;beauty is no longer a luxury&quot;. Customers can borrow \u00a3250 to \u00a32,500 for surgery. The bank says it has received more than 200 calls a day about the loan since it was launched recently with a TV and poster campaign. The Beeb website adds helpfully that &quot;there is usually a sharp increase in breast augmentation surgery in the spring, as women prepare for the summer season spent on Lebanon&apos;s beaches&quot;. Cheap trips can cost a fortune: The pound may have broken through the two-dollar barrier, but Britons rushing to book cheap trips to the States should remember that medical treatment in the US is among the most expensive in the world. American Express Insurance Services says that if you fall ill in the US, or need emergency medical treatment, it can cost a small fortune if you do not have the right travel cover. &quot;One customer had 16 hours of tests in an American hospital which generated a bill of $20,000 [\u00a310,000],&quot; it says. Not a lot of people know that: Here&apos;s the latest news from the department of the bleedin&apos; obvious: UK consumers are &quot;confused by personal finance issues&quot;. Stroud &amp; Swindon building society says it quizzed the public and found that many people displayed a worrying lack of knowledge when it came to tax, mortgages and Isas. Only 60% realised that it is the buyer who is responsible for paying stamp duty when a house is sold, while more than two-thirds did not believe a current account mortgage was a real product.

It will take the Royal Bank of Scotland&apos;s chief executive some time to get over his fury at the rebuff from ABN Amro, the Dutch bank headquartered in the city, that greeted his visit there last Monday. Having spent the plane journey making last-minute preparations for the meeting at which he and his fellow consortium members, Belgium&apos;s Fortis and Spain&apos;s Santander, would explain the merits of their proposed takeover of the bank, he arrived at Schiphol airport to discover that ABN had recommended a \u20ac72bn (\u00a349bn) bid from Barclays. It had also signed an unconditional deal to sell its American banking chain LaSalle - one of the prime attractions for Goodwin - to Bank of America, while ABN&apos;s chief executive, Rijkman Groenink, had such a busy schedule that he could no longer fit in a meeting with the consortium. &apos;It beggars belief,&apos; said one senior RBS adviser. &apos;The exclusivity agreement [which ABN had signed with Barclays] expired on the Friday and they clearly worked on the announcement all weekend. But we got nothing from Groenink cancelling the scheduled meeting until mid-morning on Monday.&apos; Goodwin, who is never one of the most patient of men, was furious. His mood hardly improved over the course of the week as Groenink made his contempt for the consortium clear. Initially he offered it access to the bank&apos;s books ahead of a formal bid, only to hedge it with the condition that if the consortium took up the opportunity they would have to agree not to mount a hostile bid for a year. He did, however, back down later. Such obstructive tactics are anathema to Goodwin, whose style is straight-talking, open and direct - a sharp contrast to the circumlocution of Sir John Varley, his counterpart at Barclays. While Varley comes across as an intellectual talking to a lecture hall of spotty students who could not be expected to understand his esoteric points, Goodwin is more like a bright PhD researcher trying to enthuse the rest of the department about his fascinating subject. He claims not to have any kind of grand plan for the future, whether his own or his businesses. &apos;We have a philosophy that you shouldn&apos;t try to predict the future, but rather spend your time preparing yourself for what the future might bring,&apos; he said. However, the fact that it was able to put together a consortium that, so far at least, has remained rock solid, shows that he recognises the importance of that old Boy Scout motto: Be Prepared. Until 2005, Santander was RBS&apos;s biggest shareholder, under a cross-holding agreement dating back to the 1980s. Although there is no longer a shareholding relationship, Goodwin has remained close to Emilio Botin, Santander&apos;s chairman. &apos;It is not just a business relationship it is a very good friendship,&apos; said a Royal Bank insider. &apos;They play golf together, Emilio comes across here four times a year and Fred and George [Mathewson, RBS&apos;s former chairman] go across there.&apos; The relationship has helped both parties before. Santander helped RBS to raise some of the money for its purchase of NatWest in 2000, while Royal helped Santander&apos;s purchase of Banesto in Brazil. &apos;There aren&apos;t many friends you can do that with,&apos; commented Goodwin. The two men made contact about a joint bid for ABN as soon as Barclays announced its exclusive period of negotiations. They invited Fortis on board to help with the Dutch retail banking operations, which did not sit well with either the Spanish or Scottish bank. Exact details of the agreement between them have not been revealed - &apos;we stand shoulder-to-shoulder,&apos; is all an adviser would say - but, given the history of the relationship, it seems unlikely that RBS would consider breaking away from the consortium to bid for LaSalle alone, as some City observers have suggested. A purely American purchase would, perhaps, evoke too many bad memories. Goodwin&apos;s last big acquisition was of US bank CharterOne, a deal that has been widely criticised for being overpriced, inappropriately financed and badly timed. Indeed, it has taken three years for many investors to forgive him enough to accept this potential deal. Some of them applaud it - though that owes much to the fact that it is part of a consortium, thus spreading the acquisition risk, and that ABN is seen as ripe for rationalisation and the injection of some decent management. Goodwin has more experience of such deals than most bankers. He earned the &apos;Fred the Shred&apos; moniker at Clydesdale Bank, where he took his first banking job, as deputy chief executive, in 1995. He said then that he had no time for &apos;cynics, spectators or dead wood&apos; and that remains true today. He really made his mark in the City when he spearheaded the integration of NatWest, still widely acknowledged as one of the best banking deals ever done, which greatly exceeded expectations both in terms of cutting costs and boosting revenues of the combined bank. That, say insiders, reflects both his careful planning and the ruthlessness with which he drives his staff to come up with the answers he wants. Trawling through the books - a key sticking point in the current ABN negotiations - is, to his mind, crucial. Before buying CharterOne, for example, RBS spent the equivalent of 500 person-days examining the bank&apos;s books before going ahead - although the subsequent poor performance of CharterOne indicates that is no guarantee of getting it right. &apos;You have a long time to regret it if you don&apos;t,&apos; he said. Goodwin rarely agrees to a profile - although more, one suspects, because he would find the questions irritating than to any desire to protect his private life. Still only 48, he was the youngest chief executive of a FTSE 100 company when he was appointed chief executive in 2000 after a two-year stint as deputy and heir apparent to Mathewson. Born in Paisley, just to the west of Glasgow, he studied law at Glasgow University before joining Touche Ross, as accountant Deloitte &amp; Touche was then known. While there, he worked on the liquidation of BCCI - one of the most complex operations in British corporate history - before being headhunted by Clydesdale Bank. He claims never to have had an ambitious game plan to get him to this elevated position. &apos;Always in my career I&apos;ve admired people who have plans for their careers; who sit down and say &quot;I want to do this for five years and that for five years,&quot;&apos; he said. &apos;I mean that sincerely; I have never had a plan. I never had a plan to leave Touche Ross. I never had a plan to go to Clydesdale. I never had a plan to come to the Royal Bank. The phone rang one day and here we are.&apos; If the consortium bid comes off, &apos;here&apos; will be one of the biggest international banking groups, and one of the biggest five in the US. The only current alternative - standing by watching while Barclays takes that prize - will be too painful for him to contemplate.

Dutch shareholders&apos; group VEB went to court on Saturday to derail the LaSalle sale, arguing that it required shareholder approval and would make it difficult to attract other bids for ABN. Judge Huub Willems of the Amsterdam district court&apos;s enterprise chamber said he would have to delay his decision because of a lecture trip to the United States. Bank of America agreed to buy LaSalle from ABN this week, in a deal linked to Barclays&apos; offer for ABN, but the VEB claims that this is a &quot;poison pill&quot; which deters potential bids for the whole group. A consortium of Royal Bank of Scotland, Banco Santader of Spain and Dutch-Belgian bank Fortis has said it can pay more than Barclays and is hoping Judge Willems will hold up the sale of LaSalle because it is interested in the whole of ABN. It has indicated it would pay \u20ac39 (\u00a327) a share, or \u20ac72bn for the whole group, compared with \u20ac35 Barclays would pay.

From May 5 to September 1, the public can have close encounters with the original props, costumes and models used in the series of six films that has become a phenomenon of popular culture. Whether or not you can afford to take students to the London leg of this worldwide exhibition - and it&apos;s not cheap - May is actually Museums and Galleries Month. So now is the time to consider a quick jaunt out of the classroom to some of the many museums and galleries providing exciting learning opportunities throughout the UK. Feeling the force The seeds of the Star Wars exhibition (www.starwarstheexhibition.com) go back to the first Star Wars film, A New Hope, released in May 1977. Not only did it have a powerful influence on subsequent films, but it also introduced us to new worlds, endearing droids and the Jedi (which later appeared as the religious persuasion of nearly 400,000 of us in the 2001 census). Focusing on Star Wars provides a great opportunity to investigate the power of the media and popular culture. There are a number of online quizzes you can use to introduce the topic, for example, this one. Or you can create your own using the official site. Students can decide which Star Wars character they are most like here. Be prepared to have a number of Darth Vaders in your class. Star Wars was a landmark series of films and is therefore a good focus for media studies. But its huge popularity can make it difficult for students to take an objective stance. Film Education produces excellent media studies resources, which feature a useful guide to popular film genres, including science fiction. Students will learn to be more analytical in their approach. Go here. Trailers and parodies Film trailers make excellent teaching resources for media studies, being compact and distilled accounts of the original. Access Film Education&apos;s teaching trailers guide before viewing a trailer from the official Star Wars site, for example, this one, and identifying the genre and conventions of the film. This activity can take students on to producing marketing and promotional materials for another film in the Star Wars series. Star Wars is much parodied. Grocery Store Wars, for example, uses Star Wars to promote organic veg. Students readily take to parodies. Not only can they be fulfilling and creative to produce, but they help students to understand how the film works by defining character types, settings and dialogue. With the help of a digital camcorder, students can work with real zeal creating their own parodies. YouTube provides some DIY inspiration for budding filmmakers. Local inspiration If London is too distant, look for exhibitions closer to home. Museums and galleries are the most popular destination for school visits, visited by 37% of all schoolchildren in 2005. You can browse through an alphabetical list of museums at here or search for galleries regionally here. Alternatively, look up current exhibitions at the 24-hour museum. The 24-hour museum also has teachers&apos; pages, where you can search for museums and galleries by topic, as well as an excellent children&apos;s site at www.show.me.uk. Many museums and galleries provide imaginative and useful web resources. These can be used to help prepare for a visit, or as a resource in their own right. The National Gallery&apos;s education pages include exciting &quot;zoomable&quot; pictures that allow students to get close in and explore high definition images. Students enjoy searching for particular subjects or motifs in pictures, such as dogs or fruit. Schools and museums between them have produced some superb resources like the Reticulum project which has created a fun, interactive website on the Romans. If you&apos;re inspired to forge links, Creative Partnerships, the government project aimed at promoting links with schools and outside groups, may be able to offer support. A museum at school The Museums Association defines museums as places that &quot;enable people to explore collections for inspiration, learning and enjoyment&quot;. Some schools do have their own museums, and Museums and Galleries Month would be a good time to set one up in your school. There&apos;s useful advice on exactly how to at here. And if you can&apos;t get to a museum or gallery, let them come to you. Video conferences with experts can be incredibly powerful. Organisations such as Global Leap can help to get you started. Institutions such as the Anne Frank House museum in Amsterdam, the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London and the National Portrait Gallery all provide conferencing.

And yet each area has one thing in common with the others: they&apos;re great for business. For industry it couldn&apos;t be clearer. The region has numerous initiatives that are not only intent on helping new business start-ups but are at the forefront of welcoming new industry to the area. The north-east has long had a culture of being &quot;employee-based&quot;, and having seen the decline of its industrial past, dominated by shipbuilding and mining, the area and its people have had to build and regain their confidence. Yet the northeast&apos;s reputation for innovation and industrial change should come as no surprise in a region that was arguably the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, where Sunderland-born Joseph Swan pioneered the electric light and where George Stephenson built the first steam locomotive. Business support can come in various guises; organisations such as Tedco, Project North East, Bic (Business and Innovation Centre), Inbiz and Entrust have great records in helping germs of ideas become fully blown businesses. Local council support varies due to budget constraints but, for example, South Tyneside had a huge boost in 2006, when it was awarded \u00a316.2m to fuel and encourage enterprise in the area. The region&apos;s universities offer unique research collaborations, often focused on innovative design, with companies accessing state-of-the-art prototyping with grants and tax credit schemes helping to minimise the risk. Regeneration initiatives such as Renew Tees Valley aim to increase economic activity in the area with its role as a UK centre for renewable energy and waste management technologies - as well as being a boon for the environment. And the region&apos;s five Centres of Excellence - including Newcastle&apos;s Centre For Life (granted the first licence in the UK to clone human embryonic stem cells), NaREC in Blyth and CPI in Tees Valley - have been set up to drive the potential and maximise the commercial value of research and new technology created in the north-east. Partnerships Key to the region is partnerships; many organisations collaborate with each other and work in tandem with One North East, the regional development agency, along with the newly formed Business Link North East (BLNE) - funded by One and (uniquely in the UK) the Learning and Skills Council. The merging of the north-east chamber of commerce and three separate Business Link outposts into one has not been without controversy; other advisory services will potentially see their funding cut and their role in the business sector reduced; redundancies for some may be on the cards. However, with its first annual budget of over \u00a330m, the aim of establishing a singular regional business support service in BLNE is to give the best possible assistance to those who need it most - the business community. The range of support offered in the region depends on the business or individual in question. For start-ups it can focus on one-to-one informal chats, building confidence and discovering if a business proposal is viable, to accessing finance such as business start-up grants where up to \u00a33,000 is available to buy up to 50% of the cost of vital equipment, or loans for those who can&apos;t raise the necessary funds from the normal routes - for example their bank manager. Finding suitable premises can be a drain, whether a small hi-tech office or a fully blown factory or warehouse is needed. Middlesbrough&apos;s DigitalCity acts as a magnet to attract digital media and technology- based businesses; a global survey of the best business incubation facilities has ranked Newcastle&apos;s Project North East (PNE) in the world&apos;s top 10 - its approach and unique fast broadband internet network &quot;Big Netty&quot; has seen business failure rates drop from 35%, to around 5% today. Excellent purpose-built business centres and science parks are dotted throughout the region and many councils offer significant rate subsidies. For established and relocating businesses, the region is fully geared up to aid workforce development, with training initiatives or help with recruitment, for example, sector development, productivity improvement and export assistance (One has a network of international offices) for those intent on keeping one step ahead of the global competition. To encourage job creation and retention, south Tyneside&apos;s major business grant fund has awards of up to \u00a350,000 for specific items such as plant and machinery. The government also offers Selective Finance for Investment (SFI) to overseasowned and domestic ccompanies opening, expanding or modernising a new plant. The region also has its fair share of venture capital firms and business angels. A minimum of \u00a35.6m under the Rural Development Programme for England is good news, too, for rural areas in the region, helping competitiveness with support for sustainable rural developments. Many factors have contributed to the region&apos;s industrial diversification, from food processing to advanced technology. But primarily, the north-east&apos;s biggest asset is its labour force - adaptable, loyal and innovative, and always with a sense of humour. Second only to this are the transport links: two international airports (Newcastle and Durham Tees Valley) link key hubs Heathrow, Gatwick and Amsterdam Schiphol. There are easy road links to Scotland and the south or west; London is less than three hours away by rail and there are five seaports including Teesport (the second largest in the UK) and the Port of Tyne, with direct ferry services to Holland, Norway and Sweden. But away from business, the north-east offers something unique: a way of life that is not only affordable (with some of the lowest housing prices in the country) but that has a wealth of natural and cultural assets. These range from internationally renowned world heritage sites, countryside that never fails to inspire (including two areas of outstanding natural beauty: the north Pennines and Northumberland coast), to its massive creative impetus and enthusiastic nightlife - from underground bars and clubs to Michelin-starred restaurants. The north-east is formidable - only the best need apply.", "sentences": ["Second only to this are the transport links: two international airports (Newcastle and Durham Tees Valley) link key hubs Heathrow, Gatwick and Amsterdam Schiphol."], "title": "The nerve centre of the north", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/01/billbryson", "tags": ["Bill Bryson"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-01T23:05:24Z", "article": "Rubbish must form many people&apos;s first impression of Britain. It was certainly what first struck me on returning from a recent trip abroad - literally, in the form of a wind-blown plastic bag attaching itself to my waist like a seedy sarong the second I emerged on to the pavement outside Heathrow airport. The British may cherish their weekly refuse collection (in the face of calls to make it fortnightly) but such incidents do make you wonder: are the British, to quote from Jeremy Paxman&apos;s recent anti-litter diatribe in this newspaper, &quot;a uniquely sordid people&quot;? Is Britain especially dirty? Those are, in fact, separate questions. To address the second question first, although there are too few comparable national littering studies to answer it definitively, evidence in a recent research paper from the environmental charity Encams suggests Britain as a country that probably does stand out for its trash. There is, first, the matter of expenditure. While cities such as Frankfurt and Brussels, for example, have street cleaning budgets of \u20ac100m (\u00a368m), a comparable city such as Manchester spends \u00a38m. You are also unlikely to be fined for littering in Britain. The few dozen environmental enforcement officers patrolling the streets of Amsterdam issue around 7,000 penalties a year; in all of England, there are about 500 litter convictions annually. Fines in continental Europe may not be on the scale of Singapore&apos;s - \u00a3400 for a first offence - but they typically sting more than England&apos;s \u00a350 and tend to carry a greater burden of shame. Powerful perception Finally, there is the perception, on the part of visitors and the British themselves, that Britain&apos;s streets are notably foul. Lonely Planet&apos;s most recent London guidebook may be less scathing about the city&apos;s environment than previous editions, but it still bemoans all the litter. In the absence of more objective indicators, the powerful perception that Britain has a litter problem can be taken as further evidence that, indeed, it has. Perception is, after all, precisely what litter offends. But that conclusion is so often coupled, as in Paxman&apos;s lament, with another claim that Britain in the past was spic and span and has only recently been so defiled. But the truth is that Britain has long been a pigsty. What has changed, however, is the quantity and kind of rubbish. Take London, for example. One can only wish the Keep Britain Tidy campaign good luck with Capital Standards, its new push to tidy up London in time for the Olympics, but in the long run it is bound to be frustrated. London is not only - as the writer Ian Sinclair, one of the city&apos;s most ardent recent chroniclers, described it to me - &quot;the epicentre of British rubbish&quot;, but possibly also of the world&apos;s. The garbage-strewn vista of pre-modern London is shorthand, in art and literature, for urban dystopia. Sinclair was astonished to discover, on a recent walk through Epping Forest, what he calls the &quot;rubbish contour lines&quot; of London. &quot;Approaching a nexus of cafes and roadside fast-food places,&quot; he recalls, he came upon &quot;Red Bull cans, lager cans, takeaway packages - a refuse line marking a trail back to the city&quot;. But he would have found some kind of litter periphery at almost any time in the history of the great metropolis. Look into the archives and you find Londoners constantly complaining about rubbish. Britain introduced a Sanitary Act as far back as 1338 but, by the 17th century, citing its &quot;apparent neglect ... throughout the City&quot;, one of Ken Livingstone&apos;s mayoral predecessors, Sir John Robinson, was threatening a fine of 20 shillings for any Londoner who failed to keep &quot;ashes, dust, filth, ordure, or other noisome thing whatsoever&quot; within their backyards until &quot;the raker or scavenger do come to carry away the same&quot;. The difference between modern rubbish and the rubbish of yore is that the latter was almost entirely organic. For centuries, pigs were left to roam among the human population in urban England, to snuffle up the rotting garbage on the streets. That reeking detritus must have had competition in the form of the human ordure that, as Emily Cockayne informs us in Hubbub, her recent book on &quot;filth, noise and stench&quot; in England, was often used to bulk out the walls of houses. Litter nostalgists look back no further than the 19th century and what John Scanlan, in his book On Garbage, calls &quot;the great cleanup&quot;, signalled by the introduction, in 1848, of the Public Health Act and, with it, systematic waste regulation. The Victorians conjoined cleanliness and virtue, a union that endured until the 1950s before the slide into the litter free-for-all of today. The 19th century also saw the expansion of the industrial revolution, born in Britain and the source of an explosion in the production of consumer goods. A nation of shopkeepers would seek to derive maximum profit from the latter by their minute dispensation in small glass, metal and, soon, plastic disposal packages. In time, pre-packaging, by the food processor or manufacturer, did away with the need for clerks measuring out supplies to customers on the shop floor. Thus were born the serried self-service aisles of packaged goods otherwise known as supermarkets - or dispensaries of pre-rubbish. We live in the age of packaging, and much of it on the streets of Britain today has been wrapped briefly around a greasy burger or kebab. In its latest national muckraking survey, Keep Britain Tidy found fast-food litter on a quarter of British streets. Disposable containers, which save on washing-up labour, are relatively sanitary and will not be pilfered, are so much a part of the fast-food industry that without them it would not exist. And Britain, with barely even the leftovers of a culinary tradition to call its own, has taken to fast food faster than probably any other European nation. Pizza slices But our neighbours are catching up. Even the French, according to a recent survey, list pizza slices as their favourite takeaway. British rubbish, in other words, could be the future - and that, according to Alexander Judd, a retired American can-manufacturing supremo, would be no bad thing. In his treatise, In Defence of Garbage, he argues that the benefits of packaging, in cutting food spoilage, increasing choice and in its sheer convenience, far outweigh incidental things such as litter. He is incredulous at people&apos;s yearning for the unsanitary, unpacked food of old. Deciding what is rubbish and what is good is a prerequisite of civilisation. There is, Scanlan reminds us, &quot;no waste in nature&quot;. Similarly, Judd enjoins us to recognise garbage as part of &quot;the inevitable residue of commerce&quot;; he recognises that the profit motive, rather than any moral failing, explains much of our modern rubbish. For him, the middens of crisp packets, cola bottles, carrier bags and sweet wrappers that mark Britain like the spoor of some garbage monster should be taken as a sign of blooming economic health. Yet it is, I suspect, precisely the intimate connection of garbage with civilisation that makes people abhor rather than applaud it. Rubbish, the sociologist Reiner Grundmann notes, &quot;is matter out of place&quot;. The litter scudding about our city streets hints terrifyingly at the underside of civilisation, at the disorder into which it could so easily collapse. That loathing can be exploited; unpopular councils do so regularly when they splash out on street-cleaning drives, for example. But such efforts, whatever their scale, must ultimately fail. Everything ends up as litter, including ourselves - which is perhaps what most bothers us about it.  \u00b7 Simon Busch is a journalist \u00b7 Email your comments to society@theguardian.com.

Greg Avery, who runs Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac), was among 30 alleged extremists seized from their homes at dawn in a police operation that was overseen by the National Extremist Crime Unit, according to police sources. Thirty-two addresses were raided, including one in Belgium and two in Amsterdam. Shac has campaigned for eight years to close Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS), an animal testing laboratory in Cambridgeshire. Shac states on its website that it does not support criminal activity, but has been viewed by animal rights activists as one of the most successful campaign groups. Those within the animal research world say it has created a climate of fear among those working in laboratories or linked in any way with HLS. More than 700 police were involved in what was one of the largest operations against alleged animal rights extremists. Fifteen men and 15 women were arrested from Berkshire, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex, Kent, London, south Wales, Lancashire and Yorkshire. The alleged offences include burglary and conspiracy to blackmail. Police search teams recovered documents, mobile phones, computer equipment and cash totalling around \u00a3100,000, according to a Hampshire police spokesman. Financial investigators from the City of London police economic crime unit are assisting the inquiry. Assistant chief constable Adrian Leppard, of Hampshire police, said that some of those arrested were linked. &quot;A number of people have been working together jointly to commit offences,&quot; he said. He also revealed that HLS had been involved in the investigation, although he would not give details. He said the arrests were the culmination of a two-year operation involving Hampshire, Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Thames Valley police forces. &quot;In recent years animal rights extremists have conducted sustained campaigns of harassment and intimidation against the animal research industry, seeking to achieve their objective by creating a climate of fear,&quot; he said. The 30 people arrested were being held at a number of police stations. One of the addresses raided was the Freshfields Animal Rescue Centre on Merseyside. Dave Callender, who runs the centre, has convictions for firebombing and formerly chaired the Animal Liberation Front (Alf) on Merseyside. Mr Callender, 47, was jailed for 10 years in March 1996 for conspiring to commit arson. A jury at Birmingham crown court heard he had enough material to make more than 100 incendiary devices. The prosecution alleged that he was planning a &quot;campaign directed at a number of targets which included cattle farms, slaughterhouses, meat traders, egg production farms and also societies connected with hunting or other field sports&quot;. Mr Callender was also a leader of demonstrations against fox hunting, hare coursing and the Grand National. But yesterday Mr Callender, who was not arrested, said he had given up his activist past. He condemned the police for their heavy-handed approach. &quot;They turned up at 5am and seized three members of staff from their beds,&quot; he said. &quot;They took another two who arrived at work at 6.20am. We have had no access to the property since and we have been unable to feed all our animals or clean them out.&quot; He added: &quot;None of the staff has been placed under arrest. We have nothing to hide here. I am an older, wiser man now.&quot; Mr Avery is one of a core of around 10 individuals who run Shac. Activists credit Shac with ensuring that HLS shares have collapsed on the London and New York stock exchanges as it lost shareholders and suppliers who have been targeted by activists. A police source said the activists would have known that they were under surveillance for some time. &quot;They tend to be very careful what they do,&quot; the source said.

Photograph: Stuart Ramson/AP Last night the schedules of the Sky Arts channel were full of programmes about the Berlin Philharmonic, &quot;considered by many music lovers to be the world&apos;s greatest orchestra&quot; as Sky put it in its publicity. No one would argue that the Berlin Phil is up there with the best, and has been for more than half a century or so, but whether it is so superior to all its rivals that it deserves an evening&apos;s programming to itself is another matter. Will the Berlin evening be followed in due course by similar evenings devoted to the Chicago Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Royal Concertgebouw from Amsterdam, the London Symphony or the Vienna Philharmonic? I rather doubt it, for ever since Herbert von Karajan ruled West Berlin&apos;s (as it was then) musical life with a baton of iron its leading orchestra has been surrounded by a carefully manufactured aura. Whatever one&apos;s views on Karajan as a conductor or a human being - and opinions differ widely on both topics - no one could deny that he was a superb publicist, both for himself and for his orchestra, and part of the myth that he manufactured was that he was in charge of the supreme musical machine. Many people fell for it, and the myth has survived the humanising process begun by Karajan&apos;s successor as music director, Claudio Abbado, and carried on now by Simon Rattle.  The Berlin Philharmonic is a more fallible orchestra now that it was in Karajan&apos;s day, but it is one with a character of its own. It is not a better or a worse orchestra than any others in the world elite, just a different one. Everybody has their own favourite - mine, for what it&apos;s worth, is the Royal Concertgebouw, which seems able to adapt to different conductors and different musical styles with total conviction, while always keeping something of its unique tonal blend; it helps, too, that its home is in the Concertgebouw itself, one of the world&apos;s very finest concert halls.

The surprise decision of the court to freeze the sale of ABN Amro&apos;s US subsidiary LaSalle appeared to open the way for an RBS-led bid which could threaten the ambition of Barclays to buy the Dutch group and become the world&apos;s fifth biggest bank. ABN Amro has agreed to be taken over by Barclays but the transaction is contingent upon a side deal to sell LaSalle to Bank of America. Yesterday&apos;s court ruling that the \u00a310.7bn sale of LaSalle should be put to a vote of ABN Amro shareholders cast confusion over the takeover despite Barclays&apos; insistence that it would be &quot;continuing to pursue its recommended merger with ABN Amro which offers significant value to shareholders&quot;. The RBS consortium was pressing on its with its plans and is expected to meet with the embattled ABN Amro chief executive Rijkman Groenink today. The consortium wrote to the management of the Dutch bank yesterday with outline details of the complex funding for its cash and share offer. The meeting with Mr Groenink, who was facing fresh calls for his resignation last night, could pave the way for a bid by the consortium, which includes Santander of Spain and Dutch-Belgian group Fortis, over the weekend. The implications of the ruling by the Dutch enterprise chamber were being digested by lawyers from all the banks involved last night but it is possible that it could prompt further litigation, casting uncertainty over the ownership of ABN Amro for many more months and causing confusion for employees. Bank of America could take its own legal action, as could Barclays, and the US bank was thought to be considering last night whether to launch an appeal to the Dutch court by the June 14 deadline. The ruling by judge Huub Willems in the enterprise chamber of the Amsterdam superior court was welcomed by shareholders in ABN Amro. TCI, the London hedge fund which started a rebellion at last week&apos;s ABN Amro annual meeting, described the decision to allow a shareholder vote on the LaSalle sale as &quot;an important precedent for European corporate governance&quot;. Peter de Vries of Dutch shareholder group VEB which took the case to the court said: &quot;This is a historic decision. Their trick has failed. This is fantastic. I am absolutely delighted.&quot; The shareholder group had argued that the sale of LaSalle was a &quot;poison pill&quot; in the Barclays deal intended to thwart any counter offers from the likes of the RBS consortium. The consortium wants to carve up ABN Amro and LaSalle is particularly important to the would-be bidders as RBS is keen to take control of the US arm.

Shares in RBS fell 13p to \u00a319.63 amid speculation that it was preparing a bid that would require it to issue shares while Barclays&apos; shares rose 22p to 744.5p as the market guessed it might not be successful and would not need to use its shares to buy ABN Amro. ABN Amro&apos;s shares were up almost 2% at \u20ac36.60 (\u00a324.95), still below the \u20ac39 a share that the consortium claims it could offer. The consortium needs to convince ABN Amro shareholders that it can raise \u00a335bn in cash to buy the Dutch bank.

The move would create Britain&apos;s first academic health science centre (AHSC). It will then apply to become a foundation trust, which will give it far greater independence from Whitehall.

Now every lawyer can get fat. Yesterday&apos;s court ruling in Amsterdam to freeze the sale of LaSalle creates chaos. Barclays&apos; ambition for a friendly deal is alive, but the pulse is weaker. RBS&apos;s hopes of landing the prize have improved, but only if it, and its chums at Fortis and Santander, are prepared to brave the barrage of lawsuits that could be launched. They think they&apos;ve found a way to dodge the avalanche. Expect a conditional bid for ABN&apos;s US unit LaSalle, trumping Bank of America&apos;s $21bn offer, to land on or before Sunday&apos;s deadline for counter-offers. The condition, of course, is enormous: ABN shareholders must also back a sale, at \u20ac39 a share, of the rest of their bank to the consortium, which would then carve up the pieces between itself on its own terms. If BofA responds by raising its own bid for LaSalle, the consortium will simply go higher. The combined total cost to the members is capped at \u20ac39 a share so, in theory, they can attribute tons of value to LaSalle and knock the difference off other parts of ABN. This might be called a &quot;swings and roundabouts&quot; principle, and it would be no surprise if BofA thinks it is an artificial construct that has no place in the modern financial world. As soon as Sir Fred Goodwin at RBS came into view, BofA put some of New York&apos;s fiercest corporate lawyers on standby and would presumably unleash them at the first sniff of funny business. Goodwin, one assumes, thinks the conditional bid route is legally bullet-proof. If it&apos;s not, trouble lies ahead because BofA&apos;s chief executive, Ken Lewis, is one of the biggest beasts in the banking jungle and will not take kindly to being outmanoeuvred by what he might regard as a clever investment bankers&apos; wheeze. There would seem to be only one sure-fire way to avoid a lawyers&apos; paradise. ABN&apos;s shareholders are perfectly free to support the sale of LaSalle to BofA and to back Barclays&apos; takeover bid. This outcome is not impossible. Aside from the litigation risks, any consortium bid will come with regulatory risks, given the hostile statements in the past from the Dutch central bank. ABN&apos;s shareholders have to weigh all this. Is \u20ac39 a share, with risks attached, really worth more than Barclays&apos; simpler all-share offer, currently worth about \u20ac35 a share? And will the consortium hold together? A caravan of three moves at the pace of its slowest member. When it comes to it, are shareholders in Fortis, for example, really prepared to support an enormous rights issue that could be extremely expensive to underwrite? ABN&apos;s shareholders, despite their militancy over the past month, might ultimately decide to vote for the certainty of the Barclays offer. We shall see, but Goodwin, assuming he does step up to the plate, can at least claim he has succeeded in giving ABN&apos;s shareholders the right to determine their bank&apos;s future. That alone may mean the position of Rijkman Groenink, ABN&apos;s chief executive, is now impossible. He told Barclays, BofA, and everybody else that shareholder approval was not needed to sell LaSalle; the Dutch court, subject to appeal, has contradicted him. Amid yesterday&apos;s confusion, the instant judgment of the stock market was easily overlooked. In fact, the share price movements look highly significant. Barclays, as it suffered a setback to its hopes of landing ABN, rose. RBS, after the boost from the Amsterdam courts, fell. Investors, it seems, think the principle of &quot;winners&apos; curse&quot; applies. It would not be a surprise because this story could run for months. Will anybody at ABN be doing any banking? Pension poser So, it&apos;s not only KKR, Stefano Pessina, Sir Nigel Rudd and the other leading characters in the Alliance Boots saga who can play hardball. John Watson, chairman of the pension scheme, wants \u00a31bn for the fund, including \u00a3500m up-front, sums that will infuriate the bidders who thought \u00a3250m might be enough. By announcing a precise figure and issuing a strongly-worded statement, Watson cannot be seen to settle for much less than \u00a31bn. That was the point of going public. He is clearly annoyed at KKR&apos;s spin that the negotiations were &quot;constructive&quot; and has decided to throw some light on the position and let Boots&apos; staff and pensioners have their say. It&apos;s a sensible strategy. The last thing Pessina and KKR want is a disgruntled workforce. Nor does the world of private equity want the reputation, fair or otherwise, that it is prepared to short-change the pension fund. And Pessina and KKR certainly don&apos;t want to walk away from their record-breaking takeover.

Rough Guides are celebrating their anniversary with a new series of 25 &quot;Ultimate Experience&quot; guides out now, charting unmissable things to do in countries and regions, as well as themes such as wildlife, journeys, wonders of the world, and ethical travel. We asked the two publishers to recall 25 of their own all-time favourite travel experiences. 1. Greek island hopping I got an office job for a few months after leaving university and it was the persistent thought of hopping on Greek ferries, and exploring the islands, that made me chuck it in and head to Greece, without a contract, to write the first Rough Guide. There are few things in life so romantic and pleasurable as sitting with a Greek coffee on the quayside, waiting for a boat to edge into harbour and transport you to a new island, with all the promise of a fresh microcosm of life. This is what made me fall in love with travel in the first place and it still hits the button. ME 2. Driving the Amalfi coast I&apos;m not that into cars, but cruising the Amalfi coast in a high-speed convertible has to be one of the best experiences going - not only for the spectacular scenery and arse-clenching sheer drops, but also because it has the filmic, fantasy element that every good travel experience should have. For the most precipitous drops, base yourself in Sorrento and drive across the peninsula to the coast from there. MD amalfitouristoffice.it 3. Getting lost in Fes The truly labyrinthine medina is entirely medieval in layout and its secretive back alleys and souks still seem to belong to an earlier age, with traffic restricted to single lane donkeys. All the traditional crafts are present in their age-old quarters of town - the brilliant skeins signalling the dyers&apos; souk, the acrid smell of the tanneries and the amazing array of plant and insect-derived ingredients in the streets of traditional herbalists. There are stunning monuments, too, and delicious street snacks. ME 4. Swimming under the Pont du Gard A massive Roman aqueduct spans the Gardon river just outside the Provencal town of Uz\u00e8s. You can stroll right across it, but the best thing to do is to join the hordes of locals swimming in the (sadly ever more shallow) river and breaststroke right underneath. MD 5. FC Barcelona at the Camp Nou I saw my first game there when Gary Lineker was turning out for Barca, which was fun. But it&apos;s the current team - with Messi and Ronaldinho and Deco - that provide the ultimate experience, rousing the vast (and often surprisingly quiet) crowds of devotees. The stadium has a beauty of its own, too, and the experience is entirely unintimidating. ME fcbarcelona.com 6. Walking the South West Coast Path This is my favourite walk in Britain, especially the stretches along the north Cornwall coast around Port Isaac and Tintagel, and further along in Devon and Somerset, where the high plateau of Exmoor meets the sea around Ilfracombe, Lynton and Porlock - a great reminder of the incredible richness and diversity of the English landscape and coastline. MD swtourism.co.uk 7. Eurostar to Paris - and beyond What&apos;s the best travel innovation for us Brits over the past 20 years? Cheap flights to allow binge-flying weekend breaks? I think not. But you&apos;d have to be a very sourpuss not to purr with pleasure at the existence of the Eurostar, which since 1994 has connected us to the continent. It&apos;s relatively green and makes a night in Paris an easy jaunt if you live within reasonable distance of London. And this year the connections beyond are going genuinely high-speed, bringing most of France, Belgium and Germany within comfortable train orbit. ME eurostar.com 8. Sailing in New York harbour In the summer of 2001, I joined a New Jersey sailing club with a friend, and we spent some happy weekends tacking across the harbour, dodging the cruise liners and Staten Island ferry. I&apos;d still recommend it to anyone. MD 9. Hot air ballooning over Luxor I was suspicious of hot air balloon tours, ever since hearing that giraffes cricked their necks looking up at balloon-safaris in Africa. But a balloon ride over Luxor - for under \u00a350pp - had me converted, at least to non-giraffe locales. It&apos;s the most seductive sensation, floating along still and quiet for most of the trip, and there is nothing to beat the unrestricted, open-air view of the Temple of Karnak and the Valley of the Kings. The anarchic nature of ballooning is appealing, too: we landed next to a school and the balloon was immediately engulfed by kids. ME 10. Queen&apos;s Day, Amsterdam Their monarch&apos;s birthday at the end of April is commemorated all over the country. But if you&apos;re after something more energetic than bunting and cakestalls you need to be in Amsterdam, which lives it up to the max in 24 hours of non-stop partying. It&apos;s the one day you can tour the city by boat and go more or less anywhere you please: there is a huge amount of traffic on the water - vessels, fuelled by large sound systems and crates of beer, that you can leap on and off at will. MD amsterdamtourist.nl 11. Red Sea snorkelling The Red Sea coral is a stunning world to explore, with azure and opal blennies, tentacled clownfish and shoals of butterfly fish darting in and out of vision. You desperately hope that it will endure climate change and rising sea temperatures. ME 12. Wildlife watching in Queensland For me, what is special about Oz is the wildlife. This was brought home to me on a trip to see friends in tropical northern Queensland. They took us up into the mountains and we stayed in a settlement of shacks where there were kangaroos and wallabies bouncing about outside, cockatoos making a din in the trees, and a river filled with platypus. We did a night walk through the rainforest spotting spiders and skinks, after which we had to pull the leeches off our skin, and then on the coast saw cassowaries and crocodiles. MD queenslandholidays.com.au 13. Druidstone Hotel, Pembrokeshire Whenever I&apos;m asked if I now prefer Marriotts to youth hostels, I give the Druidstone as an example of my perfect hotel. It&apos;s positioned on top of a cliff, bang on the Pembrokeshire Coastal Path and above one of the loveliest beaches in the world. It is run by a family for whom the word &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; might have been invented and who employ staff in the same spirit. It has a walled garden for late afternoon sun and a bar that stays open till the last guest leaves. Kids love it, teenagers love it, adults love it. In fact, the only people who don&apos;t love Druidstone are exactly the type you want to avoid on holiday - Cond\u00e9 Nast style-victims who require personal hot-tubs and who occasionally show up, and turn away even before they&apos;ve reached reception. ME druidstone.co.uk 14. Jaisalmer and the Thar desert What I like about Jaisalmer in Rajasthan is that it feels so much like the end of the line, a frontier town that due to its location bang on the Pakistan border isn&apos;t an easy place to reach; you can&apos;t fly, which means a classic train journey or road-trip through the desert from Jodphur or Udaipur - by bus or, even better, in a white Indian Ambassador. Once there, you can wander around the fort, haggle with shopkeepers for carpets and bedspreads, or take a camel ride out into the desert and sleep under the stars. MD 15. Palazzo Farnese, Rome It&apos;s been home to the French embassy for years, but it only started letting in ordinary mortals last year. You have to make an appointment, sometimes weeks in advance, but the prize is the chance to see Carracci&apos;s famous fresco of the Loves of the Gods, which almost leaps off the ceiling to greet you. MD farnese.net 16. Zip-wiring in Costa Rica  I&apos;m not a big fan of &quot;adventure travel&quot;: the idea that you can&apos;t admire some monument without bungee jumping from its pinnacles. But Costa Rica&apos;s rainforest zip-wires are a bit special. You are strapped in for each stage and introduced to a series of thrilling rides above the forest canopy - first for just 40 or 50m, but then as you gain confidence, for rides across whole valleys, soaring 80ft in the air across an awesome 600m span. Oddly enough, the zip-wires are rather an inspired bit of eco development, turning natural resource into tourist attraction with minimal impact. ME 17. Old Dehli There&apos;s nowhere quite like Old Delhi, though you need a lot of energy and patience for it. A perfect day might be visiting the Jain temple (and its unique bird hospital) opposite the Red Fort, strolling through the chaos of Chandni Chowk and then disappearing into the maelstrom of Old Delhi proper to get lost and wind up eventually at the Jama Masjid mosque, before a late lunch at Karim&apos;s. MD 18. Galle, Sri Lanka Galle, on Sri Lanka&apos;s south coast, was hammered by the tsunami, but the town has recovered and is once again a perfect place to stop by the Indian Ocean. The old town, which is now Unesco listed, is encircled by 17th-century walls, and redolent of its years as a centre for the Dutch East India Company. The appeal lies just in strolling the streets, chatting with people, perhaps wandering into the Dutch church, or the junkshop-like museum. And then you can take a tuk-tuk ride to one of the very best beaches in Asia, at Unawatuna. ME srilankatourism.org 19. Wadlopen mud walking The islands of the Wadden Sea are basically giant sand dunes and are a favourite with Dutch holidaymakers who flock to the vast beaches, sheltered cycle paths and occasional gourmet restaurant. You can get there easily enough by boat, but my favourite way is to try Wadlopen mud-walking - hiking across the mudflats that separate the islands from the mainland at low-tide. You need a guide, as the channels and rivulets can be treacherous, but by the time you get there you&apos;ve really earned your coffee and apple cake. MD 20. Birdwatching at dawn at Kandalama Kandalama is one of Sri Lanka&apos;s most inspired hotels, designed by the late Geoffrey Bawa, and mellowing beautifully as its concrete structures become engulfed in jungle vegetation. It is located near the great Buddhist sites of Dambulla and Anuradhapura, and to the north are great tanks - man-made lakes - where you can drive at dusk to watch elephants come to water. But the hotel itself is in an extensive wildlife reserve, and there is huge pleasure in waking at dawn and wandering through the woods with the resident birdwatcher-guide, who will point out, with infectious enthusiasm, perhaps as many as 70 or 80 different birds. ME heritancehotels.com/hk 21. Ancient theatre at Epidavros One of the best cultural travel experiences I ever had was in the Peloponnese in Greece, when I turned up to poke around the ruins at Epidavros and discovered that a Peter Hall production of Oedipus Rex - in English - was due to start a few hours later in the amphitheatre. I&apos;ll never forget the build-up, as fires were lit and the sun sank behind the mountain; and then the performance itself, in which the simulated thunder claps on stage were echoed by the real thing over the same distant mountains. MD 22. Wadi Rum, Jordan Even more than the fabulous &quot;lost city&quot; of Petra, Wadi Rum is, for me, Jordan&apos;s ultimate experience. Most deserts look a bit like empty building sites - coarse scrubby pebble-sand - but Wadi Rum is the full Lawrence of Arabia deal, with huge rock cliffs, massive rolling dunes and, of course, camels. We camped out for the night near a tiny oasis. ME 23. Frescoes in Serbia For obvious reasons, Serbia hasn&apos;t been Europe&apos;s most popular destination in recent years. But it is surely ready to be rediscovered. The steep wooded hills south of Belgrade host a network of medieval monasteries located in out-of-the-way spots. Most boast well-preserved frescoes which the Serbs keenly tout as examples of their superior civilisation before the Ottomans. But the real allure is in the locations - magical spots where the peace is disturbed only by the clinking of goat bells. MD serbia-tourism.org 24. San Galgano, Tuscany The abbey of San Galgano is my favourite building in Italy - a roofless gothic wonder with a grass field for a nave, patches of fresco amid the vegetation-clad walls, and panoramas of sky, cloud and hills through a rose window. ME 25. Genova I love old ports, and the northern Italian port of Genova is one of the best, with a fantastic old town of endlessly winding alleys and pokey dead-ends, a marvellously sleazy waterfront and some of the best food in Europe, never mind Italy. Spend the morning mooching around the old town, trofie al pesto or a farinata for lunch, an afternoon swim out at nearby Camogli or Santa Margherita, followed by an afternoon stroll around the Portofino peninsula, finishing up back in the old town with a seafood dinner and a root around some of Genova&apos;s less salubrious nightspots. MD Summer of &apos;82: the bare necessities and a Greek beach I was 18, and on a gap year. This was ages before they became something young, ambitious people did to impress future employers; back then, a gap year was all about leaving school behind, doing nothing and having fun. Preferably somewhere hot. And cheap. With beaches.  Perhaps that was why Tessa and me picked Greece, or perhaps it was because the Rough Guide made it look a bit trendy. The book certainly came with us. And thanks to its advice we were able to eke out our savings for more than four months (our parents expected us home after two).  The guide had two big ideas for people on a budget: rent rooms in local people&apos;s houses or sleep on the beach. We did both, but it is the beaches I remember most. In particular, the beach an hour or two&apos;s walk from Loutro in Crete. Loutro then was a tiny village that could be reached only by boat (and to catch the boat you had to walk through a gorge). Once you got there, budget travellers were advised to head up the mountain behind the village and down to a beach so remote that there was no risk of being turfed off by the police. So off we went, Tessa and I, and we liked it so much we stayed for five weeks.  I can&apos;t remember the name of the beach, but I do recall that no one wore any clothes. The only time we got dressed was to make the three-hour round trip to Loutro for our feta cheese and retsina, which we did every three days or so. The rest of the time we swam, or sat about chatting to our fellow beach bums (a handful of young male travellers who, like us, had followed the Rough Guide to this place and who were, we noticed, very friendly indeed).  We returned to England a couple of months later, after the most terrible journey (we travelled by Magic Bus, another Rough Guide recommendation). I was soaking in the bath (my first for months) when my mother walked in. She screamed, literally screamed, and said: &quot;You are brown ALL OVER!&quot; The tan lasted for most of my first year at university.Becky Gardiner", "sentences": ["Queen&apos;s Day, Amsterdam Their monarch&apos;s birthday at the end of April is commemorated all over the country.", "But if you&apos;re after something more energetic than bunting and cakestalls you need to be in Amsterdam, which lives it up to the max in 24 hours of non-stop partying."], "title": "Rough diamonds for 25 years", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/may/05/saturday.travelbooks", "tags": ["Greece holidays", "Greek Islands holidays", "Travel", "Travel writing", "Travel guides"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-04T23:02:30Z", "article": "Festive season You can&apos;t move for festivals this summer.

Sir Fred and representatives of his consortium, comprising Santander of Spain and Dutch-Belgian group Fortis, were due to meet the management of ABN Amro in Amsterdam last night to present details of their intricate cash and shares bid. The meeting, which was subject to last minute alteration or cancellation, was complicated by the decision of Bank of America, the world&apos;s second biggest bank, to begin legal proceedings against ABN Amro over the way it handled the sale of its US subsidiary LaSalle. That $21bn sale is a crucial component of the agreed takeover which would allow Barclays to become the fifth largest bank in the world. But what is potentially the largest ever banking takeover has become embroiled in confusion following a decision by a Dutch court on Thursday to heed calls by shareholders in ABN Amro to make the LaSalle deal subject to their approval. That decision, which effectively freezes the US unit&apos;s sale, prompted Bank of America to file a suit in New York against ABN Amro for undisclosed damages. In its suit, Bank of America highlights the &quot;great strategic importance&quot; of LaSalle in increasing its market presence in the US midwest and admits it was forced to pay $1bn more for the Chicago-based business than it originally intended. The Dutch court ruling also forced ABN Amro to seek clarity from the judge yesterday about whether a special &quot;go-shop&quot; agreement it had with Bank of America, allowing it to seek higher cash offers for LaSalle for 14 days after the deal was struck, still runs its course to Sunday night. This deadline is still being used by the RBS-led consortium as the time by which it must table any counter offer for LaSalle, the part of ABN Amro that is motivating the Scottish bank&apos;s interest in leading the bid. Any clarification from the Dutch court could change the consortium&apos;s plans. In its court documents, Bank of America admits that the go-shop clause is unprecedented in a transaction involving the sale of a portion of a company&apos;s assets. It is carefully worded and requires any counter offer to be a cash bid and be structured as an acquisition of LaSalle and not any other part of ABN Amro. The RBS-led consortium is thought to be talking of a cash offer for LaSalle which is contingent upon a bid for the rest of the bank, which includes operations in Latin America, the Netherlands and Asia, being successful. The consortium partners, which will have to convince regulators and ABN Amro&apos;s management that their deal is not too risky, will use a special bid vehicle to table the offer and then put the assets of ABN Amro into a holding company to carve up between themselves.", "sentences": ["Sir Fred and representatives of his consortium, comprising Santander of Spain and Dutch-Belgian group Fortis, were due to meet the management of ABN Amro in Amsterdam last night to present details of their intricate cash and shares bid."], "title": "RBS presses on with battle for ABN Amro", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/05/royalbankofscotlandgroup", "tags": ["Business", "Royal Bank of Scotland"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-04T23:11:20Z", "article": "Rarely can a Wigan-St Helens derby have been as completely overshadowed as the match that will complete the first half of Super League&apos;s weekend in Cardiff tonight. But between the tea-time Paul Cooke show, otherwise known as the 200th Hull derby, and tomorrow&apos;s top-two clash between Leeds and Bradford, Brian Noble&apos;s Warriors hope to sneak under the radar and end the six-match losing run their local rivals have inflicted on them. Wigan have climbed to fourth, their highest position since Noble took over as coach just over a year ago, with three wins out of four since they were convincingly beaten 32-14 by Saints in the more familiar derby surroundings of the JJB Stadium on Good Friday. &quot;We&apos;re quietly confident that we will perform a whole lot better than we did last time,&quot; says Noble, a Challenge Cup winner with Bradford in his only previous visit to the Millennium Stadium in 2003. &quot;I think we are a fair bit better with the ball than we were then.&quot; They showed that in scoring 94 points in their last two wins against Wakefield and Salford, with the Australian stand-off Trent Barrett collecting five tries in those matches to begin the process of justifying his billing as the highest calibre overseas player in the British game. But Saints were ominously impressive in demolishing Harlequins 44-6 at The Stoop last Sunday and, although Mike Bennett became the latest victim of the injury curse that has been hanging over the champions&apos; forwards all season, they will receive a major boost tonight from the return of Jon Wilkin, the underrated Great Britain back-row who has been out for a month with a broken hand. The most significant absentee of the weekend is Jamie Peacock, the star of Noble&apos;s 2003 Bradford cup winners, who damaged ankle ligaments in Leeds&apos;s 54-8 win against Catalans Dragons last weekend. However, the Bulls are still without their influential second-row Glenn Morrison with a broken thumb, meaning that Leeds must be favourites to pull two points clear at the top of the table, given their more convincing recent form. Harlequins and Catalans will kick off the weekend at 2pm in what is likely to be an embarrassingly empty stadium before the Wigan, St Helens, Hull and Hull KR supporters swell today&apos;s attendance to the expected 30,000 plus. There are likely to be fewer than that tomorrow, with the majority of the late rush on tickets this week that have lifted sales for the weekend beyond 50,000 coming from Wigan and Hull. But the Rugby Football League remains reasonably satisfied with the response to an experiment that is locked into the season for at least three years thanks to the financial incentives provided by Cardiff, keen to regain the economic benefit provided by an influx of rugby league supporters for the 2003, 2004 and 2005 cup finals. Edinburgh, Dublin and even Amsterdam have been mooted as possible venues in the future for what is intended to become an annual Super League weekend away in the spring - although that will inevitably depend on the success or otherwise of these initial ventures, described by one leading administrator as &quot;the most important thing we&apos;re doing this season&quot;, notwithstanding the cup final&apos;s return to Wembley in August.

Indeed, with the gap between the coming and going generally spent in more-or-less useless hanging about, spasms of fitful anxiety, boozing and gorging, punctuated by futile consumerism, you could say being in an airport is a snapshot of life. So we find them fascinating: both wonderful and awful, monuments to our fretful transitions through time and space. To enter an airport is to commit to another world, a dreamscape beyond time and (often) without access to light or reference to nature, still less to culture of the bookish sort. The mood of airports mixes the highs of excitement and fear with the lows of exquisite banality, frustration, humiliation and shopping at WH Smith. Utterly abstracted from daily routine, the nagging thought that in an hour or so you might be in a flaming fireball en route to vaporisation fuels a recklessness in behaviour. To hell with the credit limit if we are going to die. As the primary gateways or portals to nations, airports have a symbolic role. Which is why I always think, arriving at the amazing, vivid, worn-out, lash-up and make-do, teeming slum of Heath Robinson Airport - I am sorry, I mean Heathrow - the Welcome to Britain sign should be replaced by Welcome to Our Decaying Infrastructure. But there is a very big change on the way. They call it Terminal 5. Rising, some would say with additional and appropriate symbolism, above the redundant sewage works of Middlesex, is a new Richard Rogers design. It is monumental. It is vast: as grand as its neighbour, Windsor Castle, but more engineered. It is a quarter of a mile long, so, as a space, we are talking two-and-a-half Canterbury cathedrals. The clear 165-metre roof span is the largest in Britain. Standing there, like a woeful piece of displaced Samsonite, you are reminded air travel is about ever bigger numbers: they have had to reinforce the runways for the new double-deck A380, build new docks and ramps. Meanwhile, you the human, become ever less significant. What would Kafka have made of places where you volunteer for metaphysical insignificance, calculate the bargain between violent death or a sunshine holiday and agree to succumb to being thoroughly and anonymously processed? When T5 opens next year they will demolish the old Terminals 1 and 2. For most travellers, T5 will then become the new London airport. Meanwhile, a new forecourt and facade designed by Norman Foster are being attached to the sorely overstretched Terminal 3, the place where you join the check-in queues and find someone is trying to take a chest freezer on board as hand baggage. Foster is also designing the new Heathrow East, on the site of 1 and 2. By 2012 the airport will be unrecognisable: the muddle of accretion and haphazard remedy replaced by signature buildings designed by celebrity architects on a rational plan. At Stansted, Nick Grimshaw will soon be at work, making additions to Norman Foster&apos;s Nineties classic. Eventually, these buildings promise to bring order and dignity to territory now occupied by mess. Until now London&apos;s major airports have developed by accident, not design. Gatwick began when one Morris Jackaman bought a local flying club in 1933. Three years later, a remarkable &apos;beehive&apos; terminal was built by Hoar, Marlon and Lovett (it still exists on the southern perimeter). In aircraft such as Rapides, Proctors and Ansons passengers went on bumpy, Betjemanesque journeys to destinations which read like an old wireless tuner: Malmo, Isle of Wight, Hilversum, Dordrecht, Paris and, for all I know, Droitwich. But if there is one principle about airport design it is that you need flexibility, and the beehive was rigid. So by 1955 Britain&apos;s pioneer modernist practice in public service, Yorke Rosenberg and Mardall (YRM), had been commissioned to design a new Gatwick, which the Queen opened in 1958. There have been many additions since, but in all essentials this is the Gatwick that remains. In 1958 the reality of air travel was that every hour or so 45 immaculately behaved passengers would, in a leisurely style, arrive or depart on a whistling turbo-prop Vickers Viscount. Air travel has changed: when the US deregulated airlines in the Seventies, 70 per cent of Americans had not flown. Now, at any given time, you get the impression that 70 per cent of Americans are in the air. Heathrow developed differently. In 1947 it was a village of tents, hilariously satirised by Evelyn Waugh in his novella, Scott-King&apos;s Modern Europe. Here the hero describes the utter mediocrity of this Middlesex favela with its total lack of &apos;concessions to cultural curiosity&apos;. In his review, George Orwell sensed that Waugh knew that air travel was about much more than transporting living flesh. Development was rapid, although the Heathrow site was always constrained by the Bath Road and existing communities (one of which early on secured undertakings, still in force, that it would not be overflown). Nikolaus Pevsner&apos;s account of Heathrow in 1951, the year of the charming Festival of Britain, deserves quotation in full because it brings to the imagination an image of a country full of febrile optimism and bruised hope, feelings difficult to maintain after 56 years of cumulative cupidity have brought us to the 2007 reality of an airport where girls in sequins want to sell you a raffle ticket to win a new Ferrari 430, or a bogof (buy one get one free) proposition on single malts. Pevsner writes in his signature clipped style: &apos;London Airport (Heathrow). Size approximately 4\u00bd square miles. Ultimately to be 7 square miles. The final runway pattern is under construction at the time of writing: a dual parallel system of six runways varying in length from 5,800ft to 9,500ft and in width from 25ft to 300ft. The hexagonal terminal area in the centre as yet undeveloped so that no architectural features can be pointed out. Architect for the future buildings: Frederick Gibberd.&apos; When T2 opened in 1955 they predicted it would meet all air transport needs until the end of the 20th century. They were wrong. By the time of my own first visit to Heathrow (1970, a student flight to Milan on a deafening de Havilland Comet 4C), Gibberd&apos;s red brick buildings, especially the Control Tower, had become part of Britain&apos;s self-identity. Built when we still had rationing, they went live when ITV was launched, accepted the first transatlantic jets, survived the age of pop. The 747 first flew in 1970. With 400 or so passengers, the mighty Boeing suddenly turned the old, predictable arithmetic of air travel into a demented calculus that soon got almost out of control. That numbers game had begun. The squalid chaos of Heathrow is a result of old buildings struggling to cope with new circumstances. What made it worse was that room to expand was limited. Bits were added here and there, like patching a leaking bucket. More airlines appeared. Distant horizons grew as space available on the ground shrank. In the process, light was excluded, circulation paths became madly attenuated, gum spattered the carpet and was never removed. New generations of travellers demanded diversions, so shops ate space that could have been used for elegant lounges. Nearly 70,000 people work at Heathrow. If Dante needed to know about modern torments, he would fly economy from T3. It is hell, but curiously it (just about) works, a miracle of stiff-lipped improvisation. The organisation responsible for the old hell and the promised new architectural heaven is what was the British Airports Authority. BAA is a fine example of our idiosyncratic genius for making the best of enlightened muddle. It was once a public service, but was commanded by Mrs Thatcher to become a private one in 1987. And it was at this time, with destiny, not to mention profits, in mind that the concept for the revolution that is T5 emerged. But while BAA is now a private company, it almost totally monopolises its business. Still, it is a champion of national interests. That it has a moral obligation to maintain a vital element of Britain&apos;s infrastructure may be true, but what&apos;s to stop its owners (a group of highly leveraged Spanish builders) selling the lot for executive homes if they can make a nice turn on the deal? (Answer: nothing). The business case for building T5 is now as strong as the practical and aesthetic ones. Until that happy day when teleporting is perfected, getting investment bankers in and out of the country is vital to the economy. During the 20 years of planning imbroglio and public inquiry, the continental competition has been catching up. Paris&apos;s Charles de Gaulle can easily expand since its site is nearly three times as large as Heathrow&apos;s. And if you are an international derivatives trader, you will fly anywhere. In terms of a trip across the ocean from New York, whether you land and do business in Paris, Amsterdam or Frankfurt is immaterial. Mostly these people do not know where they are in any case. So T5 means a lot, which is why top-line celebrity credits for its design go to Richard Rogers. With its expertise in shopping, BAA knows all about brand value with its architects as well as its retail concessions. But it is interesting to examine what &apos;design&apos; means in such a bogglingly complex context as a new airport for the planet&apos;s financial capital. I asked architect John McAslan, once a Rogers employee, whose own successful practice is currently in a competition to reuse part of New York&apos;s John F Kennedy Airport, what was involved in designing an airport. &apos;The diagram is, there is only one diagram,&apos; he said. All that is needed is a shell. You bring Arrivals in at one level and Departures at another. I am simplifying, but Rogers&apos; contribution was a concept, in this case a wiggly profile that was soon value-engineered away into a continuous curve. (&apos;Value-engineering&apos; is the architects&apos; contemptuous expression for the client&apos;s inevitable cost-cutting.) The wiggly profile can be seen on Rogers&apos; award-winning Barajas airport in Madrid. Weirdly, because of the enervating delays with T5, Barajas was designed after T5, but finished before. It used only to be the Spanish who did manana. To attribute only the concept to Rogers is not to diminish the architect&apos;s importance, only to suggest the fabulous, brain-hurting complexity of such a project. The original brief was created by the giant American commercial (as opposed to &apos;creative&apos;) practice, Hellmuth Obata and Kassabaum (HOK). An anonymous firm called Pascal and Watson has worked on detail design of the hundreds of invisible interrogation rooms, or whatever it is they have backstage nowadays. Design of the retail units (or &apos;shops&apos;) was by another firm of specialists. Lighting consultants consulted on lighting. BAA&apos;s in-house design team did the signs. Engineers did the engineering. Baggage handling consultants consulted on baggage handling. I asked McAslan if there was anyone who knew all that was going on. He promptly drew a frantic organogram. In an ultra-complex project, he explained, it is the project managers who know everything. Still, the world will know it as a Richard Rogers design. So what will the newly designed &apos;passenger experience&apos; be? If approaching by car, you arrive up dramatically elegant concrete ramps. If by train, into a dedicated station below ground. Inside, the concept is clarity and legibility: it is literally an enlightened design since all public areas, except for immigration and customs, have natural light which leads passengers intuitively through the building. An additional benefit is amazing views of both north and south runways with their ceaseless aircraft movements. Architects detest clutter, so as much as possible has been taken away - at least before someone is tempted to put it back. Pylons carry all the signs. The composite floor is colour coded so you get a simple gestalt of where to queue. Back-painted glass is a favourite finish for vertical surfaces and allows a nice integration of advertising and media. They say there will be exhibitions. The structure is based on 10 vast steel &apos;trees&apos; anchored by pin joints, a motif recurrent in European airport design since Stuttgart in 1991. Although BAA has a convention that pedestrian travelators should be available every 250m, the distance has been stretched because the expectation is that the huge spaces invite inquisitive walking. Shopping is integrated: with nice awareness of the democracy of modern travel, there are segregated areas for - how shall we put it? - different income groups. One gets a colony of Giraffe and Boots, the other, Chanel and Gordon Ramsay. So: cacotopia becomes utopia? Certainly, at long last, London will get the airport it deserves, even if the concept has been compromised by value-engineering. And already it is not enough: T5 is launching its own satellites. Whether the purity of the design will survive the realities of modern air travel we do not yet know. Norman Foster&apos;s beautiful Stansted was another fine concept. In theory you drove up, parked outside, hummed a happy tune and walked straight through to the planes, visible through the clear elegant glassy structure. That was in 1991 when Stansted handled fewer than a million passengers. Then BAA inserted Sock Shops and Knickerboxes, compromising the architect&apos;s epicene impression of what air travel should be. Now Stansted handles 25m a year and Foster&apos;s blanched tectonic paradise has become an infernal St Bartholomew&apos;s Fair. Unless you are sedated or simple-minded, the passenger&apos;s experience in any airport is compromised by the realities of being processed by customs, security, immigration, commerce, girls with clipboards. Submission of ego to bureaucracy is stressful while, for the fastidious aesthete, the distress is compounded by the invitation to shop as if this were a palliative to humiliation and frustration. Delay and dismay are hardwired into the airport experience and there is only a limited amount even the best architecture can remedy. For the passenger, bigger does not mean better. There are other arguments about the future of airports (even before environmental issues seriously affect the mystic dreams of BAA strategy). The Manser Practice&apos;s Southampton airport, for example, is modern, small, convenient: a neat architectural complement to the new generation of intelligent, flexible, responsive airlines who have lost the baggage carried so effortfully by British Airways. Maybe we can do away with airports entirely. One New York architectural practice proposes using subway trains as check-in and security, so you do not need an airport building; you get off the subway and onto the plane. Maybe, just maybe, we can do away with air travel. It struck me as significant that BAA is moving out of its new premises on London&apos;s Belgravia-Victoria borders because Google is taking over the building. Virtual reality is, for most of us, now the reality. Aircraft used to inspire the great architects: Le Corbusier wagged a finger at stultifying old design convention and said &apos;L&apos;avion accuse&apos;. Now we are accusing the aircraft of being dirty and wasteful. Airport utopia is very welcome after the horrors of filthy carpets, queues and loos, burgers and beer, but is T5 the future or merely an atonement for BAA&apos;s past architectural sins? Is this vast shed as misjudged a solution to the stated problem as Rogers&apos; other impressive London space: the Millennium Dome? In 1970, on my first visit to Heathrow, I did without a break between school and university because I was in such a hurry to get on, to arrive. I&apos;m less frenetic now and have a new book to think about. I am calling it My Gap Year. It&apos;s about a series of departures, a modern version of The Grand Tour ... and I am doing it by train.

The proposal, which could be turned into a formal bid as soon as the Amsterdam stock market opens today, would be the biggest ever takeover of a banking group, but poses tough questions for the board of ABN Amro. In the latest twist to a record-breaking and dramatic bid battle, the ABN Amro board was to meet last night to assess whether the proposal for the US arm, LaSalle, could beat an existing $21bn (\u00a310.5bn) deal with Bank of America. Both sides were locked in talks to try to remove some of the conditions attached to the possible bid for the whole company ahead of a 5am deadline (midnight in New York) for a counter-offer to be tabled for LaSalle. The proposal tabled by RBS is complex and was altered repeatedly yesterday afternoon in the hope of winning the support of the management of the Dutch bank. It follows an agreement by ABN Amro to sell LaSalle to Bank of America and the rest of its businesses in the UK, Netherlands, Latin America, Asia and southern Europe to Barclays in a deal that would turn Britain&apos;s third biggest bank into the fifth largest in the world. To outbid Barclays, which has made a \u00a345bn bid using its own shares, RBS needed to table one offer for LaSalle and another for the rest of ABN Amro. But it has attached a number of conditions to its proposal which was sent to the board of ABN Amro on Saturday after top executives from the consortium and the Dutch bank had dinner in Amsterdam on Friday night. The conditions are largely connected to the sale of LaSalle, which must not be the subject of litigation and must be part of a successful bid for the rest of the Dutch bank. Last night, advisers were trying to remove some of these conditions, particularly with regard to litigation. This condition already appears to have been breached because Bank of America began legal action in a New York court on Friday over the handling of the sale of LaSalle. In the proposal sent on Saturday, the RBS consortium valued LaSalle at $24.5bn, well above the figure agreed with Bank of America. It put a value on the whole of the Dutch bank of \u20ac38.40 (\u00a326.21) a share, which is higher than Barclays&apos; offer. The financing is conditional upon RBS&apos;s partners, Santander of Spain and Dutch-Belgian group Fortis, raising record-breaking amounts of cash from their shareholders. The consortium will not have the necessary amount of cash - \u00a335bn - until the fourth quarter of the year. Merrill Lynch has committed to underwrite the fundraising exercise but it is not clear on what terms. Shareholders in Fortis are also likely to have to give their approval to such a fundraising. RBS wants LaSalle and operations in Asia and the wholesale bank, Fortis has its eyes on the domestic Dutch bank, while Santander is hoping to acquire units in Latin America and parts of Europe. RBS needs the consortium to buy LaSalle because its shareholders were angry about its last acquisition in the US - Charter One - arguing that the Edinburgh-based bank paid too much. RBS will use about \u00a315bn of its shares to fund the deal, leaving its partners to find cash to sweeten the offer. But the bank is having difficulty quashing rumours that it is trying to sell its insurance arms, Direct Line and Churchill, to raise cash. The Dutch central bank has already expressed concern about the implications of splitting up the country&apos;s second largest bank. As a result RBS has agreed to take charge of regulatory issues and responsibility for the bank&apos;s complex derivatives contracts, which are thought to have a notional value of \u20ac18 trillion. The takeover of ABN Amro has become complicated since shareholders in the Dutch bank took legal action which resulted in the sale of LaSalle having to be put to an investor vote. This in turn has brought the legal action by Bank of America, which had been assured such approval would not be needed. The ABN Amro shareholders regard the side deal as a &quot;poison pill&quot; to deter the consortium.

The United Nations report, compiled by all 30 of the world organisation&apos;s agencies, points to crops like palm oil, maize, sugar cane, soya and jatropha. Rich countries want to see these extensively grown for fuel as a way to reduce their own climate changing emissions. Their production could help stabilise the price of oil, open up new markets and lead to higher commodity prices for the poor. But the UN urges governments to beware their human and environmental impacts, some of which could have irreversible consequences. The report, which predicts winners and losers, will be studied carefully by the emerging multi-billion dollar a year biofuel industry which wants to provide as much as 25% of the world&apos;s energy within 20 years. Global production of energy crops is doubling every few years, and 17 countries have so far committed themselves to growing the crops on a large scale. Last year more than a third of the entire US maize crop went to ethanol for fuel, a 48% increase on 2005, and Brazil and China grew the crops on nearly 50m acres of land. The EU has said that 10% of all fuel must come from biofuels by 2020. Biofuels can be used in place of petrol and diesel and can play a part in reducing emissions from transport. On the positive side, the UN says that the crops have the potential to reduce and stabilise the price of oil, which could be very beneficial to poor countries. But it acknowledges that forests are already being felled to provide the land to grow vast plantations of palm oil trees. Environment groups argue strongly that this is catastrophic for the climate, and potentially devastating for forest animals like orangutans in Indonesia. The UN warns: &quot;Where crops are grown for energy purposes the use of large scale cropping could lead to significant biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and nutrient leaching. Even varied crops could have negative impacts if they replace wild forests or grasslands.&quot; But the survey&apos;s findings are mixed on whether the crops will benefit or penalise poor countries, where most of the crops are expected to be grown in future. One school of thought argues that they will take the best land, which will increase global food prices. This could benefit some farmers but penalise others and also increase the cost of emergency food aid. &quot;Expanded production [of biofuel crops] adds uncertainty. It could also increase the volatility of food prices with negative food security implications&quot;, says the report which was complied by UN-Energy. &quot;The benefits to farmers are not assured, and may come with increased costs. [Growing biofuel crops] can be especially harmful to farmers who do not own their own land, and to the rural and urban poor who are net buyers of food, as they could suffer from even greater pressure on already limited financial resources. &quot;At their worst, biofuel programmes can also result in a concentration of ownership that could drive the world&apos;s poorest farmers off their land and into deeper poverty,&quot; it says. According to the report, the crops could transform the rural economy of rich and poor countries, attracting major new players and capital, but potentially leading to problems. &quot;Large investments are already signalling the emergence of a new bio-economy, pointing to the possibility that still larger companies will enter the rural economy, putting the squeeze on farmers by controlling the price paid to producers and owning the rest of the value train,&quot; it says. The report also says the crops are not guaranteed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Producing and using biofuels results in some reductions in emissions compared to petroleum fuels, it says, but this is provided there is no clearing of forest or peat that store centuries of carbon. &quot;More and more people are realising that there are serious environmental and food security issues involved in biofuels. Climate change is the most serious issue, but you cannot fight climate change by large scale deforestation,&quot; said Jan van Aken, of Greenpeace International in Amsterdam. &quot;Bioenergy provides us with an extraordinary opportunity to address climate change, energy security and rural development. [But] investments need to be planned carefully to avoid generating new environmental and social problems,&quot; said Achim Steiner, executive director of UN Environment programme yesterday. Plant power Biomass energy can be obtained from just about any plant or tree but is most commonly obtained from maize, soya beans, oil palms, sugar cane, sunflower and trees. The carbohydrates in the biomass, which are comprised of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen, can be broken down into a variety of chemicals, some of which are useful fuels. At its simplest, plant matter is simply burned but much of the energy is wasted and it can cause pollution. So, the plant is either heated and refined to break down into gases, fermented and turned into grain alcohol or ethanol, or chemically converted to make into biodiesel.", "sentences": ["Climate change is the most serious issue, but you cannot fight climate change by large scale deforestation,&quot; said Jan van Aken, of Greenpeace International in Amsterdam."], "title": "Global rush to energy crops threatens to bring food shortages and increase poverty, says UN", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/09/foodanddrink.renewableenergy", "tags": ["World news", "Food & drink", "UK news", "Renewable energy", "Energy", "Environment", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-09T07:45:55Z", "article": "You wait ages for a long-lost 70s cult classic to reappear and then two come along at once. Hot on the heels of the UK cinema re-release of the surreal western El Topo comes Sweet Movie, Yugoslavian director Dusan Makavejev&apos;s bizarre, shocking stew of sex, politics, sugary treats and bodily fluids, which is next month getting the deluxe reissue treatment courtesy of US arthouse DVD label Criterion. Finally, fans of incredibly strange cinema will be able to view what Time Out called &quot;potentially the most scandalous film ever made,&quot; and see if Jack Nicholson was right when he reportedly praised it as &quot;the most beautiful film on sexual politics I&apos;ve ever seen&quot;. Runs-ins with censors around the world - it was rejected for a UK cinema certificate in 1975 - have ensured that the film has languished virtually unseen for 30 years, despite it being the follow-up to Makavejev&apos;s acclaimed and notorious movie WR: Mysteries of the Organism. The &quot;plot&quot; defies description. After winning a beauty pageant, Miss World (French-Canadian actress Carole Laure) marries Mr Dollars, the world&apos;s richest man (a cameo by US actor John Vernon, best-known for playing the mayor in Dirty Harry). But it all goes wrong when, on their honeymoon, he unveils his golden penis. She is stuffed (alive and fully conscious) into a suitcase, which is flown to Paris, where she ends up having a fling with a Latin pop star halfway up the Eiffel Tower. Their passion is so great, they have to be prised apart. She then falls in with a performance art group whose &quot;act&quot; seems to involve a food orgy and a lot of pissing and shitting, before we leave our heroine writhing in a vat of melted chocolate. It seems she is being filmed for a TV ad. Running alongside all this mayhem is another storyline involving a woman sailing a huge barge featuring a giant bust of Karl Marx through the centre of Amsterdam. She picks up a sailor but later stabs him to death while they are making love in a vat of sugar. The woman also lures young boys aboard with sweets and performs striptease shows for them. Spoiler alert! It emerges at the end that she is a serial child killer. Makavejev does not flinch from depicting any of this on-screen, and the action is intercut with what appears to be authentic footage of Holocaust graves being exhumed. There are also lots of songs. As to what it is all about... well, Makavejev was clearly trying to make some kind of artistic statement about freedom of expression, while gleefully taking pot-shots at everything from the media to sexual prudishness, but these days the movie is probably best approached as the demented missing link between Pasolini&apos;s Salo and John Waters&apos; Pink Flamingos. Perhaps what&apos;s most disturbing is the way Makavejev occasionally succeeds in turning what could simply be a parade of sick stunts into something haunting and unforgettable. I picked up Sweet Movie a few years ago on an ultra-rare Brazilian DVD, and some of its images - the sailor&apos;s blood mixing with the sugar, the serial killer&apos;s plastic-wrapped victims &quot;waking up&quot; just before the credits roll - have lingered long in my mind.

Although he says he wants to stay there is a belief that he and Ronaldinho cannot continue together. The president, Joan Laporta, wants to keep Eto&apos;o but other members of the board do not agree. The Cameroon international has few real allies in the dressing room and even Rijkaard&apos;s patience has been tested by his refusal to come off the bench as a late substitute against Santander in February. Barcelona have sounded out possible buyers but, having paid \u00a325m to get him from Mallorca (and Real Madrid, who owned 50%), they would expect a fee in excess of \u00a340m. He certainly has the talent, physical fitness and desire to succeed in England. Indeed, he would welcome the English style, as his recent snipe suggests. &quot;Fancy flicks and back-heels are fine,&quot; he said, &quot;but it&apos;s goals that win matches.&quot; He possesses an almost pathological will to win. David Villa 25 Valencia, Spain \u00a350m Villa has been a superb striker for a long time but this is the year that the rest of Europe, and England in particular, has really noticed him. He has it all: pace, skill, vision, strength and wonderful finishing. He scored 25 league goals in his first season at Valencia and this season he heads the assist charts. His agent has called for Valencia to increase his wages if he is to stay at Mestalla but the club are unlikely to match his demands and he feels he deserves a move to a bigger club. Although he has straight-batted all transfer talk, he has been careful not to close the door on a move. &quot;Let&apos;s see what happens in the summer,&quot; he says. &quot;Right now I want to concentrate on playing for Valencia.&quot; He would rather stay in Spain, though, and a move to Real Madrid or Barcelona would be more attractive than one to the Premiership. Dimitar Berbatov 26 Tottenham Hotspur \u00a327m If any Premiership player could instantly enhance either Manchester United or Chelsea, it is surely Berbatov. Both teams must be kicking themselves that they were beaten to what was surely the signing of the season last summer at the bargain price of \u00a310.9m. Interestingly United are understood to have been only a few hours too late with an approach for Berbatov. His silky touch and ability to create, as well as score goals, has evoked comparisons with Thierry Henry but he lacks the Arsenal captain&apos;s electrifying speed. He makes up for this with wonderful vision, although he would probably fit better alongside Didier Drogba than Wayne Rooney, who often works in the same areas of the pitch as the Bulgarian. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar 23 Ajax, Netherlands \u00a318m There is a long tradition of Holland&apos;s best strikers making a mark in English football and scouts from all of the Premiership&apos;s top clubs have visited the Amsterdam Arena this season to see the player known as &quot;The Hunter&quot;. Huntelaar replaced Ruud van Nistelrooy in the national team after the World Cup and it was widely accepted that Marco van Basten made a mistake by not including the clinical finisher in his squad last summer. Barcelona, Valencia, Lyon and Juventus have been monitoring the progress of a player who has accumulated more goals than any other forward in Europe over the last two years, scoring at a remarkable rate of three in every four games in the Dutch league. At 23 Huntelaar is one of Europe&apos;s most coveted players and, as such, it might need \u00a318m to acquire his signature. Luca Toni 29 Fiorentina, Italy \u00a312m The reigning European Golden Boot winner has a scoring record that would interest any of the top English clubs but it has been widely reported in Germany that he has, in principle, agreed to a \u00a312m move to Bayern Munich at the end of the season. Toni, a World Cup winner with Italy last year, became the first Italian since 1934 to score 30 goals in Serie A last season and the Fiorentina striker, who will be 30 later this month, has enhanced his reputation with another 16 this term. Milan, Internazionale and Juventus are all hoping to persuade him to remain in Italy but there have been no reported bids from England, possibly because of the lack of success historically that Italian strikers have had in the Premiership. He scored twice in last year&apos;s World Cup. Afonso Alves 26 Heerenveen, Netherlands \u00a38m-\u00a310m It is impossible to ignore the sheer weight of goals plundered by Afonso Alves this term. His five hat-tricks and 34 strikes in 31 league games have inflated the Brazilian&apos;s price tag. In January Manchester City were scouting him but now he is being touted around the Premiership&apos;s top four, with Chelsea thought to be his most likely destination. Powerful and quick, Alves boasts clear qualities and a hammer of a right foot which has been just as prolific from dead-balls as open play. He joined Heerenveen for \u00a33m last summer and has proved a fine replacement for Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who moved to Ajax a year ago. &quot;Huntelaar made the team play better but Alves can decide a match with an individual piece of brilliance,&quot; said Heerenveen&apos;s coach, Gertjan Verbeek. &quot;He has phenomenal qualities.&quot; Michael Owen 27 Newcastle United \u00a39m Owen&apos;s return from knee ligament surgery may be overdue for Newcastle United but timely for the former Liverpool and Real Madrid striker and his advisers. Owen has a \u00a39m get-out clause in his contract and is about to play his third successive Newcastle match, at Watford on Sunday. After that Owen will play for England possibly three times at B and full level and it represents a shop window of opportunity for him to show the heartiness of his recovery from the injury he sustained against Sweden at last summer&apos;s World Cup in Germany. He has said that he has returned stronger, particularly in the upper body region, than before and he has looked mentally and physically sharp in the two games he has played so far. However, his salary of \u00a3115,000 a week is sure to put off some potential purchasers. Miroslav Klose 28 Werder Bremen, Germany \u00a310m The only man to score five or more goals in successive World Cup final tournaments pledged to fulfil his contract at Werder Bremen last week, though the suspicion remains that he will leave the Bundesliga this summer. &quot;I want to experience life outside the Bundesliga,&quot; he said in January and, given his prowess in the air, England seems the obvious destination. Klose is both an instinctive finisher and a potent link man, dropping deep and combining well with his midfield. He can also hold the ball up as a lone striker and, if he lacks pace, he is technically proficient and has scored 33 times for his country. Bayern Munich had been expected to buy him but Werder will not permit his transfer to a Bundesliga club. Yet he has only 12 months to run on his contract and a move abroad appears inevitable. Carlos Tevez 23 West Ham United \u00a318m After the controversy following his signing, Tevez looks highly likely to leave West Ham regardless of whether the club avoid relegation on Sunday. He made a slow start but his quality has surfaced over the past two months. Most striking is his non-stop work-rate which would make him an ideal foil for a less energetic and more physically dominant forward. He would work well alongside Didier Drogba, although following his Argentina team-mate Javier Mascherano to Liverpool might be his ideal destination to play in partnership with Dirk Kuyt or Peter Crouch. His style is reminiscent of Gianfranco Zola and he would surely become a firm favourite at Anfield. His goal-scoring record suggests he would be best suited to working in partnership with a more traditional &quot;No9&quot; style of forward. Fernando Torres 23 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Spain \u00a335m Atl\u00e9tico&apos;s director of sport recently admitted it was ridiculous for Torres still to be at the club. &quot;The Kid&quot; could - and probably should - have moved on but, an Atl\u00e9tico fan, he is determined to play in Europe with his boyhood team. But that dream keeps getting postponed and Torres is getting impatient. He now privately questions the wisdom of having waited this long but says he would never play for another Spanish club and believes a transfer to England is ideal. Quick and strong, he would need to adapt his game, though. Alternatively, take a punt on a kid from South America ... Neri Cardozo 20 Boca Juniors, Argentina Arguably more impressive than his Argentina team-mate Lionel Messi in the 2005 World Youth Championship, he helped fire Boca Juniors to the top of the 2006 Apertura - Argentina&apos;s winter tournament, which runs from August to December - and has so far scored six goals in the Clausura (February-June championship). Can play as a midfielder or striker, and made his senior international debut last month against Chile. Missed the final of the World Youth Championship two years ago because of suspension. Oscar Cardozo 23 Newell&apos;s Old Boys, Argentina A former player with Club Nacional in his homeland of Paraguay, he has scored 20 goals in his first season with Newell&apos;s Old Boys after moving for $1.2m (\u00a3600,000). He scored 27 times in 63 games for Nacional last season and was named 2006 Paraguayan Footballer of the Year. The tall striker will lead the line for his country in this year&apos;s Copa Am\u00e9rica in Venezuela and has already caught the eye of some of Europe&apos;s top clubs. He won his first international cap last October in a friendly against Australia. Nilmar 22 Corinthians, Brazil Nilmar was signed by Lyon in 2004 but was loaned back to Brazil the following year when the French club bought his compatriot, Fred. At Corinthians he quickly proved to be the best striker in the country. He played alongside Carlos Tevez and impressed so much that he almost made the 2006 Olympic squad. But he has been dogged by injury. He missed seven months last year because of a right knee problem and this year he has had an operation on his left knee, from which he is not expected to return until September. Alexandre Pato 17 Internacional, Brazil Scored on his professional debut last November and a month later helped Internacional win the Fifa Club World Cup in Tokyo. A youth international, he was Brazil&apos;s top scorer when they won the South American Youth Championship this year and Ronaldinho has picked him out as a future star. Pato means duck and although widely referred to as &quot;Alex the Duck&quot; he does not have webbed feet; the nickname is because he was born in the town of Pato Branco.

Terrible aesthetics, miniscule lodgings and vile furniture all justified in the name of functionality. The global chains have become masters in the art of selling business travellers short (for often astronomical prices) but I implore you not to be fooled: a fast wireless connection will never be a substitute for beauty, warmth and character. You wouldn&apos;t design your house around your laptop, so why would you stay in a hotel room that does? Fortunately, the frequent flyer now has a choice \u2013 where all hotels used to look and feel the same, design visionaries (Schrager, Starck and Balazs among others) have radically changed the lie of the land over the last 15 years. The &quot;boutique hotel&quot; \u2013 rich in cutting-edge design, loaded with artistic merit and dripping with aesthetic appeal \u2013 has revolutionised leisure travel over that time.  The discerning jetsetter has stopped frequenting any kind of hotel chain (the Hyatt and Four Seasons excepted) for his precious vacation. The lure of a lodging with immaculate, personalised service, spacious rooms and impeccable design has simply become overwhelming. Businessmen are following suit. Indeed, as a community, I think our mood is changing. A hotel is no longer just for conducting business, executing email and sleeping for six hours. It&apos;s also for pleasure. The pleasure of eating and drinking well. The joy of conducting business or just lounging with clients and colleagues in a beautiful environment. And the thrill of being able to fly in your friends and family for an indulgent, hedonistic weekend. Here are my top ten hotel choices for mixing business with pleasure in the world&apos;s great cities: 1. The Mercer Hotel, New York Is there a better city hotel anywhere in the world? If there is, I haven&apos;t seen it. Gorgeous d\u00e9cor, large rooms (especially for SoHo), fabulous food and extraordinary service. The centre-piece, its understated but much photographed lobby, is the perfect lounge for a working lunch or an exuberant dinner. If you can, book a Loft Studio to sleep in; room 507 is especially brilliant. 2. Park Hyatt, Tokyo If it&apos;s good enough for Scarlett Johansson, it&apos;s good enough for you. The real star of Lost In Translation, this towering masterpiece is the best way of retreating after a bewildering working day in Tokyo. The New York Bar on the top floor is super-hip and the swimming pool/spa, on the 53rd floor, is breathtaking. The Diplomatic Suite, with its own library, dining room and grand piano, is a spectacular way to wow your clients.  3. Widder Hotel, Zurich An extraordinary project that took five years to complete, this Swiss lodging meshes together eight immaculately restored townhouses. No two of the 42 rooms are the same and yet the same philosophy imbues all of them: stunning interiors faithful to the original, historic design plus state-of-the-art technology (Bang &amp; Olufsen stereos are a particular highlight). The hotel&apos;s dog friendliness is an extra bonus. 4. Sukhothai, Bangkok &quot;An oasis of tranquillity&quot; may be a massively overused phrase in travel writing but it is a perfect description of this wonderful venue. The ridiculous hustle and bustle of Bangkok is quickly forgotten on entering the Sukhothai&apos;s beautifully sculpted grounds. Lounging by the pool and pottering around in your vast one-bedroom apartment are bound to be highlights. 5. Murano Urban Resort, Paris Paris is beginning to do boutique better than any other European city. Competition appears to increase by the day, but the Murano is surely still the best. It&apos;s restaurant \u2013 with stalactites hanging from the ceiling \u2013 looks as stunning as the models dining within. And its rooms, to be opened by fingerprint only, are fabulous: the suite with its own swimming pool is the one to book (if you can afford it). 6. Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower, Mumbai More grand than boutique, this Mumbai icon still deserves its place in the top 10. The haven of businessmen, politicians and celebrities for decades, the Taj maintains the very highest of standards. Its restaurants serve the finest Indian cuisine, its spotlessly clean pool doubles up as the hotel&apos;s social hub, and its club (Insomnia) is irrefutably the best in India. Best of all, the hotel makes every guest feel truly special.  7. Grand Hyatt, Shanghai The Hyatt delivers again (and remarkably it is a chain). Set on the top floors of the Jin Mao Tower, the highest hotel in the world is also one of its best. I can&apos;t ever remember more scrummy room service or more delightful cocktails. A wonderful base from which to enjoy the delights of China&apos;s best city. 8. The Setai, Miami If you have business in Miami, don&apos;t make the mistake of staying in faceless downtown. Stay on South Beach and enjoy the delights of this spectacular venue. Its funky neighbours \u2013 the Delano and the Shore Club \u2013 tend to try a little too hard, but the Setai strikes the perfect balance. Hip but laidback, its Asian-themed d\u00e9cor is unique in the US. The perfect place to fly your friends and family in for a holiday. 9. Hempel Hotel, London / Dylan Hotel, Amsterdam Anouska Hempel is something of a legend. Both of these signature hotels, splendidly located in Notting Hill and overlooking the Keizersgracht Canal respectively, have set new standards for boutique living in Europe. The gorgeous furnishings \u2013 almost exclusively black-and-white \u2013 are to die for. Never have hotels felt more like home.  10. Chateau Marmont, Los Angeles Built in 1929, this might be the world&apos;s first boutique hotel. The self-styled hotel of the stars, Marmont has a remarkable history \u2013 everyone who&apos;s anyone has stayed there and John Belushi famously died there. In the 1990s it was taken over by Andre Balazs, and the beauty and comfort of its hallowed turf has (remarkably) increased even further.

Mr Bazalgette made his name as owner of Bazal, the company behind such BBC hits as Food and Drink. He sold the company in 1990 to a rival production firm that eventually morphed into Endemol UK.

Photograph: David Levene There are many books I could name that have influenced my life. Lewis Carroll&apos;s Alice&apos;s Adventures In Wonderland revealed to me, at the age of seven, the spellbinding power of imagination. At 16, it was Jack Kerouac&apos;s On The Road that inspired me to pack my bag, stick out my thumb and wait for the lift that would whisk me away from small town Wales in hurried pursuit of a life less confining. At 18, Joseph Heller&apos;s Catch-22 confirmed what I had long suspected: that the world is a terribly unfair place full of repressive contradictions and that, in the final analysis, the best one can do is laugh in the face of the absurdity of it all. These books influenced my life - profoundly so. But it would be inaccurate to say that they actually changed my life. Only one book can truly make that claim and that book is A New Shirt by Desmond Hogan.  I first came across A New Shirt on the top of the number 1 bus to Catford. It was the summer of 1987. The well-thumbed paperback had been left on a seat, discarded purposely or otherwise, I&apos;ll never know. No matter, it was as if the book was waiting for me. I took it home, read it in one sitting and I was mesmerised. On the face of it, there was no logical explanation as to why I should have been so entranced by a novel that spanned three generations of Irish life and largely concerned itself with a doomed gay love affair. But there was something about Hogan&apos;s fine, refractive prose that held me in thrall. I decided that Hogan was a writer I badly wanted to meet in person and convinced the style magazine Blitz that he merited a feature. Coincidentally, Hogan lived in Catford and it was the same number 1 bus that delivered me to his eccentrically dishevelled basement flat on the last day of September 1987. Hogan proved to be an intense and fascinating interviewee. As I was taking my leave after a wine-fuelled afternoon, he offered me some wise advice: &quot;You look like you need a holiday, Jon. Go to Lisbon. Interesting things happen there.&quot; In my copy of A New Shirt he wrote, &quot;Good luck in Lisbon.&quot; I went there and all my luck came at once. On the last night of my two-week break, I met the woman who, within three months, would become my wife. A year on from my interview with Hogan and my son, William, was born. My discovery of A New Shirt turned out to be the flap of a butterfly&apos;s wings that altered the whole trajectory of my life. Hogan&apos;s novel and the birth of my son would forever be inextricably linked. For a few years afterwards, my connection with Hogan remained all too real. He became a family friend and would return from his travels with idiosyncratic gifts for my boy. A small piece of coloured glass from Amsterdam, a pebble from Prague, a broken toy car from Alabama. Then, without explanation, he disappeared from our lives. It was only in 2004 when I read Robert McCrum&apos;s profile of Hogan in The Observer that I learnt that Hogan had disappeared from all our lives. In the article, McCrum revealed that Hogan had become a virtual recluse and was quite possibly living alone in a ramshackle caravan somewhere in West Ireland. Once ranked alongside Rushdie and Ishiguro as a novelist of greatness, he was now largely forgotten, his books out of print. Assuredly, he won&apos;t be forgotten by me.

They would have been watching the extraordinary Virgin School (Channel 4), I&apos;m sure, as James Riley, the subject of the film, lives there with his dad and his girlfriend (his dad&apos;s girlfriend, not James&apos;s - he&apos;s never had one of them, even though he&apos;s 26). I&apos;d like to think that, although she&apos;s not with his dad any more, maybe James&apos;s mum was there, too, as she also features in the film. And his nan. Maybe the evening went something like this ... Mum: Ahh, James, on the telly, doing your paper round, look how handsome you are! I just don&apos;t understand why you&apos;ve never had a girlfriend. James: Mum! Dad: You shouldn&apos;t be doing a paper round anyway, at your age. When&apos;s the sex? Nan: Sex? What sex? Mum: We didn&apos;t tell you exactly what kind of course James was going on in Amsterdam, Mum, in case it bothered you. Nan: Look, there we are James, buying new underpants for you, for your trip to Holland. The grey ones you chose in the end, wasn&apos;t it? I bet you look lovely in them. What kind of course was it exactly, then? Twenty minutes later, James is in Amsterdam and has enrolled at Aquarion, an organisation that helps people lose their virginity. He&apos;s with a lady called Carla, they&apos;re on the bed ... Dad: Bloody hell, was it her who had your cherry, son? How old is she? James: Dad! No, she just did the first part of the course, coaching me in intimacy and sexual grounding. She&apos;s 58 if you must know, and I didn&apos;t have sex with her. Dad: Hmmm, she&apos;s not bad for 58. Nan: Why are you taking her top off if she&apos;s not your girlfriend? What did you say this course was? Mum: Don&apos;t listen to them, James. You seem to be doing very well. I&apos;m dead proud of you, love. Dad: Christ almighty, now she&apos;s naked and her legs are wide apart. And you&apos;re telling me you didn&apos;t give her one? James: Honest dad. She was just showing me the entrance to her vagina, and her clitoris. Mum: Maybe your dad should have gone on the course, too, from what I remember ... Dad: Oi! Nan: Couldn&apos;t you find anyone your own age, dear? Twenty minutes later. It&apos;s a few weeks further into the course, James has entered the final stages, and is working towards finally losing his virginity. Mum: Look at these women, discussing the size of my little boy&apos;s willy, on the telly. That&apos;s not right. Dad: But listen, she&apos;s saying that when it&apos;s erect it&apos;s quite respectable ... oh, is that it? There&apos;s nothing respectable about that. That doesn&apos;t look like no Riley to me. You&apos;re a disgrace to the family name, boy. James: But dad, I&apos;m not aroused there. I don&apos;t think they&apos;re allowed to show that on the TV, not at 10pm anyway. Nan: Who&apos;s this one, James? At least she&apos;s a bit younger - more like your mum&apos;s age than mine. Is she your girlfriend? James: This is Bridgit, Nan, and she&apos;s got her own boyfriend. Nan: Doesn&apos;t he mind that you&apos;re having sex with his lady? James: They&apos;re different in Holland, Nan. Did you know they call sex &quot;shex&quot;? And we&apos;re not actually having sex in this bit, it&apos;s just our first session. She just gave me manual relief on that occasion. Mum: Look at your little toes curling up, that must have been when you reached orgasm, was it dear? Ahh. James: OK Dad, this is it, session three with Bridgit, the big one. Shush everyone, turn the volume up a bit, Mum. Dad: Go on, son! That&apos;s my lad! Nan: Look at your little hairy bum! James: That&apos;s me becoming a man, Nan. Mum: Shared with not just your own family, but also with millions of viewers. Isn&apos;t that lovely? You always were a generous boy. I told everyone at work to watch. And I set the video, too, so we can all watch it again. Ahh ... I love you, James, we all do. Nan: Bridgit seems nice. Shame she&apos;s got a boyfriend. \u00b7 What did you think?

You should be glad I did, Smyth, otherwise you&apos;d be covering this session as well, because the number of casualties taken last night has left the GU Sport desk extremely sparse ineed. I&apos;m afraid I didn&apos;t see any of the morning&apos;s play because I was at a two-hour IT course - which, despite the best efforts of my lovely instructor, mostly involved &quot;learning&quot; things I either already know or will probably never use - but it seems I didn&apos;t miss much. Paul Collingwood, with the assistance of some pitiful fielding and umpiring, and Ian Bell have set the platform for an onslaught this afternoon; but if those two succumb early on to the Windies&apos; nagging line and length, England could yet be all out for 350ish. Which would make for a very interesting game on a pitch where the par is probably, er, 350ish. Tom Lutz is out of the office, says my inbox.

Reminded me of my favourite cricket headline of all time, during the Ashes when Andy Caddick was at the height of his big-eared best: &apos;Roos afraid of the big Cad wolf&apos;.

Do you have the number of this &quot;nodding duck&quot;? 85th over: England 280-4 (Collingwood 63, Bell 23) Collingwood, who was dropped at gully and at backward point (so Mike Atherton, as reliable as a commentator as he was as an opening batsman, informs me), and Bell skip their way to the middle. The new ball is due, but Dwayne Bravo prefers to let rip a few looseners with the old one first. It&apos;s an uneventful maiden. &quot;Guardian headline in the 60&apos;s or 70&apos;s about an Amsterdam street organ playing classical music: &apos;Amadeus ex machina&apos;,&quot; offers Graham Alder. Not strictly cricket that, Graham, but I suppose rarely is the OBO based on cricket. 86th over: England 281-4 (Collingwood 64, Bell 23) It&apos;s Collymore at the other end, with Collingwood deadbatting the third ball of the over and scampering through for a quick single. Why aren&apos;t the Windies taking the new ball? &quot;Old Brentwoods = cheating scumbags!&quot; equates Tom Cloke, not without reason. &quot;My old team was playing your seconds and you subbed in a first-team ringer to score a last-minute penalty, then bottled out of the return fixture, saying something like &apos;ooh there&apos;s some cars in our way on the M25&apos;. There&apos;ll be some old scores to settle at the Imperial Hotel tonight.&quot; The best thing about that is that one of my mates, who usually plays for the first XI, was turning out for the seconds but had to go off when Brentwood were losing 3-1 with 10 minutes to go. Brentwood proceeded to win 4-3. I would name and shame this hapless chap, but I wouldn&apos;t want to ruin my friendship with Jon Clements. 87th over: England 283-4 (Collingwood 65, Bell 24) The two teams are involved in a staring match, desperately trying not to be the first one to blink. If England want to score runs, they&apos;re going to need to open up because the Windies are giving them no bad balls. To answer my previous question, that&apos;s why they aren&apos;t taking the new ball. &quot;Barry Glendenning&apos;s flatmate here,&quot; says Barry Glendenning&apos;s flatmate, Matt Goodison. &quot;Just reading your OBO and was wondering if you could kindly ask Baz if he remembers a wall he didn&apos;t bounce off while trying to make it upstairs to his bedroom in the early hours of this morning? Who would have thought you could eventually make it up a flight of stairs by swearing at them incoherently?!&quot; I would ask him but he&apos;s busy headbutting the desk. 88th over: England 291-4 (Collingwood 66, Bell 31) Bell chops the first ball over the slips for four and Sarwan immediately calls for the shiny new red nut. Collymore&apos;s first few deliveries with it don&apos;t swing, but there&apos;s a breeze blowing across Lord&apos;s so he should get some assistance here. &quot;Speaking of culinary, tasty cricket at Edgbaston today,&quot; says Matthew Bell. &quot;No less than five instances of caught Mustard, bowled Onions.&quot; 89th over: England 297-4 (Collingwood 66, Bell 36) Daren Powell replaces Dwayne Bravo at the end that isn&apos;t the one that faces the pavilion end. Or, to be more precise, the pavilion end. Bell clips the ball off middle stump beautifully through mid-wicket and it rolls all the way down the hill for four. &quot;Why don&apos;t you get Gary Naylor to do the OBO if you&apos;re short on sober staff?&quot; suggests Alex McCarthy. &quot;He seems to write about half of it anyway.&quot; Great idea, Alex. Here he is: &quot;The headline identified by Andrew Mitchell above is good, but rather pales next to this one. Japanese newspaper &apos;Nishi Nishi&apos; had accused the Hong Kong government of exporting explosive bullets. The Hong Kong government rebutted the claim. The headline? &apos;Hong Kong pooh poohs Nishi Nishi dum dums&apos;.&quot; 90th over: England 302-4 (Collingwood 67, Bell 40) Like an hors d&apos;eouvre served at a London restaurant on a Friday night, Bell is a slow starter, but he&apos;s batting serenely now. Admittedly his latest flurry was as a result of a rank half-volley outside off stump, but he still crushed it through extra cover for four. It was such a gorgeous shot it probably should count as five. &quot;Live site/tools slow - IT are investigating,&quot; says Fred Rylah. Is there an echo in here? &quot;I think the &apos;tools&apos; it is referring to are you and your irresponsible GU chums.&quot; Ha! 91st over: England 309-4 (Collingwood 74, Bell 40) Collingwood goes halfway towards &quot;batting for the cyle&quot; (which admittedly is a baseball, not cricket, term, but could still be used if ever a batsmen scored one run off one ball in an over, two runs off another, three runs etc etc), running a quick single, trotting up and down the pitch for a two, and then creaming a square cut past point. &quot;Would it be utter pedantry to point out that Matthew Bell should have said &apos;no fewer than five instances&apos;?&quot; wonders Alexander Brown. &quot;No need to answer. I know the answer is yes.&quot; It is also utter pedantry to point out that the subject of your email should have been &quot;pedantry&quot;, not &quot;pedanry&quot;. 92nd over: England 314-4 (Collingwood 74, Bell 44) Collymore drops one short and wide, and Bell punishes him with a dominant cut shot for four. Botham then uses hindsight rather than foresight when he observes that Jerome Taylor should be bowling, not Collymore. He wasn&apos;t saying that four overs ago. &quot;It&apos;s not cricket-related,&quot; says Nath Jones ( I really shouldn&apos;t worry, Nath), &quot;but when Bobby Gould was Wales manager, we drew Turkey in our Euro Champs qualifiers group, with the away tie to be played in December. &apos;Turkey at Christmas! Ha ha!&apos; said the inane Gould in every media interview for about a month. After we got battered 7-1 by the Netherlands the month before the afore-mentioned game, Wales&apos; local rag the Western Mail led with &apos;Turkey at Christmas, stuffing in November&apos;.&quot; 93rd over: England 320-4 (Collingwood 78, Bell 46) The Coll brings up the hundred partnership with a backfoot drive that bissects the Windies&apos; off-side field. You don&apos;t drop Collingwood and get a second chance. Not the second time you drop him, anyways. &quot;Anyone remember when stick cricket used to be easy?&quot; asks Nick Westacott. I wouldn&apos;t know, Nick. The Guardian have banned us from playing - our reasoning that it was research for the OBO didn&apos;t work for some reason. &quot;Returning to the game after a brief absence (ie doing some work) my England team has been bowled out for 19 by Lillee, Hadlee and Sobers. Realistic, yes. Fun, not so much. I defy anyone to do better than that.&quot; 94th over: England 331-4 (Collingwood 85, Bell 50) There&apos;s plenty of seam and movement, but not much pace and bounce in this pitch. Taylor proves the point by banging a short ball in and duly sending his midwicket to go fetch from the boundary. Hoggard is going to be England&apos;s key man in the field, not Harmison. And then Bell scores his 47th, 48th, 49th and 50th runs with a mistimed drive that flew off the outside edge past third slip. &quot;Best ice-hockey related headline was when Paul Hand of Murrayfield Racers got injured in an on-ice fight with Cardiff Devils Nicky Chinn,&quot; says Mike Landers. &quot;The paper reported it as &apos;Hand breaks hand on Chinns chin&apos;.&quot; 95th over: England 335-4 (Collingwood 89, Adamson 147) &quot;Take a blow, Jerome,&quot; is what Ramnaresh should be shouting as you read this. Taylor has been dreadful in this spell. Glad to see Beefy was spot on with his analysis again. The medium-fast bowler again digs one in a half-tracker and Collingwood dispatches it emphatically for four. &quot;I have your payslips (payday is MONDAY) and some remaining p60s,&quot; says Lindsey Board. &quot;Please come and collect.&quot; He might have a few P45s handy, too. 96th over: England 341-4 (Collingwood 91, Bell 54) This has been typical of the West Indies in recent years. After a bright disciplined start which included the dismissal of Ali Cook and Ian Bell taking 17 balls to score his first run, it&apos;s all started to unravel for the men in the Caribbean. Taylor dishes up yet another gimme outside off stump, and Bell does indeed give it to him. &quot;Nick Westacott (over 93) is bang on, but it&apos;s the fact that they now have left-handers in Sticky that gets me,&quot; says Andrew White. &quot;Oh and the absurd half-track inswingers. Still, I managed to hit the great John Emburey for 34 off an over, so maybe Nick&apos;s just rubbish.&quot; 97th over: England 342-4 (Collingwood 92, Bell 54) Brilliant from Powell. Were he putting any effort into bowling on this glorious, sunny afternoon, he would be sweating hideously. Instead, after one ball of this over, he requests the return of his short-sleeve jumper from the umpire. &quot;Payslips,&quot; says Iain McCulloch. &quot;You get paid for this?&quot; Less than Daren Powell gets paid for this dross. Probably. Drinks (though whisper that word very quietly if you pass through this office). The pause in the action (sic) gives me a chance to count how many of you have emailed with variations of the headline &quot;Super Caley Go Ballistic, Celtic Are Atrocious&quot;. 74. 98th over: England 342-4 (Collingwood 92, Bell 54) &quot;This has actually been quite a good over, even if we are only five balls into it,&quot; says David Gower ever so patronisingly. The sixth ball is the best of the bunch, darting off the pitch and away from Collingwood&apos;s outside edge. &quot;In response to over 86 and the slander towards my performance in said game,&quot; begins Jon Clements. &quot;I&apos;m sure Tom can remember that the rampaging right back was easing his way back into fitness after a lengthy lay off and was at no way at fault for any of the three goals. The fact that my replacement scored one and created the other is not a reflection of my ability whatsoever. Tom - if you are attending tonight, Adamson will be the drunken Glenn Roeder lookalike shouting inanely about how Jaap Stam is the best thing to come out of Holland since the dodgy DVD I bought out there last week.&quot; Jon (Sicknote) will not be attending, because he didn&apos;t play enough games to win a medal. 99th over: England 344-4 (Collingwood 93, Bell 55) I actually missed that entire over as I was deleting the 74 emails about Celtic and &quot;headline hilarity&quot;. I&apos;m informed by my competitors, though, that Bell and Collingwood both picked up singles. &quot;I&apos;m surprised nobody has yet recalled the classic headline from the morning after Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup by Caledonian Thistle - Super Cally Go Ballistic, Celtic are Atrocious - a headline writers&apos; dream,&quot; says Martin Cruise (and many others). 100th over: England 352-4 (Collingwood 101, Bell 55) CENTURY FOR COLLINGWOOD! He registers his fourth Test match hundred in suitable fashion - a thick outside edge that lures Chanderpaul at third slip into a frantic, fruitless dive. I&apos;d like to say it&apos;s been a great innings, but it simply wouldn&apos;t be true. &quot;My favourite sports headline was after Keane&apos;s &apos;you can stick it up your boll**ks&apos; rant. The Guardian&apos;s headline: &apos;Keane: poor grasp of anatomy&apos;.&quot; 101st over: England 352-4 (Collingwood 101, Bell 55) The calm after the storm, or something similar. A maiden for Powell to Bell. &quot;I have it on good authority (ie I told two of their writers to use it on Tuesday) that the Mirror has a headline planned for the next time Angelina Jolie goes searching for some third-world child to add to her collection,&quot; says James Andrews. Drum roll, please. &quot;Womb Raider&quot;. HONK! 102nd over: England 352-4 (Collingwood 101, Bell 55) There are times when doing the OBO that you spend ages reading the readers&apos; witty (sic) and entertaining (sic) emails and then suddenly realise you&apos;ve missed a shedload of runs. No danger of that today. On either count. &quot;Granted, this one was made up, but I remember reading an article in Viz detailing a failed assassination attempt on Paul McCartney,&quot; says Anthony Pease. Come on guys, I know it&apos;s a Friday afternoon but surely we can&apos;t stoop so low that we have to actually make up the headlines. Oh, go on then. &quot;The headline was &apos;Top pop mop-top pot-shot plot flops&apos;.&quot; 103rd over: England 352-4 (Collingwood 101, Bell 55) A [OBO hack counts on his fingers] third, no, fourth, no, third maiden in a row. I&apos;m hoping one of these two is dismissed in the next 20 minutes so that Matt Prior gets a bat and I can pass off this stat - which I&apos;ve ruthlessly stolen from another of my former friends - as my own. Anoraks at the ready: Gilchrist scored 81 off 88 balls on debut against Pakistan in 1999, after making his international debut as an opening batsman in the one-day team. Will Prior do the same? &quot;For headlines, what about &apos;Wenger&apos;s Wonga Makes Bergy Linga Longa?&apos;&quot; asks Tim Gibbs. I don&apos;t know, Tim. What about it?  104th over: England 355-4 (Collingwood 104, Bell 55) I&apos;m not exaggerating when I say England scored three runs - yes, three - from that over, Collingwood flicking the ball off his legs down to fine leg for two and then dashing down to the non-striker&apos;s end for a single. &quot;This is darn funny,&quot; says Simon Allardice. Why thank you, Simon. Oh, there&apos;s more. &quot;&apos;Berbatov happy to stay with &apos;fantastic&apos; spurs&apos; - now that&apos;s comedy!&quot; 105th over: England 357-4 (Collingwood 106, Bell 56) Two more for Collingwood. England have scored 77 runs in this session off 20 overs, which is a respectable run-rate. It&apos;s tough - on the one hand you think they should be pushing on and playing a more expansive game given the excellent position they&apos;re in, but then on the other you fear that if they do and get out, all that remains are a debutant and four No11s. &quot;The Sun have even compiled a very handy presentation of the entrants for the cricket Wags competition after viewing which you&apos;ll be wondering how on earth Haley Bracken didn&apos;t win,&quot; says Will Frost. Sorry, guys and girls, I&apos;m working so you&apos;ll have to make your own mind up on that one. 106th over: England 363-4 (Collingwood 111, Bell 56) WICKET! England 363-5 (Collingwood b Bravo 111) or (b Nelson 111) Ahem, sorry about that last over. Erm, technical difficulties. Anyway, we&apos;re up and running again, and so are the West Indies. Bravo has been arguably the pick of their bowlers and that was a pearler - cutting back and clipping the top of Collingwood&apos;s off stump. &quot;A couple of headlines regarding a US plane,&quot; writes Ralph Slightly-Yates. &quot;Each the work of a genius. Perhaps written by someone from the Atherton school of stating the bleedin obvious. - Plane Too Close To Ground, Crash Probe Told - Something Went Wrong In Jet Crash, Expert Says.&quot; 107th over: England 363-5 (Prior 0, Bell 56) Prior is the new batsman. Did you know that Gilchrist scored 81 off 88 balls on debut against Pakistan in 1999, after making his international debut as an opening batsman in the one-day team? I wonder if Prior will manage something similar. 108th over: England 364-5 (Prior 0, Bell 57) Sky&apos;s brand new all-singing all-dancing Hot-Spot technology has been as redundant as most of my colleagues this afternoon, so the broadcaster decides to show off its new piece of kit by &quot;showing us exactly what happened with that dismissal&quot;. The conclusion is that Collingwood missed the ball, but his off stump did not. HawkEye it is not. In this over, Bell takes a single with a nurdle (no OBO session is complete without a mention of that word) into the leg-side. Prior plays the remaining three balls from Powell competently. &quot;When Dunnes Stores (prop. Ben Dunne) had allegedly bribed then-Irish premier Charles Haughey: &apos;Ben there, Dunne that, Bought the Taoiseach&apos;,&quot; recalls Nick Boyd, leaning back on his chair, staring at the ceiling at chuckling quietly to himself.  109th over: England 369-5 (Prior 4, Bell 57) Prior sprints out of his scoring blocks with an uppish flick through midwicket for four. He has started very confidently. It might be a little too early to say this, but have England cured their wicketkeeper-batsman dilemma? I wonder if he has a cultured left foot too? &quot;On an insurance magazine I have to get some enjoyment out of what I do, which means trying to get terrible headlines into my magazine,&quot; says David Whittam. &quot;My favourite is probably &apos;A pane in the glass&apos;, which, although not making any real sense, is slightly edgy for 50-year-old men to read.&quot; You guys. 110th over: England 372-5 (Prior 5, Bell 58) Prior and Bell play out the final six balls of the session, which is the fifth in a row to have been one on points by England. A suitably low-key end to a low-key couple of hours, which has produced one wicket for the West Indies and 92 runs for England - very similar to the first session of the day, in fact. And here&apos;s a suitably low-key email to complete a low-key group of emails, from Allan Royle: &quot;Then there was the (in)famous headline from the Aberdeen Press &amp; Journal. reporting on the Titanic sinking: &apos;North-east man lost at sea&apos;.&quot; Thanks for keeping me company, enjoy the evening session with Andy Bull in a quarter of an hour.", "sentences": ["&quot;Guardian headline in the 60&apos;s or 70&apos;s about an Amsterdam street organ playing classical music: &apos;Amadeus ex machina&apos;,&quot; offers Graham Alder."], "title": "Over-by-over: afternoon session", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/18/cricket.englandcricketseries", "tags": ["Cricket", "Sport", "England v West Indies 2007"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-18T23:42:44Z", "article": "1.

While record sales are down, live music is flourishing thanks, in part, to the ease with which we can buy tickets online. But the success of online ticket brokers also means that, paradoxically, it&apos;s becoming more difficult to see the acts we like, as even second-rate indie bans seem to routinely sell out within hours of going online. Just like the Glastonbury Festival, unless you grab tickets quickly, or pay through the nose for them on eBay, you are simply left without. Thankfully, there is another way. Travelling on Eurostar (eurostar.com) is making attending gigs in Europe, where tickets are still available, a realistic alternative. Take the forthcoming Arctic Monkeys tour. Their gig at Old Trafford cricket ground (capacity 50,000) has sold out, but you can still buy tickets to seem them in Paris at Le Zenith (capacity 5,000, tickets here ). Or perhaps it&apos;s Johnny Marr&apos;s new band, Modest Mouse, that takes your fancy. You could catch them at the Royal Albert Hall (capacity 5,000) or on the small stage at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels (capacity 800, tickets: abconcerts.be). Likewise, it&apos;s too late to see the Editors on their sell-out UK tour. No worries, tickets at the Postbahnhof (postbahnhof.de) in Berlin, a renovated train station in the trendy district of Friedrichshain, are there to be had (here). Similarly, tickets for Hot Chip at Somerset House in London are all gone. But, you still have a chance to see them in October at the equally palatial Le Botanique in Brussels (see hotchip.co.uk for details). Other sold-out acts, like Paul Weller at the Paradiso in Amsterdam or Lily Allen in Sweden (both have sold out UK tours), are all but a judicious search of Google away.  If you book early enough, moreover, it needn&apos;t cost much more than seeing them back home, with Eurostar overnights starting as low as \u00a342 return (Paris, Brussels or Lille, Saturday night only). And with both Germany and Holland opening up to high-speed rail connection from London in the coming months, catching your favourite act abroad - where its much more fun - becomes as simple as shouting for an encore.  Of course, dedicated followers of fashionable bands have been travelling abroad for years by coach, and tours can be booked online too. For those who live far from the Eurostar terminal at London Waterloo, a pre-packaged coach tour remains an attractive option. Sites such as seegigs.co.uk and radiotravelshop.com specialise in coach tours - like going to see the Arctic Monkeys in Paris - and also in ticket and hotel deals - like the Killers playing in their hometown of Vegas - although you will always do better if you buy the tickets online and source the hotel yourself. For those living in and around London at least, it&apos;s as easy to see a band in Lille as it is in Leeds.  \u00b7  sean.dosdson@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["Other sold-out acts, like Paul Weller at the Paradiso in Amsterdam or Lily Allen in Sweden (both have sold out UK tours), are all but a judicious search of Google away."], "title": "Best of the net", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/may/19/saturday.travelwebsites", "tags": ["Best of the net", "Travel", "Travel websites", "Rail travel", "Berlin holidays", "Amsterdam holidays", "Brussels holidays"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-19T23:01:02Z", "article": "Usually a night spent surrounded by cranes is a cause of complaint, but the Harbour Crane hotel can make it a positive choice.

The hens include Elizabeth&apos;s daughter Stephanie, 19, friends, sisters, prospective sister-in-law and goddaughter. The brief: &apos;My first hen night was very formal; all tea and scones with the relatives. This time I&apos;m going to do what I want. I&apos;d like a hen weekend that involves camping, but no one seems very keen on the idea - could the rain, outdoor toilets, beetles and midges be putting them off? We all like a bit of luxury, and want to do something a bit different and fun, so would consider wigwams or lodges in the Highlands and maybe incorporate belly dancing or something adventurous. I have been promising my friend Susan for years that we would go for a weekend to France, but it&apos;s probably too expensive.&apos;  The budget: \u00a3150 per person. The solution  Amanda Statham, You and Your Wedding: &apos;Camping is cool again. Forget wet weekends in Wales tussling with your tent; these days the whole experience is a lot more luxurious.

The 10 stags are aged 23-46 and live in London or the south. The brief: &apos;The bridegroom has lived in cities most of his life, so I would like to do something rural for him,&apos; says best man and Paul&apos;s brother, Keith. &apos;Although Paul says he likes living near the countryside, it&apos;s a mystery to him: his only experience is playing golf in the middle of it. We want any sort of farm-related outdoor pursuit and we want to hang out in a cosy barn afterwards to eat, chat and drink some country beer.&apos;  The budget: \u00a3200 per person. The solution   Bridget Stott, Piece of Cake: &apos;How about learning to ride Western-style on the Dorset coast followed by a two-night stay at a brewery? Just five minutes from the beach, Studland Stables (01929 450 273; www.studlandstables.com) offers weekend riding courses. The centre doesn&apos;t have accommodation, but will book you into the old ivy-clad Bankes Arms nearby. The Bankes has 10 rooms, great food, sea views and is famous for the real ales made at its on-site brewery. Packages from \u00a3264, so it&apos;s a little over-budget, but eight hours of riding is included.&apos; Tom Marchant, Black Tomato: &apos;Your budget doesn&apos;t have to limit you to the UK. The guys can take a ferry to Cherbourg and spend the weekend at Hirondelle House, in Sainte Suzanne sur Vire, Manche. The stone house has been fully restored and has a mix of antique and modern styles with all mod cons. The terraces in the front and back of the house are a perfect place to hang out and have a few beers, and there&apos;s a Jacuzzi and a barbecue. The village also has plenty of great bars and restaurants within stumbling distance. There is a range of activities available just outside the village, from quad biking to clay pigeon-shooting. From \u00a3199 per person, including ferry, two nights&apos; accommodation and activities.&apos; Sunshine and shopping Having met on holiday six years ago, Nicola Rothwell, 34, a human resources manager, and Chris Byrne, 33, a software consultant, are to marry in October in Manchester, where they live together. Nicola is looking for original ideas for a group of 10 to 15 hens, aged 30-64, the majority being work friends. Planned date is end of September. The brief: &apos;I&apos;m looking for European destinations where we will get sun, nice restaurants and perhaps go to an event or festival. We all like fashion, shopping, fine foods and wines, and we&apos;re summer people, so the trip needs to provide some or all of these elements. We&apos;d also like to spend a day doing an activity as a group. My mum (64) and mother-in-law (58), who are both young at heart, are coming. I&apos;d like to give people the option of being there for two or three nights, then after my friends fly back, I would like to stay out for one more day with my mum.&apos; The budget: \u00a3450 per person. The solution  Amanda Statham, You and Your Wedding: &apos;Barcelona is the ideal destination: fab hotels, great food, fantastic nightlife, cool shops and lots of activities - there&apos;s even a man-made beach where you can learn to surf. Lufthansa (www.lufthansa.com) flies from Manchester to Barcelona at the end of September for around \u20ac200 return. The Constanza hotel (0034 9320 1910; www.hotelconstanza.com) is in a 19th-century building with a very smart interior: think white suede armchairs and marble floors. You could take over the seven apartments on the sixth floor, each of which sleeps two and has a separate living area, well equipped kitchenette and decked terrace. From \u00a3120 per apartment per night. If you make your weekend extend to 24 September, you can experience La Merce festival, a massive party celebrating the city&apos;s patron saint with fireworks and music. Alternatively, if you&apos;re all fashion-lovers, there&apos;s a fabulous shopping package on offer until December at the new five-star Hesperia Tower Hotel Barcelona (www.hesperia.com). For \u00a3212 a head you&apos;ll get two nights&apos; accommodation, buffet breakfast, welcome pack of chocolates, fruit, mineral water, free taxi and 10 per cent discount card at La Roca Village, a shopping complex. The hotel has a swanky spa, so if you stay on with your mum you can have a serious pampering session.&apos; Bridget Stott, Piece of Cake: &apos;Late September is the perfect time to visit Marrakesh. Hire a riyad (townhouse) for a weekend. Riyad Edward (www.riyadedward.com) is stylishly decorated, fully staffed, sleeps 14 and arranges wonderful dinner parties with Berber musicians; rooms from \u00a380 a night. It is within striking distance of the city&apos;s souks and close to many fantastic restaurants.  Tom Marchant, Black Tomato: &apos;If you&apos;re looking for sun, glamour, shopping and good food, Sardinia is ideal. Take a flight to Cagliari and base the group at the beautiful Hotel Miramare, which has 14 rooms and is in the heart of the marina, so all the shops, bars and restaurants are a short walk away - as is beautiful Poetto Beach. One of the best ways to explore the island is to charter a yacht for the day to explore stunning bays and beaches.

The lads like a bevvy, but we&apos;re looking for other activities in between the beery sessions. We&apos;re all big fans of music. I think a stag event might be lost at a music festival, but a beer or food festival might work. We&apos;re big fans of the outdoors; we would be interested in hiring a youth hostel or a remote cottage and doing some mountain walking.

In constant pain but denied access to painkillers, he&apos;s been taking his rage out on the patients and his staff. Yes, even more so than usual. Last week - just because they happened to be in the line of exploding vitriol and sarcasm - it was a six-year-old girl with a mystery allergy and her estranged parents, not to mention the exceptionally long-suffering Lisa Cuddy. &apos;It&apos;s good that you failed to become a mom because you suck at it,&apos; House sneered, and Cuddy could have been forgiven for punching him, given that she was not only charged with looking after the six year old but her third attempt at IVF had resulted in a miscarriage. Everyone who comes near Greg House would have reasonable grounds for decking the miserable S of a B, but perhaps it&apos;s the thought of litigation that scares them off. It certainly can&apos;t be the hope that he&apos;ll suddenly and miraculously make the correct diagnosis, because his eye is currently off the ball and on his secret stash of whatever it takes to get through the day. It took Dr Wilson&apos;s 11th-hour-and-58th-minute lightbulb moment - a diagnosis of a photo-allergic reaction - to give us the happy ending we needed. Thus we had the medical equivalent of &apos;Hold the front page!&apos; (&apos;Stop!&apos;, presumably) when the phone rang in theatre just as a scalpel hovered and glittered, like a sinister hovering glittering thing - or maybe a scalpel - as it was just about to amputate the little girl&apos;s arm. Phew. That was close! But the occasional eye-rolling lapse into cliches, implausible timing and manipulative juxtapositions of sharp cold steel and the soft warm flesh of six year olds is a teeny-weeny price to pay for a drama that rarely misses a trick, a beat, a one-liner or any other opportunity to show why it&apos;s currently still one of the most consistently entertaining hours on TV. It&apos;s been a great week for the big American shows. I&apos;m an occasional visitor to the Lost island (Sky One) these days, but walking away from the sight of Locke staggering towards Ben with something very large and heavy slung over his shoulder, and the line: &apos;You said if I killed my father you&apos;d tell me everything I wanted to know about the island. So why don&apos;t we start at the beginning?&apos; would have been to orally examine the proverbial gift-wrapped equine. As come-ons go, this was, in time-honoured Lost-style, impossible to ignore, but Ben managed to delay the inevitable for a couple of ad breaks before agreeing to trek with Locke across the island to meet Jacob ... Edge of the seat, or what, Lostophiles? But, just as inevitably, Jacob turned out to be some bad SFX left over from Poltergeist, and I hate being suckered. Give me some answers, goddamit - if only because there are now so many bloody questions that I can&apos;t remember half of them. Meanwhile Locke&apos;s apparently dead, in a pit - and it should have been a closet - along with all the skeletons from the Dharma Initiative. Ben, incidentally, had a very miserable childhood. On the other hand, The Sopranos (C4) reached its midway-through-the-final-season mini-break (and let&apos;s hope all series don&apos;t start doing this) with an episode that proved the show is still the finest and purest distillation of the essence of &apos;What It Is To Be American&apos; than anything else on screen. This has nothing to do with warring mafia factions and everything to do with the nature of the modern family; of love, hate, lust and loyalty; of hearts ruling heads and hope triumphing over experience. The last few elegiac minutes - an It&apos;s A Wonderful Life of a Christmas Day at Tony and Carmela&apos;s - was not only beautiful to look at but loaded with humour and bathos. There was AJ with his new girlfriend and her son, and Carmela oozing hospitality and sequins, before turning to Tony: &apos;She&apos;s 10 years older than him and she&apos;s Puerto Rican.&apos; &apos;Dominican. At least she&apos;s a Catholic ...&apos; And Christopher with his arm around his pregnant wife - the vision of familial contentedness, but for the fact that his wife doesn&apos;t know he&apos;s sleeping with Julianna Margulies and using heroin. &apos;You have a beautiful home,&apos; said AJ&apos;s girl to Carmela (whose own Christmas present from Tony was a kick in the ass for the New Jersey planning department who had nipped her real estate career in the bud). Carmela smiled and said her thanks, patted Tony&apos;s knee, and the camera pulled back from the tableau without a word being uttered in anger or a punch being thrown, and the credits rolled, and you knew that, for the Soprano family, this was probably going to be as good as it got. The last half of the final series will be unmissable. There wasn&apos;t a single slice of Brit drama that could compete with House, Lost or The Sopranos last week, so it made sense to seek sanctuary among our current affairs and documentaries, because when was the last time you watched an American documentary, as opposed to a documentary about America? Monday&apos;s Panorama (BBC1), an investigation by John Sweeney, formerly of The Observer, into Scientology, had been billed as The One When The Reporter Completely Loses the Plot, and it lived up to its billing. I&apos;d seen the clip of Sweeney roaring at a Scientology bigwig on breakfast TV (though the Scientologists had posted the clip on YouTube), and it wasn&apos;t pretty, but when viewed in context it was also entirely understandable. For a new &apos;religion&apos; (in the US, though not recognised as such here, much to its members&apos; chagrin), Scientology doesn&apos;t seem to have learned many lessons from the old ones. They are tired of being kicked by the media, and I guess that&apos;s fair enough - though if you are a 55-year-old &apos;religion&apos; set up by a writer of unreadably bad science fiction you&apos;ve got to expect a few knocks - but the way they seek to control the media reveals methods a New Jersey crime syndicate might consider gauche and unsophisticated. Or perhaps it&apos;s just that the members of this California-based pseudo-religion - and if I call it a cult they&apos;ll send me a politely patronising letter from their UK HQ in East Grinstead, but, hey, it&apos;s a cult! - have seen, or possibly even starred in, too many movies. After being tailed, harangued, bullied and manipulated merely for doing his job, Sweeney had had enough. Indeed, he all but exploded. There were veins popping on his veins. It was (and this is not a word I ever thought I&apos;d be using in the context of Panorama) hilarious, though John (whom I know well enough for him to have once destroyed my lavatory under still unexplained circumstances, but without the presence of Scientologists) hardly needs me to tell him he looked like a fool, because unfortunately this &apos;corrupt, sinister and dangerous&apos; (a high court judge, 1984) religious business empire had just got their result, making somebody with integrity look even more foolish than they did, albeit temporarily. Brilliant TV - and for about 30 seconds, marginally less brilliant reporting methods, but ultimately the &apos;church&apos; hoist itself on its own inflated ego and low-self esteem. I sat open-mouthed through a great deal of C4&apos;s Virgin School. And then I closed it and opened it again and gurned a bit and covered my eyes with my hands and groaned and uuurghed and ooohed and squirmed ... such was the level of raw, naked honesty, not to mention private bits and pieces and rumpled linen, on show that I spent a while thinking it must be a spoof. Shy 26 year-old James was a virgin who didn&apos;t want to be, so instead of visiting a prostitute he decided to dispense with his virginity at a special school in - where else? - Amsterdam, run by kindly ladies of a certain age, and trailed by a documentary crew. To say that James was heroically brave was to somewhat understate the case. We were spared little on his journey, either, bar the climax, but it was touching to see this man-child (whose only job was a paper round and who lived at home with his dad and stepmum) walking taller at the end. And I can&apos;t help feeling that losing your cherry after months of coaching by partners who care about your emotional wellbeing is going to be a lot more satisfying and educational than the manner in which most of us make the leap. Form an orderly queue, ladies of Kent - James is clearly going to be a wow in the sack. Men united Tragically few are the sitcoms that would include a scene of a man urinating on the wall of a church accompanied by the line &apos;Richard Dawkins talks the talk but does he actually follow through?&apos;, though if there were too many we&apos;d become smug and probably not bother watching. The latest series of Peep Show (C4) finished on Friday with Mark&apos;s (David Mitchell) long-awaited wedding. Initially, of course, Mark did the dread deed with Sophie but discovered it made her as miserable as it made him, so left her to it and went home in the Roller with Jez, with whom he could carry on behaving as rubbishly as usual without censure. Or, as Jeremy (Robert Webb) had put it on the morning of the wedding: &apos;I don&apos;t make you tense, nervous and unhappy.&apos; &apos;Yes you do.&apos; &apos;Not nearly to the same extent.&apos; Yup, among heterosexual men that qualifies as true love.", "sentences": ["- Amsterdam, run by kindly ladies of a certain age, and trailed by a documentary crew."], "title": "Kathryn Flett on House | Lost | The Sopranos | Panorama | Virgin School", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/20/broadcasting.comment", "tags": ["Media", "Virgin Group", "Television industry"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-21T09:40:59Z", "article": "The Italian writer and politician Maria Macciocchi, who has died aged 84, was best known and admired internationally for her lifelong activities as a feminist militant and leftist dissident, particularly in France, where in 1992 President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand honoured her with the L\u00e9gion d&apos;honneur. In 1996, in a talk to students of the Institute for Social Studies in Amsterdam, she said that she had changed &quot;nationality&quot; many times, in identifying against oppression across the world. She was born into modest social conditions in a small hill town, Isola Liri, near Frosin, 110km south of Rome. Her parents were anti-fascists and she took part at an early age in the resistance movement, joining the clandestine Italian Communist party (PCI) during the German occupation of Rome. The party sent Macciocchi to Naples to help recruit women for the organisation in the postwar years, and it was there that she first met Communist party leader Palmiro Togliatti, who had just returned from Moscow. She was the companion at the time of Pietro Amendola, brother of a foremost Neapolitan party leader, Giorgio Amendola. They never married but he gave his name to their daughter Giorgina. She would later marry and divorce Alberto Jacoviello, a journalist on the party paper l&apos;Unit\u00e0. In 1950 the party appointed her as editor of their women&apos;s magazine, Noi Donne, and later of the popular weekly magazine Vie Nuove, for which she convinced Pier Paolo Pasolini to write a regular column. When she began working for l&apos;Unit\u00e0, the paper founded by the Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, to whom Macciocchi would dedicate her most impassioned writings and lecturing, she soon became their foreign correspondent, first in Algiers and then in Paris, where, in the 1960s, a new life opened up for her. She lectured at Vincennes University, always siding with the students. She obtained her master&apos;s degree in political science at the Sorbonne. When her book on Gramsci was published in France as Pour Gramsci, she was credited with having introduced the Italian philosopher to French intellectuals. In Italy, the book, an acute analysis of the philosopher&apos;s non-orthodox interpretation of Marxism, caused controversy in the party, where they were tending to underrate their founder. The paper brought her back to Italy in 1968 to stand as a candidate in Naples, from where, during her campaign, she kept up a correspondence with Louis Althusser describing the pitiable conditions of the working classes in that city but also the bad management of the local party, naturally upsetting the PCI chiefs. The letters were published as a book in 1969, appearing in an English translation in 1973 with the title Letters From Inside the Italian Communist Party to Louis Althusser. The Observer reviewer wrote: &quot;A startling and moving book. It is the most horrific account of poverty and exploitation in modern Europe to be published in many years&quot;. She was elected but the party did not offer her re-election in 1972, the year in which she went to China for l&apos;Unit\u00e0 and afterwards published a 570-page book praising the cultural revolution. In 1977 she was expelled from the PCI because she supported the Maoist agitators in Bologna. In 1979 she was elected as MEP for the Radical party. Among her 15 books, which include an autobiography, 2000 Years of Happiness, of particular interest are those that deal with the historical role of women in revolutionary politics, among these are two dedicated to Eleonora Fonsecca and Luisa Sanfelice, martyred heroines of the shortlived Neapolitan republic of 1779. She remained faithful to her principles, keeping out of the controversies afflicting the Italian left today. In 1988 she had had an audience with Pope John Paul II, for whom she confessed bemusingly a great admiration &quot;for his Marxist-Leninist origins&quot;. Recently, she expressed her support for S\u00e9golene Royale &quot;as a symbol of female emancipation&quot;. The day after her death in a Rome hospital, Gramsci&apos;s l&apos;Unit\u00e0, now the newspaper of the post-communist Democrats of the Left, published only a few unsigned paragraphs announcing her death, not mentioning her expulsion from the PCI. She is survived by her daughter, Giorgina Amendola. \u00b7 Maria Antonietta Macciocchi, writer and politician, born July 22 1922; died April 15 2007", "sentences": ["In 1996, in a talk to students of the Institute for Social Studies in Amsterdam, she said that she had changed &quot;nationality&quot; many times, in identifying against oppression across the world."], "title": "Obituary: Maria Macciocchi", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/may/21/guardianobituaries.italy", "tags": ["Italy", "World news", "Books", "Culture", "Feminism", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-21T23:12:16Z", "article": "After a strangely diverting week, in which a small dog on the run bearing his name had made news across Europe, Ruud Gullit can now concentrate fully on his footballing passion. &quot;The Champions League has always been very special to me, the trophy that matters most of all,&quot; Gullit says, &quot;and so it was a little crazy for us to be talking more about Jose Mourinho&apos;s dog than a final between Milan and Liverpool. But I did like the idea that he had named his dog after me. It didn&apos;t matter that it was very tiny. If Jose&apos;s dog is called Gullit then I understand why it is so precious to him. Any dog called Gullit must be something special.&quot; The real Gullit, an icon of European football who in the past has revealed an ego to rival even that of Mourinho, laughs with a suitable sense of self-mockery. His affection for Mourinho&apos;s Yorkshire Terrier, who escaped a spell in quarantine and the clutches of the police to end up &quot;on holiday&quot; in Portugal, will not be ruined by rival claims that the mutt is called Leya. &quot;I only heard last week that his name is Gullit and everyone tells me this is true. So I wish Jose and Gullit good luck but I am more interested in the final. These are two very different clubs with a big European history and for most people it will be hard to predict a winner. But I&apos;m not neutral. I would like to watch a good final but, really, I just hope that Milan will win.&quot; Gullit was Silvio Berlusconi&apos;s first transfer coup after he became Milan president in 1986, and helped transform an erratic team into dominant European champions. Milan had not won Serie A for almost a decade, and the European Cup for nearly 20 years, when Gullit arrived at San Siro. Alongside Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten, Gullit instilled Dutch verve into a rejuvenated side. Having won Serie A in his debut season, Milan seized successive European Cups in 1989 and 1990. Their destruction of Real Madrid and Steaua Bucharest in that first semi-final and final remain among the most complete team performances ever in club football. &quot;This is why I have such big feelings for Milan,&quot; Gullit says. &quot;The state of the club had not been so good before Berlusconi took over but he brought organisation and vision. He was responsible for everything and Berlusconi himself actually signed me. As soon as I met him I could sense a chance to do something unbelievable with a club. He started something then, a Milan legacy, because this guy has been there 20 years and the club has won something like 25 trophies [including seven Serie A and four Champions League titles]. Milan has greatness now.&quot; If it is impossible to warm to either the character or politics of Berlusconi, or to forget how fortunate Milan are even to be in the competition this season after their involvement in the corrupt machinations of Italian football, Gullit&apos;s team left purer memories on the pitch. &quot;I played in a lot of good teams with Holland but for me that Milan side was the best when we beat Real Madrid 5-0 at home in the semi-final and then won 4-0 against Bucharest. We were on a mission. Against Madrid it was like feeling something great burst out of you and afterwards we were so determined it would not just happen once. We wanted to win the final in the same fashion and that&apos;s why we were so focused.&quot; Gullit scored two goals that night and claims that &quot;it was the best possible mix of Dutch and Italian mentalities. It was important for me that I had Frank and Marco because at first we were just three guys together in a foreign country. I didn&apos;t speak Italian for a while and we relied on each other. We brought something different to Milan but we also learnt a lot from the Italians. Sometimes, these days, there are eight or nine nationalities in one team and it can be difficult to be as complete as we were at Milan. But it is still possible - we&apos;ve seen that this season.&quot; Football has changed far too much for Gullit to even attempt any coherent comparison between Milan&apos;s finest two matches and Manchester United&apos;s dazzling 7-1 demolition of Roma. &quot;The eras are too different but United came closest in that one match to doing what we did. They were amazing but the bad thing for them was that perfection came too soon. Milan had been warned. &quot;So for me the idea of Milan knocking out United was logical. I was only surprised they won so easily. But Carlos Ancelotti [Milan&apos;s coach] is right when he says Liverpool are tougher opponents. United are the better footballing team but Liverpool are much more cautious under [Rafael] Ben\u00edtez. They are harder to beat in Europe.&quot; Much has been made of Milan&apos;s determination to avenge their loss of a 3-0 lead in the final two years ago in Istanbul but Gullit insists, &quot;That match has no big relevance. It was an amazing comeback by Liverpool, and it did hurt Milan, but this time it will be very tactical and tight. Milan have got Kaka, of course, and a great defence. People say they are old but the word is &apos;experienced&apos;. Those guys read a game better than anyone and I&apos;m just so proud that their defence still includes my team-mate. Paolo Maldini, in my mind, is still the 18-year-old guy I first played with when I came to Milan but he is still going at 39. I&apos;m not surprised because even as a kid he stood out. So Milan have Kaka and their defenders but I think they can win this game in midfield - with Gattuso and my friend Mr Seedorf. &quot;But in midfield Liverpool have Gerrard - and he is a great player. But I also like Dirk Kuyt because I coached him at Feyenoord. He and Salomon Kalou were the two players I had there who I always thought would do something special. Kalou has big talent and you will see more of that at Chelsea. And Kuyt has made real progress because he&apos;s very eager to learn and easy to coach.&quot; Gullit&apos;s season-long coaching stint at Feyenoord ended in 2005, and since then he has confined himself to television work. Although he stresses his happiness in Amsterdam, playing amateur football and spending more time with a family he once neglected, his managerial ambitions remain unfulfilled. A promising start with Chelsea was dented at Newcastle and then Feyenoord and as a manager he is often remembered more for a few unfortunate phrases like &quot;sexy football&quot;. Sometimes I miss coaching,&quot; the 44-year-old says, &quot;but often things are not how they appear in football. It was like this at Feyenoord. I did OK but a lot of things happened under the surface. I had lots of trouble with the board but we still finished fourth. Now 18 months later there are the same problems even when the owner steps back. They&apos;ve just finished seventh and they won&apos;t even be going into Europe. I didn&apos;t do that bad but if I&apos;d used my head I would have never taken that job. But Feyenoord [for whom Gullit played from 1982 to 1985] was in my heart. It was difficult to resist.&quot; Newcastle, with its long-dormant potential, was another club Gullit found difficult to resist - &quot;even if we see the same pattern of failure. I never had any problems with Freddy Shepherd and the board, it was more the players [Alan Shearer and Rob Lee according to Gullit] and so Sam Allardyce is going to have to change the whole culture. I think Allardyce will concentrate on structure and discipline and that&apos;s needed most at Newcastle.&quot; And what of Chelsea and Mourinho after a season filled as much with trauma as cup-winning glory? &quot;I still think it&apos;s a failure for Chelsea. It&apos;s very good for most clubs to win the Carling Cup and the FA Cup but Chelsea and Mourinho were on another mission. They wanted the Champions League more than anything and they failed in that. I felt a little sorry because they had injuries and who knows what else behind the scenes. But they made it to the semis and even if they did not play well it is a lottery to go out on penalties.&quot; Gullit snorts derisively at Jorge Valdano&apos;s jibe that Chelsea and Liverpool produced the equivalent of &quot;shit hanging on a stick&quot; before that penalty shootout. &quot;That comment is shit in itself. You need different kinds of styles in football. Look what Real Madrid did with Valdano [before his resignation as sporting director in June 2005] when they tried to buy all those superstars. They had glamour but they never gelled as a team. We had both when I was at Milan but everyone has their own style. I don&apos;t care what Valdano says - Mourinho and Ben\u00edtez are winners. But I still want Milan.&quot;  \u00b7 Ruud Gullit is a match expert in Athens on Sky Sports 1/HD 1 from 6pm tomorrow", "sentences": ["Although he stresses his happiness in Amsterdam, playing amateur football and spending more time with a family he once neglected, his managerial ambitions remain unfulfilled."], "title": "Champions League: Memories of past magic fire Gullit's enduring passion for Milan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/22/championsleague.acmilan", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Milan"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-24T15:16:29Z", "article": "It is no coincidence, wrote Douglas Adams, that no language has developed the expression &quot;as pretty as an airport&quot;. We were not meant to fly; there is something gloriously transgressive about it. And yet, instead of being welcomed at the airport \u2013 as another writer, Will Self, imagined it \u2013 by blond-locked, helmeted creatures blowing horn trumpets, we are instead confronted by angry-faced teenagers, a blowtorch examination of our identity and, increasingly, the prospect of murder.  On my last flight, a so-called budget fare to Grenoble, I wondered why they didn&apos;t just slap me and let me board: the sum assault on my dignity would have been the same as all the preliminaries. In its rationalistic dehumanisation and its crushing of enchantment, flying represents everything about modernity it would be pleasant to rewind. Forgive these mental excursions; they occurred on a train. That flight to Grenoble would, I hoped, be my last. I was on my way to Amsterdam, but my itinerary did not comprise a sweaty scramble to the airport, lengthy queues and all the interrogations thereafter. No, I was going the leisurely \u2013 and, as we shall see, demonstratively greener - way by rail and sail. The ferry company Stena Line no doubt has sound economic reasons for abandoning its speedy, hydrofoil service from Harwich \u2013 the &quot;w&quot; has dropped off the pronunciation over the centuries \u2013 to Hook of Holland. But I prefer to dwell instead on the poetic aspect of its associated decision to expand the passenger capacity of the stately Stena Hollandica and Stena Brittanica.  These ferries have only recently carried foot passengers at all \u2013 it used to be only lorries and motorists \u2013 but, over the past few months, they have been sort of sawn in half and expanded cabin sections have been welded in the middle, making them among the largest such ships in the world. Floating to Holland is as cheap as chips (and mayonnaise), too: starting from around \u00a360, including rail travel within the UK and the Netherlands, a fare costs barely more than the cheapest flights. A cabin, essential on the night passage and to make the most of that romantic potential, costs a little extra.  It is not all smooth sailing: on the day passage you must get up very early indeed if taking the train from London, and there are a couple of changes at Dutch stations, but, once in your seat, you can watch the countryside passing by (and lifesized, rather than as seen from 20,000 feet) as you slip gently into contemplation. Stena Line might have thoroughly refurbished its craft, yet, while the sprawling bar-cum-canteen may have been done out in spanking navy blue, matching the uniforms of the highly attentive serving staff, the self-service food was barely edible. Everything had been salted and sweetened indiscriminately. If you are going to have chips with everything, at least don&apos;t ovenbake them.  The Metropolitan Bar and Grill, one deck down, served better fare (in an interesting reversal of the usual maritime class arrangement: remember what happened to the lower-deck passengers on the Titanic). You find it opposite the shop, where a wall of cheap booze bottles chime like a xylophone. The value was good at the Metropolitan and the range wide \u2013 if, in that English-pub way, a little frenziedly international; the chef would even stirfry your choice of ingredients in front of you. But the &quot;all you can eat&quot; invitation sank the tone, the curry was \u2013 again \u2013 sugared, and the array of deserts looked like a trifle and whipped cream hallucination. But that was easily forgotten. The tableside porthole view, the rocking of the boat on the mellow swell and the occasional thrum of the engine were all so fabulously evocative as to mitigate the splodges of questionable taste.  Word of the ferries&apos; concertina expansion had evidently not yet got out. Progress through customs on the outward journey was uncrowded enough \u2013 there was no crowd \u2013 but, returning from Holland, I was the only passenger in the departure hall at all. &quot;Busy night?&quot; I asked the officer, almost giggling from the strangeness of it all. &quot;You&apos;re the first one I&apos;ve seen in half an hour,&quot; he replied, flicking languidly through my passport. A quartet of his towering, blonde, female Dutch colleagues began, for some reason, singing Auld Lang Syne as he waved me through. This was not Heathrow. You can find more solitude out on deck, through a couple of heavy bulkhead doors at the end of winding corridors. By the time I boarded that evening, the sea had turned to a chilled, black, oily soup lapping the indistinct Dutch shore as we floated away. Afterwards \u2013 the improbable highlight of my crossing \u2013 I retreated to my cabin.  The cabins have been refitted with perfectly neutral decor. Small as they are, they contain a closed cubicle with toilet and shower. And there is a porthole, of course, and a reading light. With that mild rocking, again, and the occasional engine shudder, the cabin formed such a warm, safe refuge that the absence of someone else to complete it became briefly so unbearable I wanted to drown. But boat and rail travel are not only more poetic than flying; they are also dramatically less destructive. A plausible study commissioned by Eurostar last year showed that a passengers flying between London and Paris generate 10 times more emissions than someone taking the train. Tony Bosworth, from Friends of the Earth, tells me, that while &quot;shipping emissions are part of the problem, they are lower overall than flying&quot;. &quot;Travelling by boat rather than plane is more environmentally friendly,&quot; he says. There I was, then: light of conscience and leaving harbour. Getting there The Dutch Flyer fare, incorporating travel from railway stations in East Anglia to any Dutch station, as well as the ferry passage, is a collaboration between One Railway and Stena Line. The jet age unwound: Some other low-impact European journeys \u00b7 Get to Ireland on an inclusive SailRail fare from one of 2,400 railway stations in Britain to any Irish station, via the Holyhead/Dublin ferry.  \u00b7 Take the train \u2013 or, who knows, walk \u2013 to Dartmouth and then board a yacht for a six-week voyage around Britain. \u00b7 Sail from Portsmouth to Bilbao, on a P&amp;O ferry; the passage takes around 30 hours. \u00b7 Take the Eurostar to Paris, then a TGV to Marseille, wallow in the port city for a while and then return via one of the old overnight ferries to Corsica. \u00b7 easyCruise is expanding its Holland and Belgium service this year; boarding in Amsterdam or Brussels, it now runs from March to December. Prices start from \u00a345 per person for a three-night long weekend; the idea is that you pay initially only for accommodation and then for anything else you use or consume at the end of the cruise. \u00b7 Book a passenger cabin on one of the last remaining Royal Mail Ships, from Portland (UK) to the remote and protected South Atlantic island of St Helena \u2013 where Napoleon was exiled. There will be only 100 more sailings (most are from Cape Town, not Britain) of the RMS St Helena until its decommissioning, in 2012.  \u00b7 If you really prefer the journey to the destination: take the Eurostar to Brussels, then a highspeed train to Cologne and a direct sleeper for two nights to Moscow; then take the newly launched and luxurious \u2013 expect none of the traditional onboard gruel, for example \u2013 Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express, for a 14-night trip from the Russian capital to Vladivostok. \u00b7 Go to Australia - but on a seven-week cruise from Southampton.", "sentences": ["I was on my way to Amsterdam, but my itinerary did not comprise a sweaty scramble to the airport, lengthy queues and all the interrogations thereafter.", "\u00b7 easyCruise is expanding its Holland and Belgium service this year; boarding in Amsterdam or Brussels, it now runs from March to December."], "title": "The slow route to Amsterdam", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/may/24/tradepressroundup.amsterdam", "tags": ["Travel", "Green travel", "Amsterdam holidays", "Boating holidays", "Netherlands holidays", "Travel and transport", "Transport", "UK news", "Environment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-25T10:00:00Z", "article": "Move over: a Metropolitan police officer at a Critical Mass ride in London, 2005. Photograph: Andrew Stuart/AFP. Critical Mass is more than a coincidence of cyclists travelling in the same direction. It is a little cultural gem in London life which has its place alongside Banksy&apos;s graffiti and Brian Haw&apos;s hats. It is one of those mixed up expressions of dissent, fun and celebration which doesn&apos;t fit with the usual definitions of political protest. OK, it&apos;s also untidy and slightly chaotic at times, but London was born that way. That is why the police are having such trouble controlling the event and I suspect it also explains why they are clearly determined to try. For over a decade cyclists have gathered near the National Theatre at Waterloo for a once a month procession through central London&apos;s congested streets, nearly always with a small and unobtrusive police escort. Sometimes during cold &amp; wet winter evenings there are less than a hundred cyclists, sometimes in the warmth of summer there are several thousand. This evening the turn out will be huge as the appeal court judges have decided by a two to one majority that Critical Mass does come within the provisions of the Public Order Act and that gives the police their chance to nab the organisers - their only problem being that there aren&apos;t any. The legal defence for Critical Mass is both its lack of identified leaders and the attitude that this is a procession of legitimate road users rather than a militant brandishing of bicycle clips. The police should be no more able to arrest cyclists for using the road, than they would arrest commuters for crowding on board the train at London Bridge station. Critical Mass is also fun, especially on a sunny evening. That is why I would urge every one who can to come and join me from around 6pm onwards on the South Bank, near the National Theatre. I have no idea where I will be going, but I hope it involves wandering past New Scotland Yard so that I can give the Met Police commissioner a wave. I also have no idea how long it will take - after all how long is a piece of leaderless, meandering string? Having just celebrated its 13th birthday, Critical Mass can just about justify its claim to be a modern London tradition. It started in the days of the anti-roads protests, when planners still assumed that the car was king and the solution to congestion was another lane of tarmac. Back then there was no London government and cycling was categorised as one of those dangerous, urban hobbies fit only for eccentrics and rebels. It is an image, and for many cyclists an internalised mind set, which we are still struggling to escape. I have to admit that when Critical Mass takes a diversion to the spot where yet another cyclist has been killed under the wheels of a lorry, it is hard to remember that cycling is twice as safe as it was in the 90s. In fact the true meaning of the phrase &quot;critical mass&quot; is reaching that Amsterdam moment, when cycling becomes such a normal part of our life, work and leisure that drivers have to recognise the existence of the bike and cyclists can claim their fair share of the road. The theory is that if we reach that critical mass then the roads will become safer. For example, in London we now have an 83% increase in cycling, but the number of people injured on their bikes has actually gone down. The London gathering is part of a worldwide movement of several hundred similar rides. Some are bigger, some more organised and some face an even heavier police presence. One ride was recently charged by police on horses and people arrested on the basis that they didn&apos;t stick to the cycle lane provided. Thankfully we aren&apos;t going to have any of that nonsense in London as I have had a chat with the officer in charge of policing the event and he tells me that the policing will be &quot;happy go lucky&quot; as usual. Perhaps the most encouraging sign is when the rides have taken a major diversion to become part of a larger international circuit of big official rides. These have built up over many years, attracted commercial sponsorship and official blessing. From New York to Cape Town these mass participation rides have become a new way of celebrating cycling. As much as I&apos;m looking forward to the Tour de France hitting London, I think that the Berlin Star ride with its 80,000 ordinary participants is the real future for celebrating cycling in London. Berlin has built up this annual event over many years and is the biggest by far of the mass rides. People of all ages and social backgrounds converge on central Berlin for the day from all the tips of a giant star of different routes. This September London will hopefully take the first big step in creating our own version of Berlin Star ride. London&apos;s very own mass bike ride will be shifting gear and going down that path of being bigger, commercially attractive and officially backed. We are hoping it will inspire all the leisure riders, family groups and occasional cyclists to get the bikes out of the basement and join us for the day. It will be a different crowd to Critical Mass, but I&apos;m hoping that the more experienced London cyclists will provide escort for the day as tens of thousands converge on central London. So please do join me on the last Friday of the month if you can and if not, then look out for news of the day this September when cycling really does take over London.", "sentences": ["In fact the true meaning of the phrase &quot;critical mass&quot; is reaching that Amsterdam moment, when cycling becomes such a normal part of our life, work and leisure that drivers have to recognise the existence of the bike and cyclists can claim their fair share of the road."], "title": "A critical error", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/25/acriticalerror", "tags": ["Fitness", "Travel and transport", "London", "Transport policy", "Life and style", "Transport", "UK news", "Environment", "Court of appeal", "Critical mass"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-25T17:47:19Z", "article": "The Rolling Stones have waved goodbye, not to Ruby Tuesday, but Prince Rupert Loewenstein, their long standing business manager who rescued them from financial oblivion in the 1970s.

The Iron Lady&apos;s favourite composer is dearly loved in the British Isles - what would the Last Night of the Proms be without his Pomp and Circumstance March no 1 - but is sinking into oblivion elsewhere. Well, maybe not completely: there will always be cellists who cherish the depth of expression in his brilliant concerto, and audiences will always delight in his ability in capturing the personalities of unnamed friends in the Enigma Variations. But what people are missing out on is his position in the history of music: for all his association with a particular strain of English identity, he&apos;s not just a British composer - he&apos;s an international figure. Elgar was a key example of the trend at the start of the 20th century where countries on the rim of &quot;musical&quot; Europe suddenly produced unique and important composers of international significance: witness the flowering of such composers as Denmark&apos;s Carl Nielsen, Romania&apos;s George Enescu, Poland&apos;s Karol Szymanowski and Finland&apos;s Jean Sibelius. On the eve of Elgar&apos;s birthday, I find it ironic that I, a Finn, am called upon to defend him. Yes, I am a foreigner. And yes, I love Elgar&apos;s music, both performing it and listening to it. Why? Because to me, Elgar doesn&apos;t represent the fusty, quintessential Englishman as pictured on the outgoing \u00a320 banknote. Nor was he, as he is sometimes portrayed, a troubled genius hiding his uncertainty behind a melancholy grin in the shadow of his mighty moustache. Perhaps the very fact that we can still today debate what he really was about, while he still eludes us, is exactly why he does matter. In his lifetime Elgar was at pains to stress his humble origins in the West Midlands - he was born in a small village outside Worcester, the fourth of six children born to a piano tuner and his wife - and had to fight hard for recognition among the rich and powerful. He suffered from frequent and sometimes violent spells of self-doubt that cast their shadows on his work, yet he learned to be very shrewd in promoting his works and managing his public image. In this way, he was a link between the long-suffering Romantic artist and the rational modern composer. Having had no musical education, Elgar drew his early inspirations from the German late-Romantic idiom, from Wagner, Bruckner and Richard Strauss, complemented by the contradicting otherness of Brahms. Deep down, he was a symphonist rooted in this tradition, and under a subtle but noticeable influence from Debussy, the French master of colour, he developed a highly individual orchestration technique to communicate the essence of his musical thoughts. So unique was Elgar&apos;s gift for this science of orchestration that Hans Richter, the leading Viennese conductor, hailed him as &quot;a master of the orchestra&quot;. Indeed, Elgar&apos;s orchestrations breathe, reflect, ripple and quibble, transporting the music in majestic waves unlike anybody else&apos;s. He applied his technique as precisely as Richard Strauss, but also allowed himself to be carried away, to feel every colour and shade. Thus, he constantly renewed his style from work to work. So why has his work fallen into such disfavour abroad? I can&apos;t help but wonder if recordings of Elgar&apos;s music by the great British conductors have inadvertently led to this sad fate, whether Sargent&apos;s heavy sentimentality, Boult&apos;s stoic stodginess or Barbirolli&apos;s operatic fury were inappropriate starting points. I feel the greatest respect towards these musicians, but I believe that in letting their own personalities preside over Elgar&apos;s they did a disservice to his music. A very different picture emerges if you listen to Elgar&apos;s recordings of his own performances that the early era of the gramophone has blessed us with. It is often said that composers are never the best exponents of their own music. I would agree with that notion from a listener&apos;s perspective, but from a performer&apos;s viewpoint, it would be a mistake not to listen to Shostakovich&apos;s or Bartok&apos;s own piano playing, or to Stravinsky conducting his own works. These documents, however imperfect, give us clues to these composers&apos; way of being, living and breathing and offer invaluable insights into the priorities in their music-making. In Elgar&apos;s case, these documents are most revelatory because in every single case they present a unified image of his conducting: fleet and flowing, very focused on the overall musical line, subtle in colours, impulsive and elusive - not at all what emerges under other, later batons. I quite often hear British people say in an almost fatalistic tone: &quot;Elgar&apos;s music doesn&apos;t travel very well.&quot; Apart from the few obvious hits, such as the Enigma Variations and the Cello Concerto, Elgar&apos;s major works remain relatively obscure to central European, American and Japanese audiences. That is not dissimilar to how my countryman Sibelius&apos;s music was received two decades ago; but then Sibelius always had strong if small pockets of champions and supporters even in Germany and Austria, the two countries most hostile to his music, and now in the 21st century even seems to be turning the corner permanently. None of this for Elgar - he remains almost inexplicably ignored everywhere - a paradox for all those who would agree with my view that Elgar&apos;s sources of inspiration were solidly European. I believe the problems with Elgar&apos;s reception abroad lie partly in the view that Europeans, and to some extent Americans, have come to hold about the English, especially their upper classes. Somehow, in the eyes of these foreigners, the composer of Land of Hope and Glory has ended up as a representative of those classes, and so embodies all the cliches that they see as undesirable in the English: isolationism, dullness, that stiff upper lip and emotional constipation. What an extraordinarily ironic fate for this deeply romantic son of a piano-tuner. Those Britons who love and cherish their Elgar are very important, but what his music now needs are high-profile foreign champions and exponents, both among performers and scholars. I firmly believe that the only way for Elgar&apos;s music to survive internationally is to free it from the burdens of its past performance traditions. How about a biennial Elgar festival where most of the performers come from outside Britain? The idea might seem wacky, but the Sibelius festival of Helsinki did just that in the early 1960s. High-profile visitors such as the Berlin Philharmonic under Karajan, the BBC Symphony under Sargent, Sir Thomas Beecham, Serge Koussevitsky, Jascha Horenstein and many others came to Helsinki to perform Sibelius and, until 1957, paid their tributes to the ageing master at his home in Jarvenpaa. This tradition helped Sibelius into the international domain, and that is what Elgar now badly needs. In my time as music director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, we have taken Elgar&apos;s music all over Europe. For instance, we have performed the essentially Catholic oratorio The Dream of Gerontius in three predominantly Protestant European cities and have each time been met with the same amazement: standing ovations in reformist Amsterdam and Lutheran Helsinki; even predominantly atheist Berlin was appreciative. The recurring message has been: is Elgar really like this? In this way, the CBSO pays continuous tribute to the great composer who in 1920 conducted its inaugural concert. More British musicians and organisations should be proud of their own musical traditions and bold in promoting them. Only then can the musical present and future be built on firm foundations.  \u00b7 The CBSO play The Dream of Gerontius at Symphony Hall, Birmingham (0121 780 3333) on June 1", "sentences": ["For instance, we have performed the essentially Catholic oratorio The Dream of Gerontius in three predominantly Protestant European cities and have each time been met with the same amazement: standing ovations in reformist Amsterdam and Lutheran Helsinki; even predominantly atheist Berlin was appreciative."], "title": "Stand up for the maestro", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/25/classicalmusicandopera1", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Edward Elgar", "Sakari Oramo"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-25T23:01:19Z", "article": "Thirty-two years ago, my life ground to a halt. I was walking home after appearing on University Challenge when I saw a young man trying to start a car. I went over to help and he offered me a lift. He turned out to be fresh out of borstal that day, and was actually stealing the car. I can&apos;t remember any further than this, but apparently we crashed and he ran off, leaving me for dead. My mind has blocked out the memory of the accident, but the impact severed the connections between my brain and the back of my skull. The surgeons wanted to harvest my organs, because they were sure I wasn&apos;t going to pull through. I was in a coma for 13 weeks and my mum said she was preparing for me to be a vegetable, for having to take home a six-foot baby that she would need to wash and feed. But I was a fit young man of 20 and, over the months, the nerves in my brain slowly reattached themselves. I relearned how to walk and talk, but my short-term memory never recovered. Apparently, at first I would look at myself in the mirror for ages, trying to find who I was. I can remember everything up to 1975 with pin-sharp precision - but I have to ask Mum where the teabags are. I used to write down everything, to try to remember it, but then I realised that my whole life was on that piece of paper and I was too reliant on it. What if I lost it? Now I just write down any important appointments. Memories of the 80s and 90s are like lights in a dark night - the odd thing comes back, but it&apos;s hazy. My mind always returns to the 70s; I feel safe there. The music was amazing. I remember 14 of us hiring a Transit van and going to the Reading festival to see the Grateful Dead. It cost \u00a32 to get in. I grew my hair, put colourful inserts in my jeans to turn them into flares and wore tie-dyed T-shirts. My parents were shocked - long hair! - but they&apos;re good people, they have always supported me. My heyday was in 1975. A group of us hitchhiked to Amsterdam, experimented with LSD, met real hippies. I loved going to university - I wasn&apos;t very conscientious at all, but I enjoyed it. Students are a different breed now, up to their eyeballs in debt. I didn&apos;t have a worry in the world. I remember so clearly how I met my girlfriend, Marian. She was with a friend in the student union and we went to look at the pre-Raphaelites in the art gallery, and then we went back to mine to cook a meal. We had a drink and a smoke, and ended up spending the summer together. These memories are so vivid to me, so real. I do try to look forward in life, but I keep getting drawn back; it&apos;s my comfort zone. It&apos;s funny how 70s trends, such as clothes and records, have come in and gone out of fashion, but they&apos;ve never left me. I still like to wear flares and to keep my hair long. Marian came to visit me after the accident but we split up - my personality had changed, she said. I&apos;m sure she&apos;s right. I used to feel the need to tell people I&apos;d had a brain injury when I met them, always to explain straight away why I am the way I am. I have had relationships since, but none has lasted. A few years after the accident, the rehabilitation centre organised a job for me. It was in a factory, working with heavy machinery. The noise was deafening and the work monotonous - I felt as if I was in a Kafka novel. It drove me up the wall and I ended up having a nervous breakdown. Now I give talks to schools about road safety, and twice a week I help out at Headway, the brain injury association. At home I do the garden and housework for my parents. I love reading and doing crosswords - they keep my brain active. I always watch Countdown, too, and University Challenge is another programme I like. Jeremy Paxman isn&apos;t as good as Bamber Gascoigne, though. He was the true master. And, of course, there&apos;s my music. I still love to play my records - Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane. I have nearly 200 LPs and singles on vinyl. The few CDs I have are of 70s bands. Basically, I lost myself after the accident and I have been trying to find myself ever since. \u00b7 Do you have an experience to share?

For the next nine months there will be no cup finals, or at least none burdened by English hype and expectation. The disappointment of Liverpool&apos;s 2-1 defeat by Milan in Wednesday&apos;s Champions League final was only minimally tempered by the feeling that at least the game had been better than the FA Cup final between Chelsea and Manchester United four days earlier. Whatever happened, it could never have been that bad. Yet the match in Athens was always going to suffer in comparison with the melodramatics of Istanbul in 2005 when Liverpool came from 3-0 down at half-time to hold Milan at 3-3 and then beat them on penalties. Remakes seldom work. Someone has described the earlier meeting as the best European Cup final ever, which it emphatically was not. That distinction remains with Real Madrid&apos;s 7-3 defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt at Hampden Park in 1960 followed by Benfica&apos;s 5-3 victory over Real in Amsterdam two years later. Certainly for excitement and twists of plot the 2005 final eclipsed most of its predecessors since the European Cup became the Champions League. Arsenal&apos;s dogged reaction to having their goalkeeper, Jens Lehmann, sent off early in Paris last season, when they took the lead through Sol Campbell only for Barcelona to score twice late on, caught the imagination yet feelings of anticlimax persisted. This should have been the ultimate triumph of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s side but the chance was lost and the team has since gone into transition. Athens alone has seen better European finals than it did this week. Milan&apos;s fitful, slightly dog-eared performance against Liverpool paled beside their 4-0 demolition of Barcelona in 1994 and nothing on Wednesday equalled the rather pleasant shock, in 1983, of seeing an unfancied Hamburg team beat the Juventus of Dino Zoff, Claudio Gentile, Marco Tardelli, Paolo Rossi, Ziggy Boniek and Michel Platini, courtesy of a goal from Felix Magath. One myth which needs to be stifled is that the better team lost in the Olympic Stadium on Wednesday night. True, Liverpool gained command of the midfield and dominated large areas territorially while Milan remained penned in their own half and kept giving the ball away. But having established a platform Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s players got stage fright near goal and did not press home their attacks with conviction until they were two down with eight minutes to go. To be sure Liverpool were unlucky with the first of Filippo Inzaghi&apos;s two goals, Andrea Pirlo&apos;s free-kick taking a fortuitous deflection off the striker&apos;s arm as Inzaghi followed up for any rebound. However, their overall performance betrayed a lack of quality in crucial positions, not least in front of the net. Promising a close-season clear-out on the eve of a Champions League final might not boost a team&apos;s morale but at least Ben\u00edtez&apos;s need for new signings (backed by Liverpool&apos;s new American money) was proved by events in Athens. Ben\u00edtez is a painstaking football technocrat who weighs up opponents and leaves little to chance. Yet on the evidence so far he lacks the feel of Chelsea&apos;s Jose Mourinho for adapting a team to the fluctuating requirements of a big match. All right, Ben\u00edtez did bring on Dietmar Hamann after half-time in Istanbul to stop Kaka running the game but that was more about rectifying a mistake in team selection. In fact in Athens Ben\u00edtez did the reverse when he withdrew Javier Mascherano, who had severely limited Kaka&apos;s influence, in order to bring on Peter Crouch. Within four minutes the Brazilian had set up Inzaghi&apos;s second goal. Nevertheless Crouch should have come on and much earlier in the game, for it quickly became apparent that the ruse of moving Steven Gerrard up to support Dirk Kuyt was failing for the same reason that Paul Scholes has usually been less effective for Sir Alex Ferguson in an advanced role. Gerrard and Scholes like to have the play in front of them when they go forward because it gives them more options. Opponents, moreover, find it harder to pick them up. Ben\u00edtez&apos;s refusal to add Craig Bellamy&apos;s pace to the attack when the final was slipping away is a mystery. When Liverpool first won the European Cup,beating Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-1 in Rome in 1977, Bob Paisley kidded the opposition that John Toshack would be fit, although Tosh had no chance of playing. When the Welshman did not appear, the Germans&apos; game plan was thrown into disarray, Kevin Keegan took his marker, Berti Vogts, on walkabouts and the trophy came to Anfield.

It&apos;s not just the jet lag or late night networking that take their toll but hours in screening rooms with thousands of other international broadcasters, desperately hoping to stumble across a gem. The LA screenings, which kicked off last weekend with a Disney presentation in Hollywood followed by an Ugly Betty-themed party for 1,500 buyers, follow the previous week&apos;s &quot;upfronts&quot;, where the US networks showcase their autumn schedules. Watching everything from time-travelling reporters to vampire private investigators and computer nerds who accidentally download state secrets into their brains, UK broadcasters have to guess firstly whether they will succeed in the US and then whether their popularity will translate into UK ratings. Networks spend from $7m to $12m (\u00a33.5m to \u00a36m) on big budget pilots that increasingly resemble movies. Poker Lisa Opie, managing director of content at Five - home to CSI, House, Prison Break and others- said there was no single &quot;must have&quot; show but the standard across the board was high. The experience was &quot;a bit like poker ... when we all meet up in the bar, we tend to say we hate the things we love and love the things we hate. There are lots of geeks. And men seem to be the new women,&quot; she said, pointing to Big Shots, a drama centred on a high-flying group which she described as a &quot;male Desperate Housewives&quot;. But in an increasingly competitive landscape, prices are being pushed ever higher and it is becoming ever harder to sift the hits from the misses. With the BBC coping with a tougher than hoped for licence fee settlement and falling advertising revenues at Channel 4, ITV and Five, the pressure to make the right calls is more intense. The BBC is believed to have paid at least \u00a3400,000 an episode for exclusive rights to the second series of Heroes, about a group of ordinary people who discover they have special powers, before the first airs on BBC2 next month. The big US networks exhibit a herd-like mentality as they chase one another&apos;s hits, but executives said there were fewer defining trends this year. ER led to a spate of medical dramas while procedural cop shows such as CSI spawned a host of imitators. The popularity of Lost gave rise to a slew of &quot;high concept&quot; dramas, which start with a big idea that can take several series to resolve. Prophet This year, lawyers and private investigators abound. In Eli Stone, Trainspotting star Johnny Lee Miller plays a lawyer who believes he might be a prophet. The pilot stars George Michael, who may also appear in future episodes. Dirty Sexy Money stars Donald Sutherland and William Baldwin and features a lawyer drawn into a dark family drama among rich New Yorkers. Tom Toumazis, managing director of Buena Vista International Television Europe, said it was &quot;a modern take on Dallas or Dynasty&quot;, while he also has high hopes for Reaper, which he described as &quot;Buffy meets Ghostbusters&quot;. NBC, which produces House, had high hopes for a new remake of 1970s hit The Bionic Woman and for Lipstick Jungle, a series based on books by Sex and the City author Candace Bushnell. Other hotly tipped shows included Pushing Up Daisies, which starts Anna Friel and features a man who can bring the dead back to life but hits trouble when he resurrects his childhood sweetheart, and Gossip Girl, a drama about rich New York teens, overseen by Josh Schwartz, creator of The OC. US networks have been struggling to resurrect mainstream comedy. Since the golden period of Friends, Frasier and Seinfeld, few have become big hits. Ms Opie has picked up Californication for Five, a comedy drama starring David Duchovny as a troubled novelist &quot;whose honesty and self-destructive behaviour are destroying and enriching his career&quot;. British broadcasters will also keep a close eye on Back to You, a more traditional sitcom that stars Frasier&apos;s Kelsey Grammer as a bitter TV news anchor. Reflecting the vogue for British ideas and talent in LA, some of the new prime time offerings will be based on homegrown shows, including a US version of Channel 4 sitcom The IT Crowd. Whereas US imports used to be a cost-effective way of filling the schedules, they can now cost more than home produced dramas. Bidding has reached astronomical levels for hits like Desperate Housewives and Lost, which Sky One paid close to \u00a31m an episode to poach from Channel 4. Networks have recognised successful imports also drive digital channels and internet services. Predicting hits is made even more difficult by the cut-throat US market. Studio 60, a drama from West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin that goes behind the scenes in the TV industry, looked a winner when Channel 4 bought it last year. But by the time it makes it to air, it is likely to have been cancelled in the US after disappointing ratings and reviews. ITV last year bought Six Degrees, a drama about a mysteriously linked set of characters by Lost creator JJ Abrams, but it was yanked off air halfway through a disappointing run. Networks push quirky fantasies to hook the geeks Fantasy&apos;s in, comedy&apos;s out. That was the message last week, when the US networks announced their autumn schedules. Even though the previous season saw every network try and fail to manufacture their own 24, this year they were all pushing quirky fantasies intended to hook the geeks who flocked to NBC&apos;s hit, Heroes. Amid the morass of teen Grim Reapers (CW&apos;s Reaper), computer-brained slacker masterspies (NBC&apos;s Chuck), vampire cops (CBS&apos;s Moonlight), immortal cops (Fox&apos;s New Amsterdam) and do-gooding time travellers (NBC&apos;s Journeyman), the consensus points to three shows attracting at least initial interest. NBC&apos;s Bionic Woman reboot starring Michelle Ryan and Fox&apos;s sort-of Terminator prequel Sarah Connor Chronicles with Lena Headey both benefit from being brand names with built-in followings but, with their joint mixtures of tough chicks and robotics, also run the risk of cancelling each other out. ABC&apos;s Pushing Daisies - about a magical baker who can briefly raise the dead with a touch of his finger - has accrued ecstatic advance word. Science fiction aficionados aside, the most hotly pursued audience is women, specifically women who still mourn the loss of Sex &amp; The City and crave further doses of Grey&apos;s Anatomy. For the former, there&apos;s NBC&apos;s Candace Bushnell-created Lipstick Jungle and ABC&apos;s Darren Star-penned Cashmere Mafia which aren&apos;t in any way the same show. For Grey&apos;s addicts, there&apos;s the spin-off Private Practice, which follows Dr Addison to a new life of sexual embarrassment in Los Angeles. Private Practice is the closest thing this season has to a guaranteed hit but it wasn&apos;t the show that elicited the most heated response. That would be Cavemen, a sitcom based on a popular car insurance commercial that places cave dwellers in contemporary settings. While betting men predict cancellation before the first commercial break, don&apos;t be surprised, if next year, fantasy&apos;s out and prehistoric is in.

I think something untoward is going on. What do you think? CC, Surrey The reply from &quot;Nicole Ott&quot; at a-cecco (presumably meant to look like the real employment agency, Adecco) at first appears to be a standard phishing scam, designed to separate your niece from her money by offering her a non-existent commission for collecting non-existent invoices - but only after she has sent them money. But this is not random, as Nicole seems to know what sort of job your niece is looking for. This is a targeted approach known as &quot;spear phishing&quot;. So where do the scammers get the details from? Monster is categoric that its own systems are scam-proof. And as she sent it from a very secure computer, it is unlikely that her message was compromised. The weakness in the Monster system is that CVs are sent to prospective employers. And it would be easy for a fraudster to pose as a possible future boss. Delete this. Court blunder led to mortgage refusal My mortgage application was turned down because I had a county court judgment against me for \u00a31,674. It was sent to a previous address and I knew nothing about it. I discovered that it related to a motor claim which Norwich Union should have paid. Why did this happen? LT, Southampton It should not have happened. Norwich Union should have settled on your behalf after a complicated crash involving six cars, soon after the accident in August 2004, but it failed to do so. Unsurprisingly, the injured party sued you, but at the address you had at the time of the accident. Norwich Union did eventually pay but the third party&apos;s solicitor failed to ensure the court record was updated, and NU did not check. NU admits this should have been handled better but it probably became confused. It will write to you to apologise, contact Experian over the CCJ, and send you a certificate of satisfaction to show the bill has been paid. And it will send you \u00a3150 as a goodwill gesture. Coach firm to review rules after bike ban I was banned from the Eurolines coach from London to Amsterdam due to my folding bike, even though it was wrapped securely in a special case. I had taken it twice before on this route without trouble. But the driver quoted a &quot;no cycles&quot; rule, despite my telling him that due to arthritis, I cannot walk far.  MA, Worcestershire  Capital Letters argued that trains and planes have special rules for folding bikes, that there was space for it, and because you have travelled this way before without hassles, you could not have expected to be thrown off. And Eurolines, part of National Express, listened. It will review its rules and should soon allow folding bikes in secure packing. It will write to apologise. And it will return your fare money, plus all the other costs incurred in your fruitless trip as well as sending you a free return ticket to Amsterdam. Payments refunded for mis-sold insurance  I took out a \u00a32,000 loan with Halifax in October 2003. I declined unemployment and sickness cover as I knew I would soon be self-employed and unable to claim. But Halifax still added the policy, costing \u00a3552 in total. This has added around 25% to each payment, making my finances shakier than they should have been. Can you get my money back? FB, Essex Halifax claimed you agreed to the policy. You say you signed to say the policy had been explained to you (by a trainee bank worker), then rejected it. In any case, the bank should not have attempted to sell such a policy to you as you could not have claimed under many of its features. Halifax now accepts &quot;there is reason to question if the policy was fully explained to you&quot;. It will refund your payments plus interest, so you will be around \u00a3550 better off - enough to pay off the loan in full and save on the last four months of interest. &apos;Unfair&apos; terms left endowment borrower in the dark We took out a \u00a340,000 endowment with Royal &amp; Sun Alliance in 1986. Ten years later, we borrowed \u00a34,569 against the policy. We heard no more, though R&amp;SA claims it wrote to us in June 1996 to say the loan was &quot;capitalised&quot;, whatever that means.  This February, we asked Phoenix (which had taken the policy over) for a surrender value. It is worth \u00a318,850, but the loan plus interest had soared to \u00a316,692 and was growing far faster than the policy. Is there anything we can do? JS, Sussex  You were not mis-sold this. You asked for it at a time of financial difficulty. But your policy loan - an old-style endowment feature - was hardly cheap with a minimum 12.5% interest rate. Worse, once you were in arrears, (and this happened early on) the insurer stopped collecting payments and allowed the interest to roll up. Worse still, once it did this, its small print allowed it to stop sending statements. You were unaware of your debt or how your \u00a360 a month payments plus any growth were less than the mounting interest. Capital Letters argued these terms were unfair as you were left in the dark and unable to look at options - a view that the ombudsman would be likely to accept. Phoenix concedes that &quot;had you received regular statements, you might have repaid the loan or taken out one elsewhere at a lower rate&quot;. It will now recalculate the interest based on the contractual rate for the first five years and 5.22% (the average base rate) for the subsequent six years. This will reduce your debt to \u00a38,855, leaving you some \u00a38,000 better off.", "sentences": ["Coach firm to review rules after bike ban I was banned from the Eurolines coach from London to Amsterdam due to my folding bike, even though it was wrapped securely in a special case.", "And it will return your fare money, plus all the other costs incurred in your fruitless trip as well as sending you a free return ticket to Amsterdam."], "title": "Capital letters: 'Job offer' was a spear phishing scam | Court blunder led to mortgage refusal | Coach firm to review rules after bike ban | Payments refunded for mis-sold insurance | 'Unfair' terms left endowment borrower in the dark", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/may/26/moneysupplement2", "tags": ["Money"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-26T23:56:17Z", "article": "Gordon Brown has personally intervened in the search for missing four-year-old Madeleine McCann after her parents became frustrated by the lack of progress in the police investigation. After a series of telephone conversations with Madeleine&apos;s father, Gerry McCann in recent days, the Chancellor requested assistance from the Foreign Office and the Home Office. He asked that pressure be brought to bear on the Portuguese authorities to allow more information about the inquiry to be made public. Gerry and his wife, Kate, have been desperate for a description of a man seen carrying what appears to have been a child on 3 May to be made public, but Portuguese police refused for three weeks because of the country&apos;s laws, which forbid the details of an investigation being released. The Observer understands that Brown gave the McCanns an assurance he would do &apos;anything he can&apos; to help. The British embassy duly applied pressure on the Portuguese authorities to find more flexibility in their secrecy laws. British ambassador John Buck visited the Algarve last Thursday. A day later Portuguese police made a U-turn and issued a detailed description of the man, said to be white, 35 to 40, 5ft 10in and of medium build, with hair longer around the neck, wearing a dark jacket, light beige trousers and dark shoes. Asked whether Brown had influenced the decision, Clarence Mitchell, a Foreign Office spokesman for the McCann family in the Algarve, said: &apos;Draw your own conclusions.&apos; He said in a statement: &apos;I can confirm that telephone conversations have taken place between Gerry McCann and Chancellor Gordon Brown. During them, Mr Brown offered both Gerry and Kate his full support in their efforts to find Madeleine, although details of the conversations will remain private.&apos; Although they have praised the efforts being made to find their daughter, the McCanns were said to be increasingly frustrated in recent days at delays and communication problems. The family have met lawyers in the Algarve and threatened legal action to push for the information to be released because of the exceptional circumstances. The Observer can confirm that a top law firm in London had been asked late last week to seek legal avenues through which the McCanns could be kept up to date on the latest developments in the investigations. It also emerged yesterday that The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall had been following the case &apos;closely and with deep concern&apos;. The McCanns yesterday emerged from their apartment to say that they had had an &apos;amicable and very constructive&apos; meeting with police. &apos;We very much welcome the decision of the police authorities to release details of a man seen by witnesses here in Praia da Luz on Thursday, 3 May, the night of Madeleine&apos;s disappearance,&apos; Gerry said in a statement. &apos;The release of this important information followed an earlier meeting we had with senior police officers. We feel sure that this sighting of a man with what appeared to be a child in his arms is both significant and relevant to Madeleine&apos;s abduction.&apos; It emerged that the couple plan to widen their search across Europe. The McCanns are expected to visit Seville and Madrid before moving on to Berlin and Amsterdam. A source said that the reasoning behind the visits is that, &apos;after Britons, Spanish, Germans and the Dutch are the most frequent visitors to the Algarve&apos;, and the most likely to have seen something suspicious. The campaign fund is now well over \u00a3300,000, according to Mitchell. He stressed that the McCanns &apos;never asked for a single euro&apos;. In a new interview yesterday the McCanns spoke about their feelings since the night they left their three children asleep in a holiday complex apartment while they dined with friends in the complex&apos;s grounds, returning to find Madeleine had been abducted, and their refusal to give up hope of welcoming her back with &apos;a very big hug&apos;. Asked if she forgets for even one second that her daughter is missing, Kate said: &apos;Madeleine is such a huge personality it is obvious when she is not there.&apos; Gerry, wearing yellow and green ribbons on his wrist to accompany those his wife has tied to her hair for more than three weeks, said: &apos;My waking thought is that the phone by the bedside has not rung. And that means Madeleine has not been found.&apos; Kate added: &apos;I am better in the morning, it seems like a fresh start. Evenings are harder. &apos; The McCanns are drawing strength from their twins, two-year-old Sean and Amelie. Kate said: &apos;The twins are so young they just get on with things, but obviously we don&apos;t want them to forget about Madeleine. We are hoping to see a child psychologist to explain what has happened to Madeleine to the twins.&apos; She added: &apos;They help us to get through this. We are a strong family and they were so close to Madeleine, only 20 months apart.&apos; Gerry said: &apos;We could have lost the twins too. There were three children in the room. That&apos;s the worst nightmare... This is so rare. It&apos;s a million to one. We really have to make sure it doesn&apos;t affect the twins growing up and their normal childhood. &apos;This is not a time for grieving. We believe she is still alive, so grief is not the appropriate emotion. We are absolutely determined to get her back. It&apos;s a bit like we are waging a war. It&apos;s a backs-to-the-wall thing.&apos; His eyes welled up with tears when asked the first thing he would do if Madeleine returned home. &apos;I think we will be having a very big hug. Hope, strength and courage are our motto. There is nothing more I would like than to see Madeleine walk in, so we could use the fund to help find other missing children.&apos;", "sentences": ["The McCanns are expected to visit Seville and Madrid before moving on to Berlin and Amsterdam."], "title": "Madeleine: Brown urged police to give more details", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/27/ukcrime.gordonbrown", "tags": ["UK news", "Politics", "Crime", "Gordon Brown", "Labour", "Madeleine McCann"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-27T11:17:45Z", "article": "I lay down to test the mattress: it was lumpy and totally unyielding, not the sort of place one would want to spend much time, which seemed a little odd, given the purpose of this room. Agnes Munyiva saw my wince, laughed and patted the bed. &apos;You need it to be hard, because otherwise you could get hurt when the men are pushing on you,&apos; she explained. The mattress, stuffed with lumpy cotton and resting on a plain metal frame, fills most of her room, just one metre by two. The walls are made of mud, the roof of scraps of tin. The air has a tang from the raw sewage and rotting food scraps in the alley outside, and Agnes tries to keep the clouds of flies at bay with a crisp white muslin curtain in the doorway. Remnants of linoleum, pieced together like a quilt, cover most of the dirt floor. She has a kerosene burner for making tea and a gas lantern. Two mouldy calendars, giveaways from insurance companies many years back, are tacked to the walls, the only decoration. A collection of worn facecloths hangs drying on a small clothesline. Beside the bed she keeps a large white box, containing the best part of a gross of condoms. Agnes rents this room for 900 Kenyan shillings (\u00a36) a month, bed included. She doesn&apos;t live here - she also rents another room, a bit bigger than this one, on the other side of Majengo, a slum neighbourhood on the edge of Nairobi. She shares that room with the three youngest of her five children. They have never seen this one. This room is just for work. Agnes arrives here around six o&apos;clock each morning, when the sun is climbing in the sky, and she makes sure she is on the way home before the sun sinks again 12 hours later - she is a lady of the evening who works only in the daylight hours. There is plenty of rape and theft and murder in Majengo in the daytime, but at night the streets are completely lawless. When Agnes arrives in the morning, she sweeps the patch of floor and the narrow alley outside. She makes a cup of tea, sips it from a battered tin mug, stacks the cloths by the bed. Then she takes a low three-legged wooden stool into the alley, sits down and waits for business. &apos;Karibu,&apos; she says as men pass - Kiswahili for welcome. She gives them a wink and her slow smile that unfurls like honey off a spoon. &apos;We all try our luck each time a person passes,&apos; she explained. &apos;If he stops to look at me maybe he is interested, but if not, maybe he is used to someone else.&apos; In front of every third or fourth shack in the streets a woman sits on a stool, modestly dressed like Agnes, who wore a bright wrap printed with blue and yellow chickens on the day she introduced me to a working woman&apos;s life in Majengo. Most days a man stops before she has been in the alley for half an hour. &apos;They are people on their way to work. Or men on the road who spent the night away from their wives - they pass here for breakfast.&apos; When a man stops at Agnes&apos;s soft &apos;Karibu&apos;, she invites him to step into her room. &apos;Most men are discreet - the ones with wives want to get in the door very quickly.&apos; Inside, they negotiate. The price is set at between 50 and 100 shillings - 37p to 75p. She slides the door closed, but the scratchy sounds of a neighbour&apos;s transistor radio drift through the screened window; her customer knows he must be silent. &apos;We even tell them not to make a lot of noise,&apos; Agnes said, sounding very prim, &apos;because there could be a family in the next house.&apos; She removes her wrap, lies back on the bed, her arms above her head. She does not embrace the client, whispers no encouragement. This is a brisk transaction. &apos;If your five minutes are over and you are still there,&apos; she pointed at her chest, &apos;you have to pay another 50 shillings,&apos; she said firmly. Business concluded, her client steps over the curious chickens in the doorway and back out into the alley, and Agnes cleans up with the cloths and a pitcher of water from the standpipe at the end of the alley. Then she returns to the stool. This interaction is repeated a dozen times each day. A fair portion of the men who stop have spent time with Agnes before. &apos;The service must have been good, so they come back,&apos; she told me with a giggle. At the end of the day, she padlocks the door and takes home perhaps 500 shillings, enough for some food bought at the market stalls on the way, and a bit put aside for the next instalment of the children&apos;s school fees, or some kerosene or soap. Agnes came to Nairobi from Machakos, two hours to the east by bus, in 1971. She was 20 years old. There was only the exhausting work of farming at home, and she hoped to find a job in the city. Before long she was hired as a maid in a middle-class house. That lasted a year, and then she found more work mending clothes, and then casual labour in the industrial area on the edge of the booming city. That led to a job making paper bags in a factory - but she injured a finger in the machinery after a couple of years and was fired. By then she had had three small children, fathered by a couple of boyfriends who hadn&apos;t stuck around. Her mother had died back home, her father was unwell, and she felt there was no one in Machakos to whom she could turn. Agnes had only one room, then, in Majengo, the sort of chaotic community at the edge of the city where so many of Africa&apos;s rural poor end up. Majengo is built around a vast market for mitumba - second-hand clothes given by North Americans and Europeans to charity shops that end up shipped to Africa in giant bales. Traders from all over east Africa come to hunt for bargains in First World cast-offs. The market also sells everything from plastic washbasins to jerry-rigged, scrap-metal satellite dishes. There are food stalls and tearooms and hostels for the travellers. Thousands of people move through here every day, many with a little disposable income suddenly in their pocket: like similar communities the world over, it is a natural centre for sex work. In addition to the travellers from out of town, men from all over Nairobi - police officers, civil servants, welders, street sweepers, teachers and taxi drivers - seek out the anonymity of the vast market for their occasional sexual encounters. When Agnes was despairing about how to make money, how she would survive in the city, her neighbours suggested she try umalaya, sex for money. &apos;In the neighbourhood there were other women who were doing it, and they encouraged me to try it. I had children who needed food.&apos; And so, with great reluctance, she began to sit on a wooden stool outside her home and try to catch the eye of men who passed by. She never imagined, in those first few weeks, that she would be earning a living this way 30 years later. Today, thousands of women work in the alleys of Majengo and the other sprawling slums of Nairobi, but only one or two of Agnes&apos;s friends from her first days in the business are still around. &apos;The ones I started with are no longer here - they have died,&apos; she said simply. &apos;Most of the people I have worked with have died.&apos; Beginning in the early Eighties, women started to get thin, with sharp coughs and white fur that coated their mouths and throats; back then they called the illness Plastic, Agnes said, because city workers hastily wrapped up the bodies of people who died that way in plastic sheeting. Some of the women died there in Majengo, and others went back to the village when they grew too sick to work. But Agnes remained healthy, year after year. What happened to her - or, more accurately, what didn&apos;t happen to her - would prove to be one of the greatest discoveries in the 25-year battle with Aids. She would acquire, over the next two decades, a certain fame, in the world of virology and infectious disease, as one of those Nairobi prostitutes. But Agnes&apos;s body would be slower to give up its secrets than anyone imagined. This story starts with chancroid, a venereal disease that causes suppurating ulcers on the genitals. On the other side of the world from Nairobi, in the Canadian prairie city of Winnipeg, there was an outbreak of chancroid in the late Seventies, and infectious-disease experts at the University of Manitoba began to investigate. Before long they had figured out how to grow the bacteria in the lab, but the outbreak had quickly been brought under control by public health officials, and the researchers were left without patients. That might have been the end of it, had a Winnipeg microbiologist not got talking to a colleague from the University of Nairobi at a conference a few months later. &apos;You want chancroid?&apos; the Kenyan asked. &apos;We&apos;ve got chancroid.&apos; And so Allan Ronald flew to Nairobi in 1980. He soon noticed that sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea were rampant. He also noticed that most of the people seeking help at government clinics for these infections had in common the fact that they frequented prostitutes in an industrial slum. He and a couple of colleagues set up a shop-front clinic in Nairobi, offering free treatment to anyone in return for participation in medical research. Before long the operation expanded into slums around the city. They were candy-store settings for young western researchers, with more weird microbes coming through the door in a single morning than they might see in a year back home. And their patients were more than happy to participate, in exchange for the top-notch health care they could never have afforded to purchase in Nairobi. &apos;Here we got treatment if we were diagnosed - the city clinic never had any drugs,&apos; said Agnes, who first attended a clinic in 1983 and soon became a regular. And, she said, she and the other women felt less judged in the research clinic; no one gossiped about the way they earned their living. In those first few years, the Manitobans and colleagues from other universities in the west who joined them did some important research on sexually transmitted diseases, and the impact on children whose mothers were infected with gonorrhoea or chlamydia. But the discovery that would rock the scientific world came from the whim of a graduate student. In 1985, Joan Kreiss, a student researcher from the University of Washington, decided to test the sex workers, including Agnes, for HIV. The virus had been identified in New York four years earlier, and Kreiss wanted to use the new test for antibodies to HIV. Her older colleagues were dubious. They suspected, from post-mortems on patients who had symptoms similar to those being reported in New York, that HIV was present in Nairobi - and years later, tests of stored blood from east Africa would show that, in fact, some communities in the region at that point had infection rates as high as 20 per cent. But there was not a single documented case of Aids in Kenya at the time, and many scientists were doubtful that women could even catch the disease through sex. So no one was prepared for what Kreiss found. Two-thirds of the women she tested were HIV-positive. Her findings - one of the earliest recorded signs of the African epidemic - did not go down well. The government of Kenya threatened to deport the foreign researchers and shut the whole project down. &apos;The government said, &quot;It&apos;s not true what you are saying! You&apos;re going to drive the tourists out of Kenya!&quot;&apos; recalled a rueful Elizabeth Ngugi, a community health professor at the University of Nairobi. She was working (&apos;in the mud and in the sun and in the rain and in the dust&apos;) to get to know Agnes and the Majengo women, building relationships that would be the core of research through the decades. She soon organised 600 women into support groups, brought them into the clinic for classes on sexually transmitted diseases, gave them condoms and encouraged them to present a united front to clients, insisting on protected sex. Over the next few years, research involving the women yielded two big discoveries. The first was that mothers passed HIV to their babies in breast milk. Researchers already knew there was some transmission of the virus this way, but a study in the slum showed that the longer a mother breastfed, the higher was the risk of transmission - and that far from being negligible, this was in fact a major source of infection. The second major finding was that a person with a conventional STI, such as gonorrhoea, has a much higher chance of contracting HIV - as much as 70 per cent higher - than a person not infected. All of this, however, paled beside a discovery that emerged in the late Eighties. Frank Plummer, now the director of Canada&apos;s Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, in Ottawa, worked in the Nairobi project from its early days. He was intrigued by these HIV-positive women, who gave the lie to so much of the predominant thinking about Aids at the time - that it didn&apos;t exist in Africa, that women couldn&apos;t get it, that heterosexual sex was no real risk. By 1988, he had noticed something bizarre: over time, more and more of the women were testing positive for HIV - but not all of them. Some, including Agnes, were still around, three and four and five years later, and in their biannual HIV tests they were still negative. Plummer began to track them closely, and concluded that a small number of the women - perhaps five per cent - were simply not getting infected. &apos;They&apos;re basically immune to HIV,&apos; he told me. &apos;Their immune systems for whatever reason are able to recognise and kill HIV.&apos; In the study of a particularly impenetrable virus, this was a massive discovery. Keith Fowke, a professor of medical microbiology at the University of Manitoba, who was then a student working under Frank Plummer in Nairobi, explained it like this. &apos;We did the models and found that these women were not just really, really, really lucky - it was beyond the statistical chance of luck playing a role. We estimated that many of these women have had 500 to 2,000 sexual exposures to infected men when they weren&apos;t using a condom.&apos; Surveys found that a quarter of the men who frequented sex workers in the area were HIV-positive. And while Ngugi&apos;s shack-to-shack education efforts had early success getting Agnes and the other women to use condoms with some of their one-off clients, there were still many exceptions: men would pay extra not to use condoms - money that women hard-up for cash were reluctant to forgo - and sex workers didn&apos;t use them with their &apos;regulars&apos;, men they saw every week or two. Ngugi&apos;s surveys found that the women used condoms, at best, only 75 per cent of the time, so there could be no question that Agnes and a handful of others had been routinely exposed to HIV over a decade or more. Yet they weren&apos;t infected. It wasn&apos;t good nutrition - the women did not earn enough to eat well - and it wasn&apos;t that they somehow took better care of themselves, because they had had other STIs and ailments. Something else was happening to make these women immune. Then Plummer and his team noticed something even more peculiar. The women&apos;s likelihood of being infected with HIV/Aids was related to the length of time they had been doing sex work: the longer a woman had been selling sex in Majengo, the less likely she was to be infected. If she&apos;d been doing it for five years and was still HIV-negative, the data suggested, then the odds were she was going to stay that way. These findings were so counterintuitive that Plummer and his team struggled to find anyone who would publish them. The phenomenon didn&apos;t get major attention until two years later, when he described the resistant women at the International Aids Conference in Amsterdam in 1992. Once the public really began to understand that there were people who were immune to Aids - and the dark irony that it was the sex workers vilified for spreading the disease - Majengo became a focus of attention. Television news teams poured into the slum, clamouring to meet the women. The attention left Agnes baffled. &apos;I just thank God,&apos; she said then, as she does now. She couldn&apos;t explain why she wasn&apos;t sick. She could just give thanks for it at Mass every Sunday morning. The researchers, however, were frantically trying to decode what was going on in the bodies of Agnes and the other women. &apos;Either the virus couldn&apos;t infect their cells at all or the virus could but their bodies were clearing the infection in some way,&apos; explained Fowke. &apos;But when we isolated the blood cells of some women in the lab and exposed their cells to HIV, it could get inside their cells and was able to replicate and able to grow just fine. So we started looking at their immune system - HIV was able to establish initial infection and the immune system was able to clear it,&apos; Fowke said. &apos;We&apos;ve really found cells that can kill HIV in these women.&apos; Agnes has, in effect, a callus: the first time she was exposed to the virus, her body produced enough killer T cells to fight it off. This part isn&apos;t unique - the body of every person who is exposed to HIV mounts some level of response, and sometimes manages to fight it off; a single exposure does not guarantee infection. But Agnes&apos;s body, it seems, not only produced sufficient and strong enough cells to fight the virus off the first time, it then produced a whole raft of those killer Ts, flooding her system with guardians whose sole brief was to keep an eye out for cells infected with HIV. The infected cells have a distinct pattern of little bumps on them, called epitopes, which act like a red rose in the lapel as far as the killer Ts are concerned, letting them know just which cells they want to hunt down. Then every subsequent time - probably thousands of times - that HIV got into Agnes&apos;s body, her killer T cells drove it back. A person does not normally maintain a large number of killer T cells for a long period - just long enough to kill something off, then production drops. But in Agnes, fairly constant exposure to HIV kept her killer T cell count high. This conclusion was reinforced when Plummer and his team noticed that women who take a &apos;sex break&apos; - who make a trip home to the village for a few weeks, or save up a little money and leave sex work for a while to try selling shoes instead, or hook up with a regular who keeps them in cash for a year or two - were far more likely to get infected, almost immediately, if they returned to sex work, even though previously they had had years of apparent immunity. On the break, their bodies stopped making the killer T cells, leaving them vulnerable again. The Nairobi women aren&apos;t the only people in the world immune to HIV. Some Caucasian men have been found to have a genetic mutation that means their cells lack one of the molecular &apos;hooks&apos; that HIV latches on to, and so they cannot be infected. And no doubt there are other groups of people who, like these women, are able to kill off the virus - but it is much easier to see, and monitor, in this community of women who are repeatedly exposed to the virus than it would be in, say, a group of nuns in a convent in Europe. They might be immune to HIV, too, but how would anyone ever tell? From the moment it became clear that Agnes and a handful of other women in Majengo - about 100 to date - really could fight off the virus, the researchers in Nairobi hoped that their biology would hold the secret of an HIV vaccine. Soon a team from Oxford University was at work on a vaccine that used the epitopes (the tell-tale bumps on infected cells) that triggered Agnes&apos;s killer Ts. They hoped it would provoke other people&apos;s bodies to produce killer T cells in the same way that the real virus appeared to trigger production in the sex workers. Trials began in Nairobi in 2001, and a second trial was mounted by Pontiano Kaleebu and his colleagues in Entebbe a couple of years later. But despite high hopes, the Oxford vaccine didn&apos;t cause that explosion of killer T cells. And so it was back to the painstaking work of trying to figure out the secret of Agnes&apos;s immunity. &apos;Sometimes a vaccine feels impossibly far away,&apos; sighed Keith Fowke. &apos;All our knowledge about these HIV-resistant people is interesting and I feel it&apos;s important... but it is frustrating.&apos; For Ngugi, watching as Aids decimates ever more of this community where she has built such strong ties, the gains are hollow. &apos;Yes, it&apos;s fascinating,&apos; she told me. &apos;But sometimes I feel very sad. Sometimes you are not a scientist but a friend, and you feel the emptiness inside.&apos; There was a certain sense of breath-holding among the Nairobi researchers when Plummer and his team first proved the women&apos;s bodies were able to kill off HIV, but that breath has long since been let out. Today, the research strategy in Majengo revolves around intense study of Agnes and the other resistant women (who make up about five per cent of the cohort at any one time), from analysing their genome to breaking down the chemical components of the mucosal membranes in their vaginas, in an effort to figure out what may be protecting them. So far researchers have not found anything present in 100 per cent of the women, so it may be that the protection comes from multiple overlapping factors, including some that are genetic. There is a strong family correlation - people related to an HIV-resistant woman seem to be half as likely to get infected as people who are not related. Agnes is aware that she is a fascinating specimen. &apos;Most of the people have been very interested in me,&apos; she said matter-of-factly. But she has no understanding of the biological basis for her HIV resistance. &apos;No one has told me,&apos; she said with a shrug. She gets good, free health care at the clinic for the occasional sexually transmitted infection and also for respiratory infections which plague residents of the polluted slum. So she is happy to give them her blood a couple of times a year, and to enjoy a sense of contributing something to her community. But Agnes&apos;s survival has served to highlight a disquieting aspect of this research. She has come to the clinic for more than 20 years. In that time, more than $22m in scientific grant money has flowed through the project, and many of the researchers have earned reputations as the top experts in their fields. Yet Agnes and a handful of other women are still selling sex, to an average of eight clients a day, still for a dollar or two each time - although they say they would like nothing more than to get out of sex work. When I asked her what she would like to do instead, Agnes&apos;s broad face lit up. &apos;Any kind of job I could do. I could be a cleaner or anything. But it&apos;s very difficult to get a job - you have to know somebody to get a job.&apos; And Agnes said she doesn&apos;t know anybody who could help. With only limited literacy after three years of primary school, and no other skills, Agnes said she sees no other options. &apos;It&apos;s embarrassing, this profession,&apos; she said. She refuses to discuss what she does for a living with her children, although she is sure they know. &apos;I&apos;ve never told them what I do, but I think they can see it. I think they know what I&apos;m doing is not good but they know I do it to provide for them.&apos; Agnes&apos;s frustration with her life in sex work raises troubling ethical questions about research, the kind that bedevil investigations into Aids vaccines, prevention technologies and treatment, all of which, by definition, involve large groups of poor Africans, the people most at risk. What obligation does a researcher such as Plummer have to the women who have given him their blood for 20 years? What does this project owe Agnes? &apos;Those are difficult questions,&apos; Plummer told me. &apos;My philosophy has been: try to help as many people as we can with what resources we have so we can ultimately solve it. We provide treatment for a lot of medical conditions and counselling for safer sexual behaviour and free condoms and referral to other medical services - which prevents about 10,000 infections each year. We do have an obligation to provide some basic level of care, and since 2004 we have provided anti-retroviral treatment [ARV], which is an important step. But ARV drugs are not going to solve this problem.&apos; Plummer doesn&apos;t disagree that women like Agnes need a route out of prostitution. &apos;I don&apos;t know what those ways out are, though, and anything we could do is just working on the margins - it&apos;s unlikely we&apos;ll be able to do anything to get them to the point that they&apos;re not partially dependent on sex work: you can only make so much money selling tomatoes or weaving baskets.&apos; His Kenyan colleague Elizabeth Ngugi is unconvinced by this line of argument. &apos;These women have given the world such a huge body of knowledge, but what has the world done to help them change? The research findings have given us so much, but what have we given back? There is more research money coming all the time - quite clearly there is an imbalance.&apos; In 2002, she received funds from a donor agency to train 120 of the women in new skills such as dressmaking and hairdressing, and she said 80 of them successfully made the transition out of sex work. She has helped a few others make their way to local benevolent agencies and out of the business, but most are stuck, and the research budget includes no funds to give them other options - a grim irony when, as she pointed out, they&apos;ve educated all the women about what a huge risk sex work is to their lives. Plummer agreed that the women need basic education in numeracy and savings and small-business skills. &apos;But you can&apos;t get a research grant for that,&apos; he said. The ethics of science today require that the women get counselling and condoms, but ethics approval boards make no demands about maths classes or instruction in how to set up an alleyway beauty salon. There is a small patch of grey at Agnes&apos;s hairline these days, and her body has thickened to that of a woman of a certain age. &apos;I&apos;m getting old,&apos; she said. &apos;There will be a time that I&apos;m too old - at around 60. Maybe 10 years from now clients will not even look for me. It will be difficult.&apos; Now she feels lucky to get 100 shillings from a client, when a young woman newly arrived in Majengo might get as much as 300 - although in any case, trade is not what it once was. &apos;Ever since we got this disease, business has dropped. Most men go home to their wives on the weekend.&apos; Of the men who still buy sex (and she manages to find nine or 10 each day), most now agree to use condoms - but not all, and Agnes worries. She would like to start a small business that would keep her family when men no longer stop outside her room, but she used all the few thousand shillings she had saved to put up a single-room house on the land her father left her back in the village: insurance in case her luck runs out and she needs to go home. Agnes&apos;s mysterious immune system has garnered her considerable fame in the world of Aids, but little else. She lives a life almost totally unchanged from her first days in umalaya 30 years ago. &apos;I can buy our daily food out of what I earn, and that&apos;s all,&apos; she told me as we sat in the shade of her bustling alley. &apos;I don&apos;t feel famous. It&apos;s only that my problems push me to do sex work. If I could find something else, I would.&apos; \u00b7 This is an extract from Twenty-Eight: Stories of Aids in Africa by Stephanie Nolen, published by Portobello Books on 28 May.

Or a former Miss World falling theatrically into the arms of a muscled and almost impossibly good-looking actor on the windy beaches of the North Sea. Such scenes are a long way from the usual entertainment associated with Yorkshire, which is still, for many, more Last of the Summer Wine than big-budget movie paradise. But India&apos;s top film-makers will be enjoying just such full-on glamour next week when the eyes of Bollywood turn to the county for the biggest event in the industry&apos;s calendar. New York, Sydney and Barcelona were all in line to host the 2007 International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) awards, otherwise known as the Bollywood Oscars, but organisers opted for Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Hull and York. Yorkshire officials hope that, by showcasing the beauty of Britain&apos;s white-rose county through four days of glitter, parties and even the odd celebrity cricket match, Indian producers will be lured towards choosing it as a future setting for films, complete with flamboyant dancing and singing through the streets (cobbled), along the beaches (windy, possibly chilly) and across the hills (steep, maybe wet). &apos;This was always an opportunity to showcase Yorkshire,&apos; said Sabbas Joseph, director of the IIFAs, who chose the county after receiving a personal request from Tony Blair. &apos;The feedback from the industry has been phenomenal.&apos; It is not just actors and film-makers. Five hundred million viewers across the world are expected to watch Bollywood&apos;s elite arrive next week. Stars who across south Asia are more famous than Brad Pitt and more loved than Nicole Kidman will be soon be wandering through the streets of Sheffield and Bradford. Among them will be Amitabh Bachchan, the godfather of Bollywood, who has appeared in more than 130 films and won nearly 20 top awards. Other names, barely known here but renowned across the subcontinent and among India&apos;s vast diaspora, include Akshay Kumar, Rani Mukherjee and Preity Zinta. With them will be Shilpa Shetty, made famous here by Big Brother, and British stars Sienna Miller and Colin Firth. The Bollywood stars will bring their own entourage and host colourful shows with dancing and singing. Of course, it would not be Bollywood without another great Indian love. After hosting a test match between England and the West Indies, Headingley will be prepared for a celebrity spectacular. A cricket match will be umpired by Dickie Bird, introduced by Zinta and include a team packed with famous Indian actors. Shetty will be there to carry out the toss. For Bollywood fans it will be like watching George Clooney come in to bat against Antonio Banderas, with Cameron Diaz commentating. The match will take place on the second day of the event, which will also include a forum bringing together Indian business people worth a total of \u00a360bn, a polo match, film premiere and the highlight - an awards ceremony attended by most of Bollywood&apos;s top talent. Thousands of fans will flock to Sheffield&apos;s Hallam FM arena a week on Saturday to try to catch a glimpse of their heart-throbs. Most will be hoping to see India&apos;s hottest couple - Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan. Rai is a former Miss World, he is the son of a Bollywood legend. The fact that they met and fell in love on a Indian set was almost as cliched as the perfect Bollywood script. When they married last month it was one of India&apos;s most anticipated events. Fans climbed trees to try to get a peek, but with security as tight as it was for the Beckhams&apos; wedding there was little chance of seeing anything. Even in Britain, Rai is now renowned following leading roles in films such as Bride and Prejudice and Provoked. Next week she and Bachchan are sure to be followed by a team of security guards. Why is such a spectacle coming to Yorkshire? According to Joseph, it is because it is the biggest county in Britain, has never had a significant Indian investment and is home to many British Asians who make up some of Bollywood&apos;s most hardcore fans. &apos;Cineworld, Odeon and Vue all show Indian films as part of their repertoire now,&apos; said Joseph. &apos;Sixteen per cent of releases in the UK are Indian films and last year nine made it into the top 10.&apos; He pointed out that Bollywood now contributes \u00a3200m to the UK economy every year through producers filming, distributing and exhibiting in the country. The amount is rising by 25 per cent annually. These four days will boost the Yorkshire economy by \u00a310m and the event is likely to make top Indian film-makers much more interested in the county as a movie location. Joseph would not be drawn into why New York, Sydney and Barcelona were turned down and said that they were each still in line for future bids. Since its launch in London in 2000, the IIFA&apos;s have been held in Sun City and Johannesburg in South Africa, and in Malaysia, Singapore, Amsterdam and Dubai. This time, celebrity magazines across Asia and television chat-shows will be filled with tales of the journey of India&apos;s rich and famous to Yorkshire. As in Hollywood, they will be full of gossip, ranging from bitching and backstabbing to romance and who is likely to win what. &apos;This is one of the most prestigious awards ceremonies and it can really boost an actor&apos;s career,&apos; said Akshay Kumar, one of the stars who will take to the stage in Leeds next week. He said Bollywood hits were being increasingly filmed in Britain, and Yorkshire could yet make the perfect location. Last year Kumar shot two films here: &apos;Everything is available in the UK and there is so much support.&apos; The growth in international demand for Bollywood has also led film makers to seek out new, non-Asian audiences outside India. Rang de Basanti, a film about corruption starring the British actress Alice Patten, daughter of Chris, the ex-Tory politician, is about to be relaunched by production company UTV, to attract British viewers. The film has just been re-edited to reduce the amount of Hindi and has been cut (Bollywood movies are often three hours long) to bring it closer to the usual Hollywood-blockbuster length. It will be renamed The Colour of Sacrifice The IIFAs will see the first major Bollywood premiere ever to be held in Yorkshire. The film is The Train, about a married man who falls for another woman. But a preview on a Bollywood website, glamsham.com promises &apos;something even more shocking that probably has never been seen before in a Hindi movie&apos;. It will follow another controversial film, Provoked, which tells the tale of a battered British Asian housewife who eventually kills her violent husband. The film tells the true story of Kiranjit Ahluwalia, from Slough, whose case set a precedent regarding the law&apos;s definition of &apos;provocation&apos;. Observers say it won&apos;t be long before Bollywood box-office takings start to rival those of Hollywood. Each year 3.1 billion cinema tickets for Bollywood films are sold in India compared with 2.9 billion for Hollywood hits in the US. At the moment that does not translate into the same amount of money because the vast majority of cinemas in India are single-screen and tickets cost on average 25p rather than $10. But there has been a massive growth in the number of multiplexes across India where tickets are closer to \u00a32.50. &apos;The Indian entertainment sector was worth $4.5bn last year and is already $10bn this year,&apos; said Jyoti Deshpande, chief operating officer and commercial director of Eros International, one of the world&apos;s leading international distributors of Bollywood films. &apos;Films used to be distributed through small cinemas and DVD shops. Now it is Odeons, Cineworlds and Vues, while the DVDs are available in Virgin and Asda. Films are now showcased at festivals like Cannes and reviewed in the mainstream press.&apos; Bollywood, Deshpande added, was like Hollywood in the Thirties but was now growing at a phenomenal rate. It may not be long until names such as Abhishek Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Rani Mukherjee and Preity Zinta are household names in the UK. They certainly soon will be in Yorkshire. Tinseltown, Asian-style In the late 19th century, Indian photographer, Harishchandra Sakharam Bhatvadekar bought a camera for 21 guineas in London. He took it back to India, shot several short films, and, in 1899, the Indian film industry was born. While films were shot in a number of different languages, those in Hindi quickly became the most prominent. In the early Seventies, a gossip magazine in Mumbai coined the word Bollywood, referring to the city&apos;s Hindi language film industry. It is often wrongly used to refer to the whole of India&apos;s film industry. Purists - among them some of the country&apos;s leading actors - deplore the term. They say it makes the industry look like Hollywood&apos;s poor cousin. Much to their annoyance, Bollywood has now become a permanent fixture, even holding a place in the Oxford English Dictionary. Plots are often melodramatic, with star-crossed lovers, angry families, love triangles, corrupt politicians, kidnappers, conniving villains and tales of rags to riches. Few films are made without theatrical song and dance scenes. \u00b7 Tickets for the IIFA Foundation Charity Celebrity Cricket Match are priced \u00a322 (adult) and \u00a312 (child), and are available by calling 0871 222 0994, or online at yorkshireccc.com.", "sentences": ["Since its launch in London in 2000, the IIFA&apos;s have been held in Sun City and Johannesburg in South Africa, and in Malaysia, Singapore, Amsterdam and Dubai."], "title": "Bollywood glitter adds glamour to Yorkshire grit", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/27/film.india", "tags": ["UK news", "Film", "India", "Bollywood", "World news", "Travel", "World cinema", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-28T22:53:24Z", "article": "Comedy: Amsterdam Underground Comedy Collective A Dutch comedy invasion of the Fringe, from the producers who first brought Doug Stanhope to town.

The awards, which take place in Sheffield next week, are hugely popular and extraordinarily lucrative, having visited a Midas-touch effect on many of their previous hosts (Singapore, Amsterdam, Johannesburg).  But the map, which covers around thirty UK spots, from Tower Bridge to a Surrey football ground, may be protesting a little too much. It&apos;s one thing to try and grab a bit of the Bollywood buzz, but quite another to claim that the map will really be used by Indian visitors to the UK. Putting aside the fact that Indian tourists might not be thrilled at the prospect of making a cinephile pilgrimage to a Slough shopping centre, or pointing open-mouthed at the bit of greenery in front of an Oxfordshire village&apos;s All Bar One, the map overestimates its place in the scheme of Indian cinema. Foreign locations have always been as much a part of the Bollywood formula as music and dance - and usually they go hand in hand. Sometimes only the songs are filmed abroad. But the fantasy of exotic places goes right back at least to the sixties, the golden era of Indian cinema. Raj Kapoor&apos;s Sangam (1964) set many scenes in Switzerland; the self-evident locations of the films An Evening in Paris (1967) and Love in Tokyo (1966), and even the tiny mountain village of Sikkim, then not part of India, thrilled audiences of the 1967 hit Jewel Thief. The Great Gambler (1979) shot in Cairo, Lisbon, Venice and Rome, signalled an even broader scope which has continued to this day, notably aided by the Indian government&apos;s liberalisation of foreign currency exchange. Of the hundreds of global locations that have brought glamour and sheen to India&apos;s big screen, only those in the UK require indicating with a big pointy stick. And in one respect, it could be seen as good news: Visit Britain has at least learnt how to make a song and dance out of something. However, for those who prefer to greet the awards with real cultural preparation rather than a gimmicky and underwhelming location map, the following films are landmarks, each well worth every last minute of the three hour shifts involved: Guru Dutt&apos;s Pyaasa; the better known and multi award-winning Mother India; Pakeezah; and Guide.

The world of accountancy is dominated by just four secretive accountancy firms: PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG, although their might is now being challenged by mid-tier firms such as Grant Thornton. The Big Four&apos;s combined global income of $80bn is greater than the gross domestic product of many nation states. They are controlled by secret trusts headquartered in offshore tax havens (Bermuda and Switzerland), which do not have multilateral information sharing treaties with other countries. Despite appealing to codes of ethics, profit-hungry accountancy firms are engaged in a race to the bottom. A few examples would help to illustrate the issues. In the year 2000, the Italian competition authority fined the then Big Six accountancy firms for operating an illegal cartel. Their secret agreements included fixing prices and deciding in advance the firm that would win any auditing contracts. More recently, the Big Four firms, plus Grant Thornton, got together to challenge the French government over its law barring accountancy firms from auditing a company&apos;s accounts if they have provided advisory services to the client in the past two years. The same firms are planning to make further joint challenges to the French law. The UK government has shown no interest in investigating the practices of major firms. Around the world, some $2.5 trillion is estimated to be laundered each year. An early indication of the involvement of accountants is provided by the UK high court judgment in the case of AGIP (Africa) Limited v Jackson &amp; Others (1990) 1 Ch 265et seq. The judgment noted that:  &quot;Mr Jackson and Mr Griffin are professional men. They obviously knew they were laundering money ... It must have been obvious to them that their clients could not afford their activities to see the light of the day. ... [They] were introduced to the High Holborn branch of Lloyds Bank Plc in March 1983 by a Mr Humphrey, a partner in the well-known firm of Thornton Baker [this is now part of Grant Thornton]. They probably took over an established arrangement. Thenceforth they provided the payee companies ... In each case Mr Jackson and Mr Griffin were the directors and the authorised signatories on the company&apos;s account at Lloyds Bank. In the case of the first few companies Mr Humphrey was also a director and authorised signatory. &quot;  Despite the very strong court judgment, there has been no investigation by any UK government department, regulator or professional body. Tax avoidance is a huge money-spinner for accountancy firms. The US government is estimated to be losing nearly $300bn of tax revenues each year. The US Senate committee on governmental affairs (pdf) investigated the activities of KPMG and after examining the firm&apos;s internal documents concluded (page 4 of the report) that the firm:  &quot; ... devoted substantial resources to, and obtained significant fees from, developing, marketing, and implementing potentially abusive and illegal tax shelters that US taxpayers might otherwise have been unable, unlikely or unwilling to employ, costing the treasury billions of dollars in lost tax revenues&quot;.  The Senate hearings found that to secure competitive advantage senior officials at the firm had decided not to comply with the law requiring them to register avoidance schemes with the tax authorities. One internal document, mentioned on page 13 of the Senate report (pdf), noted that:  &quot;Based upon our analysis of the applicable penalty sections, we conclude that the penalties would be no greater than $14,000 per $100,000 in KPMG fees ... For example, our average ... deal would result in KPMG fees of $360,000 with a maximum penalty exposure of only $31,000&quot;.  Through such strategies KPMG received more than $120m in fees while the US treasury lost billions in tax revenues. Subsequently, the US department of justice charged (pdf) the firm with criminal conduct. The firm admitted such conduct and paid a fine of $456m. Several KPMG (now ex) partners are facing what the US department of Justice described as &quot;the largest criminal tax case ever filed&quot;. In March 2006, one of its ex-partners told a court, &quot;I willfully aided and abetted the evasion of taxes&quot;. Other major firms and their partners are also facing lawsuits for selling questionable tax avoidance schemes. The US methods for selling tax services also appear to be used in the UK. For example, a Tax Tribunal heard (pdf) that KPMG cold-called clients to sell a VAT avoidance scheme. The scheme was found to be unlawful and the firm appealed to the European court of justice, which declared it to be &quot;unacceptable&quot;. Accountancy firms continue to sell dubious tax avoidance schemes (pdf). A partner of a mid-tier firm was bold enough to say: &quot;no matter what legislation is in place, the accountants and lawyers will find a way around it. Rules are rules, but rules are meant to be broken&quot;. The UK is estimated to be losing between \u00a397bn and \u00a3150bn of tax revenues each year. Yet neither the Treasury nor any select committee has launched an investigation into the practices of major firms. In 2001, the New York district attorney told a US Senate committee that:  &quot;In 1996 my office concluded a case involving the bribery of bank officers in US and foreign banks in connection with sales of emerging markets debt, transactions that earned millions for the corrupt bankers and their co-conspirators. In this case, a private debt trader in Westchester County, New York, formerly a vice president of a major US bank, set up shell companies in Antigua with the help of one of the &quot;big-five&quot; [these are now part of the Big Four firms] accounting firms; employees of the accounting firm served as nominee managers and directors. The payments arranged by the accounting firm on behalf of the crooked debt trader included bribes paid to a New York banker in the name of a British Virgin Islands company, into a Swiss bank account; bribes to two bankers in Florida in the name of another British Virgin Islands corporation and bribes to a banker in Amsterdam into a numbered Swiss account&quot;.  Successive UK governments have failed to commission any independent investigations into the real or alleged audit failures at Polly Peck, Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), Levitt Group of Companies, The Accident Group, Resort Hotels, or the UK parts of the Enron, WorldCom, Ahold, Parmalat, WestLB, Hollinger and Xerox episodes. In other countries, the regulators are becoming more concerned. The US securities and exchange commission (SEC) fined PricewaterhouseCoopers for persistent violation of auditor independence rules. Ernst and Young (E&amp;Y) were prosecuted for persistent violations of auditor independence rules. In April 2004, a 69 page court judgment (pdf) stated: &quot;EY committed repeated violation of the auditor independence standards by conduct that was reckless, highly unreasonable and negligent ... They were committed by professionals throughout the firm, who exhibited no caution or concern for rules on auditor independence in connection with business relationships with an audit client ... EY partners acted recklessly and negligently in committing wilful and deliberate violations of well-established rules ... &quot; The firm was banned for six months from securing any new audit clients and put on probation for three years. In another case, a US judge banned a Deloitte &amp; Touche partner for life for audit failures at Adelphia. The judge ruled that among other things the audit partner bowed to pressure from the company, which didn&apos;t want to disclose the full amount of money it co-borrowed with businesses owned by its founders. In September 2005, four accountants at the Japanese firm ChuoAoyama PricewaterhouseCoopers were arrested for allegedly helping Kanebo executives falsify accounting reports and conceal losses of nearly \u00a31bn. After further investigations the Japanese regulators suspended the firm&apos;s statutory auditing operations for two months. This effectively haemorrhaged the firm&apos;s operations. It subsequently reinvented itself by forming another organisation. The above is only part of the mounting evidence that raises concerns about the activities of major accountancy firms and highlights the need for UK regulators to intervene.", "sentences": ["The payments arranged by the accounting firm on behalf of the crooked debt trader included bribes paid to a New York banker in the name of a British Virgin Islands company, into a Swiss bank account; bribes to two bankers in Florida in the name of another British Virgin Islands corporation and bribes to a banker in Amsterdam into a numbered Swiss account&quot;."], "title": "Raw dealing", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/30/rawdealing", "tags": ["Money", "Crime", "Business", "Ethics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-05-30T12:00:50Z", "article": "I must confess that this week&apos;s LA Diary comes not from So-Cal but Leigh on Sea, in Essex. Leigh on Sea, which is near Southend, hit the headlines back in February when Helen Mirren, who went to school mere yards from my very own seat of learning, declared it to be &quot;the armpit of England&quot;.  This was most unfair considering it was always Pauline Fowler&apos;s holiday destination of choice, but then again Mirren went to St Bernard&apos;s so she probably doesn&apos;t know any better; her school uniform was brown and they were thrashed by the rest of the county at sports. I rest my case. I flew over for my Aunty Evelyn&apos;s wedding and played my part as her bridal attendant and speechmaker as best I could whilst wearing a distinctly un-me lemon dress and battling severe jetlag. Everyone wanted to know about LA. And I mean everyone, including the hotel manager and the guy whose car I accidentally pranged in the car park. I&apos;ve told the same stories so many times over that next time I come back I&apos;m recording the first conversation I have so friends can download it onto their MP3 players. That way I won&apos;t lose my voice from describing in no particular order, the exact layout of my new digs, what kind of cheese I eat and how I&apos;ve coped with driving on the right. The flight itself was fine but my film choices were not so great. First was The Pursuit of Happyness which plunged me into a deep depression somewhere over Greenland. Next up was Russell Crowe&apos;s A Good Year, which I switched off after less than five minutes irritated to the hilt for a reason I have yet to fathom, replacing it with Hugh Grant&apos;s latest, Music and Lyrics. It was harmless enough and sent me to sleep which got me out of a sticky situation. Everyone who travels long-haul wonders beforehand who they are going to end up sitting next to and almost as soon as I had crowbarred myself into my snug little seat, the flame-haired American next to me declared herself to be an expert on the Dutch Mango Fork. She spent an hour telling me the entire history of this little-feted piece of cutlery. Yes, there is an entire history and I know it all. She was on her way to Amsterdam to research her new book, on naturally, the Dutch Mango Fork, although she was very worried because, as she explained, the European expert meeting her at the airport kept calling it the Dutch Cake Fork. Worse still, he had declared ominously in his last email that he was single and lived with his dog, Ringo. Wherever you are Maura, I hope you are ok and not at all forked off. Coming back to the UK after four months has assured me that nothing much changes. People talk about the telly a lot and everyone seems to be slightly fluey. I&apos;ve also realised that I&apos;m possibly the only woman to move to LA and put weight on. With all this size zero insanity flying around (or as my mum puts it,&apos; that bloody nought thing&apos;), nearly every one of my friends clearly expected me to have shrunk to the size of Posh with the hair of Jessica Alba and eyeholes like Joan Rivers. I&apos;m sorry to disappoint with my extreme make-under but I&apos;m pretty much the same as how I left, due to my passion for regular meals and natural looking facial expressions. I&apos;m back to LA this weekend and my, how I&apos;m going to miss the pounding rain, the price of petrol and the endless discussions about who will win Joseph, Any Dream Will Do.

If it were to rule against an expansion in traffic, central government would bulldoze the increase through on the grounds that it is essential to UK plc, and all other considerations are secondary. Local people who oppose Stansted&apos;s expansion would be well advised to focus their efforts on securing the best possible deals from BAA and the government to mitigate the effects of the expansion, because it will happen whether they like it or not. By this I mean getting the best possible rail links into the airport to reduce road congestion and pollution, and the best possible grants for everything from soundproofing to investment in local environmental projects. Sorry to be bearer of bad tidings, but there is a lot of evidence - and history - to support this. The most compelling evidence is a change in the government&apos;s terms of reference for its &quot;Future of Air Transport&quot; study as it progressed from the initial consultation in 2000 to the green and white paper stages. In the initial terms of reference, one of the options listed was that there should be no expansion of airports at all. That option did not survive the initial consultation period and has never been seen since. It did not get mislaid. The simple fact is that the government had been persuaded, without apparent difficulty, that UK plc will be harmed by the shortage of runway capacity in the country, particularly in the south-east of England. If the Heathrow Terminal 5 inquiry had ruled against that project, central government would have bulldozed it through for the same reason. But what is it about commercial air transport that, from the government&apos;s point of view, makes it so vital to the larger UK economy - despite the environmental downside? There are several reasons, but the most compelling of them is that all the most important commercial and financial centres of the world are extremely well-served by international air services, and that state of affairs will become more relevant as the world becomes more of a global economy. The City of London has a powerful lobby of movers and shakers that have the ear of those at Westminster. Don&apos;t waste your time telling them they can do business by teleconference. When they do deals the size of the ones they do, they want to look people in the eye and judge how sweaty their palms are at the final handshake before signature. The fear is that London would become a backwater if Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam keep on expanding their airports and London freezes its own. Heathrow is so congested that it is already harming the economy, and the UK airlines based there cannot expand while Air France, KLM and Lufthansa go ballistic. That may not sound like a compelling argument to the residents of the countryside around Stansted, but unfortunately for them Gordon Brown has been listening to the City. Voting for David Cameron would not make any difference either.

Two 8cm-thick files of emails and other communications are being examined in case one of them contains a message from the four-year-old&apos;s kidnapper, the detective leading the hunt, Olegario Sousa, said today. Each clairvoyant&apos;s claim was being taken seriously in case they were from the person or people who snatched Madeleine from her parent&apos;s holiday apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz on May 3, Chief Inspector Sousa said. &quot;That is one of the reasons that we cannot discard anything,&quot; he said. &quot;We must check them all in case it might be from the kidnapper. &quot;But the problem is the same: if there are indications which are enough to follow, then we will go.

Louis Ginsberg was a poet of mild manners and modest abilities, whose neat stanzas were often to be seen in the poetry corner of the New York Times. &quot;Howl&quot; was as far from the kind of poetry he admired as it is possible to be, but he welcomed any indication of accomplishment in his troubled 29-year-old son. &quot;It&apos;s a wild, rhapsodic, explosive outpouring with good figures of speech,&quot; Louis wrote to Allen in February 1956. But he remained uneasy about evidence of dangerous habits. &quot;I still insist, however, there is no need for dirty, ugly words, as they will entangle you, unnecessarily, in trouble.&quot; There had been plenty of that already. At the turn of the decade, Allen had spent eight months in the Columbia Psychiatric Institute, New York, as an alternative to serving a prison sentence for receiving stolen goods. Ginsberg&apos;s mother, Naomi, was in a mental hospital when she received her copy. &quot;It seems to me your wording was a little too hard,&quot; she scribbled in a letter, practically the last words she ever wrote - she died the same day. &quot;Don&apos;t go in for ridiculous things.&quot; Between them, Louis and Naomi Ginsberg encapsulated the tone of the response that Howl and Other Poems would attract - from &quot;rhapsodic&quot; to &quot;ridiculous&quot; - when it appeared at the end of 1956. The little pamphlet, 44 stapled pages, hardly the size of a postcard, was published by City Lights Books, Number 4 in the Pocket Poets Series overseen by Lawrence Ferlinghetti and issued from his famous bookshop on Columbus Avenue, San Francisco. The poet and doctor William Carlos Williams contributed a short preface, lending the collection an air of respectability, but no mainstream publisher would have touched it. Ginsberg&apos;s extravagant, free-form verses were aesthetically off-putting to most editors and critics in the mid-50s, but his language - his too-hard &quot;wording&quot; - was simply outside the law. To put things briefly in perspective: at least two out of the last four Man Booker prizewinners (The Line of Beauty by Alan Hollinghurst and Vernon God Little by DBC Pierre) could not have been published in their present form before 1960. The same goes for almost the entire output of John Updike and Philip Roth. Some writers devised ways of getting round the prohibition on four-letter words - Norman Mailer came up with &quot;fug&quot; to colour the speech of soldiers in his 1948 novel The Naked and the Dead. Some, such as Henry Miller and Vladimir Nabokov, were content to have their risky books published abroad, usually in Paris, where the Olympia Press and its offshoots rejected books without a high degree of sexual content. Most just avoided the problem. Ginsberg&apos;s book contains the poem &quot;America&quot;, which has the line &quot;America ... Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb&quot;. Another, &quot;Transcription of Organ Music&quot;, practically a prose poem, offers the recollection &quot;When I first got laid, HP graciously took my cherry ...&quot; with the implication that both the speaker and HP were men. But it was the title poem that drew the most attention. The book was printed in England by Villiers, which shipped the first consignment to California without incident. But 520 copies of the second printing were seized by US customs, on the grounds that the writing was obscene. In a remark much repeated in ironical tones, the chief collector of customs said of &quot;Howl&quot;: &quot;You wouldn&apos;t want your children to come across it.&quot; The books arriving from England were impounded in March, but in late May the collector of customs decided not to proceed with the case - Ferlinghetti had had a further 2,500 copies printed in the US, to get round the legal technicality of importing obscene material - and the outlook appeared bright for the poet and his publisher. However, within a week, in a sting operation, two officers of the Juvenile Bureau of the San Francisco Police Department entered City Lights, where the &quot;banned&quot; Howl and Other Poems was now the main item on display, and made to buy a copy. When the counter assistant Shig Murao accepted money for the book and a magazine, the Miscellaneous Man, he was arrested on June 3 for &quot;peddling&quot; literature likely to be harmful to minors. (Charges against the Miscell-aneous Man were soon dropped.) Ferlinghetti turned himself in a few days later. The opening line of &quot;Howl&quot; - &quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked&quot; - is among the best-known in American poetry. It has become a catchphrase. In 1997, Anglia Railways used it as an advertising jingle, to plug a special deal on trains from London to Norwich: &quot;I saw the best minds of my generation at Liverpool Street Station ...&quot; (the Ginsberg estate politely put a stop to it). Ginsberg wrote Part I of the poem while living at 1010 Montgomery Street, San Francisco (the house is still there; no plaque). He later recalled that he had not intended to publish it, and therefore felt free to commemorate the various assaults of madness, injury, death and persecution that had befallen the &quot;best minds&quot; of his intimate circle in what they experienced as the repressive atmosphere of postwar America. Most of the poem&apos;s long lines, or &quot;strophes&quot;, begin with &quot;who&quot; - &quot;who were expelled from the academies for crazy &amp; publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull&quot; - and are traceable to actual events. In this case, &quot;expelled from the academies&quot; refers to Ginsberg&apos;s removal from Columbia University for writing &quot;Fuck the Jews&quot; on his bedroom window, in order to provoke the cleaner into washing it. Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady, William Burroughs and Herbert Huncke all feature in the poem, in distorted form, as if under strobe lighting. It may require an act of goodwill on the part of the reader new to &quot;Howl&quot; to stick with it all the way through, so strange are the language, imagery and juxtapositions, many of which are incomprehensible without the author&apos;s explanations (Ginsberg provided a set of annotations in 1986, published in the superb Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, edited by Barry Miles), but once you are committed to the poem&apos;s unusual presence it becomes easy to like, to wonder at, to read repeatedly in search of new glimpses of meaning or memory pictures from the author&apos;s &quot;associative flash&quot; technique. As the book was being seized by police, and Ferlinghetti was charged with publishing and selling obscene literature, Ginsberg was in Tangier with Burroughs, helping to type the chaotic manuscripts of Naked Lunch. This work was mentioned in the dedication of &quot;Howl&quot; as &quot;an endless novel which will drive everybody mad&quot; - as if there wasn&apos;t enough madness about the place. Burroughs had been briefly incarcerated in a mental hospital in New York, and had cut off one of his own fingers. Later he was detained in a Mexican prison after shooting his wife in the head during a game of William Tell. Kerouac, another of the book&apos;s dedicatees, had been discharged from the navy when appearing to exhibit symptoms of &quot;dementia praecox&quot;, schizophrenia. The others mentioned in the dedication were Cassady and Lucien Carr, both of whom spent periods in prison, the latter for manslaughter (he later asked Ginsberg to remove his name from the book). This history fuels the poem: images of &quot;madness&quot;, together with its cousins &quot;visions&quot; and &quot;hallucinations&quot;, feature more prominently than the deviant sex that prompted Captain Hanrahan to position the forces of his Juvenile Bureau as a shield between the book and &quot;children&quot;. When Ferlinghetti and Shig Murao arrived at San Francisco&apos;s municipal court on August 16 (the trial lasted until October 3), they must have groaned on discovering that the judge assigned to hear the case was Clayton W Horn, who had lately caused surprise by instructing five female shoplifters to attend a screening of the film The Ten Commandments and compose essays on its moral teachings in lieu of punishment. The defence assembled a team of witnesses that included Mark Schorer, professor of English at the University of California, and the poets Kenneth Rexroth and Robert Duncan. The prosecution attorney was Ralph McIntosh, a stolid philistine who turned out to be easy prey to the articulate spokesmen in favour of the book. Schorer was particularly eloquent, breaking &quot;Howl&quot; into component parts, explaining the nature of each and how they interacted. McIntosh quoted a line from Part II of the poem, ending &quot;Religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit&quot;, and asked: &quot;Couldn&apos;t that have been worded in some other way? Do they have to put words like that in there?&quot; At this point, the judge intervened to say that it was &quot;obvious that the author could have used another term; whether or not it would have served the same purpose is another matter&quot;. At that moment, Ferlinghetti surely sensed victory. Horn&apos;s verdict was largely reliant on a case that had reached the US Supreme Court in the spring of the same year, in which it was established that literature was protected by the right to freedom of speech enshrined in the first amendment of the US constitution; but the case had involved photographic magazines with titles such as Aphrodite. In applying the new standard to a book of poems, Horn was setting a precedent for obscenity in literature cases to come (including Naked Lunch, which was the subject of several trials). The measure of a book was not whether it was &quot;fit for children to read&quot;, but its effect on &quot;the average adult in the community&quot;. The test of obscenity was that &quot;the material must have a tendency to deprave or corrupt readers by ... arousing lustful desire to the point that it presents a clear and present danger of inciting to antisocial or immoral action&quot;. If a work had &quot;the slightest redeeming social importance&quot; it should be judged &quot;not obscene&quot;. Horn summed up: &quot;I conclude the book Howl and Other Poems does have some redeeming importance, and I find the book is not obscene. The defendant is found not guilty.&quot; This was not the most significant of the obscenity cases clustered round the 50s and early 60s, but it was one of the earliest and, as Nancy J Peters writes in Howl on Trial, published by City Lights to mark the 50th anniversary, &quot;over the next decade, a series of court decisions began to remove restrictions&quot;. Writing to Ferlinghetti from Amsterdam, on receiving news of the verdict, Ginsberg asked: &quot;Is there chance of continuing the fight and freeing Miller, Lawrence, and maybe Genet? That would be really historic and worth the trouble.&quot; &quot;Howl&quot; still reads well, to a reader willing to be swept along by its apocalyptic imagery and its relentless rhythmic attack. It is an &quot;event&quot; poem, like The Waste Land, like Hugh MacDiarmid&apos;s A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle, like, in our own time, Christopher Logue&apos;s War Music, entering the language under its own terms. The occasional sloppiness - Ginsberg&apos;s annotations reveal that he was willing to sacrifice meaning for show - can be taken to add to the energy of the performance. When he returned from Europe in 1958 to find himself the triumphant author of that ever-popular thing, &quot;the book they tried to ban&quot;, as well as the assumed spokesman of the beat generation, Ginsberg gave his first recorded interview to the Village Voice. Why had he come home? &quot;To save America.

Yesterday it was Madrid, next will be Berlin, then Amsterdam, then most likely Morocco. Tomorrow will mark a month since Madeleine McCann, nine days shy of her fourth birthday, vanished from a holiday apartment in southern Portugal, and this week her parents, still clasping treasured photographs and her increasingly dog-eared cuddly toy, have taken the search to the rest of Europe and beyond. After their audience with the Pope, they spent yesterday meeting the Spanish interior minister and local journalists, before appearing on the country&apos;s version of Crimewatch to make another emotional appeal to whoever is holding their daughter. Further ministerial meetings and press appearances are planned. After that, according to those close to the couple, the schedule has not been finalised; what is certain is that it will be far from quiet. Until the evening of Thursday May 3, Kate and Gerry McCann were an anonymous couple from a small East Midlands town. Today they are at the centre of what has become an international publicity hurricane of quite unprecedented scale. Their daughter&apos;s face, screened at the FA Cup final, was seen by an estimated 500 million people; a short video about the toddler was also shown at the Uefa and Heineken cup finals, while Liverpool players posed before their unsuccessful Champion&apos;s League bid behind a banner that read: Bring Maddie Home. Gordon Brown, while campaigning to become Labour leader, has worn a yellow ribbon to show solidarity with the McCanns; many of his colleagues did the same, along with David Beckham, countless premiership and SPL football teams and the England cricket team. JK Rowling, Sir Richard Branson, the theatre impresario Bill Kenwright, the philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter and Jacqueline Gold of the Ann Summers sex shop chain, have each pledged hundreds of thousands of pounds for information leading to Madeleine&apos;s safe return; one Scottish businessman offered a million. Sir Philip Green loaned his private jet, which took the couple to the Vatican and brought them back in time to tuck Madeleine&apos;s twin siblings into bed. BP, Exxon, McDonald&apos;s, Carrefour, the French bank Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and the Spanish Banco Santander are displaying her poster around Europe; Vodafone, O2 and the Spanish Telefonica network have sent text messages to their subscribers. In the US, Madeleine&apos;s face has appeared on the cover of People magazine, and Oprah Winfrey has invited the family on to her talk show. A month on, this much we know about the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. At about 9.30pm on the second to last evening of the family&apos;s holiday, she was asleep in their rented apartment alongside the twins, Sean and Amelie. At 10pm, when Kate McCann went to check on her children, she was not. Nothing else is certain. The police search of the area surrounding Praia da Luz, the resort from which she vanished, was wound up after a week having yielded &quot;zero results&quot;, police said, and despite the designation of a British man in the town as an official &quot;suspect&quot;, he has not been arrested. The only piece of information that is known came from a friend of the McCanns who was rushing to meet the couple for dinner at about 9.30pm on the night of Madeleine&apos;s disappearance when she saw a man carrying away a child in pink pyjamas. A beautiful child, snatched from her bed while two babies slept alongside, will always be headline news. Yet rarely has the world&apos;s media had so much to say - daily, inexhaustible, blanket coverage - about so very little hard information. The McCanns themselves, say friends, have been bewildered at the scale of the coverage, while at the same time feeling a compulsion to ramp it up, convinced that someone will be stung into coming forward. They can scarcely have imagined that, a month on, the perfect media storm would appear very far from blowing itself out. The McCanns were immediately certain that their daughter had been kidnapped and determined to publicise her disappearance as widely as possible, ensuring that, from the very first moments, the hunt for Madeleine was as much about the media coverage as it was the police investigation. Jill Renwick has known the couple since they all worked together at a Glasgow hospital more than a decade ago. She spoke to Kate at 7am on the morning after Madeleine vanished: &quot;She just said, &apos;Help me, please help me&apos;. She said, &apos;We&apos;ve been searching all night until 4.30am, and then everybody left us&apos;. At that stage there was only one police officer at the door. They didn&apos;t know what to do. So I phoned GMTV.&quot; She also phoned the McCanns&apos; wider circle of friends, who mobilised to phone anyone they could think of to beg for help. Renwick&apos;s sister called someone she knew in CID, someone had a connection with Des Browne, the defence secretary. One friend lives close to the Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark, said Renwick: &quot;She knocked on her door and said, &apos;I know you must think I&apos;m mad but my friend&apos;s wee girl is missing, can you do anything to help?&apos; Though they are not friends, Gordon Brown&apos;s brother John lives in the same street as Renwick: &quot;I stopped him in the street the day afterwards and said, &apos;These are my friends. Do you think you could speak to Gordon about it?&apos; And he said of course. I don&apos;t know if anything came about that way.&quot; In Praia da Luz, meanwhile, the couple rapidly found themselves the beneficiaries of high-level media advice. The holiday firm Mark Warner reacted with admirable speed to the kidnap. By Saturday morning its managing director and UK operations director were in the resort, along with two trauma counsellors and Alex Woolfall, a PR specialist contracted by the firm. Woolfall, head of crisis management at leading PR agency Bell Pottinger, who advised Monsanto during the storm over GM food, would become for a fortnight the family&apos;s adviser and press go-between. He is probably one of the people in Britain best placed to manage such a situation, and it showed. Very swiftly, the storm of TV and print journalists camped outside the family&apos;s apartment had established a number of informal rules of engagement: Kate and Gerry would be left largely alone to take their twins to playgroup, for instance; TV cameras would remain fixed. It was made known to reporters that the family wanted their daughter to be referred to as Madeleine rather than the tabloid-coined Maddy. &quot;We were aware from the outset that there was a huge amount of media interest,&quot; said Woolfall, &quot;and they in all the conversations I had with them were very keen to see the media as a partner.&quot; Thus began a carefully scheduled round of interviews, photo-opportunities and press conferences. Helped by the wider family at home, additional photographs were released of Madeleine: a picture of the toddler in an Everton top mobilised the club and Kenwright, its chairman, to their own gestures of support. A holiday snap of the family in Donegal was splashed across the Irish papers. Vigils in Scotland and Leicestershire ensured the presence of their local media in Praia da Luz. Back in the UK, relatives launched a website and fund to handle some of the many thousands of offers of support they had received; in the first 48 hours the site had received 75m hits, becoming the fastest-growing website on the internet. But however much access the family offer, they cannot hope to meet a demand that remains, a month on, apparently insatiable. Some 62% of all traffic on the Google news website last week consisted of searches about Madeleine. Woolfall said that, despite their determination to appear before the press as much as possible, the couple have been amazed at the interest in their story. &quot;This couple don&apos;t suddenly see themselves as celebrities. If you had actually met them, sat in their apartment and seen them with the twins, they are just like any other couple. But they find themselves having to ask themselves: what can we possibly do that means we will be able to sleep tonight, knowing that we have done everything today that we could have done?&quot; Brian Kennedy, Kate McCann&apos;s uncle, is also chair of the Find Madeleine fund. &quot;There have been a number of sizeable donations but there have also been a huge number of very small ones. It&apos;s been very moving. We&apos;re incredibly grateful.&quot; Part of the money raised - \u00a3581,000 by yesterday afternoon - will be used to support the wider family in their campaigning, he said. Woolfall left Praia da Luz after a fortnight; the McCanns are now being advised on behalf of the Foreign Office by Clarence Mitchell, a former BBC reporter. He organised, in association with British embassies around Europe, the current publicity tour. If anything, say members of the still sizeable press pack accompanying the McCanns, the media operation has become even more professional. Despite the couple&apos;s remarkable drive, Renwick said the tour was taking its toll on her friend. &quot;I think she finds the nights the hardest,&quot; she said. &quot;They are busy during the day, they have quite a lot going on, but once the twins have gone to bed and its just the pair of them ... of course it will hit you then.&quot; They are also terribly nervous of overkill. &quot;Although it seems as though Kate and I are in the media all the time, that is not the case,&quot; Gerry McCann said yesterday in Madrid. &quot;I can assure you that Kate and I are getting a lot of quality time with Sean and Amelie. Spending time with them helps us cope with the fact that Madeleine is missing.&quot; Team McCann, as the family campaign calls itself, shows little sign of running out of ideas. Assuming Madeleine has not been found, they plan to target the Tour de France, golf tournaments, Grand Prix events, the Isle of Man TT, perhaps even the publishers of the new Harry Potter novel. Leicester hospital has planned a summer ball in aid of the fund; Squirrel Hayes first school in Biddulph, Staffordshire, will be doing their bit on Wednesday with a fashion show.

Accepting publicly for the first time that the hunt may drag on indefinitely, Kate and Gerry McCann have begun preparing an advanced publicity strategy. Gerry McCann said yesterday: &apos;We&apos;re not going to be holding press conferences in six months time to say, &quot;Isn&apos;t this terrible?&quot; We have to be prepared in case it does become that and that&apos;s why we need a professional campaigns manager.&apos; He will be paid out of the nearly \u00a3400,000 that has been donated to the McCanns by the public across Europe. The couple are planning to visit Berlin on Wednesday as part of a four-nation tour to publicise the abduction of four-year-old Madeleine. The following day the couple will travel to Amsterdam. Tourists from Germany and the Netherlands are among the most frequent visitors to the Algarve, from where Madeleine disappeared a month ago. The McCanns will urge people who have visited Praia da Luz, where Madeleine was snatched, to re-examine their holiday photographs for any clues. The following week the couple will travel to Morocco as part of their search for possible witnesses. It is now 31 days since Madeleine was kidnapped as she slept. She disappeared while Kate, a GP, and her consultant cardiologist husband were dining only 40 yards from where she and her two-year-old twin brother and sister were sleeping. Yesterday, reports claimed that Portuguese police are investigating an unidentified DNA sample taken from Madeleine&apos;s bed. So far Portuguese police have identified one suspect, Englishman Robert Murat, 33, who was brought up in Portugal. Despite being questioned for 19 hours over Madeleine&apos;s disappearance, Murat said in a newspaper article yesterday that he had not even been asked to provide a DNA sample, a claim rejected by Portuguese police yesterday. &apos;The man is a prime suspect in this case: what kind of professionals would we be if we did not take samples?&apos; said Sousa. In their own interview, the McCanns today reveal the emotional turmoil they suffered in the days that followed their daughter&apos;s disappearance. Kate said: &apos;The first three days just go and you can&apos;t sleep and I think that&apos;s the normal reaction.&apos; Her husband added: &apos;Night-time is always the hardest time. When you are going to bed you tend to be more contemplative, but we&apos;re usually so tired by the time we get to bed that we do actually fall asleep quite quickly and we&apos;re having good sleep every night, five or six hours uninterrupted, apart from the kids [their two-year-old twins Sean and Amelie]&apos;. However, both conceded there was mounting frustration as the days passed with no firm leads. &apos;We have anger, but it&apos;s anger at the situation and, I think, part of the normal grieving process,&apos; said Kate. The couple said they will not give up the search for their daughter while the hope remains that Madeleine is alive and they were preparing for the long-haul. Already the McCanns have a fund administrator to deal with donations from the public, a legal team that offers advice and a team of police experts to ensure their media strategy does not jeopardise Madeleine&apos;s survival if she is still alive. However, the parents, both 38, admit they have confronted the possibility she is dead. Gerry said: &apos;You would be incredible if you hadn&apos;t considered the worst scenario.&apos; They still have no plans to return to their family home in Rothley, Leicestershire. &apos;We would like to think she is still in Portugal. But we know that it&apos;s a possibility that she has gone over the border, or several borders,&apos; said Kate.

The memory of ecstasy users who were asked to remember lists of words was impaired, the study found. Researchers compared the performance of the subjects before and after they first tried the drug and concluded that even low doses of the drug could have lasting effects on the brain. The ideal experiment to investigate the effect of ecstasy on human memory would be to give the drug or a placebo to different participants at random. That would be unethical, so the next best thing would be to test non-drug users first, and then again if they decide to take the drug. Research on animals has shown that ecstasy can cause long-lasting damage to neurons involved in processing serotonin, a chemical involved in controlling learning, memory, mood and other functions. In several studies a brain region called the hippocampus which is known to be involved in memory has shown up as being particularly badly affected. A team led by Ben Schmand at the University of Amsterdam recruited 188 volunteers who had never tried the drug, but who said they would probably soon do so. The team tested their performance in a battery of psychological exercises, including tests of attention and memory. Months later, the team went back to their volunteers and tested 58 who had since taken at least one ecstasy tablet. These subjects were matched against a similar number of controls of a similar age and history of drug use. On average, the subjects who had started to use the drug had taken around three pills in total. Despite this low dosage, the researchers found a small but statistically significant drop in the volunteers&apos; ability to remember words. This test involved reciting a list of 15 words and remembering the list 20 minutes later. Their performance in other tests was not hampered. &quot;Our data indicate that low doses of ecstasy are associated with decreased verbal memory function, which is suggestive for ecstasy-induced neurotoxicity,&quot; the authors write in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry. &quot;The main underlying factor seems to be a depletion of serotonin in ecstasy users, a depletion that might be reversible. Serotonin is involved in several cognitive functions, but might be especially relevant to learning and memory.&quot;", "sentences": ["A team led by Ben Schmand at the University of Amsterdam recruited 188 volunteers who had never tried the drug, but who said they would probably soon do so."], "title": "Ecstasy impairs memory, study shows", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jun/05/drugs.science", "tags": ["Science", "Society", "Medical research", "Drugs", "UK news", "Drugs", "Memory"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-04T23:35:49Z", "article": "J\u00fcrgen Grobler may break up one of the combinations that won gold medals for Britain in the World Cup regatta in Linz - the pair of Matt Langridge and Colin Smith - in order to strengthen his eight, who finished fifth.

Environmentalists, anarchists and NGOs (non-governmental organisations and charities) seize on the event as an opportunity to lobby for changes in the developed world&apos;s priorities. Since the death of a protester at the G8 summit in Genoa in 2001, the leaders and their teams of negotiators and diplomats are herded behind miles of perimeter fencing, protected by squadrons of police and even - it is thought - anti-aircraft missiles. Germany&apos;s bill for hosting this year&apos;s summit alone at Heiligendamm, in the former East Germany, is estimated at around \u00a368m, and this Saturday&apos;s opening demo in the nearby port city of Rostock saw stones thrown, a tear-gas response from German riot police and several hundred injuries. That sparked a call by the British Wombles - white-clad anarchists with the slogan &quot;move fast, strike harder&quot; - for protesters outside the German embassy in London today to condemn the &quot;heavy police brutality&quot;. But organisers fear that the German Black Block of anarchists, predominantly from the Kreuzberg area of old West Berlin, are intent on direct action. At Gleneagles in 2005, protesters tried to prevent the &quot;second tier&quot; of support staff, especially translators, from reaching the conference venue, but security was so tight they failed to do so. Alongside the enclosed &quot;green zone&quot; of heads of state, politicians, &quot;sherpas&quot; (negotiators who agree outline positions in advance of the summit) and translators, there is an autonomous alternative event of workshops, seminars, concerts and street demos. From Britain, the largest organised contingent of demonstrators is likely to be from Globalise Resistance, an umbrella group of activists from the anti-war, climate change and anti-globalisation movements, who are promising to &quot;spoil Tony Blair&apos;s farewell gig&quot;. However, the group has been dubbed by others as &quot;Monopolise Resistance&quot; for being dominated by contingents from the Socialist Workers party. From France, the biggest protest group is Attac, which formed in the 1990s out of a campaign for a so-called Tobin Tax on international financial transactions. With Heiligendamm out of bounds for anyone without a VIP pass, the G8 &quot;alternative summit&quot; is being held in Rostock from today until Thursday. The opening panel of the alternative G8 is &quot;Rethinking globalisation&quot; (5pm, Nikolaikirche, Rostock), with guest speaker Jean Ziegler, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, alongside Thuli Makama of Friends of the Earth Swaziland and immigration campaigner Madjiguene Ciss\u00e9 from Senegal. On Wednesday, as well as workshops and film screenings, a blockade and protest at Rostock airport are expected, as well as attempts to blockade the various entry points to the seven-mile long perimeter fence around Heilingendamm. Also on Wednesday, British Marxist professor Alex Callenicos, professor of European Studies at King&apos;s College London, lecturers on &quot;The movement for global justice - balance and perspectives&quot; on a panel that also includes Susan George of the Amsterdam-based Transnational Institute. Topical fringe meetings such as &quot;The national missile defence and eastern and middle Europe&quot; will probably find an echo at the real G8, judging by the frosty response by Russian president Vladimir Putin to US plans for missile basis in Poland and the Czech Republic. Another seminar of interest to Economist readers as much as anarchists would be &quot;Hedge funds: triggering the next financial crisis?&quot; It is also worth noting that, in accordance with its ideals, the alternative G8 will offer free round-the-clock cr\u00e8ches and fair-trade organic catering for &quot;delegates&quot;. &quot;Alternative Nobel prize&quot; winner and ecologist feminist Vandana Shiva will give the closing speech at the Nikolaikirche on Thursday.

His radicalism may have eventually distanced him from the corporate publishing establishment in the US, where he settled after 1951, but he was widely published in the New York Times, the Atlantic Monthly and the New Yorker, where his perceptive and often argumentative journalism won many admirers. Born in Amsterdam, Hans Koningsberger (he changed his name in 1970) was the grandson of the noted Dutch poet Abraham van Collem and was raised in financially straitened circumstances by his unorthodox mother (who would take him to an upmarket restaurant and treat him to the best meal available, without any means of paying). He was educated at the University of Amsterdam before pursuing further studies in Zurich and Paris. When Holland was occupied from 1940, Koning joined the Dutch Resistance, managing to escape to England, where he became one of the youngest sergeants in the British Army, serving in a tank division and working as a military interpreter during the Allied occupation of Germany. He later recalled that his wartime exposure to Nazi brutality had taught him &quot;about how the darkness of towns felt in the Middle Ages ... how people used to live &apos;one day at a time&apos;, how cold it really is in winter.&quot; After working as editor of the weekly Groene Amsterdammer, Koning accepted an invitation in 1950 to run a cultural programme on Radio Jakarta, and in 1951 he arrived in the US on a freighter from Indonesia. By now an experienced journalist, he began to concentrate on his fiction, and in 1958 The Affair was published to acclaim by Alfred Knopf. A series of novels followed, written in a characteristically terse and lucid style, dealing with failed love, political intrigue and the clash of ideologies. At the same time, in order to make a precarious living, Koning turned his hand to all manner of other writing - from studies of the Dutch Masters to children&apos;s literature. From the 1960s Koning began to specialise in the political travelogue, travelling widely in the Soviet Union, China, South America and Europe. His European cultural and linguistic background gave his writing on events in 1968 France and his native Holland an insight lacked by many US contemporaries. Nor, despite his avowedly socialist sympathies, was he a blinkered traveller; his Along the Roads of the New Russia (1968) is a considered critique of Stalinism and its legacy, while Love and Hate in China (1966), one of the first accounts of the Cultural Revolution era by a Westerner (Koning had to wait four years for a visa), is a sober and sometimes witty assessment of everyday life under Mao. Koning&apos;s political activism intensified with the Vietnam war, and he abandoned fiction in favour of what he called &quot;committed literature&quot;, helping to form the influential anti-war Resist organisation with others such as Noam Chomsky. When the war ended in 1975, he moved to London with his family in &quot;self-imposed exile&quot;, only to return to the US in 1988 (in 1978 he was naturalised as an American citizen). His long-awaited bestseller finally arrived in 1976 in the unlikely form of Columbus: His Enterprise, a highly polemical biography of the Genoese adventurer that countered the prevailing orthodoxy of heroic discovery in favour of a dark story of exploitation and fanaticism. Published by the radical New York Monthly Review Press, the book both enraged traditionalists and attracted a politically conscious generation of &quot;third world&quot; activists. When the Columbus quincentenary came around in 1992, the book sold even better, fuelling debate on the real significance of the Columbian legacy. A follow-up, The Conquest of America (1993), was also a success, but could not match the iconic status of the biography. Koning was disappointed that his fiction attracted less attention than his other writing, but four of his novels were made into films. A Walk with Love and Death, a tale of medieval plague and passion, was directed in 1969 by John Huston and marked the 15-year-old Anjelica Huston&apos;s debut, while the study of an alienated anarchist, The Revolutionary (1970), starred Jon Voight. Death of a Schoolboy (1990) was adapted by the BBC, and The Petersburg-Cannes Express (2003) was filmed in Moscow. None of these, to Koning&apos;s chagrin, gathered critical plaudits and all were more a source of trouble than pride for the novelist. Koning could be a difficult character, as a long list of editorial and political contretemps attests, but he was also an intensely loyal friend and loving husband and father. His commitment to his own form of socialism, born out of personal experience and strengthened by the cold war, never wavered but was tempered by a genuine belief that the American people - if not their political leaders - could be a force for good. This sense of optimism, together with a genuinely internationalist and cultured outlook, ran through his long and varied career. Koning is survived by his wife Kate and their children Christina and Andrew, and by two children from previous marriages. \u00b7  Hans Koning (Koningsberger), writer, born July 12 1921; died April 13 2007", "sentences": ["Born in Amsterdam, Hans Koningsberger (he changed his name in 1970) was the grandson of the noted Dutch poet Abraham van Collem and was raised in financially straitened circumstances by his unorthodox mother (who would take him to an upmarket restaurant and treat him to the best meal available, without any means of paying).", "He was educated at the University of Amsterdam before pursuing further studies in Zurich and Paris.", "He later recalled that his wartime exposure to Nazi brutality had taught him &quot;about how the darkness of towns felt in the Middle Ages ... how people used to live &apos;one day at a time&apos;, how cold it really is in winter.&quot; After working as editor of the weekly Groene Amsterdammer, Koning accepted an invitation in 1950 to run a cultural programme on Radio Jakarta, and in 1951 he arrived in the US on a freighter from Indonesia."], "title": "Obituary:  Hans Koning", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jun/06/guardianobituaries.media", "tags": ["Media", "Newspapers & magazines", "Books"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-06T15:41:16Z", "article": "Why should the news of a newly discovered Holocaust diary ring alarm bells? Surely, the discovery of a 60-page diary, chronicling the life of a Jewish girl, Rutka Laskier, in the Bedzin ghetto, can only be a good thing, adding further to our knowledge of life in the smaller Polish ghettoes at that time?  After all, the Bedzin ghetto is not as well known as the larger Warsaw or Lodz ghettoes, both of which have been the subject of recently-translated eyewitness accounts. Rutka&apos;s diary offers us a view of ghetto life in the very eye of the storm, Nazi-occupied Poland in early 1943, just before the Bedzin ghetto was liquidated. Why complain? To be fair, it is not Rutka&apos;s diary that gives cause for concern but the way in which its discovery has been reported. First, there is the troubling Anne Frank connection. In 1943, Rutka was the same age as Anne. Her father, like Otto Frank, was the family&apos;s only survivor, although in this case he had nothing to do with the publicity that has greeted the discovery of the diary. There are obvious parallels, but Anne Frank&apos;s diary brings a lot of baggage. The Broadway play and Hollywood film based on her story had much to do with the Americanisation of the Holocaust in the 1950s. It shifted our attention away from the ghettos and death camps of Poland to a few individuals in Amsterdam, drawing our gaze from the larger process of the Final Solution and questions about bureaucracy and the nature of Nazism. There is another parallel. Much of the interest in Anne Frank was to do with the story of a young girl approaching womanhood and her experience of first love. The coverage of Rutka&apos;s diary has wasted no time getting to this aspect of the story: &quot;She described her crush on a boy named Janek and the anticipation of a first kiss,&quot; runs the Associated Press story, which goes on to quote this passage: &quot;I think my womanhood has awoken in me. That means, yesterday when I was taking a bath and the water stroked my body, I longed for someone&apos;s hands to stroke me... I didn&apos;t know what it was, I have never had such sensations until now.&quot; This is the Holocaust as chick-lit, bringing a disturbing element of sex and voyeurism. Finally, most reports have mentioned that Rutka shared her diary with her Christian friend Stanislawa Sapinska. One account relates how the girls &quot;formed a deep bond&quot;. It is important that there are positive stories about Jewish-Polish relations from the war. However, this is a minefield and we should be careful. The Bedzin ghetto is in Kielce province. Kielce is best known as the site of the worst Polish anti-semitic pogrom after the war. We should give due emphasis to deep bonds between Poles and Jews, but we should not rush too fast and forget a darker history. In each case - the emphasis on Anne Frank, on a young girl&apos;s sexual awakening and Jewish-Christian relations - first reports have rushed too fast and been too predictable.

The point Robert Winston raises on the introduction of new IVF technologies is, however, extremely important and concerns millions of subfertile couples all over the world ( IVF clinics corrupt and greedy, May 31). The costly screening technique he refers to, which uses fluorescent markers to stain defective parts of an embryo&apos;s chromosomes, is usually called pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS). It is an invasive technique in which one or two cells of an embryo are removed, and has been introduced into clinical practice without a shred of evidence on its effectiveness. Still, this technique is widely offered to many desperate women in many parts of the world. The reaction of the HFEA on Winston&apos;s criticism is, in our view, completely off the mark when they state that &quot;no procedure throughout medicine goes into mass use without some sort of leap of faith&quot;. In civilised countries regulatory bodies like the HFEA demand that new technologies, especially if they are expensive, invasive and possibly harmful, are only introduced after properly designed, randomised trials have demonstrated safety and effectiveness. This has not yet been done for PGS and we will have to await the results of proper trials to see if PGS has any effect whatsoever. Winston&apos;s appeal should be heard by all concerned, especially authorities whose task it is to protect patients from technology of unproven value. Unfortunately, the commercial setting of IVF in most countries make an academic approach to effectiveness and safety exceptional.

The 61st Edinburgh Festival Fringe was launched this morning, finally revealing to the world the great and good impoverishing themselves this summer in the name of art. With hundreds of shows battling for attention, the average audience for many still being a drunkard and his theatrically-inclined dog, it&apos;s understandable that more obscure companies or first-timers would want to stand out from the rest of the frantic Fringe pack. This used to take the form of a desperate tussle over having the title with the most &quot;A&quot;s in it, meaning a (sadly non-existent) show called AAAARRGHH! An Alcoholic Aardvark Hits Amsterdam would pip all others to being listed first in the programme. This year such alphabetical frolics have faded but the usual parade of zany, gimmicky or downright ludicrous names and concepts are there again, sat snugly within the programme and screaming out for some love and affection. Probably topping the list for sheer dubiousness is Cabaret Auschwitz, billed as &quot;The songs! The torture! The brothel!&quot; and likely to be a rather pathetic case of shock over substance. Then there is A (Gay Disabled Transexual) Love Story Told To A Ticket Inspector At Alton Towers, a tale of two men taking a ride on Nemesis after having gender reassignment, and the rather self-explanatory The Matrix: The Pantomime. Fringe performers, ever quick to tie in with recent political events, are this year serving up not one but two musical treatments of the life and times of Tony Blair; ASBO: The Musical and Chav! It&apos;s a Musical Innit will also presumably subject his social policies to a rigorous critique. Jihad: The Musical, including songs such as I Wanna Be Like Osama, seems so crashingly obvious that it might just turn out to be good, while I&apos;m A Lab Rat: Get Me Out Of Here! tackles the perils of signing one&apos;s life away to laboratory testing. Of course you should never (usually) judge a show by its title. The hundreds of low-budget shows is part of the beauty of the Fringe, and wading through the theatrical turd to discover a glimmering diamond is far more rewarding than sticking with the tried and tested. But more often than not a gimmicky title will merely be a crude fig-leaf for a weak or occasionally desperate production, turning away more punters than it attracts.

The four will team up with the leading British pair of Colin Smith and Matthew Langridge and two other squad rowers. Grobler said his radical move was designed to shake up the squad in the short-term and that he still expected his four to defend their world title in August. Grobler was at pains to point out that his decision was not borne out of a desire to create a new &quot;super-eight&quot; and mount a challenge for Olympic gold in rowing&apos;s blue-riband event, but rather to give his four a new learning experience and improve their speed. Yesterday Grobler said: &quot;In the first place this strategy is based on the four.

With a minimum investment of $10 (just over a fiver), you don&apos;t need to be in the Simon Cowell wealth league to take part. SellaBand.com has been billed as the latest online revolution in the way we listen to music. It allows people to buy &quot;shares&quot; in acts they think have the potential to be the chart-toppers of tomorrow. When the amount invested in an act hits the $50,000 (\u00a325,200) mark, they go into a studio to record an album - which is then sold worldwide - and the fans sit back and wait for the money to start rolling in. That&apos;s the theory, anyway. SellaBand has grown rapidly since it was launched in August last year; it now boasts more than 4,000 bands and solo artists, and around 12,500 &quot;believers&quot; (investor fans) around the world, who have between them handed over more than \u00a3400,000 of real money in less than 10 months. It&apos;s like a &quot;social networking&quot; website such as MySpace with the added entrepreneurial buzz of eBay. SellaBand is the latest in a long line of &quot;alternative investments&quot; that have ranged from buying a share of a racehorse to financing a West End show. While many of these are hugely risky ventures where people have been known to lose their shirts, the SellaBand model doesn&apos;t involve stumping up huge sums and believers can get their money back at any time until the $50,000 goal is reached. So, how does it work, who&apos;s behind it, and what are the catches? SellaBand was the brainchild of Dutch music lover Pim Betist, who teamed up with two former Sony Music big cheeses to make his dream a reality. It is registered as a German company but based in Amsterdam. The founders say the site allows unsigned acts and their fans to go into business together, sharing in the financial as well as artistic success. Participating bands and solo artists upload a maximum of three demo songs. They do not have to pay to sign up, and all genres of music appear to be welcomed. Each act issues 5,000 &quot;parts&quot; (shares) costing $10 each. Music fans can log on and listen to tracks for free, and, if they like what they hear, they can buy one or more parts of that artist&apos;s music. They then officially become a &quot;believer&quot;. Fans can buy parts of as many acts as they like, and are able to chop and change their investments or pull out altogether. If and when an artist hits the magic $50,000 - and many probably won&apos;t come close - no other investors are able to come on board, and the money raised will be used to finance the recording of an album in a state-of-the-art studio and pay for the services of a top producer and A&amp;R person. Limited edition CDs of the recording will be sent to the artist&apos;s believers. This is where the fans can start to get a return on their investment (see below). Last weekend, New Zealand rapper Maitreya became the sixth artist to break through the $50,000 barrier, and the first two finished SellaBand albums - by Dutch gothic rock band Nemesea and Hawaiian singer-songwriter cubworld - are due out later this month. The British act with the most parts sold are rock band Trail, who have landed a slot at the 02 Wireless Festival in London next Friday. Lead singer Charlie Afif says they love the site because it gives them a chance to communicate with real fans. &quot;It&apos;s certainly something you can&apos;t ignore. It&apos;s real people at the end of this. They are giving you feedback and putting their money where their mouth is.&quot; However, the band is also investigating other routes to making it big. Ben Perreau, editor of music site NME.com, says: &quot;The audience want to have their say about what&apos;s going on. It was only a matter of time before music fans wanted to start getting paid for what they are doing.&quot; Not everyone is convinced, however. A recent Guardian Unlimited article poured scorn on SellaBand&apos;s business model. But some would say that cutting fat-cat record label bosses out of the equation and handing power and potential profits to ordinary fans can only be a good thing.  Case study of a believer: &apos;I can influence the success of my chosen artist&apos; Adrian Webb and wife Penny have invested around \u00a3740 in SellaBand artists, with \u00a3500 riding on a Portuguese act called Travellers, whose music is described as &quot;lounge chill-out with a bit of world fusion&quot;. &quot;He&apos;s my tip for the top,&quot; says Mr Webb. &quot;I&apos;m convinced he can make it into the cool chill-out TV commercial space, like Moby did with Play, so I&apos;ve invested quite a bit and am working hard to get him noticed. &quot;The beauty of SellaBand is that investors can influence the success of their chosen artists by sharing their music with friends, on MySpace, etc,&quot; says Mr Webb, head of corporate communications at insurer esure. How it works This is how fans will supposedly make money. Acts that reach the goal of $50,000 (\u00a325,200) raised go into a studio to record a CD. Copies will then be sold online and at gigs for $10, of which $2 is shared between the artist&apos;s &quot;believers&quot;. These fans can make extra cash by encouraging friends and others to buy copies. For every CD they sell, the believer will pocket $1 commission. Three of the CD&apos;s tracks will be available as free downloads on Sellaband&apos;s download portal. There will be adverts on this portal, and all the advertising revenue will be shared equally between the artists, believers and SellaBand, though how much you get will depend on your artist&apos;s &quot;market share&quot; on the portal. The more their music is downloaded, the more you can make. The catch is that the income you receive from the act you have nurtured could well dry up after just one year. That is because SellaBand will, after 12 months, hand over the full rights to the master recording to the artist, who is free to walk away and do whatever they want with it. And the artist only has to make their songs available for free download for one year. If your act signs a multi-million-pound deal with EMI, you don&apos;t get a slice of that action. In contrast to the fans, SellaBand&apos;s founders could potentially carry on raking in the readies for decades. They get 30% of the publishing income &quot;for life of copyright&quot; - ie, forever (this clause only relates to the songs recorded with SellaBand). The site&apos;s founders also earn interest on the money paid upfront by believers. As an investment proposition, SellaBand is probably best regarded as a premium bond-style flutter rather than a serious money-making opportunity. The site&apos;s managing director Johan Vosmeijer says: &quot;Everybody asks us, &apos;Is SellaBand going to make me rich?&apos; We say, &apos;Don&apos;t quit the day job.&apos; The model is unproven in that respect.

In a moving exchange with presenter Kirsty Young on Radio 4&apos;s Desert Island Discs today, the 74-year-old talks about her feelings of isolation during the years when, as a wife of one of the Beatles, her influence was vilified and her work widely ridiculed in this country. She also reveals that she considered aborting her only son, Sean, after she fell pregnant when the couple reunited following two years apart. Her chaotic on-off relationship with the Beatle, and her belief that he would not want a child was, she says, the reason for her indecision and something which prompted her to give John the final say: &apos;I thought I should let John decide whether to keep it or not. We&apos;d just got back together and I became pregnant, and I didn&apos;t know if it was the right moment to have a child. I just didn&apos;t want to burden him with something he didn&apos;t want.&apos; Lennon was quite cross with her about her doubts, she tells Young. Ono goes on to reveal details of the last conversation she had with Lennon in December 1980 before he was murdered by an obsessive fan, Mark Chapman, outside their Manhattan apartment block. She selects a couple of unlikely English tunes, including the Gracie Fields number &apos;When I Grow too Old to Dream&apos;, for her desert island stay, and also picks out the song &apos;Beautiful Boy&apos; to stand for the great body of her husband&apos;s work. Written just before his death for the Double Fantasy album, it is about his love for Sean. He was the subject of their last conversation before the shooting, Ono said. &apos;We were returning from the studio and I said, &quot;Should we go and have dinner before we go home?&quot;, and John was saying, &quot;No, let&apos;s go home because I want to see Sean before he goes to sleep.&quot; And it was like he wasn&apos;t sure if we would get home before he went to sleep and he was concerned about that. &apos;That was the last thing he said, that he wanted to see Sean.&apos; One of her other musical choices is the Edith Piaf tour de force, &apos;Non, je ne Regrette Rien&apos;. Ono recalls her mother used to tell her as a child that because she was headstrong and small &apos;even for a Japanese person&apos; she reminded her of Piaf. In a conciliatory gesture towards Paul McCartney, the surviving half of the most successful songwriting duo of all time, she tells Young that it was &apos;very nice&apos; of Paul to say he has revised his opinion of her. Speaking of the notorious &apos;bed-in&apos; session that took place nearly 40 years ago when she and her new husband were holed up in a room at the Amsterdam Hilton, Ono says she believes the couple were &apos;narcissistic&apos; to believe that the world&apos;s press should come to them to hear their views about the need for world peace. &apos;We didn&apos;t need the publicity,&apos; she says, going on to say that while the event had its ludicrous side, she still believes they were doing &apos;a very good thing&apos;. Lennon met Ono in London in 1966 when he visited her art show and asked if he could be the first to &apos;interact&apos; with one of her installations by hammering a nail into a blank wooden block. She tells Young she refused because the exhibition had not opened to the public and then relented. A year later they had &apos;fallen madly in love&apos; and were working together, behind the back of Lennon&apos;s first wife, Cynthia, on their Two Virgins album. At the time many Beatles fans blamed Ono, who was already in her early thirties, for the break-up of the band and for the changes they saw in Lennon. &apos;It was hurtful in a way; it helped that I had John by my side ... it did seem that those things were happening in the distance. What was said out there didn&apos;t hurt so much.&apos; Ono confirms that she believes racist attitudes in this country were part of the problem, but she argues too that much of the animosity towards her stemmed from the proprietorial feelings the public had about their four &apos;mop tops&apos; from Liverpool. She denies the suggestion that she tried to change her husband. &apos;He was a very, very strong man,&apos; she says. &apos;I was just there loving him.&apos; At the time she met Lennon, Ono was an established artist. She insists she had no idea who Lennon was at first, but as she began to realise the level of his fame she became deeply fearful about the way the relationship would affect her life. &apos;I think that in 1967, when we started, I felt scared about getting involved - that he was a Beatle. It dawned on me that it would be a different situation and I might lose my freedom.&apos; Others who opened up on the show November 1998: Asked whether Scientology would help her to survive as a castaway, Nicole Kidman replied: &apos;No ... Catholicism will keep me going.&apos; March 1996: Sue Lawley asked Gordon Brown: &apos;People want to know whether you&apos;re gay or whether there&apos;s some flaw in your personality that you haven&apos;t made a relationship.&apos; Brown said that he just hadn&apos;t found the right person yet. October 2003: Then Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy was asked about his supposed heavy-drinking. He put the rumours down to his Scottish heritage: &apos;If you&apos;re a red-headed Highlander, that&apos;s one caricature that can apply.

In Paris, where I live part of the time, the streets themselves are a museum. Have you done anything cultural lately? I saw Tom Stoppard&apos;s The Coast of Utopia at the Beaumont Theatre in New York. It really evoked the atmosphere of post-revolution Russia - a time when people truly hoped the world was going to be different. What cultural form leaves you cold? Blockbuster movies.

Frankly, things were little better in New York. The Goethe Institut on the Upper East Side - of all places! - was exhibiting photos of Iraqi war wounded juxtaposed with totally inappropriate scenes from M*A*S*H. A tour guide at the United Nations made some frankly politicised comments about the \u00a31trillion-plus spent on arms each year - and just outside the security council chamber, too. To cap it all, the New York Times had Iraq on the front page every day, and it wasn&apos;t printing much of the good news. Disgusted, the Backbencher bought a $2 UN desk pennant and is deliberating where to burn it. Suggestions on a postcard, please, care of the Guardian dog-pound. LEVY LEAVING The Backbencher hopes the Palestinians can sort their Gaza squabbles out in time for Lord Levy&apos;s fundraiser - sorry, leaving do - next Tuesday. Being Tony&apos;s Middle Eastern envoy was never going to be easy, but at least he&apos;ll get a decent send-off.

Iraq,&quot; he told an audience at Chatham House yesterday in the mother of all Freudian slips. Permatan realised too late that Tony&apos;s lasting legacy was his own beat, Northern Ireland. &quot;It has been a long leadership contest,&quot; he explained. Don&apos;t worry, Peter - things will soon quieten down.

And MPs could satisfy themselves that offering the plebs a chance to feed slot machines is not just a great tax-raising wheeze but a thoroughly sophisticated and laudable pursuit. UP THE GARDEN PATH This is the top line of the Department of Health&apos;s admission last week that it was nowhere near its 18-week target for patients waiting to be treated after referral: &quot;Data is being published for the first time on Referral to Treatment (RTT) times for patients whose 18 week clock stopped during the month with an inpatient/day case admission.&quot; To clarify this Audenesque metaphor: &quot;The assessment compares the number of completed admitted pathways with a known clock start reported in the RTT return against the expected number of admitted pathways.&quot; SNOW TRIAL One of the reasons why it&apos;s taking so long to empty Gitmo, according to ex-Fox News presidential mouthpiece Tony Snow, is the risk they might be locked up without any rights when they get back. &quot;When you return them, they have to be returned to a nation that will, in fact, respect their human rights and their civil rights in the disposition of these cases,&quot; explained Snow yesterday. &quot;Sometimes those conditions are not met.&quot; While it was good to learn that the US is rethinking those extraordinary renditions, the Backbencher is left to wonder: is no trial better than a show trial? Is no charge better than false charges? Maybe that&apos;s one for the incarcerated guys themselves to ponder. They&apos;ve got the time. LAST WEEK&apos;S COMPETITION The Backbencher teasingly asked how long Scooter could expect to serve in the slammer. As many of you pointed out, he was sentenced to 30 months - &quot;nearly long enough to get a university degree in something suitable like public ethics, if he applies himself,&quot; notes Nick Taylor. But with good behaviour, he could be out earlier. And that&apos;s if he doesn&apos;t receive a presidential pardon. Personally, the Backbencher thinks a 20-year cell-share with Paris Hilton and Paris Hilton&apos;s dogs would serve as an appropriate punishment. Now that&apos;s what she calls a penitentiary. &quot;Why is 30 months Scooter Libby&apos;s only true sentence?&quot; asks Jamie Yeager. &quot;Because all the ones uttered in his defence were lies.&quot; Oh, very good. Jamie wins the book. The Backbencher misspelt the name of last week&apos;s winner, Tanjil Rashid. Apologies. THIS WEEK&apos;S COMPETITION This week, the Backbencher has a copy of Ian Buruma&apos;s Murder in Amsterdam: The Death of Theo Van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance to give away, courtesy of Atlantic Books.

Officers in Portugal are investigating the letter&apos;s claims and are poised to visit Odiaxere. Dutch police said part of the reason the letter was being taken so seriously was because it was similar to one sent to the same newspaper last June following the disappearance from the city of Liege, in Belgium, of two girls: Stacy Lemmens, seven, and Natalie Mahy, 10. In that case the author claimed to know where the girls had been buried.

Abdallah Ait Oud, a convicted child rapist, was eventually arrested for the murders. The DNA of a third person was found on the bodies. There was evidence that Natalie had been raped. Sita Koenders, from the Dutch police headquarters in Amsterdam, said today De Telegraaf had received the letter on Monday and passed it straight to the police. &quot;We carried out forensic investigations straight away and, as soon as the report from the forensic tests came in, we sent it to the Portuguese police.

The sentencing at Liverpool crown court came after one of the biggest ever investigations by Revenue &amp; Customs into a VAT fraud that involved nearly 100 mobile phone traders. Raymond Cox from Staffordshire; Brett Issitt and Michael McNeill from Lancashire; Paul Sweeney, who lived in Amsterdam; Peter Glover of Warwickshire, and Colin Jones from Cheshire were jailed for between five and 12 and a half years. &quot;This was a conspiracy which overall cost the taxpayer a colossal sum of money,&quot; said Judge Swift as he handed down the sentences. &quot;There was nothing genuinely commercial about any of it. It was fraud on a vast scale.&quot; The men were directors of companies that imported mobile phones free of VAT, sold them on and disappeared without paying the VAT. The fraud went on for several years, with phones repeatedly imported and exported and the VAT stolen each time. Revenue &amp; Customs investigators began tracking the trades across Britain, Germany, Ireland, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands in 2000. The court heard how the number of trades expanded so rapidly that those involved had trouble following what they were doing.

Take advantage of these gaps with a spot of&apos;catch cropping&apos;. When you have dug up your &apos;first early&apos; potatoes this month, there will be room for a crop of quick growing peas like &apos;Early Onward&apos; or &apos;Kelveden Wonder&apos; to harvest in September. Protect against mice, as they like to run away with the seeds, and pigeons, as they pull young plants straight out of the ground.&apos;  &apos;Carrots &apos;Early Nantes&apos; and &apos;Amsterdam Forcing&apos; are great for successional sowing. You will get &apos;baby&apos; carrots in 10 weeks. As the dreaded carrot fly always travels low and in straight lines so you can coolly outwit it by erecting a barrier about 75cm (2ft 6ins) high around the carrot patch.&apos;  &apos;Another quick gap filler is &apos;baby&apos; beet (8 - 10 weeks). Try &apos;Pronto&apos; and &apos;Kestrel&apos; F1. There is time for another crop of dwarf French beans (10 - 12 weeks). Lettuces enjoy growing under the light shade cast by sweet corn in summer.&apos;  &apos;If you are quick, you can get in another crop of rocket (6 weeks). Stop in August as it bolts in the heat. Try &apos;Sprint&apos;.&apos;  &apos;I usually grow cut-and-come-again salad mixes in containers with new compost. This cuts out any danger of finding weeds in your salad.

If his \u00a345bn bid for Dutch rival ABN Amro is successful, he is in line to become the boss of the world&apos;s fifth-largest bank; if he loses, as some are warning he will, to a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland, he could find himself out of a job and Barclays itself vulnerable to a takeover. The 51-year-old grey-haired banker refuses to be downbeat about the RBS consortium gatecrashing his dream deal with a higher offer, laden with cash to appeal to ABN Amro shareholders. &quot;I haven&apos;t been surprised by anything that&apos;s occurred in the last three or four months [since the ABN Amro bid was announced]. If other people express an interest in it, then so be it,&quot; he says. The battle for ABN Amro has become &quot;pretty much all-consuming&quot;. &quot;You know how it is, if you have the adrenaline from doing something you believe in strongly then it keeps you going.&quot; Adrenaline is something he is likely to need in spades. The fight for control of the Dutch bank has become locked in the courts. Late in July the Dutch supreme court is expected to rule whether the ABN Amro board can sell the bank&apos;s US subsidiary, LaSalle, without a vote by ABN Amro shareholders. The LaSalle sale was a side deal pulled off by Barclays to help bolster its all-share offer and see off any rival bidders. It has backfired. Taken to the courts by ABN Amro shareholders who regarded it as a poison pill, the once so-clever deal has become a complicating factor. Until the court decision the bid seems to be at a stalemate but the uncertainty is giving Barclays shareholders the chance to get cold feet and question the price being paid. One activist investor is urging Varley to drop the bid. Red braces Without his jacket but sporting his trademark high-waisted trousers and bright red braces, Varley acknowledges the stakes are high. &quot;I think you&apos;ve got to be realistic if you embark on something like this. You&apos;ve always got to accept the possibility that somebody else will compete and you shouldn&apos;t be disconcerted by that.&quot; The Oxford-educated banker initiated talks with ABN Amro less than a year after he became chief executive in September 2004, although they did not begin in earnest until this year. His promotion to the top job, having been previously passed over at least once, followed a varied career with the bank which he joined in 1982 after a brief spell as a solicitor. An aloof intellectual who boarded at prep school before going to Catholic school Downside, Varley has close ties with the bank through his marriage to Carolyn Pease, whose Quaker family sold their bank to Barclays in the 1900s. He had one year of absence in 1994 when he went to work for Odey Asset Management, run by his sister-in-law&apos;s husband. Work at Barclays had got on top of him. &quot;I was deputy head of equities in BZW [the now defunct investment arm]. A lot of what we wanted to achieve was done. I was feeling quite worn out at the time. I&apos;ve never had that experience before or since. I find my work energising but I went through a period then when I didn&apos;t. I needed to do something different.&quot; The year&apos;s absence did his career no harm: he came back to take on a number of senior roles, including running the retail bank, and became finance director. Questions about the family connection seem to frustrate him. When asked how he met his wife, who gave him his passion for fishing, he retorts: &quot;I can&apos;t remember.&quot; Clearly he can and it is more a reflection of an inability to be rude, when what he would rather say is: &quot;It&apos;s none of your business.&quot; The family connection was raised when the bid for ABN Amro was announced and analysts accused him of being motivated by &quot;ego and politics&quot; to satisfy his in-laws. A search for his motivation for the bid is perhaps also behind rumours that he embarked on it to rein in his boardroom colleague - some say adversary - Bob Diamond by building up the retail and commercial banking parts of the Barclays empire, which are not within Diamond&apos;s large remit. Varley sighs: &quot;I hear some of those comments. They don&apos;t trouble me much. We are very clear about what we&apos;re after here. You can&apos;t move on something as significant as this if you don&apos;t have your executive committee and your board full-square behind you.&quot; Formidable pairing If the bid is successful, Varley will move his &quot;centre of gravity&quot; to Amsterdam, moving to the Dutch city but leaving his wife and two children behind to complete school. Members of his executive team will follow, as will an undisclosed number of people from the hi-tech Canary Wharf headquarters where Varley runs his empire from the 31st floor and four times a year challenges staff to a table tennis match against himself and Paul Idzik, the eccentric chief operating officer and former world-ranking tennis player. The passion for ping pong comes from his school days. Otherwise calm and collected, he can barely hide his competitive streak. &quot;Idzik and I are a formidable pairing,&quot; he says, though conceding they do not always win. It would be easy to accuse Varley of being a Barclays lifer who would be reluctant to instigate change. He acknowledges the concern. &quot;What you say to yourself is that someone who has been there a long time is a prisoner to the organisation and won&apos;t have the will to change it.&quot; In reality, he has made more changes than many had predicted, most visibly in refreshing the top management team and squeezing out one-time internal rivals for the top job. Below board level, he has brought in Deanna Oppenheimer from the US to revitalise the sluggish high street bank and he credits her with having a &quot;massive and positive effect&quot;. &quot;She is followed by people who respect her,&quot; Varley adds, and goes on to talk about the 60% of the Barclays workforce who are female. &quot;There aren&apos;t enough of them at the top,&quot; he says. He has two &quot;women&apos;s listening groups&quot; where he goes to, well, listen. Varley used to run the retail business that is now Oppenheimer&apos;s domain. He is still remembered for closing 171 branches on one day in April 2000, at the same time as the bank was changing the way it charged for cash machine withdrawals, introducing a potentially lucrative pay scheme for top executives and firing 6,000 staff. In an interview on Radio 4&apos;s Today programme he was skewered on the bonus question by an extremely combative John Humphrys. The episode is now used by public relations executives as an example of how not to do it. Varley admits the episode was a &quot;difficult experience&quot;. &quot;I accept we got it wrong and I learned a lot from that.&quot; Around this time, Barclays also bought Woolwich, which has since lost mortgage customers and is being used by critics of the ABN Amro takeover to justify their scepticism. The retail bank, like others, is being swamped by customers reclaiming overdraft fees. While it is hard to imagine Varley has ever had an overdraft, he stresses that 85% of customers who ask for a free overdraft get one. The retail bank has shrunk in importance from the days when Varley ran it. Then it generated 70% of Barclays&apos; \u00a32.4bn profits. Seven years on, it generates 20% of the \u00a37.1bn profits, after Varley set the bank on a drive to earn more than 50% of its revenue overseas. To him, the takeover of ABN Amro is a continuation of the grand international plan even though the deal has surprised many who had grown used to his mantra that acquisitions are the &quot;servant of strategy not the master&quot;. His dream deal may yet end in tears. But Varley insists he can keep a cool head. &quot;We&apos;re exhilarated by the deal but not in love with something we can&apos;t walk away from. If you fall in love with an opportunity then you are tempted to do something on the wrong terms and we are very clear about the financial tests we apply,&quot; he says. If the bid fails he insists it will be business as usual. &quot;Our strategy will be exactly the same. It&apos;s right for Barclays to look at this from a position of strength. That means if we decide not to go ahead we can walk away without feeling we are in some strategic cul-de-sac.&quot; Some believe failure could leave Barclays a sitting duck. Varley disputes this but adds: &quot;What board would command confidence from its shareholders if it was not prepared to consider acquisitions?&quot; Few are prepared to predict the outcome of the fiendishly complex battle but some warn it may turn out to be a risk too far for Varley, a man usually so cautious he sets his watch 10 minutes fast - he finds it &quot;reassuring&quot;. That 10-minute head start may be just what he needs in the weeks ahead. CV Born April 1 1956 Education Downside School; Oriel College, Oxford.

Boab Coyle, recently laid off from his job, meets God in an Edinburgh pub, a white-bearded geezer who looks like a folk singer, &quot;maybe the boy in the Dubliners&quot;. Boab seizes the opportunity to blame God for his own and the world&apos;s ills, which provokes a gutsy response: &quot;That cunt Nietzsche wis wide ay the mark whin he sais ah wis deid. Ah&apos;m no deid; ah jist dinnae gie a fuck.&quot; After some more of what the big man calls &quot;philosophical fuckin discourse&quot;, he turns Boab into a fly, later to be swatted by his mother. &quot;What I&apos;ve always been able to do,&quot; Welsh says, sipping from a glass of still water in a Dublin restaurant, &quot;is to put people in extreme situations. I like to see how, when people are in a bad position, they can just make it worse. That&apos;s been my overwhelming interest.&quot; Welsh is just back from Miami Beach, where he has a house. &quot;It kinda takes the edge off the winter.&quot; His new collection of stories, If You Liked School, You&apos;ll Love Work, contains plenty of characters who would know where the beer-drinking God was coming from. In the opening tale, &quot;Rattlesnakes&quot;, two men and a woman are travelling through an American desert, when one of the men gets a venomous snakebite on his penis. The other performs some elementary first aid with a knife, but &quot;we ain&apos;t finished yet. Somebody&apos;s gonna have to suck that poison out.&quot; They look at the woman, who snaps, &quot;Don&apos;t even think about it.&quot; There is nothing else but for laddish solidarity to prove the quality of its mercy. Meanwhile, a pair of armed, homophobic Mexicans are approaching the improvised operating theatre ... The ability to turn disgust to comic effect is one of his two main strengths. The other is an unstoppable narrative inventiveness which, as James Lasdun wrote in the Guardian last year, &quot;continually amuses and amazes&quot;. The straight route from imagination to page marks Welsh out as a natural writer. It is a gift that is perhaps less often remarked on than what he contentedly refers to as his &quot;scatological, misanthropic&quot; subject matter, though it surely plays as great a part in his popularity. The novelist Ali Smith describes Welsh&apos;s style as &quot;all force, authenticity and highlight - a potent meld of realist-symbolist which can take on violence, hypocrisy, spin and corruption with high-kicking pleasure&quot;. If You Liked School is his ninth work of fiction since 1993, when Trainspotting made him the voice of a generation that seemed to onlookers to swing between ecstasy - Welsh&apos;s fourth book is named after the drug - and despair. The episodic Trainspotting was Welsh&apos;s first proper publication and, unusually for such a self-assured debut, his first real effort at writing. &quot;Once I decided this is what I&apos;m gonna do, this is what I&apos;m gonna write about, in this way, I was very confident. There was no doubt about it, that it would work out and get published, though obviously I didn&apos;t know how successful it was going to be.&quot; He writes quickly, &quot;blasting&quot; the first draft &quot;straight out my head, without looking back, whether it&apos;s a story or a novel&quot;, then chipping around the bulk to get the effects. &quot;My wife says to me: &apos;I never see you write, but suddenly you&apos;ve got a stack of stuff.&apos; I think it&apos;s because it tends to happen quite early in the morning: I&apos;ll get up and batter away, and I&apos;ll take stuff out with me and work on it. It just seems to get up there slowly, without me being aware of it. I&apos;ll suddenly think, &apos;Well, this is supposed to be a novel. I&apos;m just going to stay in for two weeks and finish it.&apos;&quot; In addition to fiction, he has written for the stage and screen, with an increasing emphasis on film. In recent years, he has directed some short films, including one for the Keane single &quot;Atlantic&quot;. At the same time, he has established a pattern of moving house every few years. Before Dublin - where his second wife, Beth Quinn, an American, studies at University College - he lived in Chicago, &quot;and before that San Francisco, and before that London, and before that Amsterdam&quot;. Before any of it, there was the Edinburgh housing scheme that gave him a subject matter and a style. There weren&apos;t many books at home, though his parents were readers, &quot;because we lived in a council flat and there was no shelf space. Books were never seen as things that you held on to. Tatty paperbacks would come in, and somebody would read them and pass them on.&quot; Welsh might be seen as a late development of the seditious tradition in Scottish literature: from Robert Burns, whose obscene lyrics could not be published in his lifetime, through the cultural revolutionary Hugh MacDiarmid, to the Glasgow writers James Kelman and Tom Leonard, who were among the first to make a political cause out of idiomatic speech. At Ainslie Park secondary school in Edinburgh (now closed), Welsh didn&apos;t stand out, though he was not discouraged. &quot;There was just no real point of reference. I mean, people were great storytellers where I grew up, and in my family, but it was just never in the culture to write it down.&quot; The bridge that spanned the gap was music. &quot;I got into writing songs for bands, including songs that told stories.&quot; A surprise element of the Welsh phenomenon - as with that of his one-time fellow citizen JK Rowling - has been the revelation of a large appetite for reading among young people. Welsh was a member of a group that included Alan Warner, Gordon Legge, Duncan McLean - editor of the Clocktower pamphlets and a writer himself - and Kevin Williamson, founder of the magazine Rebel Inc. They were partly inspired by the older-generation Glasgow school, but with the additional feeling of &quot;this dissatisfaction about being in Scotland at the time. The devolution thing had blown up in everybody&apos;s face in 1979, and there was this &quot;we wuz robbed&quot; mentality. That galvanised people to express themselves. Then again, a lot of it was to do with House music. People were energised by that. And in Edinburgh in the 1980s, there were loads of readings and poets&apos; performances going on. I don&apos;t know if it happens now. I&apos;m a bit out of the scene.&quot; Drugs were an important part of that scene, but Welsh, who will turn 50 in 2008, is happy to admit that he&apos;s out of that scene, too. There is no mischievous urge to play the bad boy over heroin, which he took for a relatively short period, &quot;from ignorance, really. I had no knowledge of what the long-term ramifications of doing that would be. I stopped at the right time, just as it became mainstream. A lot of people I grew up with would say to me: &apos;Oh you&apos;re mad touching that stuff.&apos; Five years later they were all on it.&quot; If somebody at a party offered him heroin now, &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be interested. Once you&apos;ve broken the physical addiction to a drug, there&apos;s got to be a psychological thing to make you go back. Whatever was driving me to heroin at that time doesn&apos;t exist any more.&quot; The whatever involved &quot;bereavements and relationship breakdowns and other stuff I didn&apos;t have the emotional range to process&quot;. He was more outlandish as a person, he says, before he began to write. &quot;It&apos;s like, instead of the world being your laboratory, the page becomes your laboratory.&quot; Welsh&apos;s fans will be pleased to learn that increased maturity has not diminished the impulse to pinpoint people&apos;s tendency to brutalise and humiliate their neighbours. The disgust quotient in his new book of stories is as high as ever: no bodily function is left uninspected, no self-abasement escapes scrutiny, no self-interest is passed over. The state of relations between the sexes has scarcely evolved since Trainspotting A few characters in If You Liked School do find a sort of equilibrium, mostly after ignoring, if not creating, a state of dereliction in those who surround them. Welsh&apos;s gift for ventriloquism takes him to the English expat community in Tenerife, to Chicago, and to the former mining town of Cowdenbeath in Fife, home of druggies, paedophiles, transvestites, dog-fighting gangsters and worshippers of human skulls. In an afterword, the mellower Welsh politely distances this jovial hell from &quot;the real Cowdenbeath&quot;. From Swift&apos;s Modest Proposal to William Burroughs&apos;s Naked Lunch, literary critics have defended the seemingly indefensible as highly moral, and Welsh&apos;s fiction is no exception. Ali Smith, whose work appeared in the Clocktower pamphlets, says: &quot;I think if Dickens were alive now, he&apos;d take something like the shape of Welsh: the social democracy deep in what he writes, the emphasis on ethics, the readability, the reinvention of and simultaneous analysis of contemporary language and culture which shifts his writing every time close to parable.&quot; Welsh himself is of the view that it is &quot;quite hard to be immoral as a writer. It&apos;s difficult to think of books that are made to do harm. Maybe some political pamphlets, or a book like Mein Kampf, but to write a novel with a sustained bad heart, in an attempt to do damage to people, is a very hard thing to do.&quot; He concedes that &quot;there might be a few personal preoccupations that are better left at home, but most writers are moralists, or at least closet moralists&quot;. He and his wife are already discussing the next place to live after Dublin, although &quot;I&apos;m getting to feel quite at home here&quot;. He has a few writer friends, but mostly sees people involved in film. As for night life: &quot;I&apos;m getting too old for clubbing. You&apos;ve got to take drugs to get into the spirit of it, and I can&apos;t do it any more. I used to be the guy that would lead from the trenches&quot; - he mimics the use of a submachine gun - &quot;but now I&apos;m the sneaky one who&apos;s hanging back and saying, &apos;Eh, after you&apos; ...&quot; There is little chance that he will move back to Edinburgh, where his mother still lives (Welsh&apos;s father died when he was in his 20s). Does she read his books? &quot;Yeah, she reads them all and she loves them. She&apos;s quite broadminded. She used to get on to me about the swearing, but she doesn&apos;t even do that any more.&quot; Inspirations Laidlaw by William McIlvanney The Busconductor Hines by James Kelman Offensive Marketing by Hugh Davidson Hunky Dory by David Bowie The Seventh Seal by Ingmar Bergman", "sentences": ["Before Dublin - where his second wife, Beth Quinn, an American, studies at University College - he lived in Chicago, &quot;and before that San Francisco, and before that London, and before that Amsterdam&quot;."], "title": "Interview: Irvine Welsh", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/16/fiction.irvinewelsh", "tags": ["Books", "Fiction", "Culture", "Irvine Welsh", "Short stories"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-16T22:53:13Z", "article": "&apos;You cycle to work? You must be mad,&quot; used to be the reaction when I told people about my commute. Today, especially in London, cycling to work is at last becoming &quot;normal&quot;: it is no longer the reserve of Lycra-clad men. Joining the swarm of cyclists travelling south towards central London from Islington in the morning, I feel like I could be in Amsterdam or Copenhagen - where cycling accounts for a third of all trips. But in the UK, we still have a long way to go. Just 3% of commuters here cycle, with around 4 million people still driving less than three miles to work - a 20-minute bike ride each way. If all of these people swapped their cars for bikes it would save around 1m tonnes of CO2 a year. As a member of parliament, my four-mile round commute to Westminster takes under half an hour (with the trip back, uphill after the 10 o&apos;clock vote, taking a bit longer). It is by far the quickest way to get to the House of Commons. In fact, most traffic in London moves at the same speed it did a century ago - barely 10mph. On a bike you can easily keep up with or beat that speed. If it&apos;s so easy and so quick - why aren&apos;t more of us commuting by bike? Here are some of the common myths that people claim prevent them. 1. &quot;But won&apos;t I be killed?&quot; The Department for Transport&apos;s own statistics show that, over the last three years, cycling is - per mile travelled - safer than walking. Indeed, the more people who cycle, the safer it becomes, because drivers get used to seeing cyclists on the road. As more people have taken to their bikes in London, so there has been a 50% drop in cycling casualties per mile ridden since the mid 1990s. We all need regular exercise and the truth is that most people do not get enough. Cycling is much more convenient than joining a gym or going swimming, and is a regular exercise that can be slotted fairly easily into most of our lives. I discovered in February that I have the cardiovascular fitness of someone almost 20 years younger. 2. &quot;Don&apos;t I need lots of gear?&quot; All you need is a bike, a lock and some lights. With a few outstanding exceptions, Lycra really doesn&apos;t do justice to the figures of most people over 30. If you feel most comfortable wearing a suit, then wear one and cycle slowly. You are going to work, not climbing Mont Ventoux. Helmets aren&apos;t compulsory and their benefit isn&apos;t proven outright. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that wearing a helmet may encourage drivers to overtake more closely - putting you at greater risk. 3. &quot;Won&apos;t my bike get stolen?&quot; A good lock and a secure area to park your bike will help. More enlightened employers will often provide the latter. Forming a bicycle user group in your workplace can improve your chances of obtaining decent facilities. Most police forces have started offering people bike registration schemes. They&apos;ll be able to enter details of your bike onto a database - this will help to recover it if it&apos;s stolen. 4. &quot;I haven&apos;t done it for years&quot; The government recently launched Bikeability, a series of three levels of cycle competency, which teaches children the skills and confidence to ride on the road. Local authorities - especially those in London - now offer a free or heavily subsidised adult version of Bikeability. Even if you think you are a good cyclist, professional cycle training will greatly help boost your confidence and can provide tips and skills to staying safe. I&apos;ve had cycle training myself and, even though I felt very confident beforehand, I&apos;m certainly a better cyclist because of it. 5. &quot;The weather in Britain is too bad&quot; In many cities in northern Europe, up to 30% of all journeys are taken by bike - often in places with wetter, colder weather than the UK. Some cities in this country have similar levels of bike-friendliness; a quarter of commuters in parts of York, Cambridge, Oxford and Hull cycle to work. In my city, Transport for London claims that the average cycle commuter will only be caught in the rain 12 times in the average year. This is, as any cyclist will tell you, quite obviously a lie - but you&apos;d be surprised how infrequently it actually does rain. My policy is - if it rains, the bike stays at home. No one wants their MP turning up looking like a drowned rat. 6. &quot;I live in a hilly area&quot; You can&apos;t tackle hills without gears. The worse the hill, the more serious the gears needed. But, frankly, no one is going to blame you if you get off and push. And then you&apos;ve got a free-wheel downhill. 7. &quot;There&apos;s too much pollution&quot; Pollution levels for cyclists are lower than you might think - on hot days when pollution levels are highest, cyclists are exposed to less pollution than commuters sitting in their cars. 8. &quot;Bikes are expensive&quot; There&apos;s now a tax incentive, which means that you could buy a bike for a substantial discount through your employer. Find out about the scheme here: tinyurl.com/zob7l 9. &quot;I can&apos;t carry anything on a bike&quot; Some people have moved house by bike, and transported furniture - even pianos - by bike. Modern panniers are adapted for files and laptops. You can buy huge panniers and removable baskets that can carry shopping - and even David Cameron&apos;s shoes! 10. &quot;There are other reasons&quot; No there aren&apos;t. Get on a bike and give it a week. Chances are you&apos;ll soon join the ranks of converted cycle commuters: green, healthy and just a bit smug.  \u00b7 Emily Thornberry is MP for Islington South and Finsbury, and chairwoman of the all-party parliamentary cycling group", "sentences": ["Joining the swarm of cyclists travelling south towards central London from Islington in the morning, I feel like I could be in Amsterdam or Copenhagen - where cycling accounts for a third of all trips."], "title": "Free wheeling", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jun/16/work.ethicalliving", "tags": ["Money", "Ethical and green living", "Life and style", "Work & careers", "Environment", "Travel", "Travel and transport", "Health and fitness holidays", "Transport", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-18T20:16:40Z", "article": "A book chronicling the chaos and cronyism that characterised the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority&apos;s government of Iraq has swept to victory in the \u00a330,000 Samuel Johnson non-fiction prize.

Iraqi workers were rarely allowed inside the Green Zone in case they blew it up. Clothes handed to the military laundry service run by KBR, a Halliburton subsidiary, and returned &quot;if at all&quot; after a fortnight; KBR had them laundered in Kuwait instead of trusting laundries in Baghdad. The result was that, unable to wash their clothes during frequent interruptions to the water supply, US diplomats were embarrassed to meet smartly dressed Iraqi government staff.

While understandable, the maligning of the eagle is perhaps a little unfair: Germany&apos;s coat of arms has included an eagle for 800 years - the Germanic tribes regarded the eagle as the bird of the god Odin. After Hitler came to power in 1933, he kept the Weimar eagle for two years before he replaced it with the Nazi emblem: a black eagle above an oak wreath, with a swastika at its centre. The eagle returned after the war, incorporated first into the coat of arms of the Federal Republic, and then, since 1990, as a symbol of the reunified Germany. The eagle is a popular national symbol - present in the coat of arms of Ghana, Poland, Romania, Mexico, Nigeria and many other countries. It was also the emblem of the Roman emperor Charlemagne, and was used as a seal in Hellenistic Egypt. The United States of America chose a bald eagle as its emblem, although some American coins have shown the golden eagle. In heraldry, much as the lion is regarded as the king of the animal kingdom, the eagle is leader of the avian world. It symbolises immortality, courage, far-sightedness and strength, and enjoys connections with the Greek god Zeus and the Roman god Jupiter. Barclays itself has recognised the aggressive nature of its emblem before - Interbrand, the brand consultant, softened its heraldic edges in 1999, and it was made gentler still in 2004. Now it appears it will be smoothed into nonexistence. The Lloyds TSB horse should probably watch its back. \u00b7 The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Monday June 25 2007. Charlemagne was described as a Roman emperor in the article above. Having ruled as king of Franks from 768 until his death in 814, long after the fall of the western empire of Rome in the 5th century, the description is not wholly accurate. His capital was at Aachen, now in modern Germany, and his empire covered most of west and central Europe. However, he was crowned Imperator Augustus by Pope Leo III after he conquered Italy in 800. This was the origin of what later became known as the Holy Roman Empire.", "sentences": ["There has been an unexpected side-effect of Barclays&apos; merger deal with Dutch bank ABN Amro; aside from moving its headquarters to Amsterdam, the British bank is set to ditch its 317-year-old eagle logo after it was deemed too reminiscent of the Nazi emblem for the Netherlands, which was occupied for five years during the second world war."], "title": "The question: Is the eagle a Nazi symbol?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jun/20/business.secondworldwar", "tags": ["Money", "Business", "Second world war", "Germany", "Current accounts", "Savings", "World news", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-20T16:06:56Z", "article": " The rival attraction of Royal Ascot meant trading was reasonably light today. But despite that diversion- or perhaps because of it - the rumour mill was out in force.   Lloyds TSB was the main recipient of gossip, up 2p to 576.5p on talk that France&apos;s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale was running the rule over the bank. With the current battle between Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays over ABN Amro, it would be unwise to dismiss anything out of hand, but traders were nontheless unconvinced.   Property group Hammerson was also the subject of vague bid talk, up 13p to \u00a315.16p. Private equity groups or rival British Land have been mentioned as possible predators, but then British Land has also been suggested as a bidder for Sergo, formerly Slough Estates.   Elsewhere miners were wanted after a hefty 30-page note on the sector from Goldman Sachs.   Goldman&apos;s analysts have raised their targets on a number of the miners in the expectation of further price rises for iron ore, platinum and base metals.   &quot;We expect rising global growth in 2008 to lead to accelerating demand growth for metals, further tightening supply/demand balances,&quot; said the bank&apos;s analysts.   They rate BHP Billiton, up 19p to \u00a313.84p, as the key buy in the sector, and raised their price target from \u00a314.60 to \u00a316.80.   Xstrata, up 4p to \u00a330.82p, is upgraded from neutral to buy, while Goldman has also lifted its targets for Vedanta Resources, 53p higher at \u00a316.24, and Lonmin, up 75p to \u00a342.54.   Depite the strength in the miners, the FTSE 100 slipped back from earlier gains to close 0.9 points lower at 6649.3.   Standard Life was wanted, up 9p to 349p. The group had seen a brief dip recently on worries that private investors would start selling once they receive their bonus shares next month. But analysts believe these concerns have been overdone. Another possible boost to the shares was news that company executives including chief executive Sandy Crombie are on a week long roadshow around Europe and the US, which has reached Chicago today.   Aero engine maker Rolls-Royce revved up 7p to 552p after announcing at the Paris Air Show today a $1bn contract with India&apos;s Kingfisher Airlines. And hedge fund group Man climbed 13.5p to 625.5p. The company reported a 3.55% weekly rise in its key AHL fund, prompting an upbeat note from Evolution Securities with an add recommendation and 630p target.   Among the mid-caps, Bluetooth technology group CSR added 47p to 784p after Credit Suisse upgraded from neutral to outperform and raised its price target from 817p to 900p.   &quot;We are increasingly confident on the earnings growth of the company,&quot; said the bank. &quot;In our opinion, CSR&apos;s earnings potential is not yet fully discounted at current levels.&quot;   Tullow Oil, up 57.5p to 504.5p, also benefited from a positive analyst note, this time Merrill Lynch with a 560p target price.   Among the fallers ICI slipped 5.5p to 633.5p on reports that there was no guarantee that bidder Akzo Nobel would come back with a higher offer. ICI has rejected a 600p a share bid from the Dutch chemical group.   James Knight at Collins Stewart advised clients to lighten their positions in ICI.   &quot;We think there is a strong chance of an imminent formal offer from Akzo, but not over 650p, just 2% above the current price,&quot; he said. &quot;There is a small chance Akzo looks elsewhere - for example, Sherwin Williams - and the offer could take time to realise given the timing of the cash inflow for Organon [which Akzo would use to fund the bid], the need to gain Akzo shareholder approval, and possible - but minor - anti-trust delay.   &quot;We see limited chance of other bidders. BASF, DuPont and Dow could all afford ICI but have minimal synergy opportunity. The same goes for private equity.&quot;   A trading statement from banking group Standard Chartered revealed good operating profit growth in the first half, but a warning of cost increases saw the shares dip 8p to \u00a316.58.   Back among the bid talk, Irish building materials group CRH added 1.4 cents to \u20ac37.70 on talk of a possible break-up of the company, while in the same sector, Wolseley was 4p better at \u00a312.88 after a buy note from Evolution Securities with a \u00a314.75 target.   &quot;The shares are undervalued on any private equity interest and the growth and recovery predicted through the next fiscal year to July 2008,&quot; said Evolution.   Pharmaceuticals giant Shire slipped 1p to \u00a312.20 after it agreed to pay up to $825m for the rights to Juvista, an experimental treatment for scarring, from biotech business Renovo, up 27p to 214p.   United Utilities has finally disposed of its remaining shares in telecoms group Thus, placing its 22.63% stake with institutional investors at 183p a share. United was unchanged at 767.5p, despite some traders believing it could now become a bid target, while Thus slipped 11.5p to 185.5p. Cazenove said the sale removed an overhang and moved its rating from underperform to in-line.   Lower down the market, Aim-listed Vyke Communications edged up 0.05p to 2.3p after it signed an agreement with The Cloud Network that will allow customers to use its mobile VoIP products in The Cloud Hotspots including London, Manchester and Amsterdam.   I-Mate, which specialises in Windows mobile devices and software applications, added 14.5p to 78p after it announced partnership deals to expand in Asia.   And a bid battle broke out for dental group Oasis Healthcare. Private equity firm Duke Street Capital had made an 82p a share offer for the company but today rival dentistry outfit ADP Healthcare - which owns 18.25% of Oasis - topped that with a 91p a share counter-bid. Oasis added 2p to 93p.   Finally garden centre group Dobbies jumped 47.5p to 1837.5p after Sir Tom Hunter raised his stake in the business yet again, buying another 418,283 shares at \u00a318.45 to take his holding to 25.57%. Dealers said he could now scupper the \u00a315 a share bid from Tesco without bidding himself. The Tesco deal requires a 75% acceptance level.

But one of the most remarkable aspects about the crew, who boast an average weight of 15\u00bdst and a height of 6ft 4in, is that the toughest man is not one of those giants but someone whose size should make him an also-ran. It says something about the formidable mind of Colin Smith that he is comfortable with the label of &quot;the toughest man in British rowing&quot;. His crew-mate Andy Hodge acknowledges that Smith has something special: &quot;Colin&apos;s achievements, in spite of his size, shows just how powerful the mind is in producing world-class performance.&quot; The Zimbabwe-born Smith freely admits that he has not been blessed with any extraordinary technical or physical abilities: &quot;Technically, I do plenty of things wrong in the boat and there&apos;s nothing remarkable about my physiology.&quot; At 6ft and only 12\u00bdst, Smith looks tiny beside his colleagues. More than that, in the crucial 2km ergometer test, his personal best is nearly 18sec slower than most of his crew-mates. But his quiet self-belief has powered him to performance levels which should be beyond him. The foundations of that were partly laid in Zimbabwe. Smith lost his mother at an early age and recalls of how hard life sometimes was for his father and his siblings. &quot;In the supermarket we&apos;d have to add up the bill halfway round to make sure we had enough money to pay,&quot; he recalls. When his family left, seven years ago, they went to New Zealand while Smith, armed with a scholarship, went alone to Britain. Perhaps that is why he often seems possessed of a wisdom beyond his 23 years - he is noted for seeking out rowing&apos;s wise old coaches, such as Mike Spracklen and Thor Nilson, and learning from them. But crucially for Smith, winning an Olympic gold is an essential part of making his separation from his family seem worthwhile. So it is not surprising that his determination has led him to the top of J\u00fcrgen Grobler&apos;s squad. But, as Smith points out, as recently as September the 60-year-old German was reluctant to include such a relatively small man in the elite group of Britain&apos;s top six rowers. &quot;At the start of the season, J\u00fcrgen thought I was too small for his top boats,&quot; he says. Grobler&apos;s reaction proved just the incentive Smith needed to take on and beat his bigger rivals. At the last World Cup in Linz earlier this month, Smith, together with his pairs partner Matthew Langridge, repaid Grobler&apos;s change of heart with a convincing win against world-class opposition. According to Sean Bowden, who coached Smith to Boat Race victory with Oxford in 2006, those remarkable performances are chiefly due to Smith&apos;s disciplined mental outlook. &quot;Mentally, Colin&apos;s extremely good,&quot; said Bowden. &quot;He takes full responsibility for his own performance and never uses excuses.&quot; It was at Oxford that Smith learnt the introvert&apos;s most challenging lesson, that his most important duty in a team sport is to help his crew-mates get the best out of themselves. His relationships with others have been revolutionised and, in his own words: &quot;At first I used to be a bit of a plonker but now I realise I need to understand my crew-mates, so anything I say to them helps them to row better.&quot; Oxford also honed his ability to deliver total focus: &quot;I learnt there that in a power-based sport, with my physique, success will only come if everything I do is absolutely always on the money.&quot; There have been times when Smith&apos;s intensity has not been to everybody&apos;s liking. But his friends value his good sense and advice. In time, he wants to pass that on to his own family. But for now, Smith&apos;s performance does present a challenge to his bigger and stronger colleagues. As he points out: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be in a job if everybody was doing what I was doing.&quot;", "sentences": ["Britain&apos;s new experimental super eight, who will race for the first time in the World Cup in Amsterdam tomorrow, contains some of the biggest, hardest and most powerful athletes around."], "title": "Rowing: Meet the puny six-footer powering GB's super eight", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jun/21/sport.sport1", "tags": ["Sport", "Rowing"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-21T10:20:21Z", "article": "The father of missing four-year-old Madeleine McCann has appealed for the return of a stolen wallet containing &quot;irreplaceable&quot; photographs of his daughter.

Apparently, there was such a cultural chasm between Macca (thumbs aloft, cheery and optimistic) and Editors (black clothes, intense sounds, songs fixated with morbidity) that they ended up bonding over their one area of common ground: Rickenbacker guitars. &quot;He was telling us about when John got his guitar and we&apos;re like &apos;John?&apos;&quot; says Smith. &quot;And then the penny drops. Oh, that &apos;John&apos;!&quot; Though not at McCartney (or Lennon) levels yet, Editors have spent the past two years becoming seriously huge. Their label, Kitchenware, originally expected their debut album, The Back Room, to sell 60,000 copies but it has now sold 500,000 (and rising) in the UK alone and the band are making inroads in Japan, Europe and America. Their songs speak the international language of not love but death. The band&apos;s hardcore followers dub themselves the Cult of Editors, and range from big goths covered in tattoos to screaming Essex housewives, of whom Smith suggests: &quot;I guess there&apos;s something in them we&apos;ve disturbed.&quot; The band&apos;s big break was supporting Franz Ferdinand on their 2006 European tour, which catapulted The Back Room to No 2 in the UK chart six months after release. The Franz jaunt saw Smith taking a break from exploring his inner soul to observe how a band &quot;operates at that level, light shows, playing arena shows, coping with the pressure&quot; as if rehearsing for the next obvious step: arena stardom. To this end, the eagerly-awaited second album, An End Has a Start, takes the Editors sound to an epic, stadium-sized level, without sacrificing the harrowing songs about morbidity and melancholy. Yet Smith seems untroubled by the demands of combining songwriting intimacy with the sort of sweeping gestures demanded in arenas. &quot;You have to play the game, you need big gestures to come across in an arena,&quot; he offers, swapping mineral water for herbal tea. &quot;It&apos;s weird, but if you get the chance to put on a big show, you&apos;ve got to go for it haven&apos;t you? I&apos;ll be shitting myself, but I&apos;ll be excited. You never know what you can rise to.&quot; There is a lot of incongruity about Editors. They are mostly compared to Joy Division - but although they are fans, they know only the hits, declaring Elbow and Echo and the Bunnymen to be far bigger influences (the Bunnymen reverberate around the dressing room before they take the stage in Amsterdam). Editors&apos; intense, driven noise suggests alienated young men who gaze at spots in the mirror and read Russian novels, but guitarist Chris Urbanowicz insists they&apos;re &quot;more likely to watch Top Gear than read Dostoevsky&quot;. They relay the travails of touring - mouth infections, eye infections, vomiting, Urbanowicz finding out he&apos;s been robbed (someone hacked into his bank account and withdrew \u00a32,000) - but the band&apos;s air of unflinching geniality and well-roundedness remains not unlike Paul McCartney&apos;s. It is in Tom Smith that the contradictory impulses of the band are most plain. He&apos;s notoriously guarded in interviews, but has a celebrity girlfriend (Radio 1 DJ Edith Bowman). He writes lyrics about alienation but his stagecraft suggests he shares DNA with Bono. When Editors played London&apos;s Roundhouse recently, the Guardian&apos;s critic raised an eyebrow at the incongruity between Smith&apos;s singing about depression while urging the crowd to &quot;tear the roof off&quot;. &quot;The songs are about my thoughts and worries but it doesn&apos;t mean I have to live my life by that code,&quot; says Smith, suddenly sounding as passionate as he does in song. &quot;I could write about going to the shops but where&apos;s the satisfaction? I don&apos;t believe that I have to be some tortured self-harming miserablist to sing about something serious. It&apos;s absolute nonsense that I should be up there slashing my wrists. For a start, I&apos;d never get through the tour.&quot; He says all his favourite bands (REM, as well as Echo and the Bunnymen) have a melancholy or seriousness about them, and that writing lyrics is a very personal thing. &quot;But then you have to share it with people. But when I&apos;m singing the songs I&apos;m not in the same environment. I guess it&apos;s some sort of release and I don&apos;t know what I&apos;d be doing with this stuff if I wasn&apos;t in a band. I find the songs uplifting, but think a lot of the songs have a sense of making the most of something, protecting people from something scary.&quot; Where does that come from? &quot;From me, I guess.&quot; Smith grew up in Stroud in Gloucestershire, which he describes as &quot;not a pretty country town, but nice&quot;. The son of two teachers, he suffered at school when his parents started teaching him. &quot;It was hard, actually, in secondary school,&quot; he says. &quot;Kids can be horrible, nasty little fuckers.&quot; He doesn&apos;t say he was bullied but suggests it felt &quot;odd, horrible. I didn&apos;t enjoy it.&quot; In Nottingham, meanwhile, Chris Urbanowicz was getting to grips with symptoms of synaesthesia (a neurological disorder where one sense can trigger another, so sound can be &quot;seen&quot; as colours), something he shares with Franz Liszt, Duke Ellington and Pharrell Williams, among others. The more intense the music, the more powerful the colours. Smith and Urbanowicz met on a music technology course in Stafford, where they also encountered their bassist, Russell Leetch, and drummer Ed Lay. Seven years ago they formed a band called Snowfield, but decided the more austere Editors would look better in print. Their big break was moving to Birmingham, where city life (and rehearsing in a &quot;claustrophobic&quot; lockup) shaped the band&apos;s angular, dark sound - Smith enthuses about &quot;the romantic attraction of dark, imposing structures&quot; and &quot;neon late nights&quot;. It&apos;s a familiar tale of struggle: months sleeping on the manager&apos;s floor, and ditching crap jobs selling shoes on the day they landed a Radio 1 session with Zane Lowe. Then came the album, and success, and now a follow-up. Rather than getting trapped into writing about what&apos;s happened to him since he became famous, Smith has looked further back for An End Has a Start. Take the first single, Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors. &quot;I&apos;ve seen that scenario every time I&apos;ve been to hospital but it stuck with me from childhood,&quot; explains Smith, adding that he hasn&apos;t seen more hospitals than anyone else and certainly hasn&apos;t &quot;been frequenting cancer wards&quot;. &quot;When you&apos;re younger, thoughts of coming to an end are miles away,&quot; he considers. &quot;You feel invincible, but when you&apos;re older things start to happen around you and you realise it&apos;s closer.&quot; As he was working on the album, Smith&apos;s grandmother died, a relative was diagnosed with cancer and, most shockingly, someone he went to school with was murdered. &quot;A tragic, horrible thing,&quot; says Smith. &quot;These things bubble in my head and come out.&quot; The incident inspired the song Well Worn Hand, but the event remains so raw that Smith says he feels uncomfortable talking about it. For all Smith&apos;s seriousness, though, Editors&apos; dressing room is full of laughter. Urbanowicz jokes about the Editors&apos; serious image with Lay: &quot;We like to go out and have a little dance, but we&apos;re not silly,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve never met Lindsay Lohan.&quot; &quot;Or shagged her,&quot; adds the drummer. &quot;I think I would have to meet her first. We don&apos;t have her dancing at the side of the stage.&quot; &quot;Not yet.&quot; However, Smith seems more deeply burdened. &quot;We&apos;ve had a lot of emails from people who have had depression or hard times, and they can identify with a lyric or something,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s hard thinking of the effect on people&apos;s lives because you can&apos;t control that. If they take comfort from it, that&apos;s an amazing thing and I&apos;ll never take it for granted.&quot;  \u00b7  Read the review for An End Has a Start in Guardian Film and Music..

Venice is the most luggage-hostile environment on the planet. Don&apos;t be tempted to walk from the train station to your hotel. After about five bridges, you will suspect you should have taken a vaporetto, but will press on, not realising there are at least 50 more bridges between you and your destination, over which you will drag your bags, crossing some of them twice. A breathtaking walk in every sense. The hotel is literally a stone&apos;s throw from my pitch, La Fenice, where Jeffrey Tate, conducting Siegfried that night, has put in a word for me. Even so, I am still out on the street, not inside, but the takings are reasonably good. Milan is next. I buy an overpriced map and, on the way to the Galeria, exchange greetings with a fellow fiddler on the metro. The whole of Milan is sheltering from rain inside the huge covered arcade, as is most of their police force who, to justify their over-concentration, are hassling the street traders. No busking here. My map defeats me. Eventually I ask a Milanese, who is equally baffled until, as I fold it up, he spots the word &quot;Torino&quot; on the cover. Perhaps I need to pay a little more attention to detail. In the crowd, I spot a familiar face. It&apos;s the violinist, Angelo, who said he&apos;s come to hear me play. He speaks little English, I no Italian, but we have a great afternoon sussing out busking pitches. Eventually we set up opposite La Scala opera house using a large statue as cover from two carabinieri standing just the other side. Not spectacular takings, but a good day in the end. Next to Berlin. After trudging back and forth I settle down to a spot outside the Konzerthaus, where the pianist Jean-Philippe Collard is playing that evening. A fortnight ago, we were playing a Beethoven piano quartet together. Ignorant of this, the audience ignore me almost completely. Miserable takings (less than \u00a37), a miserable day and, to rub it in, I&apos;ve got blisters by the time I get to my lodgings. But help is at hand. Michael Scheterlich, an ebullient Berlin-based agent, despatches me to Leipzig for the last day of their Bach Fest. When I arrive I am met by a woman who introduces herself as Maria, Michael&apos;s mum, and charm, it seems, runs in the family. We find an ideal spot in a porch near St Thomas&apos;s church where Bach worked, and I attract a small but very generous audience. By the end of the day, I&apos;ve amassed a minor fortune of \u20ac297 (\u00a3199). Overnight train to Stockholm sharing a cabin with a kebab-eating family of four and a bemused German girl. The old town of Stockholm was designed with buskers in mind. Encouraged by applause from the restaurants surrounding the main square, I approach the tables and, for the first time in my life, actually ask people to buy my CDs. I suppose I will eventually get used to this. Another overnight train gets me to Malmo before seven and, just for the hell of it, I do a quick stint, starting at 8am. It&apos;s a little early and the locals whizz by on bicycles, so it&apos;s a while before a coin drops into the case. Still, it&apos;s better than Berlin and after half an hour, I&apos;ve made about \u00a310 - and a button. Copenhagen is a bustling city but, alas, bustle and fiddle don&apos;t make good bedfellows. It&apos;s too noisy to be heard and I leave on the night train for Amsterdam with only \u00a325 to show for the day. A shower in the morning restores me but I am starting to be concerned.

Sober, conservative black, with sometimes (daringly) a hint of white. Your classic monochrome, in other words. But look at these paintings closely and you soon begin to realise that sober is the last thing these frocks are. Admittedly, in portraits such as Rembrandt&apos;s astonishing Margaretha de Geer, in the collection of the National Gallery in London, what shines out is the inner life of the marvellously geriatric, formidable subject, not the outer trappings - a plain loose-fitting gown (in black, naturally) that blurs modestly into the murky background. But in many of these paintings - a mighty selection of which is on view in a new show at the National Gallery from next Wednesday - the outer trappings are everything. Superficiality rules. Black was predominant, according to Betsy Wieseman, curator of Dutch paintings at the gallery, partly because it implied &quot;sobriety and modesty. But at least as important was the fact that it was fashionable. These days, when you go out somewhere special, the chances are that you reach for black. Well, for much of the 17th century it was like that in the Netherlands.&quot; So black is the old black; but never let it be said that these Dutch plutocrats - having a gay old time among their embarrassment of riches, at the high watermark of their nation&apos;s astonishing economic and cultural success - were flinging on the equivalent of a cleverly cut Topshop LBD, safe in the knowledge that cheap black looks less cheap than cheap colour. Deep in the basement of the National Gallery&apos;s Sainsbury Wing, Wieseman switches on the bright beam of the conservator&apos;s light to illuminate the freshly restored portrait of Aletta Hanemans, painted in 1625 by Frans Hals, and reveals the (essentially unreproducible) splendour of her get-up. This black is all about rich detail and texture. The overgown - known as a vlieger - is a satin jacquard weave with a floral motif. On her shoulders are delicious tassels decorated with jet beads. And, of course, all that is there largely to set off the pi\u00e8ce de resistance - that incredible stomacher, embroidered with gold thread. And, my dear, the accessories - a solid-gold chain belt and exquisitely embroidered gloves, the engagement present given to the young bride by her husband, Jacob Olycan, whose portrait is the pair to this one. Modest and sober? I think not. Not even that display, however, can quite equal the splendour of Bartholomeus van der Helst&apos;s Double Portrait of Abraham del Court and Maria de Kaersgieter. Even the John Terry or Gary Neville weddings at the weekend would find it hard to rival this for garish, nouveau riche ostentation. That dress of hers is not black, you will have noted. If wearing a beautiful white suit in 2007 announces that you are far too rich to take a bus or walk in the rain, ratchet that up a few notches for Holland in the 17th century: no dry cleaning, and even filthier streets. Maria is too damn rich and stylish to move, we can infer. What is hilarious about this painting is that it is more or less an advertisement. Del Court was a cloth merchant. His wife&apos;s white frock - which takes up half the painting and whose fabric is painted with loving luminescence by van der Helst - is showing what a nice bit of schmutter he can put his wife in, just as Sir Philip Green wouldn&apos;t want Lady Green to be seen slopping around in a stained tracksuit. That moonstone-coloured dress is set off by amazing silver-thread embroidery, quintuple strands of pearls at each wrist, a diamond ring and brooch, and ropes of pearls in her hair and at her throat. Talk about bling. It was not just the girls having fun, either. Abraham&apos;s black silk get-up is almost blinding in its splendid sheen; but Nicolas Maes&apos;s portrait (shown on previous page) of the magnificently rakish-looking Cornelis Munter, of 1679 (those eyes! that wig! what a beauty!) is something else again. Apart from the seductive gaze of this incredible looker (or is that just me?) the striking thing about this painting is the jacket. Those bravura swirling streaks of olive and chartreuse seem to have come from quite a different painting. They look quickly, even carelessly executed, but in fact Maes has, according to Quentin Buvelot of the Mauritshuis Museum, carefully built up this section of the painting, making individual brushstrokes invisible by thinly applying successive layers of paint to the surface. It is a marvellous garment, a real fashion statement: a Japanese padded jacket in, according to Wieseman, a shantung silk. These jackets were incredibly hard to get hold of: in fact you could only acquire one if you had connections with the powerful Dutch East India company, says Wieseman. It was the It jacket: and just like next season&apos;s coveted Balenciaga naval mini-blazer, getting one is not just about being rich, it is also about cosying up to the right people. (She also points out that it was a deeply utilitarian item, all that snug padding being just the thing for frosty Dutch mornings, but when did we care about practicality?) A splendid, unknown young man painted by Gerard ter Borch in 1663-4 was certainly untroubled by such absurd preoccupations as mobility or comfort. According to Axel R\u00fcger, the director of Amsterdam&apos;s Van Gogh Museum and a co-curator of the National Gallery&apos;s exhibition, the sitter is working the very heights of high fashion, freshly imported from Paris. Monochrome this outfit may be, but you have to see this portrait in the flesh (so to speak) to get exactly what is going on with the virtuosic rendering of all that black: the soft deep texture of the velvet lining of the cloak; the delicate, if completely phatic waistcoat, with its translucent lace edging; the gorgeousness of tumbling silk ribbons at the waist; those extraordinary fountaining frills of the overstockings, or canons, at his knees. The upper-leg-gear is a pair of what amount to culottes - petticoat breeches is the technical term. To this modern eye the look seems to be all about the silhouette: if you think about it formally, it is made up of three triangles, formed by his hat; his cloak and breeches; and his canons. It reminds me of other extreme silhouettes in fashion history - Balenciaga&apos;s 1960 sack dress, for instance, or even Christian Dior&apos;s 1947 new look with its flared skirts (though I think this is partly because Ter Borch&apos;s young man is working such a 1940s-model pose with that particular turn-out of his wonderful shiny feet - and wouldn&apos;t you kill for those shoes?). What is fascinating about this painting - as with the others in the National Gallery show - is to think about what traits the subject was trying to project when he was painted in this particular outfit. Ter Borch&apos;s young man, according to R\u00fcger, can be dated with exactitude because of his hat, with its distinctive sugar cone shape. That style was in fashion for exactly three years from 1660 to 1663, after which it was completely and totally over and no one would be seen dead in it - one of those fleeting fashion fads, like last year&apos;s puffball skirts, that no sooner comes than it goes when everyone realises how ugly it really is. So he was a fashion victim, then; and one can&apos;t help asking oneself whether this outfit would have been regarded as especially masculine; or was it a touch on the metrosexual side? There is some evidence describing this kind of look, written about a decade after the portrait was painted. &quot;All such abuses served merely as impediments,&quot; wrote a commentator of the high hats and skirt-like breeches of the early 1660s. &quot;Besides which the immoderately loose and long garments were redolent of over-abundance and profligacy.&quot; On the other hand, R\u00fcger reckons that although the subject&apos;s outfit looks foppish, his formal pose and straight gaze gives him an air of authority and dignity. Here was a man to be taken seriously. In other words, he intends to have his cake and eat it - and, what&apos;s more, he wants the world to know. \u00b7 Dutch Portraits: the Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals is at the National Gallery, London WC2, from Wednesday June 27.", "sentences": ["According to Axel R\u00fcger, the director of Amsterdam&apos;s Van Gogh Museum and a co-curator of the National Gallery&apos;s exhibition, the sitter is working the very heights of high fashion, freshly imported from Paris."], "title": "Charlotte Higgins on style in 17th-century Dutch art", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/jun/22/art.fashion", "tags": ["Art", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Culture", "Art and design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-23T13:45:43Z", "article": "Hilary Mantel I&apos;ve never understood the idea of holiday reading, or indeed the idea of holidays, but there&apos;s a poignancy about those texts you read in places where you don&apos;t know where your next book is coming from. Under a tree in Jamaica, far from the tourist trail, I read Thomas Flanagan&apos;s epic novel of 1798 Ireland, The Year of the French, while keeping an eye on the spider above my head, which had a body the size of a soup-plate. Still on an Irish theme, but with a change of beast: on my first morning in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, I finished Cecil Woodham-Smith&apos;s The Great Hunger, while a vast cockroach strolled around the room. Only when the famine was over did I go for the bug spray. In 1980, on a steam train stopped somewhere between Victoria Falls and Bulawayo, I pulled out of my bag Ian McEwan&apos;s The Cement Garden. What a sinister little effort, I thought. I wonder if I could write a sinister book? I wrote one or two. And quite separately, in my novel A Change of Climate, I wrote about a steam train stopped on a line in southern Africa, the heat building. Many years later, I was walking down a street in Adelaide, and a man stopped and asked if I was me. In a burst of honesty I admitted it. He said that he had taken A Change of Climate on a journey through Africa. He barely knew where it was set or anything about it, but took it out, bored, when his train happened to stop. He opened it at random and read. The paragraph he read described a stopped train. He realised, as his own train pulled into the next station, that he and the characters on the page, though lost in the vastness of the continent, were drawing simultaneously into the same dusty halt. This moving synchronicity (or perhaps just meaningless coincidence) persuades me that there may be something in the idea of holiday reading after all. Ian McEwan At the age of 18 I hitch-hiked to Greece with a schoolfriend. We found ourselves a job in a cheap hotel in Athens and lived under a tarpaulin on the roof. In our hours off, in the disabling afternoon heat, I lay on a bed and read Saul Bellow&apos;s Herzog. The dense, digressive prose, the meandering vagueness and vast intellectual reach of Moses Herzog bewitched me. I began writing letters in my head and dispatching them to world historical figures. After a week or two it became clear that the hotel owner was not going to pay us, so we presented ourselves at the British embassy to complain. While we sat in an anteroom waiting for the Third Secretary to see us, I had my Herzog with me. Like him, I could float above my circumstances; like him, I believed myself to have infinite inner resources. The Third Secretary heard us out, picked up the phone and for five minutes yelled in Greek at our employer. I was impressed, but impatient to get back to my book. At the hotel we were treated with greater respect - but still not paid. We walked out, and financed the rest of our travels by selling double doses of our blood. Weak and a little dizzy from lowered blood pressure, I sat in the medical waiting room and read Bellow&apos;s final pages, at one with Moses becalmed on his Recamier couch. He wanted to call out to his cleaning lady to tell her she was raising too much dust - but not yet: &quot;At this time he had no messages for anyone. Nothing. Not a single word.&quot; So this magnificent novel ends; my first encounter with contemporary greatness. Nothing in my rather arduous journey could touch me now. David Mitchell My first long-haul flight took the clueless 19-year-old that I was to New Delhi. It was 1988, and backpacks were still rucksacks. Squashed at the bottom of mine, under an iodine-filter water purifier, Hindi phrasebook and boxes of Band-Aids and Lemsip, was a Penguin Classic of Le Grand Meaulnes. Alain-Fournier&apos;s book stayed squashed there for a few weeks, while the subcontinent redefined my previous understanding of words such as &quot;sublime&quot;, &quot;squalor&quot;, &quot;liquid&quot; and &quot;bowels&quot;. The novel saw the light of day when I boarded a bone-shaker bus at Srinigar, bound for the city of Leh in Ladakh. Readers of Le Grand Meaulnes will know that the novel has no connection whatsoever with India, or indeed anywhere beyond its misty, muddy, pre-war French countryside. My memories of the two-day bus ride, however, and my first reading of Alain-Fournier&apos;s beautiful narrative are knitted together unpickably. The novel is not long, but rich and dense and not to be hurried. The story of Augustin Meaulnes, his unassuming friend Fran\u00e7ois Seurel and Meaulnes&apos;s romantic adventure between childhood and adulthood was dyed by the scenery passing by. The bus climbed a zig-zagging track up an escarpment, and Kashmir&apos;s muggy fertility gave way to a landscape like the moon&apos;s, but with glassy rivers. By mid-afternoon, Meaulnes had stumbled across a mysterious ch\u00e2teau where children and youths enacted a sort of masquerade. Vultures rode on Himalayan thermals, road-workers squatted by an oil-drum of bubbling tar, the skeleton of a bus lay rusting down its precipice, and a young woman showed Augustin Meaulnes the way into a new chamber of his young man&apos;s heart. Night fell without warning, and the bus disgorged us outside a hotel with no name, reception or furniture. My memory is fond of insisting that I never saw a sky so drenched with stars, either before or since. On the following morning, the landscape became arid, biblical and, to my travel-weary eyes, tedious. Le Grand Meaulnes ended in bittersweet perfection, and the bus stopped on the edge of Leh. A car had overtaken us, stopped, and now blocked the narrow road. Too naive to worry about armed robbers or a hostage situation, I took in a prayer-wheel, a prominent barracks for the Indian army, white-washed houses, TV aerials and a Buddhist stupa with fluttering prayer-flags. Our bus driver got out to remonstrate with the driver of the car, only to be greeted by a punch to his head. Down he went. Jan Morris Two books are improbably linked in my consciousness because I associate them both with particular journeys. One is Charles Doughty&apos;s classic Travels in Arabia Deserta (1888), the other is Inside USA (1947) by the incomparable American reporter John Gunther. I am prepared to swear that they have never been mentioned in the same paragraph before, but in my mind&apos;s bookshelf they stand permanently side by side. I bought my copy of Doughty at Steimatzky&apos;s in Jerusalem in 1947, during a protracted meander through the Arab countries, and it has profoundly affected me ever since. I was new to those parts then, and whenever I think of the experience now I hear the intoxicatingly antique cadences of Doughty&apos;s prose, and I remember the moment when, waking one morning in my tent on the edge of the Negev desert, I saw that during the night a company of Bedu had pitched their black tents, and hobbled their camels, miraculously in the distant sands. &quot;Ay, Wellah,&quot; Doughty murmurs to me then, &quot;the sooth indeed!&quot; On the other hand, Gunther&apos;s book (which I bought in Chicago in 1953, and which still smells suggestively of old American printer&apos;s ink) speaks to me from the corner of its mouth, as it were, and tells me of crooked mayors, presidents, oil-fields, dams, gangsters and railway tycoons. I used it constantly when I had a year&apos;s travelling fellowship in America, and went everywhere that Gunther went. &quot;Who runs this town?&quot; I can still hear him demanding. &quot;Boss (&apos;Ed&apos;) Crump, that&apos;s who, of the EH Crump Buggy &amp; Harness Company!&quot; Although the Bedu, I fear, no longer pitch their tents in that corner of Arabia Deserta, and hardly anybody remembers that WC Handy&apos;s &quot;Memphis Blues&quot; was originally called &quot;Boss Crump Blues&quot;. Although the worlds they described have long gone, I have only to open those dear old volumes to feel myself on the road once more, labouring down the trail of the Haj, or pressing on to Tennessee. DBC Pierre Childhood is where the most intense experiences of holidays and books seem to gather. A book was always a sacred piece of luggage for me on holiday, though being a strange little sod I often didn&apos;t read it. This was because, in bookshops, I was mostly taken with the smell of the ink, the weight of the pages, the cover art, and the resonance of the title. It never occurred to me to wonder what the narrative was about, or if I&apos;d even be able to read it - I was into the book as an end in itself; a shining, odorous promise of unexpected imaginings. This explained the unread Cantonese and Samoan works on my bookshelves; it explained me schlepping a green-covered hardback of Evelyn Waugh&apos;s Decline and Fall around one summer before I could even spell properly. One time though, by accident, I struck it lucky with a holiday book - the smell and title and artwork for Ray Bradbury&apos;s Something Wicked This Way Comes miraculously coincided with my reading skills, and a half-term holiday with best mates from school. We went camping to an arid chaparral in central Mexico, where the sinister twist of the bushes and the sharp edge of breeze in thin air brought the work to life. As twilight gripped the high plain, every word in the book became an immediate and ominous truth. I can&apos;t tell you now precisely what the storyline was - this was a narrative that seemed only to boost and fulfil the menace in its title. But I felt its threat approaching, my heart raced with it, night after night on that holiday and I carry the feeling of the place and its razor-edged breeze today. Jonathan Raban In 1977, licking my critical wounds after a play of mine had gone on, and swiftly come off, at the Bristol Old Vic, I fled to Aleppo with a magazine commission in hand, along with a penitential copy of Middlemarch, a book I hadn&apos;t reread since I slogged through it for A-level, figuring that three weeks alone in a Baathist police state were likely to provide ample leisure to come to terms with this most forbidding of great Victorian novels. Holed up in the venerably tacky Baron hotel with George Eliot for company, I made the transfixing discovery that she is not just the most serious, most intelligent, most grown-up, et cetera, writer of her age - she&apos;s funny. I became wedded to the book, reaching for it at the unearthly hour when taped muezzins were broadcast at full blast from the minarets of half a dozen competing mosques and the dawn orchestra of novelty car horns burped out the tune of &quot;Hitler has only got one ball . . .&quot;; I read it in caf\u00e9s, sucking down cool gusts of Latakia tobacco smoke from a hubble-bubble, and in the bugged hotel dining room over meals of leathery meat that might have been horse or goat; I carried it with me on walks, when I was followed at 20 paces by my very own, extremely dim, not-so-secret policeman. I was lucky he didn&apos;t confiscate the book as a concealed radio device, since when I communed with it I often muttered sentences from it aloud. &quot;Even Milton, looking for his portrait in a spoon, must submit to have the facial angle of a bumpkin.&quot; When Dorothea is moved to tears of love and gratitude by Casaubon&apos;s preposterous letter of proposal, there is, besides much else, dark laughter in the writing of the scene - laughter that permeates this wrenching comedy of misperception, misunderstanding, misjudgment. And the dialogue sings: the buffoonish solemnities of Casaubon and the ineffectual witterings of Mr Brooke are conjured by Eliot with a kind of mordant hilarity. I&apos;m rereading the book now, with almost unalloyed pleasure (yes, it&apos;s too long), and each time I open its pages, it seems to release a whiff of the red dust from the tunnels of the underground soukh, and the smell of glue and wood-shavings in the lute-maker&apos;s shop - happy memories, not of Aleppo so much as of the bewitchment I felt when I first fell under Middlemarch&apos;s spell. Ian Rankin A few years back, my wife and I headed off on a rare holiday without our two sons. My brother-in-law was a diplomat stationed in Nairobi, and we were going to stay with his family for a few days, then embark on a couple of five-day safaris. My wife and elder son had done the same thing the previous year, so I was forewarned: out in the bush, facilities are limited. We would be packing insect-repellent, torches and plenty of batteries. With the prospect of a publess, tellyless two weeks, I started looking for a big fat book to take along. I had the notion of rereading Bleak House, but couldn&apos;t find it amid the clutter in my study and was determined not to buy a duplicate copy. Instead, I decided it was time to tackle Tolstoy&apos;s War and Peace. The first couple of hundred pages certainly filled the Heathrow-Nairobi flight, but while I enjoyed it, I wasn&apos;t so sure about that &quot;greatest ever novel&quot; tag. Tolstoy is good on the upper classes, great at set-pieces, but I found few characters from the lower orders in the story - something separating him straight away from Dickens. Mind you, Dickens wasn&apos;t a Count. War and Peace really came into its own, however, as we lay down to sweat the night away at sundown. My wife had bought me the sort of torch cyclists sometimes use. It could be attached around the head by a strap. This made it the perfect reading companion. Miranda would get me to read bits aloud, especially the lengthy, realistic descriptions of deep Russian winters and the frostbite suffered by the Napoleonic soldiers. The various tents and lodges we slept in didn&apos;t run to air conditioning, but here was a worthwhile alternative. By day we had plenty of adventures and misadventures (the near-submersion of our vehicle in a flood being the least of them), and one evening were left to dine alone at a candlelit dinner-table, interrupted only by the roar of a lion in the near-distance. We retreated to our lodge and I strapped my reading-light on again, ready with the next chapter. By the end of the fortnight I&apos;d finished the book. Probably not many people associate War and Peace with the heart of sweltering Africa, but I do. Elif Shafak In winter 2007, I suffered from a long and draining depression that ensnared me amid the perplexing whirl of Istanbul. For the first time in my adult life, I stopped writing and began to lose faith in words. When April came, still orbiting around the black sun of melancholy and unable to welcome the joy of spring, I decided to leave my beloved city for a few days and spend some time in Amsterdam. Istanbul was crowded, chaotic and demanding, whereas Amsterdam was small, orderly and giving. With its tranquil, tolerant culture and easygoing lifestyle, Holland seemed like El Dorado - a blissful land of milk and cheese. Purely by coincidence, if there is such a thing, I took Harry Mulisch&apos;s The Discovery of Heaven to Amsterdam with me. I enjoyed the book very much, but when I had finished reading it there remained a rather morose feeling - a feeling of apprehension and loneliness, and a sullen recognition that not even the most sterile places on earth were immune to conflicts and clashes. Helen Simpson A few years ago, I booked us a last-minute summer holiday to Ischia, and by some lucky chance packed a copy of Reflections on Blue Water by Alan Ross. We alternated ferry trips to Capri, Pompeii, Naples and Procida with days round the pool, which was fed from the hot springs for which the island is famous. Many of Ischia&apos;s visitors come for the hot mud treatments and thermal springs - Ross describes &quot;the fanghi, the foul-smelling mud pools in which there are always a handful of stout customers of both sexes wallowing&quot;. Our pool was fringed with elderly Teutonic arthritis-sufferers, up to their necks in warm water, staying put for hours. Sometimes these heads talked to each other, but more often they remained silent and glared at the children splashing around in the middle. I was glad to have a good book. In my ignorance I hadn&apos;t heard of Alan Ross, the poet, travel and cricket writer who edited the London Magazine for 40 years. Ross first visited Ischia, war-weary, in 1947; he returned often with family and friends during the 50s and 60s; then he stopped. Towards the end of his life he felt curious to see the Aeolian islands again and this book is the result of his return visit. It is a fund of associative literary information that could only have been amassed by a passionate reader. Gorky, Ibsen, Rilke, DH Lawrence, Walter Benjamin, Pablo Neruda and scores more wrote in or near Ischia; Ross describes their books and their lives with detailed succinctness, en route dipping in and out of his own thoughts and travel observations. Reflections on Blue Water was published in 1999; Alan Ross died early in 2001 (although I didn&apos;t know this). How strange that his farewell to Ischia should be my introduction, and that on holiday six months after his death I should have had such a powerful sense of being in the company of this wonderfully well-read, thoughtful man. Paul Theroux In the monsoon season of 1970, I boarded the MV Keningau in Singapore bound for Borneo. The ship was small, not much bigger than a ferry, the inexpensive way for rubber-tappers and their families to travel to the plantations of East Malaysia. They were down below - hundreds of them, off to work. I was sailing to Kota Kinabalu, for the fun of it, and also to climb Mount Kinabalu. In a few months, my wife would be giving birth to our second child, and this was a selfish and solitary jaunt, before I became fully engaged as a father of two. I also had the notion that this solitude would help me in my writing project at the time, a novel with the provisional title Saint Jack, about a middle-aged American who dreams of getting rich in Singapore. In my small bag with a change of clothes were my notebooks and my book for the trip, a hard-cover copy of VS Naipaul&apos;s novel A House for Mr Biswas. Because there were so few of us in first class, we all ate together: the captain&apos;s wife and his son; a planter&apos;s wife, part-Malay, and her small son, in the cabin next to mine; and a Tamil lawyer, travelling on his own - he was about my age, which was 29. What seems like a cast for a Maugham story was in fact a pleasant and sedate group. The captain and his family were friendly people but all of them chewed food with their mouths open, a family trait I have never encountered anywhere else. Some evenings, I played cards with the Tamil and the planter&apos;s wife, usually the game of Hearts. Then I became engrossed in the Naipaul novel, slipped into the life of the Tulsi family and its odd-man-out, Mohun Biswas. The novel is without mannerisms, seems almost not to have a style, yet is so detailed and humane, it offered me a whole world; and as with the greatest novels, it made me care. I memorised a paragraph beginning &quot;The mind is merciful . . .&quot; &quot;Paul&apos;s laughing,&quot; the planter&apos;s wife said from the card table. &quot;At a book!&quot; the Tamil said. I hardly noticed the voyage. Most of the time, I was in Trinidad with Mohun Biswas and Anand. I was dismayed that in a day or so I&apos;d be finished with the book, and I thought - as young writers do - I could never write this. But the passion of this novel helped me see that I had my own novel to write. Colin Thubron Thirty years ago I was travelling across north-east Iran in a battered Austin, reading Hermann Hesse&apos;s futuristic The Glass Bead Game. This was the consummating work of the mystical nobel laureate: a feat of transcendent genius or of earnest kitsch, depending on your taste. It was also a cult novel for hippies, and by chance I was following the old hippie trail. As I crossed the Afghan border and made for the Hindu Kush, I reached the point in the novel where its hero&apos;s spiritual journey moved beyond an immersion in mathematics towards a retreat into wild nature. At last I climbed into the remote Bamiyan valley. Above me, from my half-abandoned hotel (the hippies were dwindling), the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan - later to be dynamited by the Taliban - were still mountainously intact, and stared across to where the city ruined by Genghis Khan lay desolate under the stars. Either the altitude or the other-worldly landscape began playing on my imagination. Next day, as I drove along a track to the lakes of Band-i-Amir, I might have been Hesse&apos;s pilgrim, advancing into oblivion. The lakes were canyons sunk in the mountain plateau, treeless and lunar, like abstract sculpture carved in desert rock. The river that fed them fell in a half-calcified waterfall to the valley, where wild horses grazed. For hours I wandered round their rim. They were glassily still. Their colours were all different, brilliant and intense: one a vivid cobalt blue, another malachite green. The end of Hesse&apos;s hero comes as he swims into a blue-green lake that closes over him. I was reminded so powerfully of this as I walked that it took on a dazed foreboding. To swim into the waters of the Band-i-Amir, I felt, would be like entering a jewel, to be embalmed there: an insect trapped in amber. You would become immortal. But the cliffs beneath me were sheer; the waters looked literally untouchable. Besides, I was more in love with life than with Hesse. I retreated from their edge, and soon afterwards, back in Kabul, somebody stole my copy of The Glass Bead Game Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn It was the spring of 1985 and I had lost my job and was wandering for no good reason in South America. In my bag I had novels by some of the local geniuses, which I read in cheap pensions and dimly lit waiting rooms and buses and trains. On the train from Puno to Cuzco in Peru, which is at the oxygen-scarce top of the Andes, I began to read Mario Vargas Llosa&apos;s Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter. I had no idea it was going to be so funny. I loved the hero who marries his glamorous aunt and I could not stop laughing at his antics in the radio station. The book got funnier as the oxygen became scarcer. The more I turned the pages the more I laughed, not understanding that on this journey it was essential to save your breath. Gradually, I began to lose consciousness. It was delicious for me but most alarming for those around me. Eventually, they had to send to the guardroom for oxygen, supplies of which were kept for gringos, and applied with dexterity and haste to my poor lungs. I was warned not to pick up the book again until we had reached our destination. The Andes and Mario Vargas Llosa had left me breathless. I have never looked back. 20 recent recommendations Fiction Half a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie The Yacoubian Building by Alaa Al Aswany Falling Man by Don DeLillo The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai What Is the What by Dave Eggers Then We Came to the End by Joshua Ferris The Road by Cormac McCarthy On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan The Damned Utd by David Peace Absurdistan by Gary Shteyngart Non-fiction Tocqueville by Hugh Brogan Heroes by Gordon Brown Imperial Life in the Emerald City by Rajiv Chandrasekaran The Ordeal of Elizabeth Marsh by Linda Colley The Weather Makers by Tim Flannery The Mistress&apos;s Daughter by AM Homes Austerity Britain by David Kynaston Family Romance by John Lanchester The Hungry Years by William Leith Homo Britannicus by Chris Stringer \u00b7  To order any of these books with a discount and free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0870 836 0875. \u00b7 This article was amended on Wednesday June 27 2007.

Look at Frans Hals&apos;s double portrait of Isaac Massa and Beatrix van der Laen in the National Gallery&apos;s forthcoming Dutch Portraits show and, instantly, all will be right with your corner of the world. The graceful painting, silvery with intimate affection, documents one of the great changes in the history of European marriage: the possibility of the shared smile - the glimlach revolution. Not that lipwork had hitherto been out of the question for portraiture. But let&apos;s face it, La Joconde isn&apos;t, is she? That thinly knowing smirk implies private knowledge, to be decoded only through the proprietorial collusion of patron and painter. But Hals&apos;s newly married couple, Beatrix sporting both betrothal and wedding rings on her right hand, advertise their mutual pleasure openly for our shared celebration. They incline to each other and, through their self-identification as a harmonious pair, radiate that sympathy outward through the picture plane towards us. Behold, the painting says, as Isaac holds his hand to his heart, the very picture of proper Christian marriage in which duty also happens to be pleasure. To gauge the magnitude of that alteration you can look at Jan Claesz&apos;s twin portraits in the exhibition of a married couple from the first decade of the 17th century. The figures are still rigid with conventions of social duty, above all that of engendering, the human bond entirely subsumed by the obligations of decorum. Precisely because, during the 17th century, the Dutch travelled that journey from iconic formalism, through a period of easygoing naturalism, back to refined family ensembles dressed to display patrician rank and classical taste, the National Gallery show is an opportunity to reflect on the evolution of the genre itself. As patrons reminded painters (including Rembrandt) whom they thought had been altogether too free with artistic licence, likeness was their first duty. But as Richard Brilliant argued in his elegant book Portraiture, the artist has often interpreted that job as the likeness of an idea, a sense of a person, rather than the laborious imitation of physiognomic detail. Roger Fry complained of a Sargent portrait of a British general that he couldn&apos;t see the man for the likeness. He was commenting at a time when a portrait was thought to be the capture of a bundle of psychological characteristics stamping the unique quality of a person, which could be read through facial expression and body language, and then transcribed on to the canvas as a sign of essential self. This was no more than a subjective hunch about a person, masquerading as some deeper objective reality. But it meant that modern portraiture has generally been imitation complicated by interpretation. Centuries earlier, before the Romantics inaugurated the cult of the unrepeatable self, the work of the portraitist was to represent the imagined mask of, say, the scholar (Holbein&apos;s Erasmus), the Doge (Titian&apos;s Andrea Gritti), or the virtuoso courtier (Raphael&apos;s Castiglione); all of them personifications rather than revelations. But between the normative icon of the Renaissance and the naked ego-show of the 19th century, bolder portraitists such as Hals nudged the decorous expectations of their patrons towards informality while never quite disobeying the obligation to represent something (wealth garnered in virtue, for instance) as well as someone. Then, enter the Haarlem smile, hallmarked not just by Hals, but by followers such as Jan de Bray, whose happy couple, the printer Abraham Casteleyn and his wife Margriet de Bancken, perpetuate the Halsian manner well into the 1660s, with the adoring huisvrouw (housewife) leaning towards her husband, while he gestures with creamy complacency towards us. Just why Haarlem should have broken the solemnity barrier is a mystery, though perhaps the conjunction of breweries and textiles, both giving a glossy shine to things, the humanist slant of its academies removed from Calvinist-canting Leiden, had something to do with it. But the Haarlem painters also knew that the line between the sympathetic smile and the coarse grin, with teeth exposed, was the severe boundary that separated portraiture from genre painting. The most famous of all Hals&apos;s paintings, The Laughing Cavalier, is, in fact, neither. And no wonder, for the raucous guffaw, with its noisome reek of herring and onions, was the sign of low-lives, both the people and the pictures. The van der Laen marriage portrait is something else again, on one level an omnium gatherum of all the stock marital pieties that could have been pulled straight from a domestic morality manual such as Jacob Cats&apos;s Houwelyck. Beatrix leans against her solid spouse in a gesture of trusting subordination to his considerable substance. At her feet, inevitably, trails ivy, the symbol of fidelity, while behind the couple a vine, the emblem of fruitful devotion, twines itself around a sturdy trunk. The partners were famously loaded: a prosperous Russian trade merchant married to a local heiress. But what would otherwise be an egregious display of conspicuous fortune is carefully offset by sartorial signals of their old-fashioned homeliness. The sharp clothes may flash with Hals&apos;s silky light, but they are sober Christian black and Beatrix sports the kind of aggressively unfashionable millstone ruff which, by the 1630s, was more likely to be found encircling the neck of a matron. And if raw money is modified by old piety, it&apos;s also polished by culture, hence the display of their poetic pretensions, embodied by the garden, the kind of place extolled in the gently Arcadian love poetry of PC Hooft, complete with Italianate pavilions, classical statuary and fountains. But Hals has moved the picture well beyond an anthology of allusions. The scene is bright with human as well as botanical nature; the smiles seem spontaneous rather than assumed. In an exquisite touch of intimacy, Hals has the fine silk of her hair escaping her under-cap, the ondermuts that was almost never thought proper for portraits, but whose delicate pink seems to rhyme with her rosy complexion. His ability to convey this move to warm informality was technical as well as conceptual. Inspired perhaps by Rubens (for the Flemish presence was strong in Haarlem), Hals&apos;s handling of paint was itself looser than anything that had yet appeared in Dutch art, the darting hand suggesting the energetic innocence of impulse. Of course, the balance between bravura and decorum was always delicate. Hals&apos;s portrait of the twentysomething plutobrat Willem Coymans obliges the patrician by incorporating his coat of arms - the black cattle that made him an urban kooi-man (cow-boy). But by describing the translucent fallen collar and the gold-embroidered coat through a web of dashing, hectic strokes, Hals manages to give Coymans the look of unbothered insouciance, making his improbable expression of thoughtful self- regard a tad more credible. We&apos;re constantly being cautioned by the anachronism cops not to read backwards and trawl through Dutch art for the ancestry of modern bourgeois informality. And if it&apos;s countervailing images of Calvinist sobriety you want (though any Calvinist mirror of the self whiffs a bit of oxymoron), you&apos;ll find enough dutiful sobersides in the show. (Casteleyn and de Bancken turn up again in startling profile as Calvinist clones.) But the curators have been right, for the most part, to go for the graceful flash, in the work, for instance, of the satiny Cornelisz Verspronck, which briefly lit up the Low Countries and lingered to haunt the archivists of European memory - Proust, Claudel, Zbigniew Herbert - as the sorry old continent staggered from butchery to banality. Their observation that the 17th-century Dutch painters stereotyped by Hollandophobes like Ruskin as incapable of rising above the prosaically material, illuminated the poetry of daily life, turns out to be right. For a generation or two, the Dutch did move art on, and through it ennobled quotidian humanity, investing two genres in particular - landscape and portraiture - with the force of natural truth. That happened because the kind of patrons - the church and the court - that were least interested in nature fell away as serious players in the Dutch art market. Instead, there were just punters, you and me, tens of thousands of us, who, if we were, say, in whalebone or the rye trade, could afford a few guilders on a Van Goyen riverscape, or a bit more on an image of ourselves, a contrefeitsel - us edited into grandeur, or piety or marital devotion or cultured finesse, but us all the same. Which is not to say that the painters on show at the National Gallery - even Rembrandt - were free to do their thing any way they saw it. Some had been to Italy, and even those who hadn&apos;t (like Rembrandt) were acutely conscious of the idealising strictures of classicism. At each end of the spectrum there were those unbothered by the conflict - pure Italianisers or pure parochialists - but the strongest were somewhere in between and struggled not just with the conflicting demands of imaginative idealism and natural truth, but with a similarly exacting conflict between the obligations of social form and the lure of vitality. In some of the most powerful portraits, dynamism - the implication of movement - has the upper hand, even when the subject is actually standing quite still. So Andries de Graaf, the potentate of Amsterdam money and politics, in Rembrandt&apos;s slick version of him in 1639, gets the full gentiluomo treatment, leaned against a truncated classical column, legs elegantly contrapposto, his trim frame exuding silkily understated nonchalance. But the billowing swathe of his right sleeve seems to take on a rhetorical life of its own, as if blown by the Dutch breezes, implying the dynamic citizen-hero that Rembrandt presumed de Graaf wished to personify. He may have presumed wrongly, as de Graaf was one of those who expressed his unhappiness with the master&apos;s efforts. The trade-off between grandeur and energy, monumentalism and the life-force, became even more problematic when artists were commissioned (at a lucrative rate per head) to paint group portraits. Adding to the challenge was the requirement, understood as built into the contract (and famously ignored by Rembrandt in The Night Watch), to produce acceptable individual likenesses at the same time as communicating the collective ethos of the company. This is still a tough call for corporate photographers (whether of company retreats or the school cricket team), who do exactly what the most mechanical of the Dutch portraitists did in the late 16th and early 17th centuries: line them up along the picture plane till they run out of heads, or else stack them up in terraced rows. To make the job still more complicated, group portraitists had to register niceties of rank within the companies, so that at a militia banquet no one would confuse the captain with his lieutenants. Unsurprisingly, the results were inhumanly wooden, an additive arrangement that managed, in the memorable phrase of Rembrandt&apos;s student van Hoogstraten, to make the sitters look as if they could all be decapitated with one sweep of the sword. There was one further non-negotiable requirement made of group portraits. In addition to documenting the internal coherence of the company, they also had to engage with those who stood before the paintings, blessing their good fortune that the fate of Amsterdam or Haarlem was in such capable, confidently civic, inexhaustibly virtuous hands. The great Austrian art historian Alois Riegl, in the work he wrote on Dutch group portraiture in 1902, believed this two-way stretch to represent a breakthrough in the genre, reconciling as it did the internal, but locked-off, coherence of Italian art with the outwardly directed exuberant show of the Netherlands. For the first time, so Riegl believed, the connection between subject and beholder had been brought together in compositions that invited cross-frame attentiveness. That might be true, but it was also a genre of inspired social fraud, for this bond between Them and Us came into its own precisely at the moment when the regents of the Dutch towns were becoming a caste of unaccountable oligarchs. Ah, the whoppers that faux-naturalism commits. The pictorial strain of doing all these things simultaneously, having multiple figures participate in a credible scene - chatting, drinking, charitably condescending to orphans or the aged, anatomising - at the same time that they bond with us, was a severe formal test of the available talent. The unavoidability of tables in banqueting pieces meant that figures who would otherwise be showing us their backs have to turn round or lean at 45 degrees, a move not all group portraitists could convincingly bring off. In merely workmanlike hands the paintings either coagulate in a congested scrum or else fall apart. Hals and Rembrandt were not the only virtuosi who could pictorially multitask. Nicolas Pickenoy and Thomas de Keyser, both represented in the National Gallery show, were dependable workhorses in the genre, but their efforts to make the ensembles come credibly alive are tentative and always play second fiddle to their obligations to deliver likeness and rank. Even Hals, the supreme virtuoso of space- and figure-juggling, could buckle under the strain. The Meagre Company, the Amsterdam militia piece in the show, is by two hands: Pieter Codde&apos;s as well as Hals&apos;s, because of a two-year row with the militia officers over whether Hals would finish it in Amsterdam or have it sent back to Haarlem where he was nursing, so he said, a bad leg. (They believed he was stalling for more money.) Exasperated, the company of crossbowmen turned to the local talent, Codde, who may have been in the militia himself. But Codde proved not much more dependable, spending a night in jail in irons along with the maid with whom he was conducting an affair. The double-painting breaks in two, precisely at its gallant centre figure. To the left is Hals&apos;s assured flash and dash; to the right, Codde&apos;s painfully laboured attempts at spontaneity. No wonder Codde never went near full-length figures again. The two Rembrandt group portraits - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp of 1632 and The Staalmeesters: Syndics of the Clothmakers&apos; Guild from three decades later (1662) - bookend his Amsterdam career and are both stupendous masterpieces that would alone be worth the price of admission. Throwing caution to the winds, Rembrandt bet on making collective dramas that embodied the ethos of the group, while not compromising either on likeness or the connection made from the painting to beholder. But the balance between attention within and attention beyond the frame could not be more different. In the Tulp, all eyes within the arrowhead arrangement of intense concentration are locked on to the professor-anatomist, who dissects the flexor muscles while demonstrating its action with his own free right hand. A single hatted figure at the top of the pyramid looks at us while pointing to the criminal corpse in a concessionary gesture to memento mori. We anatomists are good, but let&apos;s not get above ourselves; we all end up like that. But Rembrandt, at least conceptually, has smuggled himself into the scene with the implication that the painterly dexterity needed to bring off the painted anatomy lesson was analogous to the demonstration itself. The same covert self-insertion happens even more ingeniously in the Staalmeesters. It was long assumed that the drama of the scene, with one of the quality-control men rising to his feet, must have been in response to someone entering the chamber of their deliberations and, so Riegl thought, saying something that provoked a response. A cooler generation of critics thought this was so much fantastic projection and insisted this was &quot;just five gentlemen in black sitting for their portraits&quot;. But four years ago, in a stunning insight, Benjamin Binstock argued that since Rembrandt&apos;s initial study drawings for a composition (that he later abandoned for the present arrangement) were made on account-book paper, it was very likely that those drawings were made in the very book we see depicted on their table, thus making artist and sitters true partners in the composition. The two figures, one of whom gestures at a page the other holds, are thus debating the making of art - this work of art. This subtle visual essay in the collaboration between painter and patrons would have been just the thing to tempt Rembrandt as an exercise in vindication, since he was doubtless still smarting from his greatest fiasco four years before, when his painting of Claudius Civilis and the oath of the Batavians had been rejected by the regents of the town hall, leading him to mutilate the masterpiece. The connection between the two, Binstock further argued, is not just their similarity as groups around a table, but the fact that the Staalmeesters was painted on the rough herringbone canvas intended for a replacement for the repudiated Batavians. It gets even better. If the syndics are paying attention to the drawings in the book and then to someone in the room, that someone must surely be Rembrandt himself, so that the syndics are actively glancing from book to painter, taking in the changes he has made to the very scene that we now see. This is a gesture of co-option beyond anything Riegl could have imagined. The master has put himself in our shoes and vice versa in a quality-control drama of composition. The syndics are still checking the cloth, but it is in fact the weave of a canvas. The secret of the Staalmeesters can stand for the peculiar genius of Dutch art at this moment in its history; one that wore its prodigious ingenuity lightly. What seems to be the most straightforward visual culture turns out to be a Chinese puzzle; an endless inquiry into the observation and representation of seen things and people. The Dutch were obsessed with nature all right, but very often, and with a confounding depth, that turns out to be the nature of picturing itself. \u00b7  Dutch Portraits: The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals is at the National Gallery, London WC2, from June 27 to September 16.

Not many people go on holiday to New York with walking boots and roomy calf-length trousers purchased more for comfort than style, sensible rucksacks and blister plasters. There is an international uniform for ramblers and a glance around the arrivals lounge at John F Kennedy airport suggests it comes in shades of taupe, mushroom and khaki.  We&apos;ve only been here for five minutes and have already lost one of the group. Joseph, 72, last seen at the X-ray machine at Heathrow, has disappeared. This doesn&apos;t bode well for a seven-day walking tour in one of the world&apos;s most frenetic cities, but Loraine, a lecturer in nursing from Wolverhampton, will later tell me that all walking groups expect 5 per cent wastage. She&apos;s only half joking.  Most of the party have never been to New York before. Some may have trekked across far-flung parts of Peru and Australia and China, but the nearest they&apos;ve got to this infamous city is a rerun of Cagney &amp; Lacey Fortunately, our guide, Irene, has lived in New York all her adult life. She can reel off bus routes and subway interchanges the way other people list the names of their children. She is also very fit. Aged 62, she hikes, cycles and plays tennis. In the winter she zigzags though Central Park on cross-country skis.  We arrive on Memorial Day weekend. It&apos;s a broiling 28C and 34 million Americans will have already taken to the road in their air-conditioned cars. Not us. Irene suggests we meander through the Upper West Side, near our hotel. Twenty blocks equals a mile, she explains, as she strides out along the sidewalk on Broadway, pointing out Citarella, a great fish shop, and Niko&apos;s, the best local Greek restaurant.  Those of us not banjaxed by jet lag trundle behind. We turn up West End Avenue, where a one-bedroom apartment costs at least $1m, and head towards Riverside Park, a neighbourhood, non-touristy alternative to legendary Central Park. Over dinner at the local diner, we tentatively introduce ourselves. Ramblers are an eclectic and cheery bunch. Many are widows or widowers or divorced. For some, this is their first holiday alone. There&apos;s a postman, a magistrate, an educational psychologist. There&apos;s even a Baroness (though she keeps this mostly to herself). Most are retired and many started travelling late in life - the indomitable Labour peer applied for her first passport at the age of 43.  The following morning Joseph reappears (accompanied by a round of applause but minus his baggage) and the trip takes on a pattern which will become comfortingly familiar. In essence, Irene will explain the day&apos;s timetable by saying the same thing three times, very slowly (&apos;Tonight we will meet at 7.30 in the lobby. This evening we will gather at half past seven at the front desk. We will set out for dinner at 7.30. Meet me here, in reception&apos;) and we will set off behind her, like an obedient army of ants.  One of the advantages of a walking tour of New York is that for a city teeming with life, it is a tiny place. Wholly navigable with its grid system and only 31 miles in circumference, it is also fabulously flat. So much so that its one little bump, near the UN headquarters, goes by the name of Murray Hill.  On the first day we visit the glistening skyscrapers of Midtown (from the Lincoln Center at West 65th Street to Macy&apos;s at 34th), followed by Brooklyn&apos;s handsome brownstones and a walk across the famous suspension bridge back into Manhattan.  Irene points out places of interest - everything from Trump Tower to Nora Ephron&apos;s apartment block - but I&apos;m looking as much at the people as at the buildings and views. Overdressed Jewish families and underdressed Paris Hilton lookalikes. Slacker downtown students and uptown old ladies with poodle perms. A Chinese man, bent double by age, staggers by and I wonder what kind of life he&apos;s led. This mix of nationalities becomes all the more poignant on Monday, when we visit the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, the stopping-off point for 100 million immigrants into America during the 20th century. At the museum it becomes clear that this is a city of stories, of arrivals and survival. In a remarkable treasure trove of photographs, solemn-faced families from across the globe stare at the lens and wonder if their new lives will be any better than the ones they have left behind.  As the week goes on, the itinerary is a mix of tourist classics (on Tuesday we&apos;re at the top of the Empire State Building) and local haunts. One lovely evening is spent at an outdoor concert of Dvorak and Brahms at the Cathedral of St John the Divine, followed by coffee and poppy-seed strudel at the Hungarian pastry shop on Amsterdam Avenue at 110th Street.  It&apos;s strangely relaxing being told what to do. For once on a city break I&apos;m not holding the useless map upside down and threatening to eviscerate the idiot who wrote the guidebook. My visits to the Big Apple have always amounted to a frantic rush between bars and shops and taxi cabs, all in the bit of Manhattan between Central Park and SoHo. This time I learn how peaceful New York can be, and how neighbourhoods sit one beside the next, like books on a shelf.  I had wondered if I would be embarrassed trudging round this uber-cool city looking like a middle-aged, overweight cub scout, but I realise there is no point worrying. One of the joys of New York is that no one cares. I buy my daily bottle of water from a transsexual at the local corner shop. Nobody looks twice, at either me or her.  By midweek we&apos;re getting used to New York and its hazards, not least the buses that unexpectedly turn right on red lights, the soupy temperatures, the rollerbladers and the joggers, the crowds and the incomprehensible subway map.  On Wednesday we tour Harlem, far from the usual tourist haunts. We&apos;re introduced to an eightysomething Italian woman who has baked bread here all her life, and supermarket owners who speak only Spanish. We walk past Bill Clinton&apos;s offices on 125th Street and the Abyssinian Baptist Church on West 138th Street where, on Sundays, the queue of worshippers stretches around the block and Fats Waller&apos;s father used to be the minister. The tour finishes on Strivers Row, named after the blues musicians who came to Harlem to make their names. Not so long ago this was an infamous area avoided by tourists. Now you can&apos;t move for property developers intent on gentrification. We average about five miles a day. Everyone has walked much further on other rambling holidays but we are on our feet from nine till six and it&apos;s oddly tiring. I&apos;d fondly imagined swapping my walking boots for Carrie Bradshaw heels and nipping out after dinner for cocktails, but I&apos;m usually too exhausted. I&apos;m not the only one. By Thursday Andy has blisters and Margaret, who has arthritis, is resting her knees on an open-topped tourist bus. Just as we&apos;re getting our bearings, we leave New York for the day. On Thursday we set off from majestic Central Station, all gleaming marble and polished walnut, for a trip up the Hudson River to Dobbs Ferry and Cold Spring. What a treat it is to sit down. The heavenly, unreal chill of an air-conditioned train. Within minutes we&apos;ve left the sky-scrapers behind. Looking across the broad, tranquil water, we could be in Canada or New Zealand. Acres of forest, clapboard houses, quaint stations with hand-painted signposts. We walk along a deliciously shady and wooded route that follows the path of a 19th-century aqueduct which used to bring water into the city and saved thousands of New Yorkers from death by cholera.  On my final day, we return downtown to the site of Ground Zero. All week we&apos;ve looked at Manhattan from different vantage points - from across the East River, from Brooklyn, from the top of the Empire State Building - and been unable to take in the skyline without thinking of the two towers that are no longer there. A block away is St Paul&apos;s Chapel, the church used as a sanctuary for rescue workers after 9/11. This was where pews doubled as beds and people from all over New York came to offer help and seek solace. The homespun exhibition still housed inside the 240-year-old building is incredibly poignant. All the more so because having spent a week walking the city, negotiating its police cops and dog walkers, manholes and kerbstones, cab drivers and skateboarders, I can&apos;t help but feel that a sliver of it belongs to us too.

That debate is now under way. Most of those who support the deal do not want a referendum. Most of those who are unhappy about it do. On both sides the reasoning is depressingly simple. There is a good chance that, however strong a case was made to British voters, in their present mood a referendum would wreck the deal. There are no rules in the British constitution about when a referendum is appropriate. As Lord Owen wrote yesterday, much of the uncertainty is Tony Blair&apos;s fault. He refused a referendum in 2003, changed his mind in 2004, dropped the commitment after the French and Dutch referendums rejected the constitution, reinstated the promise in the 2005 election manifesto, and now insists there is no need for one. Having six different positions in four years has led to a suspicion that the most effective argument for a referendum is a loud and sustained clamour for one. And tacking this way and that has undermined the confidence of an instinctively Eurosceptic home audience in its government&apos;s own declared assessment of the deal reached - especially as it was reached at 4.45am on Saturday with the aircraft engines revving to whisk Mr Blair to a final, awkward audience with the Pope. The government&apos;s case is that the constitution is dead and what is now being proposed is only an amending treaty, similar to the treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, all of which were ratified by parliament. But with another voice it has been claiming that the amending treaty retains the essential ingredients of the doomed constitution. There will be an EU foreign minister in all but name and a permanent president, instead of the awkward six-month rotating presidency. The EU will become a single legal entity with the ability to sign treaties in its own right, and there will be an extension of qualified majority voting. These are new and significant powers. Perhaps it would be better for the government to admit as much. That need not in itself mean that there should be a referendum on the deal, rather than the normal process of parliamentary ratification, which has served in the past for bigger changes than these. Mr Brown knows that a way forward has been found for an organisation that had been faced with paralysis. Climate change, energy security and policing a UN deal on Kosovo all require a single European voice. If the EU is to be anything, it must be more than a collection of competing domestic interests: the squabble between nations about funds and voting weights will continue - because it matters - but should not crowd from attention the larger tasks of the EU and the whole reason for the union. A united Europe is important to each member state, just as its own domestic interests are, not least because European unity is very much in the domestic interests of each member. Mr Brown has a chance to set the lead and raise the tone. As Mr Blair said yesterday, the commission is headed by a reformer. Germany and France are led by people who are more Atlanticist in their thinking than their predecessors were. Britain has a strong economy, the strongest army in Europe, it speaks the dominant language and its civil servants are respected in Brussels. All the elements are there for Mr Brown to take the helm. But if he concedes a referendum, as he need not, and loses it, other countries are poised to fill the gap. Nicolas Sarkozy set his stamp on the debate, even if he did not alter the EU&apos;s underlying ability to fight cartels and state aid, which distort markets. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, also drew strength from her diplomatic success on Saturday and begins to look like the new Helmut Kohl of Europe. She and Mr Sarkozy can both claim to be placing their countries at the heart of Europe. It is important for a new British prime minister to join them.", "sentences": ["The government&apos;s case is that the constitution is dead and what is now being proposed is only an amending treaty, similar to the treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, all of which were ratified by parliament."], "title": "Leader:The case against a referendum", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/25/politics.comment", "tags": ["Politics", "European Union", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-25T23:07:48Z", "article": "Bernard Kouchner, France&apos;s new foreign minister, has a distinguished record as an advocate of intervention in countries where human rights are abused. As a co-founder of M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res he stated that &quot;we were establishing the moral right to interfere inside someone else&apos;s country&quot;. Saddam Hussein&apos;s mass murder of Iraqi citizens is why Kouchner supported the war in Iraq, and he has often said that the murder of his Russian-Jewish grandparents in Auschwitz inspired his humanitarian interventionism. Whatever one thinks of Kouchner&apos;s policies, his motives are surely impeccable. The fact that many prominent Jewish intellectuals in Europe and the US - often, like Kouchner, with a leftist past - are sympathetic to the idea of using American armed force to further the cause of human rights and democracy may derive from the same wellspring. Any force is justified to avoid another Shoah, and those who shirk their duty to support such force are regarded as no better than collaborators with evil. If we were less haunted by memories of appeasing the Nazi regime people might not be so concerned about human rights. And by no means do all those who work to protect the rights of others invoke the Third Reich to justify Anglo-American armed intervention. But the term &quot;Islamofascism&quot; was not coined for nothing. It invites us to see a big part of the Islamic world as a natural extension of nazism. Saddam, hardly an Islamist, and President Ahmadinejad of Iran are often described as natural successors to Hitler. And European weakness - not to mention the &quot;treason&quot; of its liberal scribes, paving the way to an Islamist conquest of Europe (&quot;Eurabia&quot;) - is seen as a ghastly echo of the appeasement of the Nazi threat. Revolutionary Islamism is undoubtedly dangerous and bloody. Yet analogies with the Third Reich, though highly effective as a way of denouncing people whose views one disagrees with, are usually false. No Islamist armies are about to march into Europe - indeed, most victims of revolutionary Islamism live in the Middle East - and Ahmadinejad, his rhetoric notwithstanding, does not have a fraction of Hitler&apos;s power. The refusal of many Muslims to integrate into western societies, as well as high unemployment and ready access to revolutionary propaganda, can easily explode in acts of violence. But the prospect of an Islamised Europe is remote. We are not living a replay of 1938. So why the alarm about European appeasement, especially among the neoconservatives? Why the easy equation of Islamism with nazism? Israel is often cited. But Israel can mean different things to different people: to certain evangelical Christians, it is the holy site of the second coming of the messiah; to many Jews, it is the one state that will always offer refuge; to neoconservative ideologues, it is the democratic oasis in a desert of tyrannies. Defending Israel against its Islamic enemies may indeed be a factor in the existential alarmism that underlies the war on terror. A nuclear-armed Iran would certainly make Israel feel more vulnerable. But it is probably overstated as an explanation. Kouchner did not advocate western intervention in Bosnia or Kosovo because of Israel. If concern for Israel played a part in Paul Wolfowitz&apos;s advocacy of war in Iraq, it was probably a minor one. Both men were motivated by common concerns for human rights and democracy, as well as perhaps by geopolitical considerations. Still, Islamist rhetoric, adopted by Ahmadinejad among others, is designed to stir up memories of the Shoah. So perhaps the existential fear of some western intellectuals is easier to explain than their remarkable, sometimes fawning, trust in the US government. The explanation of this mysterious trust may lie elsewhere. Many neocons emerged from a leftist past, in which a belief in revolution from above was commonplace: &quot;people&apos;s democracies&quot; yesterday, &quot;liberal democracies&quot; today. Among Jews and other minorities, another historical memory may also play a part: the protection of the imperial state. Jews were among the most loyal subjects of the Austro-Hungarian emperor, because he shielded them from the violent nationalism of majority populations. Polish and Russian Jews, at least at the beginning of the communist era, were often loyal subjects of the communist state, because it promised (falsely, as it turned out) to protect them from anti-semitic nationalists. If it were true that our democratic world were about to be destroyed by an Islamist revolution, it would only make sense to seek protection in the full force of the US. But if one sees our problems in less apocalyptic terms, another kind of trahison des clercs comes into view: the blind cheering on of a sometimes foolish power embarked on unnecessary wars that cost more lives than they were intended to save. \u00b7 Ian Buruma, the author of Murder in Amsterdam: the Death of Theo van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance, is professor of human rights at Bard College, New York \u00a9 Project Syndicate, 2007 Project-syndicate.org", "sentences": ["\u00b7 Ian Buruma, the author of Murder in Amsterdam: the Death of Theo van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance, is professor of human rights at Bard College, New York \u00a9 Project Syndicate, 2007 Project-syndicate.org"], "title": "Ian Buruma: This is not a 1938 encore", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/26/comment.comment1", "tags": []}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-26T09:24:51Z", "article": "Best in show ... visitors looking at The Milkmaid by Vermeer. Photograph: Martin Godwin I think of myself as a meanderer by inclination, and although this has limitations, many of them sociopathic, it possesses certain advantages too. One of them is that I can spend hours drifting around galleries without any clear idea where I&apos;m going, what I&apos;ve come to see or even if I have any good reason for being there. Marching into London&apos;s National Gallery one lunchtime years ago, determined to double-check that the Wilton Diptych was as amazing as everyone says it is, I ended up sidetracked by Francisco de Zurbaran&apos;s hilarious portrait of St Margaret instead - Zurbaran imagines this bloody-minded martyr as a kind of Renaissance Sloane Ranger - and left the building an hour later without going near the wing that contains the Wilton. But when you&apos;re in a rush or short of cash, meandering around a large gallery without knowing what to look at is an impossible luxury. I thought this when I spent a grand total of 22 hours in Amsterdam over the weekend. So it was that I found myself in the museum quarter on Saturday morning, with only an hour-and-a-half to spare. Fortunately the good people who run the Rijksmuseum had thoughtfully embarked on a long-term restoration project that ensured the gallery proper was closed. But here&apos;s the thing: instead of keeping a couple of wings or the odd room open, perhaps shuffling exhibits around over the course of the project, they&apos;ve taken the brave step of shutting everything for the duration and moved the most important parts of the collection to a sub-gallery next door. What this means is that you can sample the cream of the Netherlands&apos; unequalled painting and decorative arts tradition in a building about the size of an average new-build. Distilling the highlights into a custom-made exhibition has obviously forced the gallery&apos;s curators to be brutally selective: The Night Watch gets a room to itself, but ends up dominating proceedings so much that you realise what a silly, deliberately overblown thing it is. Other than that it&apos;s all hand-picked Rembrandts, better-than-average Van Ruisdaels and three glittering Vermeers. Now I know what you&apos;re going to say (if I weren&apos;t writing this I&apos;d say it too). One of the delights of looking at art is seeing the stuff you didn&apos;t expect to see, or bumped into on the way somewhere else. Life isn&apos;t just about masterpieces: it&apos;s in the minors, the maybes, the mysterious surprises en route. And that&apos;s before you even get into the ethics of canon and selectivity, still less the concept of what actually constitutes a &quot;masterpiece&quot; in the first place. I know all this, I honestly do: I once spent a train journey agonising about whether to delete from iTunes all the songs on Joni Mitchell&apos;s Blue that I can&apos;t stand, but still decided I couldn&apos;t bring myself to commit such a crime against artistic integrity. Compared to that, surely letting go of a few lesser Pieter der Hoochs counts as enlightened. And during my quick tour around the Rijksmuseum-in-miniature I had fun in a way I wouldn&apos;t have done if I&apos;d had to trudge my way through the vast, unedited collection. I didn&apos;t feel overwhelmed, pressured, in fact felt positively euphoric to spend a third of my precious hour-and-a-bit inside looking at just one work, Vermeer&apos;s Delft street scene - a painting that only gets stranger, more wonderful, more deliriously brilliant the more time you spend in front of it. Rushing back to catch my plane, I felt refreshed and engaged in a way I haven&apos;t for ages.

In it he compiled a modern, critical edition of the hundreds of &quot;fragments&quot; - or quotations in other Chinese texts - that testified to the existence of the text of the Shen Tzu, a work of political philosophy completed c275BC that had been lost in direct transmission for more than a thousand years. Paul traced every single fragment of quoted text, determined its authenticity, collating it with other versions of the same piece of text, and finally established a critical edition of the surviving fragments that was authoritative. Even greater than this accomplishment was his creation of a method of scholarship that could be used to establish modern critical editions of all ancient Chinese works, whether still extant or not. The importance of this work has also been recognised in China: when the Shanghai museum recently announced the imminent publication of an unearthed fragment of the Shen Tzu, brush-written on strips of bamboo from the period in which the original work was compiled, they cited Paul&apos;s book as the definitive reference. Paul belonged to four different countries, but China, the land of his birth, was the enduring strand in his life. His parents were Irish missionaries with the China Inland Mission, and he was born at Shunde (Xingtai), in Hebei province, north-eastern China. At the time of the Japanese invasion in 1937, he was attending an English school at Chefoo (present-day Yantai, in Shandong province), and living with his mother, two brothers and sister, while his father was away on missionary work in the interior. At first, the Japanese allowed the school to continue, but after Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the internment of Japanese-Americans in the US, conditions became more severe. They were eventually moved to Weixian internment camp (in Shandong), where they remained until liberated by American paratroopers in 1945. Paul always said they had had enough to eat and, as a child living with his family, he did not feel any particular hardship. When the war ended, his family returned to Northern Ireland, and he completed secondary school in Belfast. His higher education was as unconventional as much of his life. After spells at the Free University of Amsterdam, the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis (where he met and married Marcia Cole in 1952), the US army language school at Monterey, California, a stint as an interpreter in Japan, and a few years teaching in Taiwan, he still had no BA. None the less, the great German sinologist, Hellmut Wilhelm, accepted him at the University of Washington at Seattle in 1959. Awarded a BA the following year, he went on to write his PhD, the earliest version of his Shen Tzu Fragments. After a period of teaching at the University of Wisconsin (1963-70), Paul joined Professors DC Lau and AC Graham at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) in London in 1970. Soas soon became the centre of classical Chinese learning in the western world; it was also an extraordinarily convivial place. Lau had a dry, ironic wit that some people found intimidating and Graham was oblivious of social norms, but Paul had a natural social grace that made the most awkward student or visitor feel comfortable. He also had an extraordinary breadth and depth of erudition; one subject of conversation thus led easily into another, and long hours were spent in the student bar and Chinese restaurants, discussing everything under the sun, but often returning to Chinese philosophy and how to understand particular lines of ancient texts. Paul was a true Chinese junzi, a term usually translated as &quot;gentleman&quot;; that is, he was graceful, kind, intellectually curious, good-hearted, a generous and loyal friend, and reluctant to conform to the petty demands of bureaucracy. To a younger colleague, he was a magnificent model, if not quite the mentor approved by institutions. His teaching was also blissfully free of convention. One of his former students, Vivienne Lo, has written: &quot;He had that quality that I imagine of the ideal, old-style English education: concerned for personal enrichment in the broadest sense, inspiring us to apply an intellectual vitality to whatever life would bring rather than training for vocation ... He was barely concerned with examinations, giving us broad hints about what would be on the paper, in favour of engaging us in lively conversation on whatever garden path the particular text we were reading would lead us up.&quot; Paul became interested in the potential of computers for producing editions of ancient Chinese texts early on. Before the problem of easily inputting Chinese characters using an alphabetic keyboard had been solved, he created a system that was, in some ways, more sophisticated than those now in use. These are based primarily on statistical tabulations of frequency, which aid the computer in generating a list of the most likely characters, from which the person typing must choose. Paul&apos;s system would also have incorporated sophisticated grammatical analysis. After his retirement in 1996, he continued living in London and worked on using the potential of computers to produce rigorous editions of excavated and other ancient Chinese texts in a visually transparent manner. He is survived by his wife, Marcia, daughter Aidan and sons Brian and Kevin. \u00b7 Paul Mulligan Thompson, sinologist, born February 10 1931; died June 12 2007", "sentences": ["After spells at the Free University of Amsterdam, the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis (where he met and married Marcia Cole in 1952), the US army language school at Monterey, California, a stint as an interpreter in Japan, and a few years teaching in Taiwan, he still had no BA."], "title": "Obituary: Paul Thompson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jun/27/guardianobituaries.obituaries", "tags": ["Education"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-27T23:46:30Z", "article": "Frank Heller, who has died aged 87, was one of the last of a generation of internationally renowned social scientists associated with the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London. He held practical and academic posts in the field of management in the Americas before going to the Tavistock in 1969 as director of the centre for decision-making studies for three decades. Frank&apos;s abiding interest lay in the exercise of power and the consequences of sharing power, mainly in work settings. Concerned about the use of appropriate and ideally longitudinal research methods, where data is collected over time, and recognising that much could be learnt from exploring the exercise of power in different institutional contexts, he engaged in a series of comparative projects that helped to establish his reputation. He had started work on a PhD in occupational psychology soon after completing his undergraduate studies at the London School of Economics (LSE), but he was distracted by the demands of work and did not complete it until 1969, when he returned to the UK after several years abroad. It resulted in some of his most important work, carried out at the Tavistock and published in 1971 as Managerial Decision-Making: a Study of Leadership Styles and Power-Sharing Among Senior Managers. One of the most notable research programmes in which Frank took a leading role was the Industrial Democracy in Europe project (1981 and 1993), a 10-country, two-phase study exploring the factors that influence power-sharing. At a time when much of Europe was legislating to ensure some form of industrial democracy but the UK was sticking determinedly to voluntarism, the study showed the key role played by legal and structural features if democratic processes were to take hold in organisations. Alongside this work, Frank was heavily involved in the three-volume International Yearbook of Industrial Democracy and the International Handbook of Industrial Participation. Other important contributions, all leading to books, included an eight-country study with his German colleague, Bernhard Wilpert, of Competence and Power in Managerial Decision-Making (1981), an eight-country study of The Meaning of Work (1987) and a three-country study of Decisions in Organisations (1998). In all these projects, the integrating theme was the exploration of the role of democratic processes in enhancing the quality and acceptability of decision-making and facilitating the full engagement of the skills and capacities of workers in achieving work objectives and promoting workers&apos; well-being. The research was always scholarly and directed primarily to an academic audience, but the ultimate aim was to influence practitioners. This all fitted well with the kind of open systems approach long associated with the Tavistock, reflected in a belief in the importance of the wider social, economic and political context in explaining the scope for and impact of industrial democracy; but also a recognition that an absence of democratic, participative processes inside work organisations, as dominant institutions in society, may well spill over into other areas of life. Many aspects of Frank&apos;s work were brought together in Organisational Participation: Myth and Reality (1998), co-authored with three of his long-term collaborators, Eugen Pusic, George Strauss and Wilpert. It signalled a return to a more contingent approach represented in some of his earlier work with American academic Gary Yukl. The book emphasised the range of conditions necessary for participation in organisations to flourish, including the importance of knowledge and competence, structural and institution support, and trust. By implication, even if participation was always desirable, for ethical reasons rather than to enhance performance, it was not always feasible. Frank&apos;s work was highly influential in academic circles, since it helped to capture developments during the high tide of enthusiasm in Europe for the use of participative processes to distribute power and influence within organisations. By the time of his jointly authored book, it was apparent that in political and industrial circles, enthusiasm for industrial democracy had receded. A long-term and deepening concern for Frank over the years, reflecting his interest in the use of the social sciences, was the relationship between theory and action, and he coined the term &quot;research action&quot; as a counter to the growth of action research, which he considered often lacked effective diagnosis before moving to potentially inappropriate action. It is essentially a process of data collection and group feedback, but also a method that could be used by the participants themselves to engage with the analysis and interpretation of the data provided. He had first applied this with his mature students at the Polytechnic of Central London, and in later years utilised it working with schoolchildren in studies designed to raise awareness of energy conservation. By giving equal weight to the views of all participants, it was a natural extension of his interests in democracy and decision-making. Frank was a prolific contributor to conferences worldwide and wrote 110 articles and 13 books (11 co-authored). In 1994, a number of his collaborators, led by Pieter Drenth, organised a celebration of his 75th birthday, under the auspices of the Kurt Lewin Institute in Amsterdam. As Frank had been heavily influenced by Lewin&apos;s work, this was appropriate, but he was eager to reassure those present that he was not ready to retire. He never did, maintaining his emeritus role at the Tavistock. His early life had been very different. He had been sent by his father from his native Vienna to England in 1934 to complete his schooling at the Quintin Hogg school, in central London. In anticipation of taking over his father&apos;s furniture manufacturing business, he then completed a three-year course in motor car engineering at the Polytechnic of Central London. After his parents escaped from Austria in 1938, he and his father were interned for a year early in the war. On release, Frank was allowed to work in a small engineering company, and rose to the position of foreman (much later, he took over his father&apos;s spring-making firm). Towards the end of the war, he was given an award to study at the LSE, where he gained a degree in economics and sociology. Wanting to und ertake a doctorate that involved some psychology, he completed a part-time MA at Birkbeck College in 1950 and registered there for a PhD. After some part-time teaching, he joined the Polytechnic of Central London, finally becoming head of management studies. Here, he undertook his first comparative research project (with Lyman Porter), published in Occupational Psychology in 1952. In 1961, he seized an opportunity to work for the International Labour Office in Argentina, where he spent three years helping to build a national productivity centre before moving to Chile for a further three years as chief of the UN special fund on the development of small- and medium-scale industry. After that he had a two -year spell, in the mid-1960s, as a visiting professor at Berkeley, during which time he also taught at Stanford University. There, he met Fred Emery, an eminent Australian social scientist, who persuaded him to join him at the Tavistock. Frank took a lively interest in politics, and was happy to engage anyone in discussion with gusto and humour. Despite his travels, his family was always at the centre of his life, and he carried on skiing with them well into his 80s. He is survived by his wife, Florence, his children Michael, Juliet and Claire. \u00b7 Frank Heller, social scientist, born March 22 1920; died May 27 2007", "sentences": ["In 1994, a number of his collaborators, led by Pieter Drenth, organised a celebration of his 75th birthday, under the auspices of the Kurt Lewin Institute in Amsterdam."], "title": "Obituary: Frank Heller", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jun/28/guardianobituaries.obituaries", "tags": ["Science"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-28T07:19:00Z", "article": "I&apos;ve lost count of the number of emails I get asking for advice on how to get published. My initial reaction is &quot;Why bother?&quot; when being unpublished is such fun and so satisfying. When I was in my 20s I lived on a houseboat in Amsterdam. Those were the days: irresponsible alternative living at its best...You can&apos;t imagine how I appreciated cabbage soup. No money for birthday and Christmas presents, but we all turned our hands to something, some people sewed, one guy was a brilliant knitter - someone else found a small soldering iron and took to burning patterns and wise sayings onto bits of wood. It&apos;s amazing how inventive one can become with virtually nothing. It was then I started to write stories for my friends, sometimes embellishing them with illustrations. And I found they gave delight. I sent poems to my parents one penniless Christmas. A friend was feeling really bad, so I wrote him something funny... and the stories kept on coming. Eventually I came home to England, became a newspaper reporter and a radio broadcaster, and eventually I married, but still I wrote personal, special stories. I tried to comfort a seven-year-old whose dad had died. I entertained my own children with silly tales. I never published these. They don&apos;t &quot;belong&quot; to the world. They are gifts that will last longer than the inevitable bath oils and chocolates. Illustrated with photos or drawings, nicely printed out in bright covers, all of these stories have been kept and treasured. When I started to get &quot;properly&quot; published I was asked to run workshops and give talks and readings at schools and festivals - not always on the subjects of my novels - so I took to producing small volumes of my poems and adult short stories. I didn&apos;t even try to get them &quot;published&quot;, partly because I don&apos;t have enough material for whole, erudite tomes worthy of the world&apos;s attention, but also because it was fun doing it myself. Now, if I do a reading, or a storytelling event, I often have my own, personal choice of work available for a couple of quid. These aren&apos;t money-making exercises, they are just mementoes, if anyone is interested. There is no point to turning them into anything more. The world is already stuffed with books that no one will read. Self-publication of a neatly produced, high quality (the paper is never less than 100 gram, preferably 120 gram) booklet with a smart Photoshop cover professionally folded and stapled makes a great gift, or maybe a summary of a good year at the writing group, a fundraiser for a school, or a memorial for a special person. Why bother to go through all the heartache and hassle of fighting to get your precious memories or thoughts into mainstream publication? Your own PC, printer and digital camera are waiting to make someone&apos;s day. If you really want to go big and produce a novel, there&apos;s the internet or print on demand (no surplus stock there!). Getting published by a mainstream company is great, but in all honesty, how many of us can really afford to give up the day job, even when we&apos;ve signed that contract? Such a long, heartbreaking haul for what? The joy of writing should be just that - the writing. Define your audience and publish yourself. Get your books and anthologies into the hands of people who really want to hear from you - whether it&apos;s one copy, or a couple of dozen through print on demand. I&apos;m often asked if I would still keep writing if I wasn&apos;t published by a mainstream publisher. I can honestly say I would. My stories are very important to me, and it gives me a huge amount of pleasure to share them. But it doesn&apos;t matter if no one&apos;s interested. Before my Star Dancer quartet was bought by Macmillan, I had accepted that I&apos;d been lucky to have published nine children&apos;s titles and my career as a &quot;published&quot; writer was probably over. But I still kept writing - because I loved my stories and so did my friends - and that, I am still certain, was the point!", "sentences": ["When I was in my 20s I lived on a houseboat in Amsterdam."], "title": "The joys of NOT being published", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/jun/28/thejoysofnotbeingpublishe", "tags": ["Books"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-28T10:18:31Z", "article": "Visa has hired Wieden &amp; Kennedy to handle the global advertising to support its football World Cup sponsorship after finally securing a $170m deal with Fifa earlier today.

According to the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, an Italian man was detained by specialist anti-kidnap police in the town of Sotogrande, close to Gibraltar, early yesterday. The paper said the man was being held on suspicion of a possible extortion plot against the family of the child, who disappeared on May 3 from a holiday apartment in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz. The suspect was apparently arrested after an international warrant was issued by the French authorities, but Spanish police said: &quot;We are investigating whether this is linked to Madeleine&apos;s disappearance.&quot; The paper said that the man had already tried to blackmail the McCann family, and quoted other sources suggesting that he had been sought by French police in connection with a case of child abuse. French police refused to comment on the reports, referring inquiries back to Spanish and Italian authorities. Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa, the Portuguese officer leading the investigation in the Algarve, told the Guardian that two people were arrested in the operation. Portuguese officers had been called in by their Spanish counterparts to assist in an operation in Spain that began early yesterday, he said, adding that he could not yet confirm whether the arrests were directly linked with Madeleine&apos;s disappearance. Other sources suggested that the second person arrested was a Portuguese woman, but Mr Sousa would not confirm this. The reported arrests, 56 days after Madeleine&apos;s disappearance, were the most significant breakthrough in some weeks in the kidnap investigation. The only other person to have been arrested in connection with the case is Robert Murat, a British man who lives in Praia da Luz. Mr Murat&apos;s house was searched and he was questioned at length but he was not charged. Madeleine was four days short of her fourth birthday when she vanished from the bedroom of her parents&apos; holiday apartment while they ate dinner in a nearby restaurant. She was apparently taken from her bedroom while her two-year-old twin siblings slept beside her. Despite a huge search in the nearby area during the days following the disappearance, and an energetic publicity operation which has seen posters of the missing child distributed throughout Europe and north Africa, there have been no confirmed sightings of Madeleine since she disappeared. Kate and Gerry McCann, her parents, went on a tour of European and north African cities this month in an attempt to widen the appeal for information, visiting Rome, Lisbon, Madrid, Berlin, Amsterdam and Rabat, but the breakthrough for which the family longs remains elusive. Last night John McCann, Gerry&apos;s brother, said he had not yet been given information relating to the arrest. &quot;We have no comment to make, because we know no more than we have seen on the news,&quot; he said. Madeleine&apos;s great-uncle, Brian Kennedy, told Sky News: &quot;We are trying not to get our hopes up too much because they so frequently get dashed.&quot; Mr and Mrs McCann, from Rothley in Leicestershire, have remained in Praia da Luz since their daughter vanished and have vowed not to return to the UK until she is found.", "sentences": ["Kate and Gerry McCann, her parents, went on a tour of European and north African cities this month in an attempt to widen the appeal for information, visiting Rome, Lisbon, Madrid, Berlin, Amsterdam and Rabat, but the breakthrough for which the family longs remains elusive."], "title": "Madeleine McCann inquiry takes new turn as two arrested in Spain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jun/29/ukcrime.madeleinemccann", "tags": ["UK news", "World news", "Crime", "Madeleine McCann", "Spain", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-06-29T07:39:35Z", "article": "Ahh then my nice clean clothes went missing ... David Juritz telling an audience about his mishaps My phone is broken. The screen went a few days ago and texting, my lifeline to the outside world, is impossible. Plus I will have to take out a second mortgage to cover the international calls I am making for interviews. Emailing is also proving difficult on the hoof. But help is at hand. As I&apos;m leaving Copenhagen my contact there hands me a large parcel. It&apos;s a new Smartphone with email, which Toshiba have given me, paying the bill for it too. Life is easier again. It&apos;s a long journey on the overnight train to Amsterdam. I have been invited to stay with Geerte Wachter and her family. As soon as I get through the door, I make a beeline for the washing machine, before setting out on my routine search for a good patch. The people who run Amsterdam&apos;s main hall, the Concertgebouw, say I can play outside just before their concert that evening. I find a very nice spot at the flower market. Then back to Geerte&apos;s for a quick bite to eat before setting out again. My washing has been dried and folded. Luxury! While I&apos;m changing and packing my case, I tread on something on the floor. It&apos;s my new phone, which now has a cracked screen. So I have two unusable phones! Amsterdam takings reasonable, but not great - about \u20ac80. CBS television want to do an interview in Rome the following day, which means the first flight of the trip. This is an expense I can&apos;t really afford, but we think it is worth going. A hotel near the Trevi fountain offers me a free room for the night, which helps. Early start the next morning to fly to Rome via Prague. Automated check in at Schipol where the machine refuses to give me boarding passes. As I&apos;m checking my bags, emphasising that I&apos;m going to Rome, the computer on the counter breaks down. This gives me the opportunity to do a little luggage re-allocation and avoid an excess baggage charge. I congratulate myself all the way to the gate. The shoulder, dislocated by the weight of my carry-on bag, is a small price to pay. But then I panic at Prague. There&apos;s no check-in desk for my onward flight. I run around in circles and, 10 minutes before my flight leaves, I find someone to issue a boarding pass. Things are a little slower in Rome. So slow that after an hour my luggage hasn&apos;t appeared. I go to baggage enquiries, where there are only two people in the queue. An hour later, there are still two people in the queue. At last it&apos;s my turn. My luggage is still in Prague. D&apos;oh! At least it&apos;s full of clean clothes. I&apos;m ripped off by the taxi driver going in to Rome, but, to compensate, she drives like a maniac and I am only half an hour late for my interview. The TV camera attracts more interest than my fiddle playing. I&apos;m not proud, though, and cash in. A short stint under a flyover adjacent to the new concert hall earns enough for some pizza and an ice cream. I spend the rest of the evening walking through throngs of tourists, half looking for a spot to play but, really, just being amazed by the city. Very early flight back to London. Can&apos;t wait to see Jane and the kids. On Saturday I have a concert in Portsmouth, where I do some very worthwhile busking on the side. The rest of the week is taken up sorting out the next stage; a visit to Kampala to see the school where Musequality&apos;s pilot project will be starting, and concerts in Cape Town. 50% of my luggage arrives four days later and Toshiba generously replace the phone. I bank my earnings; around \u00a31,000. So far I&apos;ve raised around \u00a34,000 for the journey. It&apos;s pretty tight, but I have just enough to do the next few legs.

So why pretend portraiture was their greatest achievement? The most minor Dutch still-life is more metaphysical than most of the complacent faces here. There is only one explanation: the National Gallery no longer believes in the intelligence of its public and feels it has to patronise us with nice, easy portraits. Of course, there are two excuses - this is the culture that produced Rembrandt and the vivacious Frans Hals. A way to while away time in this show is to wonder why Hals is no longer one of the world&apos;s most popular artists, as he was a century ago. Yet the dated word I&apos;ve used to praise him, &quot;vivacious&quot;, says it all. He is a bit florid and jolly and Victorian. In the most impressive room, Hals&apos; Meagre Company (finished by another artist) is given pride of place. Come on - anyone who has visited Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum has seen it eclipsed by Rembrandt&apos;s Night Watch.

It is claimed that the man, from Italy, and woman, from Portugal, were planning to con Gerry and Kate McCann out of some or all of the \u00a32.5m reward that has been offered for Madeleine&apos;s return. They were alleged to be pretending to know where Madeleine was being held. The development is the latest false lead to raise hopes that Madeleine could be found, yet Mr and Mrs McCann still tried to be positive about it. In his blog Mr McCann said: &quot;This appears to be a clear signal from European police forces that they are treating all information relating to Madeleine&apos;s disappearance very seriously.&quot; Police made the arrests in the resort of Sotogrande, near Gibraltar, on Thursday. The couple were named in Italy as Danilo Chemello, 61, from Sandrigo near Venice, who was said to have made a fortune from a gravel business, and Aurora Pereira Vaz, from Portugal. The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that they had met when Ms Vaz was married to a Roman businessman. She left him and the pair then travelled around Europe, living lavishly. In 1996 they were tried on charges of plotting to murder Ms Vaz&apos;s by then ex-husband but were convicted of lesser charges and escaped jail. In 2003, Mr Chemello began an 18-month jail sentence in France for maltreatment and neglect of the daughter he had had with Ms Vaz; the child was five years old. He was arrested on Thursday on an international warrant issued from France, where he was wanted in connection with an association it is claimed that he had with a criminal group. Portuguese police were involved in the arrests, which at first suggested that this was a genuine breakthrough. By yesterday, however, it seemed that it was another false lead. Madeleine was four days away from her fourth birthday when she vanished from the bedroom of her parents&apos; holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on the Algarve. Her parents were eating dinner at the time in a nearby restaurant. She was apparently taken from the room while her two-year-old twin siblings slept beside her. Despite a huge search nearby during the days after the disappearance and an energetic publicity operation, with posters of Madeleine distributed throughout Europe and north Africa, there have been no confirmed sightings of her since she disappeared. Mr and Mrs McCann toured European and north African cities to try to widen the appeal for information; they visited Rome, Lisbon, Madrid, Berlin, Amsterdam and Rabat. But the breakthrough for which the family longs has not happened. Initially the search was concentrated on the country where she vanished, and within a few days police revealed that they had investigated 350 separate suspicious incidents. Reports of sightings included local expatriates spotting a young girl who was walking along a road in a nearby town with two people. A balding man was seen dragging a girl towards a marina in the nearby town of Lagos. Another man was seen driving away at speed from a central Portuguese village. However all these appeared to be false alarms. Attention then focused on a British expatriate, Robert Murat. Police questioned him and searched the villa where he lives with his mother; it is only 160 metres from the place where Madeleine was snatched. Mr Murat remains the only named suspect, but has not been charged with any offences. He has denied any involvement with the child&apos;s disappearance. So has a Russian computer expert, Sergey Malinka, who lives in the same area and has worked with Mr Murat. Meanwhile, in the UK, a man accused of stealing cash from a collection box for the Madeleine fund failed to show up for a scheduled court appearance.

Beyond the booth is something called The Galley, where Yotel staff in grey Chinese jackets dispense meals (which automatically goon to my credit card; Yotel is cashless) or order from the room. The softly lit corridor is like a cocoon, with windows on either side through which I can see rows of unoccupied premium cabins. If you fly easyJet then it&apos;s nothing like a plane, but if you&apos;re accustomed on long haul to turning left once on board instead of right, then it really is like the real thing.

Sometimes their communications even assume a biblical tone: &apos;Should we not change our ways, we&apos;ll see forests burn, soils decay, oceans rise and millions of people die.&apos; Their methods, including a huge protest camp and co-ordinated civil disobedience, echo those of past campaigns against the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons, and oppressive regimes abroad. But this time, the mission is not to stop wars, bombs or torture, it&apos;s to stop people going on holiday. Thousands of activists are expected to descend on Heathrow for the Camp for Climate Action from 14 to 21 August. There will be workshops on issues from carbon offsetting and biofuels to campaign strategy and skills for direct action, and the week will climax with a day when demonstrators will try to disrupt the airport as much as possible. Never before has flying been so controversial. In the space of two years, the environmental damage done by planes has gone from being something quietly discussed by scientists and committed environmentalists, to a headline-grabbing issue no one can ignore. Politicians are pilloried in newspapers for flying to meetings abroad. Travellers checking in for domestic flights are confronted by Greenpeace campaigners urging them to take the train instead. Travel agents&apos; shops are daubed in protesters&apos; paint and travel magazines get hate-mail. Even those who fly once or twice a year on holiday can&apos;t help but feel a growing sense of guilt, while those opting for trips by car, train or ferry have a self-righteous spring in their steps.  Now, however, the backlash is beginning. The tourism and aviation industries are mobilising, setting up lobbying groups, and pointing out some awkward facts. Did you know, for example, that some ferries emit far more carbon dioxide than some planes? That driving can release twice as much carbon as flying? A new report from Balpa, the pilot&apos;s union, even claims that planes can be better than taking the train. And at last month&apos;s Paris Airshow, Airbus bosses unveiled their own, very different, solution to climate change - promising to &apos;save the planet, one A380 at a time&apos;. That&apos;s A380, as in the vast double-decker airliner about to enter service. So who do you believe? One thing on which all sides agree is that aviation is booming. Today there are around 17,700 commercial aircraft in the world. Over the next 20 years, manufacturers expect to deliver 25,600 new planes, with massive growth coming from China, India and Russia as economies develop and flying is deregulated. &apos;Aviation is here to stay and will grow faster than people expect,&apos; said Praful Patel, India&apos;s civil aviation minister. &apos;Remember, India is a country of 1.1 billion people and fewer than 10 million fly even once a year.&apos; It&apos;s an unpalatable argument, but even if everyone in Britain were to stop flying tomorrow, in less than two years the total number of passengers worldwide would still be rising. This year there will be 2.2 billion air passengers worldwide and the total is currently growing by 4% a year, according to International Air Transport Association forecasts.  Airbus predicts the UK will buy 1,282 new airliners over the next 20 years, while America, China and India will buy 10,492. While UK passenger numbers are expected to grow over the next four years by 4 per cent per year on international flights, 3 per cent on domestic flights, India and China are predicted to grow by 8 per cent on international flights and 23 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, on domestic flights.  Perhaps we can lead by example and so influence the world to cut back on flights too. Britons took 234m flights last year. Discounting the 20% in the population who never fly at all, this works out around five per person. To hit the government&apos;s target of a 60 per cent drop in carbon emissions by 2050, we simply need to slowly wean ourselves down to two annual flights - one return trip. Maybe, if planes get more efficient, we could still afford two.  And yet we still seem to be a long way from the kind of mass change in behaviour that would make this work. Recent surveys have suggested that 3 per cent of Britons have already stopped flying and a further 10 per cent have cut back, but people seem slower to practice what they preach - Ryanair say they have yet to notice any effect and have certainly yet to cancel a single flight as a result of such concerns. (It could be lying, but then why would it have 30 new planes on order?) Even if an individual route from the UK were to become unviable due to boycots by green travellers, the airlines, loathe to give up a landing slot, would simply switch to a new destination - likely to be one further afield in a developing economy where demand is growing fastest.  Moreover, with China building two new power stations per week, mostly coal-fired, it&apos;s easy to wonder if it&apos;s worth agonising about whether you should go for that long weekend in Tuscany. According to last year&apos;s government-commissioned report by economist Sir Nicholas Stern, power stations account for 24 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, shipping, train and road transport account for 12.3%, while flying accounts for just 1.7 per cent. Compare this with deforestation, which accounts for 18 per cent (half of which is attributed to the destruction of rainforests in two countries: Indonesia and Brazil).  That&apos;s not to say we&apos;re damned anyway, so let&apos;s get on the plane and keep partying till the world goes up in flames, but it does put the issue into balance - should we devote nine times more effort to fighting deforestation than flying? And being aware of the balance should steer us away from extreme positions - refusing to fly at all or ignoring the issue completely - towards taking practical, realistic steps to a solution.  A return flight to Barcelona, for example, emits around 260kg of carbon dioxide per passenger. By insulating your loft you can easily make up for this - it will save, on average, 1,500kg of CO\u00b2 per year. Replace 10 ordinary bulbs with energy saving ones, and you&apos;ll save 380kg. Chuck out your plasma TV and you&apos;ll save 404kg. Even turning off appliances instead of leaving them on standby will save 173kg - easily enough to allow a return flight to Paris or Amsterdam with a clear conscience. &apos;Dark green&apos; environmentalists argue there is a bankrupt logic in this kind of carbon offsetting - you are doing the equivalent of donating to the RSPCA so you can keep kicking your dog, as the saying goes. You could, after all, take all those carbon-saving steps, and still cancel your holiday in Barcelona.  Except that assumes tourism is a frivolous, self-indulgent activity which is as pointless as leaving your TV on standby. Even putting aside the benefits to the tourists themselves, this is clearly not the case. Tourism employs around 231 million people, and generates 8-10 per cent of world GDP.  While the campaigners plot their camp at Heathrow, in Kenya plans are being drawn up for a very different camp. Looking out from an escarpment over the deserts of Samburuland is a stunning hotel, the Ol Malo Eco-Lodge. Revenue from the small number of visiting tourists has allowed the 5,000 acres around it to be transformed from over-grazed cattle ranch to a pristine conservation site, but that is just the start. The tourist-funded lodge provides the infrastructure and backup for a range of vital community work. Around 100 women are employed in the workshop making traditional beadwork for export, and the children come along to paint for fun. More impressive still is the Ol Malo eye project. Up to 80 per cent of adults in the area suffer sight loss, caused by the infectious and preventable disease Trachoma, so the Ol Malo Trust runs regular surgical camps, bringing doctors from the UK to treat them. In January, the camp gave 102 people back their sight, and final plans are now being made for another camp this autumn. &apos;It&apos;s very simple - all of our visitors fly here,&apos; said Julia Francombe, the founder. &apos;If they stopped coming, it would kill us.&apos;  &apos;Our message to all air passengers is to stop feeling guilty about flying,&apos; said Captain Mervyn Granshaw, chairman of the British Airline Pilots Association, unveiling a major study conducted by the union last month. &apos;We are now going to debunk the myths about air travel and spell out the facts.&apos; Fine words but, given the level of self-interest and degree of enmity between those involved, getting the facts is a nightmarish task.  Launching the 82-page report, Granshaw pulled out one key point: &apos;Passengers going by high speed train to the south of France would be responsible for emitting more carbon dioxide than if they had flown there.&apos; I rang the union to check the figures and was directed to a section of the report quoting Roger Kemp, professor of engineering at Lancaster University. I then rang him. &apos;No, actually that&apos;s completely untrue,&apos; he said. &apos;France generates about 80 per cent of its electricity using nuclear power, so if you wanted to go to the south of France, by far the best way to go is by TGV.&apos; But Kemp does go on to say that plane travel is not always automatically the worst choice environmentally. &apos;The worst way to get to the south of France is to take a car ferry then motorail, where you can end up with a diesel engine hauling a huge train with cars on wagons.&apos; A full plane, can sometimes compete with a car too. Paul Upham, a research fellow at the Tyndall Centre, calculated that travelling from Manchester to Guernsey on a full Saab 200 turbo-prop plane produced 103kg of carbon dioxide per person, compared with 226kg for a Nissan Micra carrying one person the same difference. He was quoted as concluding: &apos;Planes aren&apos;t the evil things relative to cars that people imagine.&apos;  Ferries too, can&apos;t claim automatic green superiority. &apos;I have to admit that I rather enjoy ferry travel,&apos; says Kemp. &apos;But if you start to do the analysis of that, it starts to look rather unattractive too, because of the power used to move not only the people, but the cabin, space for their car, the bars, nightclubs, and so on. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s much in it between taking the plane and taking the ferry.&apos; The reality is that analysing how various modes of transport compare is fiendishly complex. Some trains are far worse than others (increasing the top speed of trains from 125mph to 220mph can consume four times as much energy, while diesels can emit more than twice the carbon dioxide of electric trains). Some high-speed ferries, such as Stena Line&apos;s HSS craft, use double the fuel of conventional ships, making them several times worse than modern planes for carbon emissions. Ultimately, experts admit that given the right circumstances, any method of transport can be made to come out on top.  On average, though, a car carrying several occupants is usually better than a plane, and trains are almost always the best of all. The UK government&apos;s calculations suggest a long-haul plane emits 110g of carbon dioxide per passenger kilometre, a medium-sized car with two occupants the same, while the train emits 60g. However, as the pollution from planes is emitted high in the atmosphere, its effects are far worse, and vapour trails (or &apos;contrails&apos;) lead to the formation of cirrus clouds, which stop heat escaping from the earth. Most scientists agree that this &apos;radiative forcing&apos; effect is real - and point to the significant cooling in America after all planes were grounded on 9/11 - but few agree on the scale of its effects. Current estimates are that before comparing a plane&apos;s emissions to those of a car or train, you would first have to double or triple them. &apos;The big problem is that there is no consensus on this and people seem to be becoming split along ideological lines with NGOs accepting the multiplier and industry not,&apos; said Upham. His Manchester-Guernsey calculation has made him the unwitting poster boy for the pro-aviation lobby, but his actual views are very different: &apos;Taking into account the contrails, flying is usually about nine times worse than taking the train, and three times worse than a car with two passengers.&apos; Given the world&apos;s apparently insatiable appetite for flying, and accepting it is seriously damaging for the environment, it becomes crucial to develop new and less polluting aircraft. Already, there is some progress: the new Boeing 747-800, which will enter service in 2009, is 16 per cent more fuel efficient than its predecessor, while the 787 &apos;Dreamliner&apos;, which enters service next May, uses light carbon composites to cut fuel use by 20 per cent compared with the 767, and 70 percent compared to the 727 launched in 1963. Airbus&apos;s claim that it can save the world with the A380 may be far-fetched, but its &apos;gentle giant&apos; plane is far more efficient and quieter than those of 20 years ago, while next year, Virgin is even planning to test fly a 747 on biofuel. Moves to reform the air-traffic control system so planes are not stuck in circling patterns are also vital. In Europe, this would cut carbon emissions by 12 per cent. Some environmentalists, however, scorn these advances, saying such measures are a &apos;delusion&apos;, &apos;like holding out for cigarettes that don&apos;t cause cancer&apos;. &apos;The aviation industry is prone to vastly overstating the gains that can be made from technological improvements but sadly a climate friendly plane isn&apos;t on the horizon,&apos; says Emily Armistead of Greenpeace. &apos;The only way to deal with aviation&apos;s impact is to limit its expansion.&apos;  So should we stop flying? If no one set foot on a plane again, it would undoubtedly help to stop climate change - though at the expense of killing off the tourism-based economies of many of the world&apos;s poorest countries. But in the real world, with the US and the developing world demanding thousands of new planes, surely we have to take a more sophisticated approach: to choose airlines with greener, newer fleets, and thus encourage plane makers to prioritise environmental performance; to travel to destinations that help local communities rather than destroy them; to take the train where possible; to reduce carbon emissions at home; and, above all, lobby politicians to tackle deforestation and to switch to green forms of energy.  Do all this, and we can start to cancel flights in the knowledge that it really will make a difference. How green are your holidays? Anita RoddickActivist and founder of the Body Shop  How many flights have you taken in the past year? 60. Have you modified your travel habits as a result of concerns about climate change? I decided not to do a talk in Beijing this month, for a retail conference; other than that, no. In Europe, for business, I travel by train because it is so much more pleasant. Where are you going on holiday this year? Canada. We travel with the Wilderness League [an environmental organisation] and raft through and camp alongside some of the most remote rivers in Canada and Alaska. Do you feel guilty about travelling overseas? Half of my family live in California. I never feel guilty visiting them, neither do I feel guilty when I am visiting prisoners in American jails or collecting data on child slavery and women working in Bangladeshi sweatshops. When there is a purpose to my travel, then I don&apos;t feel guilty.  Do you think cutting back on flying is a sensible response to climate change? I think we should be environmentally taxed, so at least we get some measure of the real environmental cost of flights. Mark EllinghamPublisher, Rough Guides  Do you use a carbon offsetting scheme? I believe in multiple offsetting. I&apos;ve recently sponsored 50 acres of Amazon rainforest through Cool Earth (www.coolearth.org). Rainforest is hugely important: each acre you buy locks in around 260 tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 100 return flights to New York.  Have you modified your travel habits as a result of concerns about climate change? Yes. I fly a lot less than I would like to, and have pretty much cut out weekend and short breaks by air. I think the main concern is to make sure your holiday money goes into the local economy. This is at the heart of all Rough Guides recommendations.  Where are you going for your holidays this year? My last trip was to the Mull of Kintyre (by train) and I will be spending part of the summer by the sea in Pembrokeshire (by car). We&apos;re also going to Sri Lanka (2.5 tonnes CO2) to see my wife&apos;s family. Do you feel guilty about travelling overseas? Not guilty. But conscious. And let&apos;s not confuse &apos;travel&apos; with &apos;flights&apos;. Travel doesn&apos;t have to involve flying. Is cutting back on flying a sensible response to the issue of climate change? I think travel is an overall global benefit and I&apos;d hate to see tourism&apos;s financial support cut off to the developing world, or even countries like Greece or Spain. But we in the West, and in Britain in particular, need to fly less. The growth in aviation is not sustainable if we are to curb carbon emissions. And I don&apos;t believe we have a God-given right to cheap flights that overrides our responsibility to care for the planet. Colonel John Blashford-SnellExplorer and Chairman of the Scientific Exploration Society How many flights have you taken in the past year? Five return flights.  Do you use a carbon offsetting scheme? No. Have you modified your travel habits as a result of concerns about climate change? I travel by sea whenever possible. I find it much more restful. And I sleep in tents and use solar power. Where are you going on holiday this year? Jersey. Do you feel guilty about travelling overseas? No. My expeditions overseas are part of an SES (Scientific Exploration Society) programme designed to help people, fauna and flora. Do you think people cutting back on flying is a sensible response to the issue of climate change? Yes, but more fast sailing ships and partially solar-powered vessels are needed to replace aeroplanes. We should be encouraging young people to take up sailing. \u00b7 This article was amended on Monday July 2 2007.

Three other members of Cpl Apiata&apos;s squad, from the Special Air Services commando unit, were awarded medals for actions in the battle, in Afghanistan in 2004. Cpl Apiata was a member of the SAS squad that won a presidential citation from George Bush in 2004 for their actions in Afghanistan. The soldier said he was &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the honour. &quot;At the time I was just doing what I&apos;ve been trained for, doing my job,&quot; Cpl Apiata said, adding he had only been &quot;looking out for my mates&quot;. &quot;I see myself as Willy Apiata.

Cpl Apiata, born in the North Island town of Mangakino in 1972, joined the army reservists in 1989 and the regular army in 1999, before gaining selection for the SAS. His medal is the first Victoria Cross awarded to a serving member of the Special Air Service anywhere in the Commonwealth, Ms Clark said. Cpl Apiata is one of only 13 living recipients of the Victoria Cross and the only New Zealander. The last New Zealander awarded a Victoria Cross was Squadron Leader Leonard Henry Trent in 1946.

I watched him in Holland&apos;s 2-1 win over Portugal in the European Under-21 Championship last month and I found him a bit of an enigma. He is a big, strong, forceful player in the mould of a young Kevin Campbell - yet he just loves to come short for the ball. He almost moved into a midfield role rather than what you might expect, which would be playing high up, against his defender. However, in Maceo Rigters (who ended up with the tournament&apos;s Golden Boot) he had a willing strike partner who could stretch defences over the top with his pace, meaning opponents were reluctant to come forward and play a high line. That allowed Babel to exploit the space between midfield and the opposition defence. Babel has a very good awareness of what is around him when he does receive the ball, which is important because you need almost peripheral vision in this area of the pitch. Against Portugal this, allied with a good first touch and strength on the ball even when closed down, meant he was able to hold off his opponent. There was a nice balance to his game with regard to when to run at people and when to release a team-mate. His success at this led to Holland&apos;s first goal: Babel received the ball and immediately got his head up to play Rigters in with a perfectly weighted pass between the centre-back and full-back. Rigters was brought down and Babel showed he is not short on confidence by stepping up and scoring the penalty. Babel not only combined well with his fellow centre-forward but also picked the ball up wide and deep, playing either winger in with passes good enough to take their full-back out of play. Although this is his preferred way of playing, when he did push forward to a more advanced position he proved a willing runner, particularly into channels, and pulled away for the diagonal ball extremely well. One or two parts of his game made me realise why he likes to play the way he does: his hold-up play and battling qualities in the air fell a little short of what I imagined for someone of his build and strength. Scouted by Ajax at the age of 11, he has obviously benefited by his time at the club since then. He became Holland&apos;s youngest scorer for 68 years with a goal on his full international debut, against Romania in 2005, and scored twice on the way to the last eight of the Under-20 World Cup the same year. This is a player born to play in the modern game, with all the physical attributes needed at the highest level. But the difference from players of a similar physical development at such a young age is that mentally he will not be found wanting, which can happen all too often. Babel would be no direct replacement for Henry; if he were to join Arsenal, this season or next, I could see him in a Dennis Bergkamp-type role, dropping off a bit. He has a similar stature to Bergkamp. He needs to play alongside someone with pace, who will frighten the opposition defence so that they do not step up; this will create a hole for him to play in.

The line-up: Rex Garfield (vocals), Ste Rasch (guitar), Kristian Kristensen (vocals), Michael Brandt (drums), Moogie Johnson (various instruments). The background: You wait all year for a band from Denmark and then two come at once. Compared to yesterday&apos;s comic-book synthpop saga, however, the story of Green Pitch, who mix fragile Bj\u00f6rk-y vocals, twinkling music-box keyboards, melodica, dreamy steel guitars and cryptic yet searingly emotional lyrics, is tragedy, albeit one with an uplifting ending. The abridged version goes like this: the Paris-born, 27-year-old Rex Garfield, who learned to write songs on her late preacher father&apos;s Spanish guitar, met guitarist Ste Rasch at High School in 1998, when they formed a band called the River Phoenix and started making beautiful music together - although there was no funny business yet. They moved in together as friends after graduating and, in the summer of 2000, they went to Amsterdam where they met some Norwegians who lived in a top-floor apartment. They went up for drinks, and then up the ladder to the roof to enjoy an aerial view of the sleazoid micro-metropolis. Suddenly, on her way down, Rex slipped and fell, landing on the stone staircase. The accident damaged her spinal chord, paralyzing her permanently from the waist down. Astonishingly, through the pain and morphine haze, she determined to pursue a career in music. After an operation in Denmark, she was placed in a rehab centre for 10 months where she started composing songs on a piano and that guitar of her dad&apos;s. When she was discharged in spring 2001, Ste and Rex went to New York, where they got jiggy with it for the first time, even though the title of Will Smith&apos;s sub-rap hit was, even then, considered old hat. They&apos;ve been together ever since. Back in Copenhagen, they built a home studio and released an album called The Outlet Pass which earned them airplay on a local indie radio show. By 2002, they were playing live and Rex was feeling the rush of blood to the head that results from performing music of preternatural charm and beauty to awestruck crowds reduced to tears by the sound of her poignant, autobiographical songs and the sight of her boyfriend carrying her, at the end of shows, offstage. The buzz: &quot;The vocals are fragile and the melodies gossamer-gentle, but their softness gives them strength.&quot; The truth: Rex offers a straighter, more Suzanne Vega-ish version of Bj\u00f6rk, and her album is a thing of consistently pretty wonder. Most likely to: Make you wish Bj\u00f6rk had collaborated with Bacharach not Timbaland. Least likely to: Make you cry with pity - the songs are moving even without the tragic backstory. File next to: Bj\u00f6rk, Stina Nordenstam, Suzanne Vega, St Vincent. What to buy: Ace Of Hearts was released yesterday on Ryko.

In the early 1970s, new air-cargo connections linked a global supply of fish, molluscs, and crustaceans with a ravenous Japanese demand for it. The country&apos;s new wealth ensured that for any sea product for which there exists an appetite in Tokyo - and the Japanese are famously free-spirited in their attitude towards eating things as varied as toxic blowfish, whale bacon and barnacles - a Japanese buyer will pay a premium over all foreign competitors. And so the catch of the day inevitably ended up in Tokyo, and the rest of the world settled for leftovers. Last week, a front-page New York Times story addressed a growing sense of national crisis in Japan over declining availability of wild bluefin tuna, the trophy fish of the sushi bar and perhaps the country&apos;s most prized culinary delicacy. Faced with dwindling supply and rising prices, picky chefs have become forced to deal with lesser-quality big-eye or yellowfin tuna or the stigmatized ranched bluefin. The more farsighted among them, the New York Times reported, were already pondering the scenario of a post-tuna menu, and experimenting with red-meat substitutes including venison, horse, and whale. In reality, this was an obituary for the Japanese seafood premium, and the birth notice for what will shortly be recognized as China&apos;s seafood premium. The perennial Japanese fear about being usurped by their historical rivals to the west has taken a new angle: the Chinese will, quite literally, eat their lunch. The Chinese have not traditionally preferred their fish raw, but sushi bars catering to new luxury tastes have begun popping up in the country&apos;s commercial cities - ultimately pitting the two countries against each other in bidding wars on docks worldwide. &quot;The Chinese are going to pay more than what the Japanese can pay very soon. That means exporters will be looking into the China market, not Japan,&quot; Tom Asakawa, a fisheries-trade official at the US embassy in Tokyo, told me in late 2005. &quot;Five years from now, Japanese consumers will not be able to eat good-quality sashimi. You&apos;ll have to go to China to do that.&quot; It didn&apos;t take five years. Buyers at the early-morning tuna auctions at the Tsukiji market in downtown Tokyo - where each day millions of dollars in fish are swapped in just a few minutes with coded hand signals - are already packing up their purchases and putting them on planes to Shanghai hours later. (In many cases, those fish arrived by plane - from the Atlantic, Mediterranean, or South Pacific - the night before.) But some version of this transaction, diverting the daily catch from Japanese mouths, has been taking place for almost a decade: Atlantic bluefin caught off the New England coast being eaten in Boston or Mediterranean farmed tuna ending up in London. When the Japan&apos;s economic bubble burst in the early 1990s, the corporate expense accounts indirectly subsidizing top sushi bars contracted, at the same time as American and European diners started paying more for their meals. Much as environmentalists like to blame the Japanese government for the overfishing of worldwide bluefin stocks - a sense of sovereign entitlement for tuna led to an ecological recklessness - the country&apos;s consumers bear responsibility, too, for their declining access to top fish. High-quality fresh seafood was one of the few good import businesses into Japan. Diners there could savor either the delicate textures of raw fish or their country&apos;s quick shift from the periphery of the global economy to its center, noted monthly with a growing current account surplus built on a roaring export business in cars and electronics. The trade gap, it turned out, was not a one-way exchange of goods, but a quiet two-way flow of taste and ideas. There&apos;s a reason sushi bars surfaced in Los Angeles in the 1960s, in Amsterdam in the 1970s, in Hong Kong in the 1980s, in Moscow in the 1990s, and in Shanghai today. Demand for sushi has followed integration into the global economy, and in the postwar period those patterns of trade and foreign investment have had a particularly Japanese flavour. Sushi bars followed the Japanese corporate money, and local appetites followed Japanese tastes. Now China&apos;s growing trade surplus means that the world&apos;s dockside premium will likely be set by chefs in Shanghai. If Japanese diners want to avoid a permanent lunch of horse sushi, their best hope might be in a rising China - and that the twenty-first century&apos;s global tastemakers use their new mercantile reach to drive up prices for sea cucumber and pass on the raw tuna.", "sentences": ["There&apos;s a reason sushi bars surfaced in Los Angeles in the 1960s, in Amsterdam in the 1970s, in Hong Kong in the 1980s, in Moscow in the 1990s, and in Shanghai today."], "title": "Sushi in crisis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/03/crisisinsushi", "tags": ["Japan", "China", "Business", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-04T08:18:46Z", "article": "&quot;My late Dad used to tell a tale of a footballer he met on the train once, possibly the 1950s, who played possibly for Chelsea, or against them (I know, I&apos;m sorry), but in a match he scored nine times for his side and still lost 10-9! Is this true?&quot; asks Joe Castle. &quot;Are there any other examples of individual glory thwarted by the deficiencies of team-mates in such a dramatic way?&quot; Well, Joe, we couldn&apos;t find any evidence of the aforementioned match, nor any performance to match the suggested nine-goal haul. However, there are still plenty of examples of players&apos; heroic efforts going unrewarded thanks to their shambling accomplices. Take Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, for example. In 1997 Milinko Pantic scored four times in a Spanish Cup match with Barcelona, three of them before half-time, only for Bar\u00e7a to come back and win 5-4. &quot;I saw a post-match interview with the poor fella and he couldn&apos;t believe it,&quot; recalls Neil McMahon. &quot;He&apos;d never scored more than three goals in a game before.&quot; However, one year later the same fate befell Christian Vieri, who snagged four of his own in the 5-4 La Liga loss to Salamanca. &quot;I read that afterwards Vieri refused to get changed with his team-mates, got changed in the corridor and went straight home,&quot; notes James Syme. Unsurprisingly, Vieri left for Italy at the end of the season. Equally denied by his colleagues&apos; ineptitude was Dariusz Dziekanowski, who scored four times in a Uefa Cup clash with Partizan Belgrade, only for the Celtic backline to concede four at the other end. Leading 5-3 in the last minute, Partizan launched one final attack, making the score 5-4 and claiming the tie on away goals. Goal machine Kerry Dixon also scored four for Reading in a 1982-83 Third Division game at Doncaster, not that it counted for much: the Royals went down 7-5. But surely the hardest-done-by player must be poor old Denis Law. Playing for Manchester City in an FA Cup fourth-round tie at Luton in 1961, Law scored six times as City raced into a 6-2 lead, only for the match to be abandoned. The Kenilworth Road pitch &quot;first resembled a beach with the tide just out, then [there was] deep mud, then a shallow lake,&quot; according to one report of the game. &quot;It&apos;s not every day that you score six goals,&quot; recalled Law earlier this year. &quot;I never did it again - the most I managed in a game that counted was four, which I got a couple of times. But then the heavens opened. Obviously it wasn&apos;t meant to be. The funny thing was when we went for the replay on the Wednesday the pitch was in a worse state than it ever was on Saturday.&quot; As the law of Sod dictates, Law still scored in the second match, only for City to slump to a 3-1 defeat. Can you top that? Then let us know at the usual address. THE TRAGIC CASE OF SERHIY SCHERBAKOV &quot;Trawling the U-21 World Championships archives, I saw that in 1991 Serhiy Scherbakov won the Golden Shoe,&quot; writes Andrew Gordon. &quot;I searched for him on Wikipedia and it seems he moved to Sporting Lisbon from Shakhtar Donetsk in 1993 but then suddenly retired in 1995. Since as far as I can tell he is still alive, what happened?&quot; Unfortunately, Andrew, it&apos;s a sad story. Scherbakov had been brought to Sporting by Bobby Robson in 1993, but the manager was sent packing by the club following their Uefa Cup exit against Casino Salzburg, despite leading the league at the time. Pedro Est\u00eav\u00e3o takes up the tale: &quot;The manager was highly regarded by the players and the fans, so the players decided to stage a dinner in honour of the departing manager. On his way home, however, Serhiy suffered a horrible car crash that left him paralysed from the waist down. I still get a lump in the throat when I remember the television footage of him frantically pursuing his rehabilitation and vowing that he would don the Sporting jersey on the pitch once again someday.&quot; The accident fractured Scherbakov&apos;s skull and his spinal column in three places, although The Resident newspaper reported that he had been &quot;over the legal alcohol limit&quot; at the time. Scherbakov, according to Alexei Berezovoi, &quot;has undergone a series of operations and is still working on his health. He is working with several football-related charities, such as the Federation of Football that unites football lovers that have cerebral paralysis. He lives in Moscow.&quot; SHIRT SHRIFT &quot;I was at the Amsterdam ArenA to see Ajax batter Sparta Rotterdam 5-2,&quot; says Federico Tessadori. &quot;It occured to me then that Ajax are is the only team I know with their sponsor (ABN Amro) written vertically on their shirt, and not even in the middle! Do any other teams have such extravagant sponsor placing?&quot; &quot;Ireland&apos;s newest senior club, Wexford Youths (the name is a nod to Juventus) have a similarly jauntily positioned sponsorship,&quot; explains Sean DeLoughry. &quot;The club is owned, sponsored and indeed managed by building magnate and football enthusiast Mick Wallace.

KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;I recall one episode of Jim&apos;ll Fix It, where a young lad asked Jim to fix it for him to become a football referee,&quot; wrote David Voss back in 2004. &quot;I can&apos;t remember the sides involved, I suspect they were two Sunday league sides. The plucky young fellow had some link with one of the sides, which showed in his refereeing as he sent all of the other side off.&quot; We weren&apos;t sure that Oxford United and Arsenal would thank David for referring to them as Sunday league sides, but the game in question took place some time during the 1984-85 season. If memory serves correctly, the young lad was an Arsenal fan, who had been enraged by his side&apos;s 3-2 defeat at the old Manor Ground in the Milk Cup when Oxford were still a Second Division side. Oxford were on a bit of a high at the time and their side in those days contained the likes of John Aldridge and the Northern Ireland striker Billy Hamilton. Both were on the scoresheet in that win over Arsenal, who included eight then-current or future internationals. But the young lad retaliated by sending off virtually the entire Oxford team for a series of petty infringements. &quot;I remember four players forming a wall being sent off for not being 10 yards away from the free-kick,&quot; he recalled, &quot;which, naturally, had been awarded for a red-card offence.&quot; Click here for thousands more Knowledge questions and answers.

In the wake of the abortive atrocities in London and Glasgow, there has been no shortage of lurid media coverage of the &quot;doctors&apos; plot&quot; that came so close to carnage, nor of bombastic calls for the nation to stand firm against terrorists. The Sun was yesterday handing out free union jacks to &quot;fly in the face of terror&quot;, while its heavyweight counterparts have been demanding ever greater efforts by an increasingly intimidated Muslim community to demonstrate its loyalty. Mercifully, the tone adopted by Gordon Brown has been less strident than his predecessor&apos;s - he has avoided the rhetoric of the war on terror and the shopping lists of new coercive powers favoured by Tony Blair in the aftermath of the July 2005 attacks and last year&apos;s alleged transatlantic airline plot. But when it comes to the substance, there has been little change. The failed bombings were, Brown insisted, an attack on &quot;our British way of life&quot; and the &quot;values that we represent&quot;, &quot;unrelated&quot; to the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan or any other conflict. He compared the fight against the bombers&apos; ideology with the struggle against communism and called for a similar &quot;propaganda effort&quot; to win &quot;hearts and minds&quot;. In the days since, this &quot;it&apos;s nothing to do with the war&quot; refrain has since been taken up with gusto by large parts of the media. The pro-war Times and Telegraph have led the field, with neoconservative commentators and politicians hammering home the Blair-Bush message that terror is simply the product of an evil ideology. Anyone who dissents or suggests a connection with Britain&apos;s violent role in the Muslim world is portrayed as somehow soft on terrorism - as the Liberal Democrats&apos; Nick Clegg found when he tentatively referred to Muslim grievances in the House of Commons earlier this week. In an echo of Gordon Brown&apos;s cold war propaganda theme, defectors from radical Islamist groups have been playing a prominent role in this campaign. Rarely a TV debate goes by without Ed Husain, one-time member of Hizb ut-Tahrir and now a British neocon pinup boy, or Hassan Butt, formerly of the banned al-Muhajiroun group, insisting that this is all about people with identity crises who are &quot;hell-bent on destroying the west&quot;, denouncing Ken Livingstone for engaging in dialogue with Islamists, or calling for a harsher crackdown on their former fellow enthusiasts for the restoration of the caliphate. They are championed by politicians like the Tory Michael Gove and New Labour&apos;s Denis MacShane, who this week argued that all Islamists, from the liberal Muslim academic Tariq Ramadan to al-Qaida terrorists, had to be confronted without exception. It&apos;s become eerily reminiscent of the McCarthyite era when communist renegades would be wheeled out to give Americans a state-orchestrated glimpse of the enemy&apos;s dark heart. Of course, it&apos;s perfectly true that al-Qaida and its &quot;takfiri&quot; fellow travellers have an extreme, violently sectarian and socially conservative ideology. But it is simply delusional - and flies in the face of logic and history - to fail to recognise the central link between the terror threat and Britain&apos;s post-9/11 actions in the Muslim world. First, there were no al-Qaida-inspired attacks in Britain before the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. There were against the US - starting with the World Trade Centre in 1993 - triggered by the aftermath of the Gulf war, as well as jihadist campaigns in Kashmir, Chechnya and Bosnia. But Britain was not a target until it attacked the Muslim world. If the bombers&apos; real focus was, say, sexually liberal western lifestyles, they would presumably be attacking cities like Amsterdam and Stockholm. Second, it is only necessary to listen to what the bombers say themselves. Just as Bin Laden has repeatedly spelled out that his campaign is about western occupation of Muslim lands and support for pro-western autocracies, so the &quot;martyrdom videos&quot; made by the London bombers of 2005 made clear that they regarded their attacks as revenge for British support for Israel and the occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq: &quot;Until you stop the bombing, gassing, imprisonment and torture of my people we will not stop this fight,&quot; Mohammed Sidique Khan declared. The government was repeatedly warned before the Iraq war that it would bring terror to Britain, and a string of government, intelligence and other reports have since underlined the connection - also accepted by a large majority in opinion polls. In the case of these latest bungled bombings, in which two Iraqis, a Palestinian and at least two other Arabs are said to have been involved, it&apos;s not hard to guess what might lie behind them. And while politicians who have supported wars that have cost hundreds of thousands of lives might want to cast a veil over the link, it makes no sense for the rest of us. The neocon attempt to lump together all Islamists - a political trend that stretches from Turkey&apos;s ruling Justice and Development party to al-Qaida - as beyond the political pale will meanwhile only make it harder to overcome the terror threat and isolate those who believe it is justifiable to kill civilians in retaliation for the Iraqi and Afghan bloodbaths. It is a folly that exasperates senior figures in the police, including special branch, whose job is to counter terror groups in the Muslim community. Just as mainstream Islamists in the Palestinian territories such as Hamas have helped prevent the encroachment of takfiri jihadists, so non-violent Islamists in the west can offer an alternative political channel to those who might otherwise be drawn to al-Qaida-inspired terror. &quot;This approach has played into the hands of al-Qaida,&quot; one high level special branch officer argues. &quot;Islamists have the best antidotes to al-Qaida propaganda.&quot; Given Britain&apos;s role in the Muslim world, the surprise must be that there haven&apos;t been more attacks. They have, after all, yet to reach anything like the level of the campaign waged by the IRA. But that such attacks continue is a central part of Blair&apos;s legacy - and the responsibility of a political class that failed to hold to account those who launched an illegal war of aggression with the most devastating human and political consequences. Until the Brown government makes serious moves to end Britain&apos;s role in the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, the likelihood must be that the threat will grow. s.milne@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["If the bombers&apos; real focus was, say, sexually liberal western lifestyles, they would presumably be attacking cities like Amsterdam and Stockholm."], "title": "Seumas Milne: Denial of the link with Iraq is delusional and dangerous", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/05/terrorism.terrorism", "tags": ["Politics", "Counter-terrorism policy", "Iraq", "World news", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-05T10:34:19Z", "article": "M&amp;C Saatchi has acquired international brand consultancy Clear Ideas for \u00a318.4m.

A year-long study of 818 women found that those who turned to complementary therapies such as herbal medicines, reflexology and acupuncture while having IVF treatment were at least 30% less likely to become pregnant than women who did not. A team led by Jacky Boivin, a psychologist at Cardiff University, investigated the effects of alternative therapies because they are increasingly being used by women undergoing fertility treatment. Some herbal treatments are marketed as natural remedies for infertility, while others claim to improve women&apos;s chances of getting pregnant by reducing their stress levels. Dr Boivin said it was unclear what was to blame for the apparent drop in pregnancy rates, but said the effect may be due to herbal medicines interacting with and disrupting drugs and hormones used in fertility treatment. Of the women followed in the study, 261 tried alternative therapies alongside their standard IVF treatment. Of those women, nearly half took herbal medicines. Over the 12-month period the women who used alternative medicines had an average of 2.4 cycles of IVF treatment, leading to pregnancies in 45.2% of them. Those who had only conventional fertility treatment had an average of 1.91 IVF cycles over the year, leading to pregnancies in 66.4%, Dr Boivin told a meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Lyon yesterday. &quot;It looks like complementary therapies might not be as benign as previously thought, at least with regard to fertility treatment,&quot; she said. The findings were met with caution from some experts. Many women who turn to alternative therapies do so out of desperation, because they have failed to become pregnant by conventional IVF treatment, said Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University. &quot;Those women who are more prone to stress and have more health problems are more likely to try complementary medicine, so complementary medicine could only be a marker, and not the cause, of stress or lower success rates.&quot; Similar results have been found in looking at the use of alternative therapies among cancer patients. Dr Boivin said although she could not rule out confounding factors, the study was designed to take into account any previously failed attempts to become pregnant, and also the women&apos;s socioeconomic status and mental health. Experts said that while the study did not provide definitive guidance for women thinking of using alternative therapies, it raised an important issue. &quot;We cannot start with the assumption that these therapies do no harm,&quot; said Andrea Braverman, director of psychological and complementary care at Reproductive Medicine Associates in New Jersey. A separate study yesterday raised concerns that fertility clinics which screen embryos to boost a woman&apos;s chances of a successful pregnancy may inadvertently be damaging their patients&apos; chances of having a baby. The finding suggests that women who pay up to \u00a32,000 for the procedure may be less likely to give birth afterwards. Doctors at the Academic Medical Centre at the University of Amsterdam studied 408 women aged 35-41 and found that only 24% of those who received the procedure had babies, compared with 35% of women whose embryos were implanted without being screened. Genetic screening of embryos has become increasingly popular at IVF clinics since 1997, though it is still relatively uncommon in Britain.", "sentences": ["Doctors at the Academic Medical Centre at the University of Amsterdam studied 408 women aged 35-41 and found that only 24% of those who received the procedure had babies, compared with 35% of women whose embryos were implanted without being screened."], "title": "Herbal medicines 'may hinder IVF treatment'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jul/05/health.medicineandhealth", "tags": ["Health", "Science", "Life and style", "Society", "Controversies", "UK news", "Reproduction"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-05T22:55:59Z", "article": "Moscow threatens to base missiles at Polish border   Russia yesterday warned that it would site rockets close to the Polish border and target US bases in Europe if Washington rebuffed its offer of cooperation on missile defence.

The question prompted much head-scratching this week as a Spanish-language website, Sentido Comun, declared that Mexico&apos;s very own Carlos Slim had overtaken Bill Gates to seize the top spot. Sentido Comun, which means &quot;common sense&quot;, calculated that a 27% surge in the share price of Slim&apos;s America Movil group had pushed the cigar-chomping billionaire&apos;s wealth up to a staggering $67.8bn - a country mile ahead of Bill Gates&apos; $59.2bn. The figures appear simple enough - Slim owns a third of America Movil&apos;s equity and share prices, after all, are in the public domain. But nobody was quite sure whether to believe the story which went unnoticed outside Mexico for three days before Reuters picked it up on Monday evening. For no particularly good reason, the American magazine Forbes is generally accepted as the font of all wisdom in ranking the mega-rich. Like a stately galleon, Forbes takes time to switch its course and as yet, there has been no indication that the venerable New York publication is taking any notice. Earlier this year, Sentido Comun&apos;s editor, Eduardo Garcia, was the first to point out that Slim had overtaken Warren Buffett to slot into second place in the global league. After a brief pause for breath, Forbes agreed and updated its own rankings. This time, Garcia admits the issue is less certain - because he has not taken into account any increase in Bill Gates&apos; worth from holdings outside Microsoft which represent half the technology tycoon&apos;s portfolio. Much of the American media duly ignored the Slim story, presumably waiting for Forbes to move. But many international news services, including Guardian Unlimited, opted to crown the Mexican as the planet&apos;s wealthiest being. Slim&apos;s nationality, incidentally, seems just as negotiable as his bank balance. Arabian Business magazine laid claim to him as a &quot;Lebanese businessman&quot;, citing his parentage. More tenuously still, the Turkish Daily News triumphantly announced that the world&apos;s richest man was a &quot;businessman of Ottoman descent&quot;. When you&apos;re that rich, everybody has a claim on you. More crap service on US airlines Nobody in America needs much reminding that travelling on the nation&apos;s airlines can be a dismal experience. With sheer military-style rudeness, overstretched airline staff often making flying akin to being in a boot camp. Official figures out this week from the US Bureau of Transport Statistics revealed that on-time arrivals slumped to their worst level for 13 years during the first five months of 2007, with just 73% turning up within 15 minutes of schedule - a record which makes Virgin Trains look like a Swiss metronome. The worst of a poor bunch, US Airways, only managed to get 67% of its planes to their destination on time. And wise passengers should avoid the carrier&apos;s flight 1569 from Boston to Philadelphia, which was late on a stunning 95.6% of occasions during May. The airline horror story of the month surfaced in the New York Times, which told of a Continental Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Newark on which the lavatories spilt sewage into the aisle forcing an unscheduled landing in Ireland. The next day, the plane took off again - and sanitary problems recurred. According to one passenger, the hapless flight attendants mopped the carpet over the Atlantic and urged passengers not to eat or drink too much, offering the memorable advice that those on board should &quot;control your intake so you can control your output&quot;. How many journalists does it take to watch someone change a lightbulb? Spare a thought for Conrad Black and his co-accused, patiently awaiting a verdict over whether they embezzled $60m from the peer&apos;s former Hollinger media empire. A motley collection of 40 or so British, Canadian and American journalists has been hanging around the city&apos;s Everett McKinley Dirksen federal courthouse hoping for a decision from a decidedly languid jury. The panellists aren&apos;t in much of a hurry - for no obvious reason, they took Tuesday afternoon off ahead of the Independence Day holiday on Wednesday. On Thursday, they went home 45 minutes earlier than schedule, leaving a note indicating that they only plan to ruminate for a half day on Friday. The judge, Amy St Eve, demonstrates little sympathy. Every so often she walks past the media encampment outside the courtroom, cheerfully asking: &quot;Aren&apos;t you bored?&quot; Notable events have included a workman changing a lightbulb outside the court. At one point, a delivery man turned up with an impressive bouquet of flowers for judge St Eve, prompting a brief frenzy of speculation over her suitor. If it&apos;s tedious for us, it&apos;s hard to imagine just how nerve-racking it must be for the noble lord. To his credit, however, Black isn&apos;t showing it. The writer Mark Steyn, who knows the peer well, reports on his blog that the fallen media mogul was out painting the town a conservative blue until the early hours this week for the 25th birthday of his daughter, Alana . And Black is such a good customer at one Chicago eaterie that the maitre d&apos; is planning to name a booth after him.

We&apos;ve come a long way since this account of young Harry&apos;s arrival at Hogwarts and his first encounter with evil Lord Voldemort, but the computer-generated magic is still strong, from the dumbfounding Diagon Alley to a deadly game of chess and the thrilling quidditch match; and with a whole coven of British acting talent to back up the youngsters, it&apos;s a spellbinding tale. The Scalphunters(Sydney Pollack, 1968) 5.25pm, Five Pollack&apos;s intelligent and entertaining western has a strong 1960s civil rights subtext, Burt Lancaster&apos;s trapper and Ossie Davis&apos;s runaway slave in a black-and-white partnership on the trail of Telly Savalas and his gang of unscrupulous scalphunters. Lancaster and Davis are a sparky double act. Blow(Ted Demme, 2001) 10.15pm, C4 Ted Demme&apos;s last film is the real-life story of George Jung, America&apos;s biggest drug-runner of the 1970s. His life of crime begins in near-innocence, persuading air hostess girlfriends to smuggle Mexican marijuana into California: but the later partnership with the Medellin cocaine cartel is a much more serious business. Unfortunately the film mirrors the decline, the vivid colours of the first half fading in a monotonous second. Still, it&apos;s an absorbing tale, with Johnny Depp convincing as Jung and strong support from Franka Potente, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths. Fight Club(David Fincher, 1999) 11.30pm, BBC2 Fincher&apos;s ferocious, subversive comedy stars Edward Norton as an insomniac businessman who is led into a whole new way of life by Brad Pitt&apos;s angsty soap salesman, Tyler Durden. At their fight club, where ordinary guys batter each other to pulp, they embrace a world of anarchic violence, and the club expands into a nationwide movement. Mr Majestyk(Richard Fleischer, 1974) 1.45am, BBC2 Charles Bronson knocked out a dozen or so hard, violent thrillers just like this in the 1970s. Here he&apos;s a peaceful watermelon farmer who has to take up his pitchfork against assorted crooks and racketeers. Fleischer handles the action with a sure touch, and there&apos;s a smart script from Elmore Leonard. Sunday July 8 Star!(Robert Wise, 1968) 12.50pm, BBC2 Wise is reunited with Julie Andrews for another musical epic, but this is nothing like as successful as The Sound Of Music. It&apos;s a whopping, three-hour biopic of Gertrude Lawrence, with Andrews never quite convincing as the stage legend. That apart, there are terrific productions of hits from the 1920s and 30s. Popeye(Robert Altman, 1980) 2.15pm, Five Idiosyncratic even by Altman&apos;s standards; a musical romance inspired by EC Segar&apos;s comic strip. Robin Williams employs all his whirligig talents to put flesh on the cartoon character, who is scouring Sweethaven for his missing father, and deeply in love with Shelley Duvall&apos;s Olive Oyl. Bizarre and curiously watchable. Driven(Renny Harlin, 2001) 8pm, Five Can young American Lewis Hamilton-alike Kip Pardue see off Teutonic automaton Til Schweiger and become world racing champ? Well, with mentor Sylvester Stallone behind him he can. Since Sly also wrote the script, it&apos;s pretty much Rocky on wheels: a formulaic motorsport movie featuring an exhausting series of races and some sentimental meanderings; not too many, though, because this is a fast, loud and furious feelgood movie brimming with brrrmm-brrrmm. Cabin Fever(Eli Roth, 2002) 10pm, C4 Five college pals on a relaxing holiday in a cabin up on the remote snowy mountain. What could possibly go wrong? Plenty, with Eli Roth, creator of the horrid Hostel movies, in charge. A man staggers out of the woods with something nasty in his system, and soon the youngsters are plagued by a spectacularly gruesome flesh-eating virus: it makes people bleed, copiously, from everywhere. An awkward mix of comedy, horror and grindingly obvious social comment, it nevertheless has a certain cranky appeal. Bronco Billy(Clint Eastwood, 1980) 11.45pm, BBC2 One of those quirky, accomplished Eastwood projects that&apos;s therapy for his avenging-angel westerner and heavy-cop personas. Here he&apos;s a New Jersey shoe salesman who realises a dream to ride off with a wild west circus, to be a real Rowdy Yates. Clint&apos;s ex, Sondra Locke, plays a New York heiress tagging along in this easy-going, satirical comedy. Urban Legend(Jamie Blanks, 1998) 11.45pm, C4 One of many teenie-slashers cashing in on the success of Wes Craven&apos;s far superior Scream. This has college chums getting gorily sliced up, one by one, in the manner of various urban legends; in among the shrieking youngsters are Brad Dourif and a cameo from Robert &quot;Freddy Krueger&quot; Englund. The Spiral Staircase(Robert Siodmak, 1945) 1.35am, BBC2 A vintage, gothic thriller set in turn-of-the-century New England, where a manic, voyeuristic murderer obsessed with the body beautiful is knocking off physically challenged women. Dorothy McGuire is the mute heroine menaced in a shadowy old house, where no one would hear her scream even if she could: Siodmak was a master of gloom, and could have taught Blanks a thing or two. Agnes Browne(Anjelica Huston, 1999) 2.15am, ITV1 Anjelica Huston directs herself in the title role, as a woman for whom the word indomitable was invented: in 1960s Dublin, her Agnes struggles to bring up seven children alone after the death of her husband, and to see off loan shark Ray Winstone; luckily she has best friend Marion O&apos;Dwyer for support, but will she live her dream of seeing Tom Jones in concert? Monday July 9 School For Scoundrels(Robert Hamer, 1960) 1.45pm, C4 Delicious vintage comedy from the director of Kind Hearts And Coronets. It stars the terminally naive Ian Carmichael as a much too decent chap who joins Alastair Sim&apos;s College of Lifemanship to learn how to turn the tables on his oppressors: John Le Mesurier the snooty waiter, Dennis Price and Peter Jones the secondhand car swindlers, and worst of all, tennis cheat Terry-Thomas. Escape From New York(John Carpenter, 1981) 11pm, ITV1 Kurt Russell dons eyepatch to play sneering con Snake Plissken, recruited by hard cop Lee Van Cleef to rescue hijacked US President Donald Pleasence from the hellhole that is near-future Manhattan; and by way of encouragement Snake has a timebomb planted in his head. Hefty, big-budget mayhem. Porky&apos;s(Bob Clark, 1982) 11pm, Five Scabrous comedy set in 1950s Florida, where a bunch of sex-mad high school lads fall foul of redneck brothel owner Porky (Chuck Mitchell) and take lurid, slapstick revenge. This grossly humorous tale was made long before the birth of PC, and it shows. Also, look out for a young Kim Cattrall. The Sting(George Roy Hill, 1973) 11.35pm, BBC1 Lavish, lighthearted comedy caper that reunites the director with &quot;Butch&quot; Newman and &quot;Sundance&quot; Redford. This time the lovable rogues are conmen in 1930s Chicago, executing one last, glorious sting on vicious racketeer Robert Shaw. Scott Joplin&apos;s ragtime piano tickles up the jolly period feel and the whole thing is performed as professionally as the sting itself. Saltwater(Conor McPherson, 2000) 12.15am, BBC2 Working in Dad&apos;s chippy on the Irish seaside just isn&apos;t fulfilling for Peter McDonald&apos;s Frank: add in the fact that dad (Brian Cox) is deep in debt to loan shark Brendan Gleeson, while Frank&apos;s brother (Laurence Kinlan) can&apos;t figure out his messy love life, and you have the makings of an engaging, funny, slightly leftfield comic drama. Tuesday July 10 Open Range(Kevin Costner, 2003) 10.35pm, BBC1 It&apos;s an unfashionable genre these days, but Costner&apos;s handsomely staged, intelligent western has much to recommend it. Costner&apos;s Charley Waite, haunted by his civil war past, and Robert Duvall&apos;s paternal Boss Spearman are itinerant cowboys who ride into confrontation with Michael Gambon&apos;s bullying rancher Baxter and his men, and sure as High Noon there&apos;s a (superbly staged) showdown on the way. Wednesday July 11 Collateral Damage(Andrew Davis, 2002) 9pm, Five Predictable revenge thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, as a firefighter aiming to extinguish the Colombian terrorists who blew up his wife and child in an attack on an embassy building. There&apos;s a half-decent cast that includes Elias Koteas, John Leguizamo and John Turturro, while director Davis is a dab-hand with the action. Hideous Kinky(Gillies MacKinnon, 1998) 11.40pm, BBC1 MacKinnon&apos;s screen version of Esther Freud&apos;s semi-autobiography stars Kate Winslet, fresh from the success of Titanic, as hippy-dippy, early-70s Julia, who gives up humdrum London and heads for Morocco with her two young daughters. An absorbing, emotionally honest drama. Thursday July 12 Mr Jealousy(Noah Baumbach, 1997) 11.50pm, BBC1 Eric Stoltz is the jealous guy of the title: he falls for Annabella Sciorra, but soon his wide eyes turn to green eyes as he obsesses over her ex. A ho-hum romcom, set smartly in New York, with the best jokes aimed at group therapy sessions. The Invisible Circus(Adam Brooks, 2001) 3.50am, C4 Pretty but limp drama in which Jordana Brewster&apos;s Phoebe tries to unravel the mystery of her sister Faith&apos;s (Cameron Diaz) suicide. She follows Faith&apos;s hippy 1960s quest through Amsterdam and Paris to the Portuguese coast and takes up, hesitantly, with sis&apos;s ex Christopher Eccleston. Friday July 13 Kevin And Perry Go Large(Ed Bye, 2000) 11.35pm, BBC1 Harry Enfield&apos;s terminally-teenaged comic creations jet off to Ibiza to try to find fame and get off with loads of girls. Kevin and Perry are played with almost endearing drooling idiocy by Enfield and the brilliant Kathy Burke, and Rhys Ifans is suitably revolting as DJ Eyeball Paul: if you love them on the box, you&apos;ll adore this.", "sentences": ["She follows Faith&apos;s hippy 1960s quest through Amsterdam and Paris to the Portuguese coast and takes up, hesitantly, with sis&apos;s ex Christopher Eccleston."], "title": "The week's best films", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jul/07/tvpickoftheweek.television", "tags": ["Film", "Television", "Culture", "Media", "Television & radio"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-07T23:04:41Z", "article": "Frits Seegers can think of nothing better than &apos;a little terraced house in Amsterdam, sitting in the sun and talking with a few people&apos;. It may be more than a pipe dream. Barclays, where he is chief executive of the grandly named Global Retail and Commercial Banking division, is bidding \u20ac66bn ($45bn) for Dutch bank ABN Amro and, if it wins, he, along with the rest of the bank&apos;s management team, will be moving to his native Netherlands. It would, he says, be good to go home. Over the last two decades, he has worked from California and Tokyo for Citigroup, the American banking giant, before being lured to London 12 months ago with an \u00a311.9m pay and bonus package and the challenge of putting some oomph into Barclays&apos; retail and commercial business, which has been languishing in the shadow of the hyper-successful investment arm, Barclays Capital. If he can deliver anything close to what he promises from a merger with ABN, he will earn that reward. Tall and solidly built, with silver hair that makes him look older than his 49 years, he comes across as single-minded, focused and determined not to be distracted. That is certainly the case with our conversation: he steers nearly every question back to his strategy, the strength of his team and the opportunities that a successful merger could create. Even his recollections of the favourite places he has lived revolve more around work than their beauty or leisure opportunities. &apos;To be in Tokyo when I was was fascinating. It was going through incredible change, a financial crisis. Interest rates were at zero but the Japanese were still very wealthy.&apos; He will need that determination if Barclays beats off the challenge from the Royal Bank of Scotland-led consortium that has also tabled a bid for the Dutch bank: a merger would all but double the size of the business, not to mention adding territories like Brazil and Canada to Barclays&apos; international operations. He seems in no doubt that he can do it. His presentation to investors includes a list of 11 executives, all skilled at handling acquisitions - from Seegers himself, who integrated Diners Club in Japan in 1999, to Deanna Oppenheimer, his retail banking chief executive, formerly of US bank Washington Mutual, who has 36 acquisitions under her belt. They are certainly an international bunch: as well as Oppenheimer and Seegers, two of the other senior executives - Paul Idzik and Todd Gravino - are Americans who, like Seegers, were formerly with Citigroup. They have not been together long - Gravino started only this year, and there will be three new recruits from ABN Amro. But Seegers thinks this diversity is an advantage rather than a handicap. &apos;In this team, we not only have people with the capacity to do in-country integrations, they know how to do outside-country ones too. They all have experience across the world.&apos; That reflects the global ambitions of Barclays chief executive John Varley, who has been steadily increasing the target for the amount of business generated overseas - last year, half the bank&apos;s revenues came from outside the UK and, if the deal goes ahead, that will increase to 60 per cent. It will also propel Barclays into the highest league, giving it a global market share of around 2 per cent and making it the fourth biggest bank in the world in commercial and retail terms, adding Asian and Latin American presence to its operations in the US, South Africa and Spain. &apos;Why is that important? Because worldwide, customers are getting more global,&apos; says Seegers. &apos;There is no difference between a mortgage in Mumbai, Manchester or Mombasa. The question is: can you bring the experience you have developed in developing markets to emerging ones?&apos; Seegers and his team spent four weeks working with ABN to agree an integration strategy - one which, he says, its executives will be helping to implement. The key is harnessing ABN&apos;s more advanced payment and money transfer systems - &apos;cash and trade&apos;, as he calls them - to Barclays&apos; superior product penetration (in credit cards, for example), and to move quickly to integrate platforms and systems between the two banks. The promised cost cuts, at \u20ac1.65bn, look ambitious given the relatively small overlap between the two businesses; conversely, the predicted \u20ac150m revenue increase looks modest. He readily concedes the latter point. &apos;We will have 8,000 branches combined, and \u20ac150m of extra revenues amounts to just \u20ac19,000 per branch. You do not need too many customers to achieve that.&apos; And, he says, the combined bank will have operations in areas that account for 91 per cent of international trade flows. &apos;A UK entrepreneur who does business in China, for example, we cannot service now, as we have no network there. ABN brings that. Because we will be such a big distributor, with 8,000 branches, a lot of customers will come to us.&apos; Equally, however, he believes that the cost savings estimate will turn out to be conservative too. &apos;Take cards: our platform [Barclaycard] is the biggest in the world outside the US. We will be able to drive higher revenue growth in cards than ABN and cut layers of cost as they transfer the cards to us.&apos; He points to innovations like the Breathe card launched last week, which will contribute half its profits to environmental causes, and a forthcoming card linked to Oyster, the London Transport electronic ticketing system. Analysts are sceptical about such claims because Barclays failed to live up to its promise to transform Woolwich, the building society it acquired in 2000. While Varley admitted the failure well before Seegers arrived, and charged Oppenheimer with fixing it, Seegers is happy to take the credit for putting it right. &apos;It was a three-part plan, and the 11th biggest integration in Europe. Two [parts] have already been done and it will be completed shortly. The precision rate [the number of records successfully transferred] was 99.2 per cent.&apos; When it is pointed out that this is happening six years too late, he retorts: &apos;But I wasn&apos;t here then.&apos; Barclays has a much leaner management structure than ABN, with just seven layers between the customer and Varley compared with an average of 11 at ABN - and it is clear which way Seegers intends to move if Barclays wins the day. &apos;We have insisted on a model with accountability and clarity. My job is to empower those who work for me. The CEOs are there to run the business; my job is to help them get on with it. Seegers squirms as soon as the conversation veers off his core message of how formidable a team ABN and Barclays would be. While he admits to a long list of languages that he speaks or understands - including French, German, Spanish and reading familiarity with several Scandinavian languages - he will give little else about his private life away. Asked about his early ambitions, he will only say: &apos;I was always interested in doing something with a group of people, something with an international element. I always like it if I have an assignment I enjoy.&apos; He is married to Kartika Sukarno, daughter of the first president of Indonesia; they have a baby together and two children from a previous marriage. He is unperturbed by the constant travelling: &apos;As long as you find a bed to live in, you can do it.&apos; He thinks the Dutch and the British have a love of travelling and an international outlook. It will be some months before he finds out if he is going home, however. The Dutch Supreme Court is expected to rule shortly on whether ABN should have sought approval for the sale of its US bank, LaSalle, which was linked to Barclays&apos; bid. But, even if that ruling goes in Barclays&apos; favour, the RBS consortium is unlikely to accept defeat. Whatever happens, you can be sure Seegers will have his battle plan ready.

With wire cutters and stepladders, they&apos;re up and over in under a minute. They hurry towards the west end of Nottingham East Midlands Airport&apos;s Taxiway Alpha, as they rehearsed. &apos;Keep calm,&apos; says Reverend Malcolm Carroll to the 23 young men and women with &apos;Climate Camp&apos; stitched to their jackets. &apos;Don&apos;t run.&apos; It&apos;s a little after 8am. They kneel in four rows, now chained together, while Carroll, a Baptist minister, addresses them from behind a lectern he has carried with him, arms outstretched, as he would a congregation. &apos;One hundred and sixty thousand is a heck of a lot of people,&apos; he begins, &apos;a 9/11 every week. So, in this act of remembrance, we&apos;re going to start with a couple of moments&apos; quiet.&apos; Everyone bows heads. Emergency Fire and Rescue vehicles thunder down the runway towards them. &apos;Planes. Profits. The airline industry is possibly the worst for CO2,&apos; continues Carroll. &apos;Short-haul flights are a symptom of sin. There&apos;s two worlds. There&apos;s the plane-stupid world of these big companies,&apos; he gestures around the airport, &apos;and the plane-stupid attitude of our government that has given them free skies, no matter how much they pollute those skies. And there&apos;s this world - caring, compassionate. And we&apos;re part of this world.&apos; He calls for two minutes&apos; silence, timing it on his wristwatch. In the event, the protesters stay put for four hours, the time it takes for police from four counties to remove and charge them with aggravated trespass and criminal damage. They succeed in delaying five flights, inconveniencing 1,000 passengers, though the real victory comes that evening - prominent coverage on the national news. &apos;One hundred and sixty thousand people are dying through climate change every year, according to the World Health Organisation,&apos; Carroll will explain. &apos;We&apos;ve had words, but we&apos;re getting no action. So we&apos;re taking direct action ourselves, peacefully, putting our bodies in the way. A message to the airline industry: we are watching you. And you&apos;re not going to get away with it.&apos; So it continues. The next month, aviation executives at London&apos;s Waldorf Hilton abandon their conference on ways to leverage demand for cheap flights when demonstrators burst in and release helium balloons tied to screeching rape alarms. At Tower Bridge, protesters wearing business suits infiltrate a gala dinner for airline CEOs, making it impossible for police to tell who&apos;s who. In Manchester, Birmingham, Cambridge and Southend, travel-agent staff arriving for work find their paths blocked and their windows plastered with stickers: &apos;Closed for a Rethink&apos;. It&apos;s all the work of Plane Stupid, an environmental action group co-founded by student Joss Garman, who, in his 21 years, has already chalked up a lifetime of frontline protest. Plane Stupid believes air travel poses the single greatest threat to our climate. Its stated aim is to bring the aviation industry down to earth&apos; by seeking an end to short-haul flights, a tax on aviation fuel and abandonment of airport expansion. Their 150 or so members represent a new generation of green activists, many of whom grew up with one eye on the Reclaim the Streets anti-road movement of the Nineties, were involved in Iraq protests and believe direct action is now the only way forward. &apos;Our members have become radicalised because they marched against Iraq and wrote letters and did all the things they were supposed to do, and it didn&apos;t make any difference,&apos; says Garman. &apos;We&apos;re not going to let that happen with climate change. There&apos;s the real sense that we&apos;re the last generation - if we don&apos;t do it, no one else will.&apos; As climate-change scrutiny shifts from homes and cars to aeroplanes, airline companies are fastening their seatbelts for a bumpy ride. A survey conducted in May suggested that 47 per cent of people in Britain had already cut down on short-haul flying as a result of climate change. Along with other aviation-badgering groups, such as AirportWatch, Spurt and enoughsenough.org, Plane Stupid is on a mission to push this figure higher. Next month, Camp for Climate Action, an annual gathering of hundreds of environmental campaigners from disparate groups, will take Plane Stupid&apos;s lead and spend eight days campaigning at Heathrow, somewhere they say is responsible for 31m tonnes of carbon emissions a year - more than many countries, including Peru, Cuba and Croatia. &apos;People can&apos;t now contemplate flying without contemplating their impact on the climate,&apos; says Garman. &apos;That wasn&apos;t the case six months ago.&apos; One spring evening, Plane Stupid gives a talk to the Hackney Labour Club. A dozen people have turned up to the basement of a north London church. Graham Thompson, a member currently spending his Sundays painting a youth club as community service for his part in the East Midlands protest, mans the projector. He draws parallels with the road protest and the GM crop movements of the Nineties. &apos;I guess a lot of people have heard of Twyford Down and Newbury Bypass,&apos; he says, referring to the M3 and A34 extensions that proved protest flashpoints. &apos;Those roads did get built. But the vast majority got cancelled because of the costs of those protests. [The bill for private security at Newbury alone reached \u00a323.7m.] A lot of GM crop companies pulled out of the UK, because every time they planted them they got pulled up. That&apos;s the kind of model we&apos;re trying to copy with aviation.&apos; Plane Stupid has christened August&apos;s mass Heathrow sit-in &apos;Newbury Bypass of the Skies&apos;. Thompson brings up some graphs. &apos;Aviation is not the biggest source of CO2 emissions,&apos; he explains. &apos;The airline industry will make a big play of saying it&apos;s only 2 per cent. Globally it is - in the UK, it&apos;s more like 6.5 per cent. But it&apos;s not the amount, it&apos;s the rate of growth that&apos;s so worrying.&apos; In fact, this figure still belies aviation&apos;s true impact. CO2 released at ground level takes half of its 100-year lifetime to rise from an exhaust pipe to the stratosphere. Released at 30,000ft, the CO2 from a single flight across the Atlantic can cause more damage than the average motorist does in a year. The rub of Plane Stupid&apos;s argument, then, is the apparent contradiction between the Department for Transport&apos;s plans for hefty airport expansion, outlined in a 2003 White Paper, and the Department for Environment&apos;s pledge to cut carbon emissions by 60 per cent by 2050. &apos;They&apos;re incompatible,&apos; says Thompson. &apos;The only way the government can set those carbon-cutting goals and not look like it failed its GCSE maths is not to include aviation in the figures.&apos; Using more graphs culled from Oxford University&apos;s Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, Thompson claims that if aviation continues to grow at its current rate, it will outstrip emissions from cars in six to eight years. By 2030, the number of people flying in or out of UK airports is expected to double to 465m a year. New schemes mooted to facilitate this include the fifth terminal and third runway at Heathrow, a second runway at Stansted, an extension to the main terminal at Glasgow, a new runway at Edinburgh, a new pier and main terminal extension at Glasgow and a new terminal at Southampton. &apos;If they&apos;re serious about climate change,&apos; says Thompson, &apos;the government has to change plans or they&apos;re going to fuck everything up.&apos; It&apos;s 2 February and Plane Stupid protesters plan to climb on to the roof of easyJet&apos;s headquarters at Luton Airport, unveil a banner and remain there for as long as they can. They park in a nearby street. It&apos;s breakfast time, and people are leaving for work, paying little heed to the white van with a ladder hanging off its roof or six scruffy twentysomethings standing about discussing Tony Blair&apos;s interview on the Today programme and smoking Old Holborn roll-ups. Joss Garman is here, though he&apos;ll not take part directly - when the inevitable arrests come, he&apos;ll act as legal support. &apos;They&apos;ll call the cops right away,&apos; he confirms. &apos;But easyJet is slicker than any other airline. They&apos;re PR gurus. They&apos;ve just tried to rebrand as the environmentally friendly guys. Stelios [Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, easyJet&apos;s founder] gave an interview last week saying he was &quot;the Toyota Prius of the skies&quot;.&apos; He rolls his eyes. Low-cost, short-haul air travel is another of Plane Stupid&apos;s bugbears. Through tax-free fuel and VAT-free transactions, the aviation industry receives an annual \u00a39bn tax break - the reason it can offer flights to Amsterdam for \u00a319. (Without subsidies, that flight would be more like \u00a3119.) At the time of writing, Ryanair is trailing &apos;10m seats for \u00a310&apos;. Forty-five per cent of flights to Europe are 500km or less in length - all destinations reachable by train, bus or ferry. Air Southwest currently offers a flight from Plymouth to Newquay - 50 miles - which is surely the very definition of false economy. &apos;You could cycle it,&apos; reckons Graham Thompson. But there will be no arrests today. The ladder is barely off the van before an easyJet employee has grabbed the other end. &apos;It would be extremely dangerous for you to go on this roof,&apos; he warns. &apos;It&apos;s not structurally sound.&apos; As he stands there wrestling with Isabel Harris, one of the protesters, an easyJet colleague wanders past. &apos;Has Fathers 4 Justice made any difference?&apos; &apos;We&apos;ve got nothing to do with them,&apos; she says. &apos;But has that amount of campaigning made any difference? If your organisation is as clever as you say, you should try something a little bit brighter than standing on an orange roof.&apos; The police arrive. So does Andrew Harrison, easyJet&apos;s chief executive. He cruises into PR mode. &apos;I agree with you, there needs to be action. I care. I&apos;ve got young kids. That&apos;s why we&apos;re running the most environmentally efficient airline in the UK. Eighty-five per cent full, modern planes; we burn 30 per cent less than any other airline.&apos; He mentions his concern over last year&apos;s Stern review, the government-commissioned report into global warming which suggests that by 2050 aviation could account for half the UK&apos;s carbon dioxide emissions. &apos;But easyJet is expanding ... &apos; says Isabel. &apos;The reason we&apos;re expanding is because we&apos;re efficient,&apos; says Harrison. &apos;You can&apos;t be a King Canute and say industrialisation is locked. You&apos;ve got to realise there are going to be more cars, more lighting, more aeroplanes. People need to be thinking about the big issues: power generation, lighting, deforestation ... &apos; &apos;People can&apos;t take that much of an active role in deforestation,&apos; says Isabel. &apos;One thing they can do is fly less.&apos; &apos;But what you&apos;re effectively doing is demonstrating outside Smart car,&apos; Harrison persists. &apos;What you ought to do is protest outside Alitalia or British Airways. They fly old aircraft. They&apos;re like the old London buses. We don&apos;t generate new markets,&apos; he says, &apos;the guys who do that are Ryanair.&apos; Defeated, Plane Stupid hands out a few flyers before police take their names and escort them off the premises. &apos;It&apos;s just an impossible conversation,&apos; Isabel concludes. &apos;All you can say is: &quot;In the end, it would be best if this airline closed down.&quot; That&apos;s not a debate that&apos;s going to work, is it? I&apos;d love it if Joss had been able to speak to him. He would have found a way.&apos; A fortnight later, Joss Garman is on a train to Loughborough. He&apos;s due in court this morning, charged with aggravated trespass for his part (albeit organisational) in the East Midlands protest. The train fare is \u00a395. He&apos;s not happy. &apos;You can fly to Scotland for a quid and it costs you \u00a3200 to take the train. The government says it&apos;s up to individuals to combat climate change, but they take away all the green choices. They&apos;re investing massively in aviation, and not the railways. Per person we fly more than double the amount the French fly. Why? Because they&apos;ve got a good train network.&apos; Garman&apos;s finals are in three weeks. He&apos;s studying Politics and Development Studies at the University of London. While his lawyer sits opposite making notes in a ring binder marked &apos;Regina v Joss Garman&apos;, Garman turns his attention to political philosopher John Rawls&apos;s essay &apos;Justice and Culture&apos;. His dissertation is overdue: 3,000 words on Cultural Diversity and Liberal Society. Garman grew up in Radnorshire, South Wales. His dad invented the bath lift, the device for helping elderly and infirm people wash. His son was keener on animals, a Gerald Durrell &apos;total obsessive&apos;. &apos;I used to keep snakes and spiders and write letters to and fro with David Attenborough.&apos; The more he got into wildlife, the more his focus shifted to conservation. At 15, he wrote to Greenpeace asking if they had a local group he could join. They hadn&apos;t, so he started his own. Soon he could be found outside Sainsbury&apos;s, leading GM food demonstrations. At 16 he&apos;d joined the fight against the nuclear power station at Wylfa, Anglesey. The same year he took direct action for the first time, joining the Trident Ploughshares disarmament campaign and breaking into the Royal Navy nuclear submarine base in Faslane, Scotland, three times in the same week. &apos;The most trouble I&apos;ve been in was probably breaking into [RAF] Fairford, when the bombers were leaving to attack Iraq, and trying to blockade the runways,&apos; he says. &apos;I got held at gunpoint by US military types screaming their heads off, then held in solitary for two-and-a-half days. It was just before my A levels, and I was already on bail for doing a similar thing at the US spybase at Menworth Hill.&apos; In 2003 Garman was presented with the Anne Frank Award for Moral Courage for his public policy work with Greenpeace and Trident Ploughshares. Bliss magazine called him &apos;Britain&apos;s Coolest Activist&apos;. Today he&apos;s horrified at suggestions that he&apos;s the poster-boy for a new generation of greens. After one reporter christened him the &apos;New Swampy&apos; - as in Daniel Hooper, the dreadlocked &apos;eco warrior&apos; who became the public face of the anti-roads movement - he had to change his phone. &apos;It was so bad,&apos; he mutters darkly. &apos;People asked me to present lifestyle programmes and stuff.&apos; Garman is smart and likable and his arguments are compelling, but given his history of aggro, aren&apos;t planes just the latest thing for him? &apos;Climate change makes [past protests] fade into insignificance,&apos; he insists. &apos;This isn&apos;t about protecting a bit of woodland - this is about protecting the whole of sub-Saharan Africa. It&apos;s not fighting against one war. It&apos;s something worse than slavery, worse than apartheid. The people dying in Africa this century alone - that&apos;s like 30 Holocausts or something. This is the defining thing of my life. I want to be part of the last-ditch attempt to stop it.&apos; He agrees the planet&apos;s woes aren&apos;t entirely down to planes, but says that as they&apos;re the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gases, it&apos;s on the airline industry that pressure needs to be applied. Still, is trespass, criminal damage and mucking about on runways really the way for his group to be taken seriously? &apos;You have to capture people&apos;s imaginations. One of the criticisms levelled at Greenpeace is that it&apos;s all negative, negative, negative. That&apos;s why people are coming to these small, grassroots groups. We haven&apos;t got time to just &quot;protest&quot;. People felt totally let down by something like Make Poverty History. What actually changed?&apos; Surprisingly, perhaps, the more established environmental groups have nothing but praise for Plane Stupid. &apos;At a time when the government wishes to ignore the urgency of climate change in order to promote short-term economic growth, I think peaceful direct action is perfectly legitimate,&apos; says Tony Juniper, executive director of Friends of the Earth. &apos;Plane Stupid is young, idealistic, very media savvy and with a budget that would probably be dwarfed by Richard Branson&apos;s hotel bill for a night,&apos; says Greenpeace&apos;s Ben Stewart. &apos;They&apos;ve taken on a multibillion-pound industry and absolutely shifted the debate. They&apos;re waving credible, peer-reviewed science in the faces of the government and the industry and trying to get them to accept reality. Good luck to them.&apos; Dr Benjamin Franks, a lecturer at the University of Glasgow in political and social philosophy, who has written widely on direct action, places Plane Stupid in a lineage of historical global protest. &apos;A great number of campaigns to change public attitudes - votes for women, curtailment of racial segregation, improved working conditions - probably would not have been as successful without some form of direct action. One can certainly sympathise with Plane Stupid&apos;s aims.&apos; At Loughborough Crown Court, Garman sits outside Court A in his brother&apos;s suit and waits for the district judge. Reverend Malcolm Carroll is here, too, a potential witness (last week he had his dog collar felt again: fined \u00a330 for being over the limit on his bicycle). A man in a boxy suit walks by. &apos;All right, Joss?&apos; It transpires he&apos;s the policeman, a member of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, who arrested and interviewed Garman. It happened to be the day after Garman had appeared on Newsnight. &apos;He said to me, &quot;You think Paxman was tough? You ain&apos;t seen nothing yet,&quot;&apos; Garman whispers. &apos;I was, like, cringe.&apos; The judge eventually finds him not guilty. Clearly, we&apos;re not all about to relinquish planes and spend the rest of our holidays hillwalking in Wales. Plane Stupid doesn&apos;t expect us to. &apos;It&apos;s not a message for consumers,&apos; says Leo Murray, another representative. &apos;It&apos;s a message to the public that the government&apos;s got to change policy. It&apos;s true that will have some knock-on effect, because it will make flying more expensive. We&apos;re only asking that aviation pays its price.&apos; But anything that makes air travel more expensive, such as a &apos;green tax&apos; on aviation fuel or further increases in air passenger duty, as mooted by the opposition parties, is the last thing the airlines want. Ryanair&apos;s forthright chief executive Michael O&apos;Leary has declared such notions &apos;horseshit&apos;, claiming the carbon-offsetting business is riddled with &apos;snake oil salesmen&apos; and stating &apos;there is no suggestion the [eco] loonies are dissuading people from travelling&apos; - a comment which led a government minister to brand Ryanair the &apos;irresponsible face of capitalism&apos;. But as airlines face unprecedented scrutiny, they&apos;re increasingly finding themselves on a collision course with the public. Last November, Uttlesford district council, in Essex, rejected plans by the British Airports Authority to double the number of passengers at Stansted. (The case has gone to public inquiry.) And last month, despite O&apos;Leary&apos;s comments, Ryanair&apos;s deputy chief executive said he was &apos;concerned&apos; over the amount of negative publicity the airline sector was receiving, admitting its margins were being &apos;squeezed at the edges&apos;. Ryanair aside, many airlines are now making concessions to green-sky thinking. EasyJet posts its eco agenda on its website (&apos;Do you care about the environment? We do too!&apos;) and recently took Virgin Trains to the Advertising Standards Authority over whose credentials were &apos;the greener&apos;. Richard Branson has pledged to invest all profits from his travel companies into developing renewable-energy technologies. And British Airways and lastminute.com encourage carbon-offsetting schemes when passengers book tickets. BAA, owner and operator of seven UK airports, agrees that aviation must pay its price and argues that this can be done through new energy-efficient technologies, biofuels and emissions trading, not taxes. &apos;The green ticket is not something we&apos;ve jumped on in the last 18 months,&apos; says Mark Mann, BAA&apos;s head of media relations. &apos;We recognise there&apos;s an impact and we&apos;re working towards a solution, otherwise there&apos;s no sustainable future for aviation. We&apos;re not just going to go on expanding willy-nilly with no concern for the environment. But we don&apos;t agree the best solution is taxation that will stop people flying.&apos; The public agrees. A May survey suggested that more travellers want to see air taxes cut than increased. Mann points out that BAA already participates in an emissions trading scheme, by restricting the CO2 emissions from the boilerhouses situated around its airports. Meanwhile, he says, any expansion is always done in a responsible manner, taking local communities&apos; concerns on board. &apos;There&apos;s a feeling that because you&apos;ve enjoyed yourself flying, the only way to remedy this is to punish yourself and stop,&apos; he says. &apos;We think that&apos;s wrong.&apos; Plane Stupid calls carbon-offsetting &apos;greenwash&apos;. &apos;It&apos;s a total con,&apos; says Garman. &apos;Like being a member of the RSPCA and kicking a dog.&apos; Ian Pearson, minister of state for Climate Change and Environment, says that aviation isn&apos;t included in the Climate Change Bill because there is no agreement on how to allocate emissions to various national inventories. He denies that his role and the Department for Transport&apos;s plans for expansion are at odds. &apos;The government&apos;s principle of sustainable development for aviation is that a proper balance should be struck between economic and environmental considerations,&apos; he says. &apos;In 2002, aviation added \u00a310bn to the UK economy.&apos; He agrees, however, that aviation is making a growing contribution to climate change and that, &apos;like all sectors of the economy, the polluter should pay the price&apos;. The best way to do this, he says, is for the government to ensure that aviation is included in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme &apos;as soon as possible&apos;. &apos;Today is the 10th anniversary of Blair coming to power,&apos; says Richard George, Plane Stupid&apos;s co-founder. It is 1 May, and George is currently spending his Sundays picking up litter for his part in the East Midlands protest. &apos;We want to shut the revolving door between the aviation industry and Blair&apos;s inner circle. So we&apos;re going over to Heathrow to pay BAA a visit.&apos; It&apos;s Plane Stupid&apos;s belief that the government and the aviation industry are in cahoots. They cite Lord Soley, ex-Labour MP and campaign director for Future Heathrow, an alliance of businesses supporting the airport&apos;s modernisation, as an example. With an eye to grabbing some headlines, this is the &apos;revolving door&apos; Plane Stupid wants to draw attention to today - by blocking the doors to BAA&apos;s head office. George and his protesters are dropped off outside BAA. Four demonstrators in business clothes march into the entrance, apparently as if going to a meeting, then, using bicycle locks, they shut themselves in between two sets of double doors. The security manager arrives with the police. &apos;Hi, can you hear me?&apos; he says through the glass. &apos;I&apos;m the security manager for BAA. I&apos;m making a formal request for you to come out of the building. You&apos;re trespassing. My formal request is made at 10.37.&apos; &apos;Our formal request is that you stop climate change,&apos; says Felix, one of the protesters. &apos;In all reality, that&apos;s not going to happen today, is it?&apos; sighs one of the policemen. Plane Stupid says they&apos;ll leave once BAA gives them a &apos;written undertaking&apos; that they have &apos;read and understood&apos; the Tyndall Centre report, copies of which they&apos;ve plastered over the doors. The police suggest drilling the doors off. BAA is against it. &apos;Let&apos;s see who&apos;s got the most patience,&apos; says BAA&apos;s security man. Around lunchtime, two middle-aged women turn up wearing T-shirts that read &apos;No Third Runway&apos;. They&apos;re soon joined by Linda McCutcheon, secretary of NoTRAG, the No Third Runway Action Group. &apos;It will destroy five villages, 2,000 people will be turfed out, 700 homes destroyed. Schools will be demolished. Churches under threat,&apos; she says. &apos;Criminal.&apos; At 5pm, Plane Stupid decide to call it a day, reading from a statement as they&apos;re pushed into the back of police vans: &apos;Having reached the end of the working day, we have still received no reply from BAA.&apos; They&apos;re bailed until 6 July. This protest barely makes the news, perhaps because there is a fatal air incident that day. But Plane Stupid believes their message is getting across, that they&apos;ve got the airlines rattled and that support for their arguments is swelling. In April, 10 protesters occupied a runway at Stockholm&apos;s Bromma Airport, releasing a statement saying they were &apos;inspired by Plane Stupid&apos;. Next month, Camp for Climate Action at Heathrow will make Plane Stupid&apos;s arguments global front-page news. &apos;Historically, greens have had it tough,&apos; says Garman. &apos;So many of these environmental battles are conveyed as an &quot;Industry versus Greenies&quot; thing. We&apos;re lucky, all our stuff is based on science. It sounds cliched, but all the big changes in history have come from a small group of people.

In your face, hole-left-in-society-by-Diana&apos;s death, we&apos;ve got a new People&apos;s Princess, but this one&apos;s taller, smilier, Balkanier and doesn&apos;t walk around with a great, big bouffant on her head. But tennis isn&apos;t the only thing undergoing a makeover at the moment. Because Human Rights FC manager Sven-Goran Eriksson has decided to transform himself from the kind of manager whose idea of a bold attacking move is bringing on a defensive midfielder for another defensive midfielder, to a freewheeling maverick who buys obscure \u00a38.8m Italian strikers just for the hell of it. And then nips down for the pub for a drink with a man who&apos;s got an international corruption charge hanging over his head. The \u00a38.8m forward in question is Reggina&apos;s Rolando Bianchi, who scored 18 goals last season, finished as Serie A&apos;s fourth-highest scorer and looks set to join Sven&apos;s new dawn tomorrow. Exciting enough to have HRFC fans slipping their hands between their thighs, but it&apos;s worth bearing in mind that Bianchi scored two goals in 39 appearances during his time at Cagliari and none in 21 at Atalanta. And then there&apos;s the nagging worry that little-known Italian strikers in the Premiership - Corrado Grabbi and Massimo Maccarone anyone? - usually work out as often as Nicky Weaver. Which is perhaps why West Ham have gone for a known quantity in their foray into the transfer market - and with laid-back funster Craig Bellamy you know exactly what you&apos;re getting and it usually involves all kind of naughty words. Bellamy&apos;s \u00a37.5m move from Liverpool was confirmed today and as ever, he&apos;s raring to go. &quot;It was important for me to start playing regular football. I could sit at Liverpool as a squad player all day long, picking up my money, playing every now and then, but I&apos;d be cheating myself and my personality,&quot; he said.

The lineup: Cameron Meshell (vocals, guitar, piano), Pelle Hillstrom (guitar, FX), Mikkel Heimburger (bass), Jesper Kristensen (drums). The background: Just when you start thinking that Forever Like Red, a four-piece from London comprising an American, two Danes and a Swede, two of whom were in an LA band called Citrus while a third was in electropoppers Modwheelmood, tout generic post-Bends Keanefodder, you hear their astonishing backstory and you&apos;re forced to reconsider. Seriously reconsider. According to the press release, Father and Forever Like Red, tracks from their forthcoming debut album, Distance, are meant to be excoriating exercises in heavy-duty autobiography, written by the band&apos;s singer, pianist/guitarist and main writer Cameron Meshell in August 2000 in the aftermath of &quot;a catastrophic event in his life&quot;. And you think, &quot;Yeah, sure, don&apos;t tell us. His hamster got eczema, right?&quot; Wrong: his dad got shot and killed by the police in a domestic dispute in his hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana. Suddenly, the blood-curdling screeches and gut-wrenching roars throughout Father sound less like emotional posturing and more like authentic cris de coeur. Well, they would do, wouldn&apos;t they? Blimey, last week we brought you an act called Green Pitch fronted by a woman who&apos;s lost the use of both legs after a fall from a ladder in Amsterdam, and now this. What next? A 100-piece band, all victims of a Jonestown-style mass suicide? Still, when this little lot gets out, Forever Like Red are going to be all over the media, satisfying our voyeuristic bloodlust (or is that just us up here at GUM?), and Cameron Meshell is going to be recounting endlessly what amounts to possibly the most shocking pop-star tragedy of recent times. The tough question is: do the ghastly events of August 2000 help elevate Forever Like Red&apos;s mundane ballad-rock towards the realms of the grimly compelling? Honestly? Well, yes, they do. Until we heard the cop-killing saga, we were feeling ever-so-slightly comatose. But when we found out the above, it was as though someone had rammed a cattle-prod under our collective jacksie. Now Cameron Meshell, the product of a traditional Deep South, God-fearing upbringing - as detailed on the single What Will You Pay, an agnostic look at the inherent contradictions of a belief in the after-life - seems like the most fascinating man on the planet, although frankly we were disappointed when we discovered that his song Inhibitions, about doing what you want because you want to, sounds nothing like the similarly-themed Because We Want To by 90s teenpop terrors Daphne &amp; Celeste.

The all-cash offer of \u20ac55 a share, a 44% premium to Numico&apos;s average closing price over the past three months, comes in the immediate wake of Danone&apos;s sale of its biscuits business to US rival Kraft last week.

Mon oeil - or pull the other one as we say. The sight of Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg premier and Eurogroup chairman, embracing French president Nicolas Sarkozy may not have been grand guignol but it was pure theatre - from two master illusionists. After effusively welcoming a &quot;night visitor&quot;, the Grand Duchy veteran went out of his way to reassure him and the gaping, guffawing hacks that Sarko&apos;s plans to defer balancing the French budget to &quot;at the latest&quot; 2012 - rather than the stipulated 2010 - was wholly within the rules of the revised stability and growth pact governing the eurozone. &quot;I believe in the pact,&quot; said Sarko. &quot;I&apos;m simply asking for an intelligent and dynamic application of the pact ... as France will put in place the reforms that Europe has been waiting for from her for so long.&quot; So did he get away with it? The workings of the pact - revised in 2005 - are arcane because they are politically devious and have been subject to chicanery in recent years, allowing Germany and France, the eurozone&apos;s two biggest economies, to escape without fines despite busting the rules for four years in a row. Now virtuous Germany, in the person of ultra-orthodox finance priest Peer Steinbr\u00fcck with his projected 0.5% deficit this year, is admonishing Sarko to set an example, stick to the rules and deliver on time. Others, including Italy, singled out this week as so often before for breaking the pact&apos;s criteria, feel the same. Steinbr\u00fcck at least had the grace to admit that a previous (underlined 10 times) administration (of his own party) had hardly been a model player in 2003, drumming up enough support to escape censure. But, he glowered, no more. &quot;We don&apos;t need any more reforms but should follow the rules of the game ... If the pact&apos;s obligations and disciplinary power are weakened it impacts on the domestic policies of other countries...&quot; Memo to Sarko: don&apos;t you dare or I&apos;m buggered at home. Almunia, the pact&apos;s stern guardian, said he had lectured the French president that budgetary discipline and reform were not irreconcilable but went hand in hand and ensured growth and jobs. But he duly admitted that Sarko is not breaking the rules - yet - and had promised to present a model programme of reforms in September. &quot;Compared with the attitudes of some countries in 2003 the situation now is completely different: nobody will dare to provoke a crisis in the pact,&quot; he intoned - sitting beside an equally grim Fernando Teixeira dos Santos, the Portuguese minister chairing the meeting, who nodded solemnly. Portugal, of course, is a serial sinner as regards the pact ... Ecofin, the new farcical comedy. The Austro-Hungarian empire cannot be revived While Sarko is chasing around France and, now, North Africa, trying to sort out the floundering \u20ac90bn merger between Suez and Gaz de France, bringing in perhaps EDF, Total or Sonatrach, the Algerian gas company, the Austrians are fruitlessly trying to engineer their own big energy group in central Europe. OMV, in which the Austrian government is the largest shareholder with 31.5%, has built up an 18.6% stake in Hungarian oil and gas firm MOL and has offered a friendly takeover. Oh, Vienna! You mean nothing to us, respond the Magyars, who have bought up 30% of their own shares and parked them with some strange bedfellows as the rules limit MOL&apos;s stake to 10% of itself. Gyorgy Mosonyi, MOL chief executive, said this would be no merger of equals and, anyway, it would reduce competition in the region. In true EU fashion the Hungarian premier Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny has said the offer can hardly be friendly when it&apos;s from a state-owned foreign - fellow European, in truth - firm trying to make a hostile takeover. Shades of Eon and Endesa. But, in the energy-starved Europe, the plot thickens. This is not just an everyday takeover tale of consolidation. The two groups are heavily involved in Nabucco, the planned pipline linking gas-rich central Asia with south-east Europe that bypasses Russia and is seen by the EU as a more than useful instrument in the battle to reduce dependence on Putin, Gazprom and the other oligarch-run enterprises. Gazprom, it just so happens, has signed a deal with Italy&apos;s state-owned Eni to build a rival \u20ac10bn pipeline running under the Black Sea through Bulgaria and Greece to southern Italy. The pipeline would also undercut Turkey&apos;s plans to transport gas under the Caspian to Europe. MOL suspects that OMV is working hand in glove with Gazprom in its takeover approach while both, meanwhile, have shown interest in South Stream - and are working on Nabucco. Robert Amsterdam, the Canadian international lawyer who was retained by Mikhail Khodorkhovsky, the jailed Yukos chief, has said: &quot;It would be inappropriate to argue that OMV is just another ambassador for Russian interests in Europe but it is clear where the Austrians (who get 80% of their gas from the Russian bear) place their loyalty.&quot; He suspects that OMV and MOL are fighting to be the prime partner of Gazprom in developing its central European hub. Given that the Greeks and the Bulgarians and even the Turks are showing interest in South Stream, it&apos;s pretty obvious that the EU&apos;s drive for a unified energy policy and single market is hardly worth the paper it&apos;s written on in the face of the Kremlin-backed offensive. Seamless rail travel across Europe? Huh! Last week we reported on Railteam, the new high-speed train operators&apos; alliance promising to take on the low-cost airlines and the code-sharing alliance of the international carriers with faster journey times and effortless switching from one network to another. It&apos;s not due until later this decade when the IT systems are in place etc but can&apos;t come a moment too soon for this frequent pan-European traveller. In Paris this week for an interview I managed to reach the Gare du Nord in time to catch an earlier train back to Brussels. Pas possible, monsieur. Nobody available to change the reservation (well, the fraught official simply put up a closed notice as I spoke to her). And the ticket-checker refused to let me (and others) on.

The apparent flurry of activity took place shortly before ABN Amro and Barclays announced on March 19 that they were in exclusive discussions about a tie-up, prompting a tense bidding battle as a consortium led by RBS tabled a rival \u20ac71bn (\u00a348bn) offer. The NYSE declined to comment. But an ABN Amro spokesman in Amsterdam confirmed that an investigation was under way. &quot;We have received an inquiry from the NYSE. They have started an inquiry into the trading of our shares,&quot; said the spokesman. &quot;The inquiry is being conducted as part of the NYSE&apos;s policy of investigating market activity around corporate announcements. We&apos;re fully cooperating.&quot; The NYSE&apos;s monitoring unit uses sophisticated computer models to scrutinise the market for unusual price movements and transactions. When a so-called &quot;red flag&quot; goes up, officials begin a process of piecing together the run-up to the incident. All the parties involved are asked to provide their version of events. If there is evidence of insider trading, the NYSE could take enforcement action against any of its members - brokers, traders or listed companies. The NYSE could also pass evidence to US government authorities including the Securities and Exchange Commission. An average trading day sees about 513,000 of ABN Amro&apos;s ADRs changing hands on Wall Street. But on March 12, the figure spiked up to 2.68m and three days later, it was 1.05m.

How I love that expression. It&apos;s the thought of Alexi Lalas tugging a cord to pull away a billowing chiffon sheet as David is revealed in all his uncomplicated and newly unshaven splendour. Who needs Gillette when you&apos;ve got 125m greenbacks over five years? It will be the equivalent of Beckham&apos;s wee friend Tom Cruise being unveiled as the new male principal of the Driffield and District Gilbert and Sullivan Society. I have been racking my brains for the phrase that best describes Beckham&apos;s place in the American (forgive me) &quot;soccer&quot; firmament and more specifically the LA Galaxy (forgive me) galaxy. He will be . . . a diamond in a dungheap. Sapphire in silage ain&apos;t bad and pearl in a stinking, steaming pile of relative mediocrity is good but it&apos;s not right. D-I-D does it for me. When else has one player&apos;s talent been so massively, inversely proportional to the standard of the rest of the squad; when one man has been so head and shoulders, knees and toes, above anyone else that the ghastly football cliche &quot;different class&quot; is rendered pathetically inadequate? I put the problem out to tender. Some suggested Kenny Dalglish and Scotland. But that&apos;s different. Clearly Derek Parlane and Willie Pettigrew were not Ian Rush and there were times when King Kenny was on a different plane on the pitch and then the same one back home, but was it D-I-D syndrome? With Graeme Souness, Gordon Strachan and Davie Cooper around? I think not. Some suggested Matt Le Tissier. Again there is no comparison to Becks because I have always held to the theory that he craved that comfort zone. The fact that he never left Southampton for a big club was more about insecurity than loyalty. Apparently some attractive women of low self-esteem surround themselves with a gaggle of &quot;mingers&quot;, to use the language of Channel 4. Beckham would love to be playing beautiful football in a gorgeous team but that pig-ugly wedge dictates otherwise. Mitch in Brum was adamant. &quot;Best, Moore and Marsh for Fulham in the 1970s.&quot; No, Mitch. Three gems they most certainly were but the diamond-geezer shtick was an out-and-out novelty act. They were the Marx Brothers, Marsho, Mooro and Wino, delighting us with their madcap patter. But this wasn&apos;t Duck Soup (1933). It was At The Circus (1939). &quot;Some good scenes but not a patch on their best years.&quot; Incidentally, Henrik Larsson and Harpo - are they by any chance related? Some other examples get closer to D-I-D syndrome. Jacki Dziekanowski at Bristol City 1992-93 is a good shout. As Eddie in Gloucester put it: &quot;Polish class amongst carthorses.&quot; But was the chasm gaping or just quite big? An email from Charles Connelly was persuasive. &quot;My team Charlton signed the former European footballer of the year Allan Simonsen from Barcelona in 1982. It was surreal - there he was, this football legend, trying to weave his magic alongside the likes of Terry Bullivant and big Les Berry in a crumbling stadium with about 4,000 diehards huddling together on the terraces watching this genius trying to create brilliant football in the bottom half of the old Second Division.&quot; The textbook case came to me when a Caledonian buddy was talking about one of his badminton shots. &quot;I lobbed him like Zoltan Varga,&quot; he bragged. While others nodded blankly, I got it. A player of phenomenal poise and vision, Varga was a Hungarian genius. He played in the 60s and 70s for Borussia Dortmund, Hertha Berlin and Ajax and today he would cost at least \u00a325m. In 1973, banned from German football for taking bribes to lose matches, he was exiled to Aberdeen for a season. A bit harsh, I know. Thirty-one unforgettable games later and presumably rehabilitated, he went to Amsterdam to replace Cruyff. Diamond in a dungheap? He was the Koh-i-Noor in a khazi of kick and rush. Different class? Different universe. For a Varga scenario to occur in a team sport like football it takes a unique set of circumstances. If you can think of any more let me know but I reckon you&apos;ll have to go a long way to better that one. Los Angeles maybe? London taps refresh parts other waters cannot reach I was worried about the Tour de France being in London given that the city&apos;s water supply is reputedly recycled. If you do live in the capital and have experienced a spring in your step or surge in your libido, now you know why. Those caught with a surfeit of testosterone in their pee have different ways of atoning. Take the Millars. Robert, our greatest touriste, has gone to the other extreme and, according to the Daily Mail, become a woman called Philippa, and David has also remoulded himself dramatically, but as an anti-drugs campaigner. David, who served a two-year ban, said that &quot;cycling is a complete mess at the moment&quot;. Now you might argue that&apos;s like Don Rumsfeld saying &quot;Iraq is a complete mess at the moment&quot; but those in the know assure me David is the real deal. He&apos;s a rare thing - an athlete who, when rumbled, didn&apos;t deny it and now is genuinely and vitally engaged in the war to get drugs out of sport. A valuable member, you might say, of the coalition of the willing. How bad are things? Reluctant to get on my bike, I let my fingers do some crack investigative reporting and discovered that if you Google &quot;Tour de France&quot; and &quot;drugs&quot; you only get 590,000 results whereas &quot;Glastonbury&quot; and &quot;drugs&quot; or &quot;Pete Doherty&quot; and &quot;drugs&quot; yield 654,000 and 620,000 respectively. Could be worse. I spoke to John Scott, director of drug-free sport at UK Sport, and asked if any of the top riders were clean. His answer was extraordinary: &quot;I believe there are a number of the top riders who are clean.&quot; Is it possible to win the Tour clean? &quot;A very good question and I think that is the sort of question that you need to put to the athletes themselves. I think with the proper support, with the proper training, with the kind of medical excellence there is, it can be done.&quot; Has it been done in the last 10 years? &quot;Well, the evidence would clearly suggest that it hasn&apos;t.&quot; Centre Court &apos;jokers&apos; raise the non-existent roof I attended the wonderful Wimbledon men&apos;s final on Sunday and you know those jesters you hear on the telly shouting between points and being rewarded with gales of laughter? Well, the king of comedy was five along from me and the master of mirth just round the corner. They must have left feeling like Richard Pryor after Live at the Apollo. The guy near me scored big with &quot;Rafa, I love you&quot; and &quot;Rafa, you&apos;re an animal&quot; while his rival raised the non-existent roof with &quot;Rafa, will you marry me?&quot; but his pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was, wait for it, &quot;Come on Tim&quot;. People near me were practically wetting themselves at that one and excitedly repeating it to one another.

He is drawing on his American experience, of course, but there are resonances in Britain. I can do no better than reproduce most of his posting, with a couple of views at the end from commenters to his blog. &quot;I think I&apos;ve been thinking about hyperlocal the wrong way. Like most everyone else chasing this golden fleece, I&apos;ve defined it as content, news, a product, listings, data, software, sites, ads. It&apos;s not. Local is people: who knows what, who knows whom, who&apos;s doing what (and, yes, who&apos;s doing whom). The question should be... how we bring them elegant organisation? &quot;They already are a community, already doing what they want to do, already knowing stuff. How can we help them do that better? Local is people. Our job is not to deliver content or a product. Our job is to help them make connections with information and each other.&quot; His following paragraph applies mainly to the US. So let&apos;s pick it up here: &quot;I&apos;m not suggesting that hyperlocal is just a social networking tool. Or just a forum. Or just a bunch of blogs. Or just a listings tool. Or just a search engine. Or just a news site. It needs to end up being all those things and more... The trick, once more, is to organise it all. Elegantly. And this will not happen all on its own. It needs investment, motivation, leadership, shared and distributed ownership.&quot; (I hope owners and managers recognise that key point). Jarvis admits that he is, as yet, uncertain how this will work out in practice but claims: &quot;I&apos;m getting a better idea, I think, by working from a new starting point: People, not content. People, not data. People, not software... &quot;I now believe that he who figures out how to help people organise themselves - letting them connect with each other and with what they all know - will end up with news, listings, reviews, data, gossip, and more as byproducts.&quot; This prompted Rick Waghorn, of Norwich City football website fame, to respond with a supportive comment: &quot;What you&apos;re trying to build, in a way, is a new village hall; a town square; a civic precinct; somewhere for a local community to congregate; then on the walls of that &apos;village hall&apos; you stick up posters from local advertisers; little business people and firms that they recognise - not of out-of-towners. &quot;For your advertisers are, ideally, just as much woven into that community as the familiar faces that walk through the doors of your &apos;village hall&apos;. The trick is to find the passion that inspires them to meet; why they come to congregate in your &apos;precinct&apos; in the first place. And that will come down to trust - because there&apos;s someone there that they trust to impart local, community news. And that person they trust will, to my mind, be a trained, local journalist. Someone they deem to be one of their own.&quot; In other words, Waghorn is extolling the professional virtues of &quot;the journalist&quot; as an organiser of news on behalf of the community. But Amsterdam media adviser Arno Laeven is unconvinced, arguing that people within a small community already communicate. &quot;What is interesting is to find people from your locality when you are on a platform of bigger scale. Example: who in my town is on Facebook? Who in my town posts pictures on Flickr? and so on.&quot; And London-based blogger Patrizia Broghammer is not sure journalists have a central role anyway. She believes that people bypass the intermediary through sites, such as Google, with enough space, bandwidth and software to allow people to do everything for themselves, including making money. She concludes: &quot;The terrible thing is that a 50-year-old journalist will have to compete with a 15-year-old guy who is writing news for a teens&apos; audience. And the drama is that he will very likely lose.&quot; Ah yes, the cult of youth. But I do think the growing belief in hyperlocal media needs much more thought, especially in Britain. We have fractured communities here and there is an urgent need to find some glue.

But what sort of tourists are these drunken mayhem-makers? Rome&apos;s deputy mayor, Maria Pia Garavaglia, is helpfully specific - they&apos;re all from the US and the UK.  Eh?

Let&apos;s play the blame game properly. These drunken barbarians who&apos;re invading the Eternal City - you&apos;re talking about Brits and only Brits, aren&apos;t you? More accurately, you&apos;re talking about young Brits in replica football tops or T-shirts advertising the stag weekend. The ones who have begun to arrive in Rome by the thousand, since the growth of cheap flights to the Italian capital - now arriving at Ciampino airport at the rate of up to 14-a-day from Britain.  Meanwhile, over in Barcelona, controversy is raging over an attempt by the chic and venerable Boadas cocktail bar to ban customers wearing the wrong sort of clothes - ie, not dressed up like your average Catalan in slacks and tasseled loafers with optional sunspecs resting on top of the hair and non-optional pastel-coloured cashmere sweater slung over the shoulders.  T-shirts and baggy shorts are the offending signifiers of the kind of loutish, &quot;low-quality&quot; (ie British) tourists the Boadas bar doesn&apos;t want to have sampling its cocktails.  Alas, this attempt to discriminate on grounds of taste has fallen foul of Spanish law, which protects the fundamental human right of young red-faced British men dressed in identikit stag-party T-shirts to enter whichever Barcelonan cocktail bars they please.  The development is clearly not without controversy or collateral damage, but how heartening it is to learn that our boisterously high-spirited British youth - whose amusing antics have done so much to endear themselves to the locals of Amsterdam, Prague, Dublin, Tallinn and just about every Mediterranean resort outside the French Riviera and Libya - are now venturing even further afield for their stag parties and mini-breaks.  Rome? Barcelona? These were the places for trend-setting weekenders in the 90s. It took a good 20 years for the Costa del Sol to develop from the little fishing villages beloved by the chic and starry - your Sinatras, your Lorens - into the popular package-holiday destination for the unrich and non-famous. Now the whole process has accelerated, taking a mere 10 years for a destination to move from Wallpaper to Nuts.  So where&apos;ll be next on the young Brits&apos; party circuit? Rome, Barcelona ... It&apos;s got to be Bilbao, hasn&apos;t it? Marvellous news for that city&apos;s beleaguered lap-dancing industry and all local suppliers of San Miguel and plastic breasts.

The exciting 20-year-old Holland forward accepted a five-year contract after the Amsterdam club agreed to sell him in a deal worth \u00a311.5m, about \u00a32m less than they originally wanted. West Ham&apos;s Israeli midfielder Yossi Benayoun is expected to follow Babel into Anfield in time to fly out with the squad on Sunday to a training camp before two friendlies in Switzerland, where the record signing Fernando Torres is likely to get his first game. Ben\u00edtez, who has also signed the striker Andriy Voronin from Bayer Leverkusen since the Champions League final defeat in May, has been one of the busiest managers in the market this summer, but Hicks does not expect the spending to stop. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t rule Rafa out for one more [transfer]. I know the team is going to be a better team,&quot; said the American, who with his compatriot George Gillett has helped fund the eye-catching recruitment drive. &quot;Part of the plan Rafa explained was that we needed to have more depth as it is a long season, particularly in the Premier League. &quot;He explained to George and me that we were able to compete better in the Champions League because of the format than we were in the nine to 10 months of the Premier League. We tried to add to that depth and I think we have.&quot; Hicks believes Liverpool&apos;s spending sends out a strong signal to Premiership and European rivals about their intent to win trophies. Only Manchester United have flexed more muscle in the market, although Spurs are pushing them close. &quot;United are always going to be a top side and we just have to compete as best we can,&quot; he added. &quot;Rafa has done a great job. We talked to him about a plan and it has gone pretty much how we agreed it would go. The first was to get existing core players on our team to sign extensions - it was critical to get those guys locked up. Then we started with the process of getting new players in.&quot; Babel, one of the stars of Holland&apos;s European Under-21 championship win last month, is a product of the famed Ajax youth academy and broke into the senior side in the 2003-04 season. He has since scored 14 goals in 73 league games, was picked for Holland&apos;s World Cup squad last summer and is rated as one of the country&apos;s most promising talents. He said he had been won over by Ben\u00edtez&apos;s expectations for the future. &quot;I&apos;ve spoken to Rafa Ben\u00edtez and that was when I knew everything would be signed,&quot; he said. &quot;He has a clear vision of what he wants and said I&apos;d be competing with six others for four positions in the forward line.&quot;", "sentences": ["The exciting 20-year-old Holland forward accepted a five-year contract after the Amsterdam club agreed to sell him in a deal worth \u00a311.5m, about \u00a32m less than they originally wanted."], "title": "Hicks promises more as Reds net \u00a311.5m Babel", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/13/newsstory.sport13", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Tom Hicks"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-13T08:00:00Z", "article": "&quot;Half a million quid, for a three-bed semi in Chingford - it&apos;s madness,&quot; cried my colleague. After five years out of the country, he had just spent a weekend house hunting. This was not a banker transferred to London from Glasgow, or seconded here from Melbourne. Nor was it the despair of a young graduate realising that there was no prospect of escape from a one-bed flat in inner-city muggerland. So where had he been these last five years? Everyone knows that the property market is booming. That the average house price has trebled since the general election of 1997. That affordability is at its lowest since the days before the last slump. That a first-time buyer needs a mortgage of seven times an average income to take the first step on the property ladder. So where had he been these last five years? Even if property is ruinously expensive, and even if there&apos;s a correction after five increases in interest rates in just 10 months, everyone knows you can&apos;t lose money in the long-term. Pensions are a waste of money, stock markets look frothy, and bond markets are tumbling. There&apos;s only one sure-fire, rock-solid investment: the Englishman&apos;s home, his castle, his dream, his passport to untold riches. So where had he been these last five years? What remote part of the world did he inhabit, which impoverished city could make an exiled banker&apos;s eyes water when he came home? Where could he live but yet not know that property goes up for ever? The answer is revealing. It wasn&apos;t Dusseldorf - 45th in the list of world&apos;s most expensive cities. Nor was it Amsterdam, in 25th place. It wasn&apos;t even New York, in 15th place. My colleague, who has travelled the world many times over and thinks half a million quid for a three-bed semi is &quot;madness&quot; has just spent five years... in Tokyo! When land prices peaked in Japan 15 years ago, the land occupied by the Emperor&apos;s Imperial Palace was valued at more than the entire state of California. Analysts could explain that this was normal and that it would continue. Indeed, banks responded with 100-year mortgages to make it &quot;affordable&quot;. After 10 years of economic depression, a series of bank failures and a property collapse, Tokyo is still the world&apos;s fourth most expensive city. The Japanese stock market is at a seven-year high but anyone who bought in 1990 has still lost half their money. Fifty percent down in 17 years is not a great textbook &quot;long-term investment&quot;. All of which brings us back to the UK property market; the greatest &quot;long-term investment&quot; in memory. The memory, that is, of anyone who graduated in the last 15 years. Hardly anyone under 40 years old has ever seen their house-price fall. It couldn&apos;t happen. It&apos;s unimaginable. It&apos;s different this time. It may seem different, but in fact it&apos;s very much the same. In 1989 it was the cost of debt that killed the housing market as the bank base rate hit 14%. I well remember the horror of a letter from the building society announcing an increase in the mortgage rate to 15.6%. Today, the problem is not so much the cost of debt as its sheer quantity. As Dan Atkinson and The Guardian&apos;s Larry Elliot write in their new book, Fantasy Island: &quot;The brooding dark cliff of debt towers over the economy&quot;. That&apos;s debt to finance property, debt to finance consumption, debt even to pay the monthly bills. Let&apos;s take a quick look at the maths of property &quot;madness&quot;. My colleague is lucky. After some years of accumulated housing &quot;equity&quot; before heading east, he could probably put down a \u00a3100,000 deposit. This would just leave him a \u00a3400,000 mortgage to finance. A nice two-year interest-only fixed rate deal at 5.75% comes to \u00a31,916 per month. Add in \u00a3150 for council tax, \u00a3200 for gas, electricity and water, and another \u00a350 for insurance and this average family home costs \u00a32,300 per month. That&apos;s \u00a32,300 per month that must be paid out of take-home pay. At a 40% tax rate, this is gross earnings of \u00a33,800 per month. Each year, this requires a salary of \u00a346,000 - almost twice the average earning - just to pay for a modest place to live in London. Now this back-of-the-envelope calculation is for one of the lucky ones. A family man with a well-paid job, during the biggest boom in the world&apos;s greatest financial centre - the City of London. So that&apos;s \u00a346,000 of salary to buy a three-bedroom semi. And with an interest-only mortgage, the debt is never repaid. In Britain today, this is seen as a great investment. After all, in the long-term you cannot lose money in property. In Japan today, the market is just recovering 17 years after the bubble burst. As the great economist John Maynard Keynes memorably observed, &quot;in the long-term, we are all dead&quot;. In today&apos;s property market, though, the debt may never die.

RBS said it would press ahead with a &quot;superior&quot; offer to Barclays proposed \u00a345bn deal. Earlier in the day Barclays scented victory in its battle to win control of ABN Amro after a court rejected calls for a shareholder vote on the sale of the Dutch bank&apos;s coveted US arm LaSalle. The Dutch supreme court ruled that ABN could sell LaSalle to Bank of America without a vote despite receiving a higher offer from a rival consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland that was based on LaSalle remaining part of the group. The sale of LaSalle was a condition of Barclays&apos; \u00a345bn takeover offer, agreed in April, but was seen as a &quot;poison pill&quot; by some shareholders, who favour the \u00a348bn proposal from RBS. RBS and its consortium partners, Fortis of Belgium and Franco-Spanish bank Santander, were forced back to the drawing board with few options other than to table a revised bid or to walk away from the deal. Analysts said they expected RBS to mount a counter-offer that excluded LaSalle and focus instead on the benefits of acquiring ABN&apos;s wholesale operations and its businesses in the far east. Today RBS said: &quot;This offer will be on materially superior terms to Barclays&apos; proposed offer and will not be conditional upon the sale of LaSalle remaining part of the ABN Amro group.&quot; It added that its offer was also conditional on ABN&apos;s agreement to stop any further sales or acquisitions. A revised bid could pose serious problems for Barclays because RBS is able to offer a larger proportion of the sale price in cash. Barclays offer for ABN is largely a swap for Barclays shares. Analysts expected RBS would match the Barclays value of the ABN business and rely on shareholders preferring its largely cash offer to the shares from Barclays. A bidding war is not expected given the number of cross shareholdings in the banks and the well documented distaste of a few high profile Barclays shareholders for the current offer, which they argue is already too high. Any increase in the offer from Barclays could spark a rebellion by Barclays shareholders, according to several brokers. Hedge funds are also likely to play a key role. More than 40% of ABN&apos;s shares are held by hedge funds, which led Rijkman Groenink, chief executive of ABN Amro, to declare that the bank had become a &quot;toy for hedge funds&quot;. ABN has spent the past year in talks with Barclays and the board is agreed a full takeover would be in the best interests of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. Barclays has agreed, as part of the deal, to move its headquarters to Amsterdam and to cut around 10,000 of its British staff. The RBS offer would result in a three-way split with Fortis and Santander dividing up ABN&apos;s retail operations and RBS getting the international wholesale business and outposts in Asia. Some analysts said ABN&apos;s hedge fund shareholders were more likely to vote in favour of the cash deal offered by the RBS consortium than accept the potential benefits of a union with Barclays. Bear Stearns said RBS would re-bid &quot;promptly to ensure shareholders realise two parties still remain in the bidding war&quot;. Cormac Leech, analyst at Evolution Securities, predicted that the most likely long-term outlook is that the RBS consortium wins ABN without LaSalle. He believes it is likely also to negotiate a side deal with Bank of America on LaSalle to grab back some of the business.

Dendrologists and folklore buffs tell varying versions of Cantre&apos;r Gwaelod and the Sunken Hundred. Allegedly, this once-fertile land and township was lost beneath the waves when the floodgates were left open. Go with it, please, it&apos;s worth it. Treen Cove, Gurnard&apos;s Head, CornwallBest in a storm and only accessible for two hours at low tide, this suddenly sandy beach, like many along this coast, is one big nest of &quot;dinosaur eggs&quot; in black, grey and rose granite, or straight-up basalt. These gorgeous boulders can be rolled into words to make declarations of love to ramblers 100m above, before waves rearrange them in a giant game of scrabble. Check into Cove Cottage and bags the place all to yourself. cornwall-online.co.uk/cove-cottage Findhorn Bay, MorayThis one keeps reeling me back. In deep-sodden winter, the rain from the hills causes chaos as the fresh water collides with salt in a narrow channel at eight knots on a low spring tide. It&apos;s a big bun-fight with salmon going berserk to evade seals, dolphins and circling ospreys. The Black Isle forest and snow-clad Highlands cast a cinematic backdrop across the Moray Firth drama and the pebbles will bring out the kleptomaniac in you. Dancing Ledge, Langton Matravers, DorsetThe limestone cliffs are hogged by climbers, but beneath the grand, abandoned quarry entrance sits the tide-out double whammy. First up, fossils - think Lyme Regis minus the mob of the Cobb. Then there&apos;s the feel-nine-again buzz of a swimming pool carved out of rock. The dancing tag comes romantically from the waves that dance on the floor of this lower ledge.  Seal Cave, Land&apos;s End, CornwallIt takes gallons of charm, beer and tenacity to coax a local seaman into finding this magical den. Only on a super-calm day at low tide can you navigate the Y-shaped cave in a rubberised outboard rig and beach it on the sand at the back where the seals loll about and hark to their bellies content. Peter Duncan filmed there 20 years ago for the BBC. Today, your best bet is to dream, or try marineteamvideo.com Port Luinge, Plockton, ScotlandForget Hamish MacBeth&apos;s town, and mosey a mile or so west to Port Luinge. The \u00fcber-white beach crunches like a carpet of cornflakes, and come low tide, you&apos;ll see why. The sand is made up of bleached coral-like algae called maerl. Before it calcifies, it&apos;s even more beautiful. Wade in and feel (softly, softly) the mauvish-pink fronds, keeping your eyes and toes on red alert for otters. Bulverhythe Beach, between Bexhill and Hastings, East SussexIn 1749 VOC Amsterdam was on its maiden voyage when it hit a Bronze Age forest off Hastings. Today, the wreck resembles a majestic 15m turbot when the spring tide drops. The keel is in A1 condition and rears its perfect butt in line with the railway footbridge at Bulverhythe. Should you find a silver guilder in the 4,000-year-old peat bed, hand it in to lost property at the Hastings Shipwreck Museum.  Church of the Little Ark, Kilbaha, Co ClareIt&apos;s 1852, mid-famine, and cholera is rife in West Clare. Mass is outlawed by bigoted landlords. Fr Meehan builds a church in a shed and wheels down to Kilbaha beach at low tide (no-man&apos;s-land) to bless, marry and baptise. After five years of tidal mass, he gets his church with an equally poetic name: Our Lady, the Star of the Sea. Artist Marie Barrett recreated the ark in 2005 on Pollan Beach, Ballyliffin.donegalpublicart.ie Lydstep Caverns, Pembrokeshire A labyrinth of National Trust-owned coastal caves, west of Tenby, with Smuggler&apos;s Cave the daddy. At low tide, its whale-like corridor runs the length of a football pitch where, fittingly, it belly-flops up on to a grassy sinkhole. There&apos;s even a back door with steps out, if the rising tide hems you in. Next door, the Droch offers up one hell of an echo. The entrance would do a cathedral proud, before it opens out into a 18m chamber, which feels like being inside a very big drum. Take a torch and please, watch the tides. Eccles, the North Sea by NorfolkWhile the people of Happisburgh in Norfolk watch the sea creep closer to their town each year, a few miles south, the old village of Eccles wallows under water. During one very low tide in 1986, the heart of the village was exposed. Like a periscope, the octagonal belfry was first to show, followed by skeletons from the churchyard. A beginner&apos;s guide to beachcombing Whether you&apos;re looking for missing pirate booty or a message in a bottle, Britain&apos;s sandy beaches can offer up a plethora of surprises. Beachcombing, an age-old tradition made popular during the war, was brought back to prominence in January when hordes of people descended on east Devon beaches to capitalise on the shipwrecked MSC Napoli. They made off with everything from BMW motorcycles to furniture, nappies to crockery. However the Maritime and Coastal Agency warned that all items must be reported to the Receiver of Wreck, who will try to contact the legal owner of the property.  While you can&apos;t depend on shipwrecks all the time, the sand still throws up treasure: all you need is a keen eye. Brian Grove, who wrote The Treasure Hunters&apos; Handbook, advises: &quot;Search all entry points to the beach, promenade steps, car park access areas etc. Finds will become trapped around man-made structures. Rocks and rockpools are also coin and jewellery traps.&quot; And the best beaches to scavenge? &quot;Beaumaris, Blackpool, Broadstairs.&quot;  Beachcombing is a fun, free and easy activity for children, too. Let&apos;s not forget it was Disney&apos;s Little Mermaid who made beachcombing &quot;cool&quot; when she found the dingle hopper (fork). To give kids a taste, look out for events such as &quot;Walk Beneath the Waves&quot; at Dawlish Warren in Devon on Oct 28 - an exploration of beachcombing and a wildlife adventure to boot.

The reef starts at 7m and drops down to 70m. Visibility is usually around 8m-12m (20m on a good day) and the sealife is fantastic.  Lusitania, Old Head of KinsaleOne of the most famous wrecks in the world. The ocean liner, built in 1907, was torpedoed by a German U-boat in 1915 and sank within 18 minutes, killing 1,298 of the 1,959 people on board. It stands eight miles from Old Head of Kinsale in Cork at a depth of 93m. Most of the 238m-long vessel is collapsed but there is still plenty to see. Rumours abound about the cargo - of contraband, jewellery and even Old Masters paintings, which caused the Irish government to ban diving there altogether in 1995. Ten years later, the American adventurer Gregg Bemis finally won a legal battle to mount explorative dives on what remains a relatively untouched wreck. M1 and M2 submarines, English ChannelThese British M-class submarines were built in the first world war with the firepower of a battleship, but failed to do any damage before both sinking in the English Channel. M1 collided with a Norwegian minelayer in 1925 near Start Point in Devon, and was only located by seasoned wreck finder Innes McCartney in 1999. The wreck lies at 75m, but its exact position is kept secret to try to prevent souvenir hunters (as a war grave, it is covered by the protection of the Military Remains Act and should not be entered or interfered with). M2 was converted to a seaplane carrier in 1925, sank in 1933 off Chesil Beach in Dorset, and is also classified a war grave. Perfectly intact and at a maximum depth of 30m, this a very popular dive. The Smalls, off PembrokeshireThis rocky reef, 18 miles west of Skomer Island (a marine reserve), is full of gullies and canyons perfect for exploring the abundant sealife. The visibility here can get over 25m, and the area has many wrecks too, including the 86m-long Cambro steamship which, sitting at 12m-22m, is a really good exploration for novice and experienced divers alike.  Scapa Flow, Orkney IslandsThis mighty natural harbour formed an important base in both world wars and now provides a relatively weather-protected spot to dive. Several German world war one battleships were scuttled in 1919 after the armistice; seven large warships and four destroyers remain on the seabed, although at a depth accessible only to seasoned divers. But there are also some first and second world war blockships lying in 10m-15m of water here. Isles of ScillyA diving haven with more than 3,000 recorded shipwrecks and superior underwater visibility. Most divers will visit the hefty Hathor and Plympton wrecks just south of St Agnes. Another popular site is the immense Torrey Canyon, one of the first supertankers which sparked an environmental disaster when it wrecked and was deliberately sunk in 1967. Aeolian Sky, DorsetThis Greek freighter collided with another ship in fog in 1979 and sank 12 miles from the Isle of Portland in 9m of water. Although subject to salvage work and explosions to move it, much of the ship is intact.  Farne Islands, NorthumberlandOne of the most dangerous shipping areas around Britain has hundreds of wrecks that can be explored even by less experienced divers, although most are broken up. The most impressive is the Somali, a passenger-cargo steamer sunk in 1941 after being bombed by a German Heinkel 111. The wreck sits upright in 30m of water, and much of the hull is intact. The 5,000 grey seals inhabiting the Farne Islands year-round are also breathtaking to watch under water.  P555, DorsetThis American-built submarine, supplied to the British navy during WWII, was scuttled near Portland as a sonar target in 1947 (the Americans just didn&apos;t want it back). Sitting upright at a depth of 32m, it has a vast 72m hull and four distinctive torpedo tubes on the bow.  Rewa, CornwallThis world war one hospital ship was torpedoed near Padstow without warning in 1918, providing powerful anti-German propaganda. Divers had been investigating the much searched-for site since 2003, but it took until April 2004 to prove the 139m-long ship&apos;s identity. It is now laying upright at a depth of 60m, and is suitable only for experienced divers.  ... and Britain&apos;s most famous shipwrecks From Goodwin Sands to the Shetlands, our coast has swallowed legendary ships with vast riches. 1: Mary RoseHenry VIII&apos;s beloved warship sank in the Solent in 1545 while engaging a French fleet. Raised in 1982, the Mary Rose is the largest archaeological excavation ever attempted: more than 25,000 artefacts were recovered, including woollen hats and backgammon boards. 2: Merchant RoyalThe estimated \u00a3250m-worth of booty landed to date is said to be the largest ever treasure haul. This 1641 wreck&apos;s American salvage crew has (amid great secrecy) raised 15 tonnes of loot with remote-controlled submarines - and there&apos;s more to come. 3: AmsterdamThe best-preserved ship of the Dutch East India Company sank off Hastings in 1749. The wreck was located 220 years later after being exposed by a fortuitously low spring tide; 27 chests of silver coins were recovered. 4: RooswijkThis Dutch East India ship sank in the ships&apos; graveyard that is Goodwin Sands in 1739. Discovered and secretly excavated in 2005, the booty included 1,000 silver bars and a jar of mustard. 5: Stirling CastleThis 70-gun British man-of-war sank on Goodwin Sands in the Great Storm of 1703, and re-emerged (thanks to the sands&apos; shifting nature) in 1979 and 2002 to reveal bronze cannons, textiles and shoes. 6: GironaThis greatest haul of Spanish Armada treasure (more than 1,000 gold, silver and bronze coins) was discovered in 1967, the ship having sunk in 1588 at Lacada Point in County Antrim. 7: Trinidad ValenceraThis Spanish Armada vessel went down at almost the same time in Kinnegoe Bay, County Donegal, taking bronze cannons and textiles with it. 8: El Gran GrifonThe flagship of the Armada&apos;s supply squadron was wrecked on Fair Isle following a fatal encounter with, it is thought, Sir Francis Drake&apos;s ship, Revenge. Discovered in 1970 with bronze guns and ammunition.  9: KennermerlandThis richly laden Dutch East India ship sank in 1664 off the Shetlands, was discovered in 1971 and excavated over 25 years. Booty included five golf clubs and some perfectly preserved peppercorns. 10: HollandiaDiscovered in 1971, this Dutch East India vessel sank west of the Isles of Scilly in 1743 with more than 3,500 artefacts including silver coins.", "sentences": ["3: AmsterdamThe best-preserved ship of the Dutch East India Company sank off Hastings in 1749."], "title": "10 scuba diving sites", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/jul/14/beach.uk17", "tags": ["Travel", "Beach holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Cornwall holidays", "Ireland holidays", "Scotland holidays", "Dorset holidays"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-14T22:46:11Z", "article": "I have sand between my toes, a cooling drink in my hand and as I recline on the pile of inflatable tyres, I can hear trains rumble past somewhere above my head. I am in a deranged Wild West village that looks as if it has been dropped from a great height on to a beach, with potted palms and AC/DC hollering out from the DJ booth. Before Paris got its Plage and London, Amsterdam and even Birmingham jumped on the sandwagon, there was Berlin. A former swamp 150 miles from the sea, the German capital perfected inland beach culture about 95 years before other landlocked cities. And as parks and squares across Europe are hurriedly transformed into artificial beaches this summer, Berlin is really pushing the boat out. A mongrel country-and-western style beach, bar and play area, Strandmarkt is one of 30 beaches that have sprung up in Berlin. This stretch of sand is more than a little crazy. It&apos;s almost as bonkers as taking a beach holiday in a European capital miles from the coast. The only thing that isn&apos;t balmy is the weather. My Australian companion is sceptical. Australians don&apos;t need to build beaches and they don&apos;t understand those who do. Unfortunately, on our first evening in Berlin, the rain-lashed deckchairs of the first urban beach we visit - bizarrely billed as boasting wonderful views of Berlin&apos;s new railway station at sunset - look as hapless as an out-of-season English seaside resort. The following day is also a washout. But it&apos;s here that the advantages of a holiday in a real city with fake beaches (as opposed to the usual fake city on a real beach) hit home. Our hotel&apos;s chic grey minimalism and amazing breakfasts (served until a very civilised 1pm on Sunday) are perfect for a grey day, as are Berlin&apos;s museums, most notably, Daniel Libeskind&apos;s striking, disturbing Jewish museum. Then there&apos;s the added bonus of Germany&apos;s superstar polar bear, Knut, who looks deliriously content when cool rain falls on the city&apos;s zoo. Beach weather threatens to break out by the second evening and a stroll to Strandbar Mitte on the edge of Monbijou Park in the city centre reveals why Berlin does beaches so well. Where in Britain could you arrive at 9.30pm on a Saturday and get a drink and a seat straight away? Where in Ibiza could you instantly plonk yourself on a chair right by the water? Forget the stereotypes about the race for the sun-loungers; in Berlin, there&apos;s a deckchair for everyone. Rumpled like a trendy haircut, yet blessed with that German talent for order, Berlin boasts incredible space. Vast tracts of the city still lie in undeveloped, post-industrial ruins - the legacy of its painful cold war division. Much is the kind of desolate riverside which became London&apos;s Docklands 20 years ago. It&apos;s perfect beach-building territory. Inland beaches probably began with the Wannseebad, a traditional lakeside bathing spot out in the suburbs beyond Berlin&apos;s Grunewald forest that celebrates its 100th anniversary this summer after a long programme of refurbishment. But Strandbar Mitte was the first modern urban beach to open in the centre of Berlin. It first scattered the sand in 2002 (the same year as the more celebrated Paris Plage). This summer, it offers a thick carpet of proper beach sand, palm trees and cosy Strandkorben (literally, &quot;beach baskets&quot;), the traditional German two-seater beach chairs. A twentysomething crowd hunker down against the evening chill, although the caipirinha served up at the attractive bar shack delivers a warming kick. My companion wriggles her toes on the chilly beach, perplexed. &quot;Where I come from the sand is warm,&quot; she observes. It is, at least, scenic: swifts dart over the river Spree and the handsome walls of the Bode museum opposite are dappled with light bouncing off the water. Strandbar Mitte is also impressively - but not oppressively - well organised. The beach toilets are clean (they always are) and all drinkers pay a deposit on their glasses and bottles, which means they return them to the bar rather than leaving them scattered in the sand. The neighbouring beaches in the centre of Berlin, such as Bundespresse Strand and Beach Park 61, are similarly well put together, offering drinks, music and plenty of beach volleyball (place your 2012 Olympic bets on the Germans now). But what sets Berlin apart from other cities is its proliferation of independent beaches. Most European urban beaches are little more than overcrowded corporate stages, while many of Berlin&apos;s beaches are the summer siblings of its underground club scene. The sun shines on Sunday, and we head for the grittier beaches on the banks of the Spree near the Ostbahnhof railway station. This is where you can relax in the Wild West chaos of Strandmarkt, devised on an old recycling centre by the two men behind the cult Berlin nightclub White Trash Fast Food. One of them, Walter, is mixing a formidable Bloody Mary at the bar.  What makes a great urban beach? &quot;Three hundred tonnes of sand and a will to have a cocktail,&quot; he smirks. &quot;The drive to sit on the beach and have a cocktail is definitely strong in Berlin.&quot; Most beachgoers here are locals who arrive on bicycles to tuck into a &quot;hangover breakfast&quot;, play ping-pong or collapse into loungers under parasols surrounded by Wild West shacks and Chinese lanterns. Beaches are supposed to have sand, but that hasn&apos;t stopped Brighton - or Bar 25, next door to Strandmarkt. Tucked away behind a slice of the Berlin Wall, Bar 25 is a stretch of decking by the River Spree and a wooden bar that creaks to the thud of German techno. A glitter ball hangs from a poplar tree and lines of lights dance above. It stays open from Saturday night until Monday morning, (with more usual opening hours during the week). Shortly after midday on Sunday, its skinny jean-clad crowd look like they will be partying well into next week. While the odd tourist finds its door in the wall, Bar 25 remains the kind of underground club for which Berlin is famed. &quot;At night it all becomes a little crazy and that&apos;s what we like,&quot; says Kathinka, who runs the bar area. This isn&apos;t a beach for sunning yourself and sipping expensive cocktails, although if 48-hour clubbing marathons sound too energetic, the club also shows underground movies, has a fine-dining restaurant with views across the river and plans to offer sauna and massage. After a couple of hours in the sun, the murky waters of the Spree seem increasingly alluring. But even the hardcore clubbers of Bar 25 rarely plunge into the river. Instead, they use the Badeschiff, a huge old industrial barge converted into a swimming pool (and sauna in winter) and moored on the left bank. Beside it there is a bar, another beach and a wooden jetty, perfect for sunbathing. The pool is a 20-metre oblong of clear blue water on the dark waters of the Spree. Despite an entrance hidden away at the back of a maze of old tram sheds, Badeschiff is the busiest of the beaches but still perfect to bob about in on a Sunday afternoon. Serious swimmers arrive at 8am on weekdays. Ostrand also has an old boat moored on the river for sunbathers, although this one has no pool. Surrounded by more commercial beach bar operations - such as the fancy white leather of Strandgut beach bar and the pumping techno of Space Beach - it retains a homely feel with olive trees in pots, wood-fired pizza and a good mix of twenty and thirtysomethings and young families. Real or fake, the best kind of beach is the sort that you have to tear yourself away from at the end of the day, gritty and giddy from sunshine and the odd bottle of passion fruit beer. Yaam beach has this effect. Set up by a social worker in 1996, Yaam is a slice of the Caribbean in Berlin - it&apos;s not a tacky themed beach, but a real focal point for some of the city&apos;s immigrant communities with hip-hop, reggae and ragga gigs as well as basketball and volleyball for the teens who hang out here. &quot;The idea is not, &apos;let&apos;s have a beach and drink cocktails&apos;. It&apos;s a youth project. We want to bring people from different backgrounds together in a harmonious way,&quot; explains Lea Varnbuler, one of Yaam&apos;s managers. This not-for-profit beach sounds worthy, but it&apos;s as fun and sandy as a beach should be. Set behind a graffitied slab of the Berlin Wall, you can swing in a hammock overlooking the river, as the sound of reggae drifts from the bar. The cocktail list is long and cheap - mojitos and mai tais are less than \u20ac5 - and there is also the peculiar charm of Dju Dju, a bottled beer from Ghana that comes in mango, banana, palm or passion fruit flavours. I&apos;m happy in my hammock but, sadly, it can&apos;t last forever. Berlin&apos;s property boom and rapid redevelopment is squeezing out some of the best underground beaches. Mainstream beaches like Strandbar Mitte will endure, but by next summer, the only sand on the banks of the River Spree may be for the foundations of office blocks and luxury apartments. &quot;It&apos;s like any city - the gentrification happens at a really high pace,&quot; says White Trash&apos;s Walter. Lea Varnbuler, from Yaam, also sees clouds on the horizon. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of art and underground lifestyles in Berlin. They still exist now, but I don&apos;t know whether they will much longer because the policy is to tidy up the city.&quot; And at Bar 25, Kathinka fears their days are numbered. &quot;We don&apos;t know if this is going to be the last year. The owner of the property wants to sell it,&quot; she says. &quot;We&apos;re fighting it because we think this is underground culture, which is really important for Berlin.&quot; Getting there Air Berlin (0871 5000737, airberlin.com) flies Stansted-Berlin from \u20ac94 return.

Local hunters speak of massive creatures that seem to be some sort of hybrid between a chimp and a gorilla. Their location at the centre of one of the bloodiest conflicts on the planet, the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has meant that the mystery apes have been little studied by western scientists. Reaching the region means negotiating the shifting fortunes of warring rebel factions, and the heart of the animals&apos; range is deep in impenetrable forest. But despite the difficulties, a handful of scientists have succeeded in studying the animals. Early speculation that the apes may be some yeti-like new species or a chimp/gorilla hybrid proved unfounded, but the truth has turned out to be in many ways even more fascinating. They are actually a population of super-sized chimps with a unique culture - and it seems, a taste for big cat flesh. The most detailed and recent data comes from Cleve Hicks, at the University of Amsterdam, who has spent 18 months in the field watching the Bili apes - named after a local town - since 2004. His team&apos;s most striking find came after one of his trackers heard chimps calling for several days from the same spot. When he investigated he came across a chimp feasting on the carcass of a leopard. Mr Hicks cannot be sure the animal was killed by the chimp, but the find lends credence to the apes&apos; lion-eating reputation. &quot;What we have found is this completely new chimpanzee culture,&quot; said Mr Hicks. Previously, researchers had only managed to snatch glimpses of the animals or take photos of them using camera traps. But Mr Hicks used local knowledge to get closer to them and photograph them. &quot;We were told of this sort of fabled land out west by one of our trackers who goes out there to fish,&quot; said Mr Hicks whose project is supported by the Wasmoeth Wildlife Foundation. &quot;I call it the magic forest. It is a very special place.&quot; Getting there means a gruelling 40km (25-mile) trek through the jungle, from the nearest road, not to mention navigating croc-infested rivers. But when he arrived he found apes without their normal fear of humans. Chimps near the road flee immediately at the sight of people because they know the consequences of a hunter&apos;s rifle, but these animals were happy to approach him. &quot;The further away from the road the more fearless the chimps got,&quot; he added. Mr Hicks reports that he found a unique chimp culture. For example, unlike their cousins in other parts of Africa the chimps regularly bed down for the night in nests on the ground. Around a fifth of the nests he found were there rather than in the trees. &quot;How can they get away with sleeping on the ground when there are lions, leopards, golden cats around as well as other dangerous animals like elephants and buffalo?&quot; said Mr Hicks. &quot;I don&apos;t like to paint them as being more aggressive, but maybe they prey on some of these predators and the predators kind of leave them alone.&quot; He is keen to point out though that they don&apos;t howl at the moon. &quot;The ground nests were very big and there was obviously something very unusual going on there. They are not unknown elsewhere but very unusual,&quot; said Colin Groves, an expert on primate morphology at the Australian National University in Canberra who has observed the nests in the field. Prof Groves believes that the Bili apes should prompt a radical rethink of the family tree of chimp sub-species. He has proposed that primatologists should now recognise five different sub-divisions instead of the current four. Mr Hicks said the animals also have what he calls a &quot;smashing culture&quot; - a blunt but effective way of solving problems. He has found hundreds of snails and hard-shelled fruits smashed for food, seen chimps carrying termite mounds to rocks to break them open and also found a turtle that was almost certainly smashed apart by chimps. Like chimp populations in other parts of Africa, the Bili chimps use sticks to fish for ants, but here the tools are up to 2.5 metres long. The most exciting thing about this population of chimps though is that it is much bigger than anyone realised and may be one of the largest remaining continuous populations of the species left in Africa. Mr Hicks and his colleague Jeroen Swinkels surveyed an area of 7,000 square kilometres and found chimps everywhere. Their unique culture was uniform throughout. However, the future for the Bili apes is far from secure. &quot;Things are not promising,&quot; said Karl Ammann, an independent wildlife photographer who began investigating the apes 1996. &quot;The absence of a strong central government has resulted in most of the region becoming more independent and lawless. In conservation terms this is a disaster.&quot;", "sentences": ["The most detailed and recent data comes from Cleve Hicks, at the University of Amsterdam, who has spent 18 months in the field watching the Bili apes - named after a local town - since 2004."], "title": "Found: the giant lion-eating chimps of the magic forest", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jul/14/conservation.internationalnews", "tags": ["Science", "Environment", "Conservation", "World news", "Primatology"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-14T23:08:06Z", "article": "Katie Hopkins, Apprentice finalistCrete and Cornwall I&apos;m going to Crete next week with my wonderful man, Mark.

We will enjoy lazy mornings followed by equally lazy lunches, time with books and time writing, and the odd thrash about on the tennis court and cycling in the hills. Then I&apos;ll be going with all my family to Cornwall, which is my first true love. My family are Cornish and I spent virtually every childhood holiday on my uncle&apos;s farm, generally getting in the way of all things agricultural and living the outdoor life. I have fond memories of long days on the beach with sandy cucumber sandwiches and rides on the hay trailer in the days when Health and Safety were but a twinkle in some bureaucrat&apos;s eye. We stay in fabulous St Ives, where my family have taken the same apartment overlooking the harbour for years. My two- and three-year-old will stay with Grandma and Grandpa, and Mark and I will stay nearby. It will be one big jolly round of sea air, pasties, walks on the coast and sandcastles. As a couple we can enjoy the galleries, pub gardens, sauvignon blanc, great restaurants and runs along the cliffs.

It has just one little house, and when we bought it seven years ago it was a complete wreck. That&apos;s why we got it so cheap. It cost \u00a395,000, so we managed to buy the island, and the boat we live in on the Thames, for less than a one-bed flat in London. We spent four years doing up the house with friends who are builders. It is attached to a lighthouse which is solar-powered and is where the lighthouse keeper&apos;s family used to live. It can get pretty wild in winter - the house is 300ft up, but the spray can go over the roof. We go for six weeks every summer. Throughout the year I judge everything around how long it is till we&apos;re on the island. What&apos;s so nice is that there&apos;s no telephone, no emails, no other people. We drive to the marina, where we load up the Rib (a fast, semi-inflatable boat) with all the food, the kids - Jesse, who&apos;s four and Marmaduke, one - and everything we need, then trog six-and-a-half miles over to the island. What I find so hard about my work life and my filming life is that I&apos;m away from my family so much. Even when I&apos;m home it can be mad, with constant meetings, so what&apos;s so precious about this is that it&apos;s literally just us, no meetings, no nothing. We swim and mess around and climb and fall asleep in the hammocks and have barbecues and curl up and hide from the rain when it&apos;s wet - and I love it. It&apos;s just everything wild and cosy and family that motivates me in my life, so it has it all. Most days we&apos;ll do boat trips. It&apos;s a really fast Rib and if it&apos;s calm I can do the journey back to the mainland in 15 minutes, so I often do a run just to get a load of nice doughnuts - there&apos;s a lovely bakery near the marina. The nice thing is that all that area of coast is National Trust land, so we&apos;ll explore and find coves for picnics. But we also use the boat to water-ski, and we have a little canoe for messing around in. Jesse has been obsessed by skydiving, camping, climbing, everything adventurous, since he was six months old. We climb together, and I&apos;ve taken him paragliding. Simon, my cameraman, finds it hysterical that he&apos;s a mini version of me. It&apos;s wild, there are sea cliffs for climbing, dolphins and seals - it&apos;s my complete heaven.

We&apos;ll go out for one meal when we&apos;re there but we enjoy being at home so much more. We have a wood oven and each year we roast a whole pig in it and there&apos;s a ravioli festa in the village and a very good market in Montepulciano. About this time of year I try to make up a calendar of who&apos;s coming and going but it&apos;s a constant flow of people. We have five children so they come, as well as my family from the US. And it&apos;s a chance to see our friends; this year Rose [Grey, who co-owns the River Cafe] is going to come over so we can start work on our next book, which is going to be a classic Italian cook book.

I visited four years ago and they have since constructed the most extraordinary open-air spa where all the herbs that are necessary grow by the side of the beds and are picked by the attendants and rubbed into you. It has a tent a couple of miles away in the desert which is accessible only by horse, and also a very chic, very urban residential club in the middle of the souk in Marrakesh where you can seek respite from all the noisy shopping going on around you.

Zaha Hadid, architectIstanbul Istanbul is my favourite summer destination. It looks very old, but is also very modern at the same time: you never know what to expect around the corner. Istanbul now has a branch of Harvey Nichols and a shopping mall but also the Grand Bazaar, and ancient architecture. The city has a great energy. I gain a good deal of inspiration for my projects.  It&apos;s a unique, visually stunning, historical city that will never lose its long-term appeal. The first visit was with my family and we did the full tour, the Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque and island of Buyukada, where my cousins and I piled into a donkey cart that took us to the Aya Yorgi church and monastery. I have favourite restaurants all over the city, from Venge, a chic kebab house in the business district, to Pandeli, a historic turquoise-tiled institution on the upper floor of the Spice Market.

Andy Mcnab, authorSwitzerland There are two trips this year. The first is when I go to Switzerland on a freefall parachuting trip. I have been into the sport since I learnt to freefall in the SAS and to date I&apos;ve made over 1,300 jumps. This time it will be all about jumping into restricted Drop Zones. The Swiss are experts at this. Their emergency services need to be experienced, as they regularly have to drop into tiny clearings in the middle of a forest, or land on minute plateaux on mountain tops. The second trip is a 3,000km cross-country motorbike race across South Africa. I have been riding bikes since I stole my brother&apos;s and crashed when I was 11. I am riding with the Ducati team. Everyone keeps calling it a &apos;trip&apos; but we all know they mean &apos;race&apos;.

Fay Ripley, actressCenter Parcs Since I&apos;ve had children, I&apos;ve become a convert to Center Parcs, so that&apos;s on the agenda. Initially it was like entering a Canadian religious sect, full of pine trees and people on bicycles waving at you, but it&apos;s a much more aesthetic experience with more nature than I had originally imagined. Of course, ultimately you are staying in prefabs in a pretend world, but it&apos;s a really nice pretend world, with log cabins that have flatscreen TVs and barbecues, as well as welcome hampers with organic food in them.  There are all these activities you can do - like fencing, or archery, although pootling off for a treatment at the spa is about as intense as I get. You do actually need a bicycle because there&apos;s a lot of ground to cover. On our last visit, we had an eight-month-old, a three-year-old and a four-year-old and we put them in these trollies that latched on to the back of the bikes and they were in heaven. Luckily, it&apos;s almost completely flat which is handy, because I don&apos;t like the idea of bicycles and hills.  Above all, everyone&apos;s very nice.

Peter Stringfellow, nightclub ownerMallorca My fiancee and I usually spend the summer at our villa in Mallorca - our dogs are there, our boat is in Ibiza and we like the heat. We don&apos;t go near clubs, or even the beach really - although Bella and I do go out to eat, especially at Di Benedetto, just south of Palma. It&apos;s owned by an English-Italian family and the food is exquisite. But actually this summer, we might go to the US. It&apos;ll be a working holiday, though. We&apos;ll start in New York, go to a few clubs there, then head down to Las Vegas for the Adult Entertainment Convention. I&apos;ve never been and it&apos;s about time I popped in and took a look at it. We might also spend some time in Miami before going to see my daughter.

Tim Moore, travel writerIceland Our annual trip to Iceland is almost a pilgrimage, a bulwark of my in-laws&apos; determination to expose absentee demi-Viking grandchildren to their motherland. In unfortunate reality, an army of blond cousins regard our visits as a chance to finesse their own MTV English. The only extension to my youngest daughter&apos;s vocabulary last summer was &apos;Ew&apos;. A balmy summer evening in the world&apos;s most northerly capital might be imagined as one where you forget to wear gloves, but make it home with the bulk of your fingertips intact. But we&apos;ve sunbathed at 10.30pm, and in August 2004 the mercury hit a record 24.8C. The midnight sun engenders an extraordinary sort of anti-hibernation. Unattended young children play in the street at midnight, and grumpy great uncles blossom into 24-hour party people. From the all-night teenage bacchanalia downtown to the 3am suburban barbecue, the Nordic summer is a round-the-clock civic celebration of life. The in-laws run a rural summerhouse - a two-floor festival of pine plonked between a lake and a lava field an hour east of Reykjavik. These days, though, we&apos;re usually invited to Gr\u00f6f, a remote farmhouse they have been renovating. Boasting all the high-octane thrills you&apos;d expect from a place that translates as &apos;grave&apos;, Gr\u00f6f is a tough sell to offspring whose combined nirvana would be an intergalactic branch of Claire&apos;s Accessories staffed by robo-hobbits.

There are also doubts over the company&apos;s medium-term growth prospects.   The Dutch group, which is offloading significant stakes in semi-conductors to concentrate on high-margin businesses such as medical systems, said net profit rose fivefold to \u20ac1.6bn because of a \u20ac1.2bn gain from selling shares in Taiwan Semiconductor. But overall sales fell 4.4% to \u20ac6.1bn because of the soaring euro.   Pierre-Jean Sivignon, chief financial officer, said Philips planned to reduce its 33% stake in LG Philips, its flat-screen joint venture with its Korean partner, to below 20% this year, releasing more cash for acquisitions and buy-backs. But Taiwan&apos;s Hon Hail denied reports it would buy the stake.   The Amsterdam-based group, the world&apos;s biggest maker of electric shavers, admitted that consumer electronic sales were down 11% on a year earlier, with earnings flat at \u20ac22m or a 1% margin - compared with \u20ac151m at medical and \u20ac150m at lighting.   Philips, which is leading an EU-wide drive to switch to greener products, said it was on track to achieve its targets of pre-tax profits of 7.5% sales and 5-6% average annual revenue growth.   It said it expected an upturn in second-half sales growth, boosted by strong orders of scanners on the medical side, and also by green lightbulbs.   Gerard Kleisterlee, chief executive, said: &quot;It is encouraging to see that the increase in profitability we achieved was driven over a broad front - lower central costs and improved results at our high margin businesses, based on their strong market positions and the overall strength of our business models.&quot;   But the shares fell 1% in early trading as analysts cast doubt over the viability of the group&apos;s transformation from a cyclical to a growth-orientated business.

The music is thudding out, skinny-jeaned students are edging their way on to the dancefloor, and the bar staff are run off their fashionably attired feet. Only one thing is peculiar about this event. The entity whose birthday is being celebrated tonight isn&apos;t a person. It&apos;s a typeface. People have been pouring into the building all evening to attend the Dutch premiere of a biopic with a difference, a documentary about the life of a font, Helvetica, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. You may not know the name, but you&apos;ll almost certainly know the face: Helvetica, the typographic identity of Orange and Muji, of British Gas and US Mail, of United Van Lines as well as the United Nations, is probably the most popular font in existence. Even so, isn&apos;t a special birthday bash in its honour a little, well, extreme? The film&apos;s creator and director Gary Hustwit, a small-set, close-cropped 42-year-old, smiles at my incredulity. &quot;Oh, that was nothing,&quot; he grins when we meet for lunch the next day. &quot;In Zurich, which was the European premiere, they brought out a huge cake and 800 people sang happy birthday.&quot; Really? &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; he says, chewing thoughtfully on his burger. &quot;And when we showed the film in Philadelphia there was a giant H made out of Swiss cheese.&quot; If Hustwit looks chuffed, it&apos;s easy to understand why. His first attempt at a full-length documentary, shot on a credit-card budget and made up of interviews with designers and typographers, has somehow become a global phenomenon. Since March, when the film premiered in Austin, Texas, it has been shown in cities from Auckland to Vancouver, Cologne to Santa Fe, and new dates are being added almost daily. Released in time for Helvetica&apos;s 50th anniversary, it&apos;s been screened at Zurich&apos;s Helvetica50 celebrations and also at a commemorative exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The film will hit Britain at Oxford&apos;s Britdoc festival later this month, with a three-week run at London&apos;s ICA slated for early September. On the face of it, such demand seems hard to explain. Typography, the art of crafting letters, numerals and symbols and arranging them in communicable patterns, is among the more recondite and poorly understood aspects of design. Most of us comprehend what it is architects and engineers do each day, just as we&apos;re used to grappling with the applied design that rules our daily lives, whether it&apos;s the shape of a kettle or the operation of a photocopier. But about typographic design, whether good or bad, we&apos;re clueless. Design a building and it&apos;s headline news. Design some text and barely anyone notices. For all that, typography is ubiquitous. We require text, text requires form, form requires design. Since the invention of the printing press, the stuff has been everywhere. The idea for the film came, Hustwit says, when he was wandering the streets of New York, observing the way urban and typographic design collide and collude. &quot;I was walking around, looking at the type and the way people interacted with it, and I just saw the whole film in my head. I wanted to do a documentary about graphic design, and I thought - well, Helvetica is the most ubiquitous typeface in our lives, why not that?&quot; In one of the film&apos;s most brilliant sequences, one of Hustwit&apos;s interviewees, the writer Lars M\u00fcller, takes a similar stroll around London, a city that, it turns out, is nearly as full of Helvetica as New York. Pointing gleefully at traffic signs, shopfronts and notices that &quot;Posters Will Be Prosecuted,&quot; M\u00fcller pays tribute to what elsewhere he has called &quot;the shift worker and solo entertainer of typefaces&quot;, the font that moonlights on the glossiest of corporate identities as well as the scummiest of homemade signs. If you can&apos;t think what Helvetica looks like, glance around you: chances are it&apos;s somewhere in your field of vision, whether whistling past on the television news or staring out at you from the local dry cleaners. (Though no longer does it star on the pages of this newspaper - after 17 years&apos; service, the font was retired in 2005, when the Berliner format was launched, and replaced by Guardian Egyptian.) Nor is Helvetica confined to the western alphabet: a Cyrillic version now exists, as do variants in Greek and Chinese. It is, I am slowly beginning to comprehend, the world&apos;s font. For all that, and as the film reveals, Helvetica is indelibly associated with the country whose Latin name it pays tribute to: Switzerland, where a new movement in graphic design first took root in the 1950s. Energised by advances in typesetting technology, Swiss designers were hungry for typefaces embodying the principles of modernism - clean, crisp, neutral - and type foundries reciprocated with a wave of fresh designs. One of the first was Univers, an austere but elegant sans-serif face drawn up by Adrian Frutiger that appeared in 1956. It became an instant classic, its 14 different weights, ultrathin to \u00fcber-bold, painstakingly numbered to offer technicians greater flexibility. Univers was followed just a year later by a rival typeface designed by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffman of the Haas foundry in M\u00fcnchenstein - the working drawings for which, annotated with Hoffman&apos;s pencil adjustments, appear in the film. Their new font was initially christened Neue Haas Grotesk but rapidly renamed Helvetica - a last-minute publicity decision that had far-reaching ramifications. Marketed as a symbol of cutting-edge Swiss technology, Helvetica went global almost at once. One man at the heart of this revolution was Massimo Vignelli, the Italian-American designer who used Helvetica for an iconic American Airlines logo in 1966, distilling the company&apos;s forward-looking philosophy so brilliantly that it has remained unchanged ever since. Hustwit managed to interview Vignelli, and like the other typographers and technicians he spoke to, found him passionate about the social significance of his craft. &quot;The life of a designer is a life of fight, fight against ugliness,&quot; Vignelli exclaims at one point in the film, &quot;just like a doctor fights against disease.&quot; Small wonder that when he came to develop a new identity for the signage of New York&apos;s ailing subway system in the early 1970s, Vignelli reached yet again for Helvetica - this time stark white text on an unyielding black background, iconography as bold and brash as the city itself. Part of the point of making a documentary about all this, Hustwit explains, is to put faces to the names of great designers such as Vignelli whose work surrounds us every day but whose identities remain more or less unknown. &quot;When I started this project,&quot; he says, &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe that a film like this didn&apos;t exist already, because these people are gods and goddesses. What they do is more than just logos and corporate branding - they design the type that we read every day in newspapers and magazines, onscreen and on television. Fonts don&apos;t just appear out of Microsoft Word: there are human beings and huge stories behind them.&quot; Microsoft Word and the revolution in desktop publishing are, of course, part of the reason that audiences who wouldn&apos;t otherwise know their glyphs from their descenders are flocking to see a documentary devoted to the history of typography. Graphic design is no longer the province of specialists, but available to anyone with a word processor. &quot;All these things that were the realm of professional designers 10 years ago are now being done by eight-year-olds,&quot; says Hustwit. &quot;The more people are exposed to graphic design, the more they appreciate it.&quot; \u00b7 Helvetica is showing at BritDoc, Keble College, Oxford, July 25-27 (details: britdoc.org); and at the ICA, London, from September 7 (details: ica.org.uk/020-7930 3647). 50 Years of Helvetica is at MoMA, New York until March 31 2008.", "sentences": ["Inside the Kriterion cinema in central Amsterdam on a sodden summer evening, a birthday party is getting under way."], "title": "Andrew Dickson meets Gary Hustwit, creator and director of the film Helvetica", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jul/16/design", "tags": ["Film", "Design", "Culture", "Art and design", "Typography", "Documentary", "Helvetica"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-17T10:32:38Z", "article": "Spotted, on that nice Andrew Neil&apos;s excellent Daily Politics show yesterday, acclaimed journalist, author and playwright Toby Young loudly singing the praises of London&apos;s latest mayoral candidate in his capacity as official organiser of the &quot;Boris for Mayor&quot; Facebook group.

An external computer hard drive containing the plans was found in the luggage of Yassin Nassari, 28, of Ealing, west London, at Luton airport in May last year. The prosecution had alleged during a six-week trial at the Old Bailey that Nassari was a radicalised Muslim bent on waging violent jihad. The jury, however, cleared him of a charge of having articles for terror. Today Judge Gerald Gordon said there was no evidence to show the material would be used for terror. It was, however, an offence to possess such plans about explosives and &quot;the sooner that is understood the better&quot;, the judge said. Nassari and his Dutch wife, Bouchra El Hor, 24, who was cleared of failing to disclose information on terror, were stopped at the airport as they returned to the UK after a long trip to Syria and a shorter visit to Holland. They were travelling with their five-month-old baby. Police looked at several items in Nassari&apos;s luggage, including the external hard drive. It contained dozens of files including documents about &quot;martyrdom&quot;, weapons training and how to construct the Qassam artillery rocket, a home made steel weapon used by terrorists in the Middle East. Nassari had claimed he knew nothing about the missile plans, and said he had loaned the computer to a friend who was now facing a terror charge. Officers searched his home and found computer equipment, CDs and DVDs which included violent footage of terrorist attacks and beheadings. There were documents entitled &quot;Preparing the Fighter Who Is Going For Jihad&quot; and &quot;Islamic Ruling on Permissibility of Self-Sacrificial Operation&quot;. Nassari was subsequently arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000. Detectives later discovered that he had left the UK in April 2005 and travelled to Syria, where he taught English. He downloaded the material about the explosives to the external hard drive in April 2006, just before he left Syria for Amsterdam. He then returned to the UK via Luton airport. Scotland Yard also discovered that Nassari had communicated with extremists via internet chat-rooms. With the user name &quot;Mock Turtle&quot; he exchanged views with other users, including one known as &quot;Abu Dujanah&quot;. Dujanah was in fact Tariq al-Daour - who was jailed last month along with two other men for incitement to murder using the internet. After Nassari&apos;s sentencing today, the head of the Metropolitan police&apos;s counter terrorism command and deputy assistant commissioner, Peter Clarke, said: &quot;Nassari held the ideology, ability and determination to find and download material which would have been useful to terrorists. &quot;...what he intended to do upon his return to the UK is unclear. However, it is possible that his research could have ended up in the hands of individuals or groups willing to put it into practice.&quot;", "sentences": ["He downloaded the material about the explosives to the external hard drive in April 2006, just before he left Syria for Amsterdam."], "title": "Man jailed over instructions for making rocket", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/17/ukcrime.terrorism", "tags": ["UK news", "Crime", "Syria", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-18T23:03:34Z", "article": "The unclassifiable The Human Computer  The always intriguing Will Adamsdale (2004&apos;s Perrier award-winner with the unforgettable Jackson&apos;s Way) returns after last year&apos;s modern-life-is-puzzling theatre hit The Receipt with a new stand-up show about a man who &quot;becomes a computer.

But over the past few years the Blair government has provocatively granted refuge to high-profile anti-Putinists, including men wanted on charges of terrorism or other criminal activities under Russian law, and let them engage in activities hostile to Russia. Repeated requests by the Russian authorities for the extradition of Boris Berezovsky and Akhmed Zakayev (the representative of a terrorist who once boasted that he would forcibly establish sharia law in Chechnya) have been refused. Britain has also participated in the US policy of encirclement, which has built a ring of hostile states and pro-US regimes around Russia, while trying to subvert it through US-funded Moscow-based agencies and organisations. The siting of a &quot;missile defence system&quot; in Poland and the Czech Republic, directed at Russia, is just the latest example of this policy. Added to this is the stream of anti-Russian lies in the British media, including the claim that Russia ruthlessly turned off gas supplies to Europe during its dispute with Ukraine. It was the US stooge Viktor Yushchenko who hijacked supplies intended for Europe when Russia rightly withheld deliveries to Ukraine until it received a fair market price for them. Now, in a return to the antics of the cold war, Gordon Brown has expelled four Russian diplomats on no other grounds than that their country will not deliver up one of its citizens to the dubious mercies of British &quot;justice&quot;. Dr Andrew Markham-Cooper Amsterdam, Netherlands It is hardly realistic to expect Russia to change its constitution at the behest of a foreign power, or even a Guardian leader writer (July 17). But in any case there is no need, as the existing constitution allows extradition under the terms of article 63 (2) where this is provided for by Russian legislation or an international agreement. It would surely be in everyone&apos;s interests to explore such opportunities for cooperation before we begin to think of expelling each other&apos;s diplomatic representatives. Stephen WhiteGlasgow Our government accepted the &quot;longstanding position&quot; of the Pentagon that US servicemen should not appear before foreign tribunals, thus releasing the pilots concerned from being questioned in a British court regarding their responsibility in the death of Lance Corporal Matty Hull. Perhaps, as Moscow asserts, we British are immoral, or at least morally inconsistent, in insisting that Andrei Lugovoi appear before a foreign court to answer to his responsibility in the death of Alexander Litvinenko. Shall we now see Mr Lugovoi lecturing to students on health and safety in the deployment of radioactive material, following the pattern of the US pilots elevated to training officers for current pilot trainees.Catherine Allen Twickenham, Middlesex The British government has not shown great enthusiasm for a common European foreign policy in recent years, for example when trying to split Europe into old and new about the Iraq invasion. But this does not stop them crying for European solidarity when it comes to national interests, whether it&apos;s the release of hostages from Iran or the recent row with Russia (Europeans lukewarm as Britain tries to rally support in row with Russia, July 18). A common European foreign minister would have given Europe a unified voice in such matters. The establishment of such a post was vehemently opposed by the Blair government. It may therefore not be surprising that Europe&apos;s response is only lukewarm. J\u00f6rg SchumacherOxford So the government is expelling Russian diplomats. I hope for their sake that their removal will not take as long as that of a Russian man, Aleksandr Latsinnek, who on Saturday will have been in prison for a whole year awaiting deportation after his prison sentence ended. He is not contesting his removal; for his own and his family&apos;s sake he cannot wait to leave.

Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty I can guarantee, without the benefit of a Mori poll, that there isn&apos;t a single frequent traveller in the UK who hasn&apos;t spent hours (or weeks) complaining about Heathrow. I hear, most often, three meaty (and pretty legitimate) complaints.  First, there&apos;s punctuality. You&apos;ll make meeting or evening plans on the basis of a plane&apos;s arrival time; and invariably you&apos;ll be late or have to cancel. Next up is incompetence. It&apos;s truly astonishing how often Heathrow&apos;s internal infrastructure fails. Escalators are stationary; areas of the airport are cordoned off for seemingly no reason at all; seats are made from cheese-grater metal. In particular, Terminal 2 is close to being a national disgrace: starved of investment since its opening in 1955, it looks awful and requires a ball-busting amount of walking. Third and the current favourite: queuing and security. I think any fair-minded traveller can acknowledge that events since 9/11 have required tighter security. But the result is an inconsistent mess. Yes, the liquid rule makes sense, but how is the one bag policy remotely helpful? I can understand the need to check laptops, but taking shoes off?  But, despite all this, do I hate Heathrow? Absolutely not. In fact, I love the place. And I&apos;m immensely proud of this British achievement. Contrary to our train network, it is an infrastructural achievement of immense, almost miraculous, proportions. London Heathrow is the hub of global aviation, the most lucrative international airport in the world. Last year alone nearly 68 million passengers, of all nationalities, passed through it. Ninety airlines use it and it will be the first - and then the most regularly visited - home of the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 787, aviation&apos;s most celebrated and most fuel-efficient new aircraft. This is truly extraordinary given the constraints that the airport operates under. It may creak but let&apos;s not forget that T1, T2 and T3 were built before 1980. Certain terminals at Heathrow - for example, T4 - are functioning at four times the capacity they were designed for. The airport only has two runways, while its closest European rivals have at least three (Munich) and sometimes four (Frankfurt) or five (Schiphol, Amsterdam). A plane takes off or lands every 20-30 seconds. The growth in civil aviation should have rendered Heathrow a total disaster. But remarkably, it still works.  Every poll on major airports places Heathrow T4 among the best five in the world, no doubt thanks to its brilliant shopping, the serene (very British) response to calamity and, perhaps above all else, the extraordinary access to all of the world&apos;s greatest leisure destinations - New York being the most popular. And let&apos;s not forget the impending arrival of T5. This will increase the capacity of the airport to an unprecedented 90 million passengers. Its glass walls will showcase the Wembley Arch, the London Eye and the Gherkin, among other London landmarks.  Heathrow&apos;s status was never inexorable. It is the result of 60 years of sustained hard work - a real dedication to excellence, reliability and safety.", "sentences": ["The airport only has two runways, while its closest European rivals have at least three (Munich) and sometimes four (Frankfurt) or five (Schiphol, Amsterdam)."], "title": "In praise of Heathrow", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2007/jul/19/inpraiseofheathrow", "tags": ["Travel", "Airline industry"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-19T23:09:07Z", "article": "Millions of air passengers were warned that they could suffer a repeat of last summer&apos;s Heathrow chaos, as the head of the world&apos;s busiest international airport quit on the eve of the hectic holiday peak period. Heathrow&apos;s chief executive, Tony Douglas,said the UK&apos;s main flight hub was operating beyond capacity and faces a &quot;tough&quot; nine months before a fifth terminal opens to relieve congestion. As a critical six week period approaches, the outgoing airport head said he could not guarantee a smooth ride for passengers: &quot;I cannot tell if there will not be an extraordinary event like last summer.&quot; The alleged liquid bomb plot last August brought Heathrow to a standstill as emergency security measures were implemented, exposing the strained state of the airport&apos;s operations. British airports are braced for a difficult summer as they prepare to handle record numbers of passengers, with at least 20m holidaymakers expected to fly in and out of the UK in the next two months. As well as the current draconian security guidelines inside terminals across the UK, passengers face extra delays in getting to the airport following last month&apos;s attempted suicide bombing at Glasgow airport. All UK international terminals have been ringed with concrete since the attack and some still have restrictions on private cars drawing up to departures. Mr Douglas stepped down less than a month after admitting that Heathrow was &quot;bursting at the seams&quot; and in &quot;some places is held together with sticking plasters.&quot; The transport secretary, Ruth Kelly, provided some hope for air passengers yesterday by announcing the intention to raise the limit on hand luggage to two bags per passenger, but only after airports guaranteed the new allowance would not compromise security or lengthen queues. It means the rules will not be relaxed until after the peak holiday season, if at all. The Air Transport Users Council expressed concern at the timing of Mr Douglas&apos;s resignation, which deprives the airport of its top executive just as it prepares for peak of 200,000 people a day. &quot;We hope there is some continuity with all the improvements they have put in place,&quot; said an AUC spokesman. Mr Douglas, who is to be chief operating officer at construction giant Laing O&apos;Rourke, said the airport would not be disrupted by his departure. &quot;The team in place here are very professional and very competent and have made appropriate plans to deal without me. No organisation is one person and Heathrow is a prime example of that. I will not make the difference between a great summer and an indifferent one.&quot; However, he admitted that whoever runs the airport must handle infrastructure that was designed to process 45 million passengers per year but now receives 68 million. &quot;Until it gets additional capacity, Heath row will always be tough. Contrast it with Paris Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt, or Amsterdam Schiphol. They all operate at 70% capacity. We are at 98.5% every day.&quot; Mr Douglas&apos;s successor will be Heathrow&apos;s managing director, Mark Bullock. Mindful of an inquiry that could order the breakup of BAA, the airport owner has been on a hiring spree to open up more security checkpoints at its airports, which include Stansted, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow. It has hired 1,400 new staff, of which more than 500 have been deployed in security areas at Heathrow, which has suffered the worst queues. Despite the recent hirings, passengers are reacting with scepticism to assurances that, if they turn up to airports in good time and have noted the security restrictions, they will pass through major airports with minimal delays. It is not just security that will cause delays. New passport scanners that double the length of time it takes to check a passenger&apos;s details have been rolled out across the UK and are already causing queues at passport control areas.

These included mine winding towers, blast furnaces, gas tanks, grain elevators, water and cooling towers, and occasionally entire complexes of factory buildings. Together, the couple recorded the changing urban landscape initially of Germany, and later of much of Europe and the United States. The citation of the prestigious Hasselblad Foundation award they received in 2004 recorded that &quot;their systematic photography of functionalist architecture, often organising their pictures in grids, brought them recognition as conceptual artists as well as photographers.&quot; Becher&apos;s fascination with industrial buildings began with the mines and smelting works he saw while growing up in Siegen, in North Rhine-Westphalia, where he was born the son of an interior decorator. His interest grew during his time studying painting and graphic art with Karl R\u00f6ssing at the Stuttgart Art Academy (1953-56), and the D\u00fcsseldorf Art Academy (1957-63), where he married Hilla, a fellow student, in 1961. During this period Becher had a crucial experience, of which he often spoke, and which was connected with the demolition of a mine in Siegen. Because of its iron-ore deposits, for centuries the region had been an important economic area with a large number of mines and smelting works. However, as a result of structural change, intensified by the activities of the EEC, the industrial facilities increasingly fell victim to international competition - and began to shut down. Becher was both inspired by and regretted this impending disappearance, and initially attempted to capture, in pencil drawings, the Eisenhardter Tiefbau mine in the small town of Eisern. He soon realised, however, that his plan was doomed to failure, as the demolition work was going faster than his drawing. &quot;One had to capture these objects in order to preserve them, as they were to ultimately disappear,&quot; he said later in an interview. So to speed things up, he used a small-format camera to take photographs of the individual buildings and structures, which in turn became templates for his artistic work and photo-collages. Becher thus discovered his artistic medium through photography, which provided him with precise reproductions of the world of objects. He became increasingly interested in the analytical and synergetic power of the form, and was set on a path that would lead to the systematic assembly of individual photographic views into multi-part typologies and series. He developed a kind of visual grammar that adhered to a scientific standard. It was not the personal signature or creativity of the artist&apos;s gaze that mattered; rather, each object had a platform independent of its moment as a photograph. This also corresponded with the objects he focused on; they were free of architecturally aesthetic considerations, but were important as the work of craftsmen and engineers. Becher and his wife found models for their approach in the new objectivity of the 1920s - such as the photography of August Sander, which focused on types and was free from retouching; or the industrial photographs and Ruhr district landscapes of Albert Renger-Patzsch; or the magnified detail of the botanical studies of Karl Blossfeldt. The precision of the photo-documentary work of late 19th-century industrial photographers also influenced their methodical approach. In drawing attention to the cultural dimension of industrial architecture, their work also highlighted the need for preservation of these buildings. On the couple&apos;s initiative, for example, the Zollern coal mine at Dortmund-Bovinghausen in the Ruhr, for the most part an art-deco structure, was designated a protected landmark. From the beginning, the Bechers worked systematically at their task. They undertook countless journeys in their Volkswagen van, which also served as a bedroom, improvised darkroom, and mobile nursery for their son, Max, who was born in 1964. The routes they staked out in their D\u00fcsseldorf studio took them to the far corners of western Europe and north America, through Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Luxembourg. In 1966, they undertook a six-month journey through England and south Wales, taking hundreds of photographs of the coal industry around Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Nottingham and the Rhondda Valley. In 1972 their work was shown in Nigel Greenwood&apos;s London gallery, and in 1974-75 the Arts Council of Great Britain organised a comprehensive overview of their work. Their first book, Anonymous Sculptures: a Typology of Industrial Buildings (1970), now a standard photographic work, brought the Bechers into the limelight, and in 1972 and 1977 they were invited to show their subdued black-and-white photographs at the Documenta 4 exhibition in Kassel. Their images had all the stylistic clarity of minimalism. From 1976 to 1996, Becher applied his methodically rigorous manner to teaching photography at the D\u00fcsseldorf Academy. Today, the success of the so-called Becher school of photography is reflected in the work of such prominent German artists and photographers as Laurenz Berges, Andreas Gursky, Candida H\u00f6fer, Axel H\u00fctte, Simone Nieweg, Thomas Ruff, Thomas Struth and Petra Wunderlich. The Bechers&apos; work is represented at the Tate Gallery, London, and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. They received numerous major awards, among them the Golden Lion for sculpture at the 44th Venice Biennale (1990) and the Erasmus prize in Amsterdam (2002). In 2003-04, a retrospective exhibition, Typologies of Industrial Buildings, was shown in Germany, France and Spain.

There is no doubting the seriousness or sincerity of the protesters putting the final touches to plans for a campaign of direct action next month. Sometimes their communications even assume a biblical tone: &quot;Should we not change our ways, we&apos;ll see forests burn, soils decay, oceans rise and millions of people die.&quot; Their methods, including a huge protest camp and co-ordinated civil disobedience, echo those of past campaigns against the Vietnam war, nuclear weapons and oppressive regimes abroad. But this time, the mission is not to stop wars, bombs or torture, it&apos;s to stop people going on holiday. Thousands of activists are expected to descend on London&apos;s Heathrow airport for a week in mid-August. There will be workshops on issues from carbon offsetting and biofuels to campaign strategy and skills for direct action, and the camp will climax with a day in which demonstrators will try to disrupt the airport as much as possible. Never before has flying been so controversial. In the space of two years, the environmental damage done by planes has gone from being an issue quietly discussed by scientists and committed environmentalists to one that grabs headlines no one can ignore. Politicians are pilloried in newspapers for flying to meetings. Travellers checking in for domestic flights are confronted by Greenpeace campaigners urging them to take the train instead. Travel agents&apos; shops are daubed in protesters&apos; paint and travel magazines get hate-mail. Even those who fly once or twice a year on holiday can&apos;t help but feel a growing sense of guilt, while those opting for trips by car, train or ferry have a self-righteous spring in their steps. Now, however, the backlash is beginning. The tourism and aviation industries are mobilising, setting up lobbying groups, and pointing out some awkward facts. Did you know, for example, that some ferries emit far more carbon dioxide than some planes? That driving can release twice as much carbon as flying? A report from the British Airlines Pilots Association (Balpa) even claims flying can be better than taking the train. And at last month&apos;s Paris Airshow, Airbus unveiled its own solution to climate change - promising to &quot;save the planet, one A380 at a time&quot;. That&apos;s A380, as in the vast double-decker airliner about to enter service. So whom do you believe? One thing on which all sides agree is that aviation is booming. There are about 17,700 commercial aircraft in the world. Over the next 20 years, manufacturers expect to deliver 25,600 new planes, with massive growth coming from China, India and Russia as economies develop and flying is deregulated. &quot;Aviation is here to stay and will grow faster than people expect,&quot; said Praful Patel, India&apos;s civil aviation minister. &quot;India is a country of 1.1 billion people and fewer than 10 million fly even once a year.&quot; It&apos;s an unpalatable argument, but even if everyone in Britain were to stop flying tomorrow, in less than two years the total number of passengers worldwide would still be rising. This year there will be 2.2 billion air passengers worldwide and the number is growing by 4% a year, according to International Air Transport Association forecasts. Airbus predicts the UK will buy 1,282 airliners over the next 20 years, while America, China and India will buy 10,492. UK passenger numbers are expected to grow over the next four years by 4% per year on international flights and 3% on domestic flights, but India and China are predicted to grow by 8% on international flights and 23% and 12%, respectively, on domestic flights. Perhaps Britain can lead by example and so influence the world to cut back on flights too. Britons took 234m flights last year. Discounting the 20% in the population who never fly at all, this works out at about five per person. To hit the government&apos;s target of a 60% drop in carbon emissions by 2050, Britons simply need to slowly wean themselves down to two annual flights - one return trip. Maybe, if planes get more efficient, it could be two. And yet the kind of mass change in behaviour that would make this work still seems to be a long way off. Recent surveys have suggested that 3% of Britons have already stopped flying and a further 10% have cut back, but people seem slow to practice what they preach - Ryanair says it has yet to notice any effect and has not cancelled a single flight as a result of such concerns. (It could be lying, but then why would it have 30 new planes on order?) Even if a route from the UK became unviable due to boycotts by green travellers, the airlines, loath to give up a landing slot, would simply switch to a new destination - likely to be one further afield in a developing economy where demand is growing fastest. Moreover, with China building two power stations per week, mostly coal-fired, it&apos;s easy to wonder if it&apos;s worth agonising about whether you should go for that long weekend. According to last year&apos;s British government-commissioned report by economist Sir Nicholas Stern, power stations account for 24% of global greenhouse gas emissions, shipping, train and road transport account for 12.3% and flying accounts for just 1.7%. Compare this with deforestation, which accounts for 18% (half of which is attributed to the destruction of rainforests in two countries: Indonesia and Brazil). That&apos;s not to say we&apos;re damned anyway, so let&apos;s get on the plane and keep partying till the world goes up in flames, but it does put the issue into balance - should we devote nine times more effort to fighting deforestation than flying? And being aware of the balance should steer us away from extreme positions - refusing to fly at all or ignoring the issue - towards taking practical, realistic steps to a solution. A return flight from London to Barcelona, for example, emits about 260kg of carbon dioxide per passenger. Insulating an average loft can easily make up for this - it will save, on average, 1,500kg of CO2 per year. Replace 10 ordinary bulbs with energy-saving ones, and that saves 380kg. Chuck out a plasma TV and save 404kg. Even turning off appliances instead of leaving them on standby will save 173kg - easily enough to allow a return flight from London to Paris or Amsterdam with a clear conscience. &quot;Dark green&quot; environmentalists argue there is a bankrupt logic in this kind of carbon offsetting - you are doing the equivalent of donating to an animal charity so you can keep kicking your dog, as the saying goes. You could, after all, take all those carbon-saving steps, and still cancel your holiday. Except that assumes tourism is a frivolous, self-indulgent activity, which is as pointless as leaving a TV on standby. Even putting aside the benefits to the tourists themselves, this is clearly not the case. Tourism employs about 231 million people, and generates 8-10% of world GDP. While the campaigners plot their Heathrow action, in Kenya plans are being drawn up for a very different camp. Looking out from an escarpment over the deserts of Samburuland is the Ol Malo Eco-Lodge. Revenue from its few visitors has allowed 2,000 hectares around it to be transformed from over-grazed cattle ranch to a pristine conservation site, but that is just the start. The tourist-funded lodge provides infrastructure and backup for a range of community work. About 100 women are employed in the workshop making traditional beadwork for export, and the children come along to paint for fun. More impressive still is the Ol Malo eye project. Up to 80% of adults in the area suffer sight loss, caused by the infectious and preventable disease trachoma, so the Ol Malo Trust runs surgical camps, bringing doctors from the UK. In January, the camp gave 102 people back their sight. &quot;It&apos;s very simple - all of our visitors fly here,&quot; said Julia Francombe, the trust&apos;s founder. &quot;If they stopped coming, it would kill us.&quot; Captain Mervyn Granshaw, Balpa&apos;s chairman, says: &quot;Our message to all air passengers is to stop feeling guilty about flying,&quot; he said. &quot;We are now going to debunk the myths about air travel and spell out the facts.&quot; However, getting the facts is a nightmarish task. &quot;Passengers going by high-speed train to the south of France would be responsible for emitting more carbon dioxide than if they had flown there,&quot; Granshaw said. The report quotes Roger Kemp, professor of engineering at Lancaster University, in support of this statement. However, he disputes the claim. &quot;No, actually that&apos;s completely untrue,&quot; he says. &quot;France generates about 80% of its electricity using nuclear power, so if you wanted to go to the south of France, by far the best way to go is by TGV.&quot; But he goes on to say that plane travel is not always automatically the worst choice environmentally. &quot;The worst way to get to the south of France is to take a car ferry then motorail, where you can end up with a diesel engine hauling a huge train with cars on wagons.&quot; A full plane can sometimes compete with a car too. Paul Upham, a research fellow at the Tyndall Centre, calculated that travelling from Manchester to Guernsey on a full Saab 200 turbo-prop plane produced 103kg of carbon dioxide per person, compared with 226kg for a Nissan Micra carrying one person the same distance. He was quoted as concluding: &quot;Planes aren&apos;t the evil things relative to cars that people imagine.&quot; Ferries clearly cannot claim automatic green superiority. &quot;I have to admit that I rather enjoy ferry travel,&quot; says Kemp. &quot;But if you start to do the analysis of that, it starts to look rather unattractive too, because of the power used to move not only the people, but the cabin, space for their car, the bars, nightclubs, and so on. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s much in it between taking the plane and taking the ferry.&quot; Analysing how modes of transport compare is fiendishly complex. Some trains are worse than others (faster trains consume up to four times as much energy, and diesels can emit more than twice the carbon dioxide of electric trains). Some high-speed ferries use double the fuel of conventional ships, making them several times worse than planes for carbon emissions. Ultimately, experts admit that given the right circumstances, any method of transport can be made to come out on top. On average, though, a car carrying several occupants is usually better than a plane and trains are almost always the best of all. The UK government&apos;s calculations suggest a long-haul plane emits 110g of carbon dioxide per passenger kilometre, a medium-sized car with two occupants the same, while the train emits 60g. However, as the pollution from planes is emitted high in the atmosphere, its effects are far worse and vapour trails (or contrails) lead to the formation of cirrus clouds, which stop heat escaping from the earth. Most scientists agree that this &quot;radiative forcing&quot; effect is real - and point to the cooling in America after all planes were grounded on 9/11 - but few agree on the scale of its effects. Estimates are that before comparing a plane&apos;s emissions to those of a car or train, you would first have to double or triple them. &quot;The big problem is that there is no consensus on this and people seem to be becoming split along ideological lines, with NGOs accepting the multiplier and industry not,&quot; says Upham. His Manchester to Guernsey calculation has made him the unwitting poster boy for the pro-aviation lobby, but his actual views are different: &quot;Taking into account the contrails, flying is usually about nine times worse than taking the train, and three times worse than a car with two passengers.&quot; Given the world&apos;s apparently insatiable appetite for flying, and accepting it is seriously damaging for the environment, it becomes crucial to develop less polluting aircraft. Already, there is some progress: the Boeing 747-800, which will enter service in 2009, is 16% more fuel efficient than its predecessor, while the 787 &quot;Dreamliner&quot;, which enters service next May, uses light carbon composites to cut fuel use by 20% compared with the 767, and 70% compared with the 727 launched in 1963. Airbus&apos;s claim that it can save the world with the A380 may be far-fetched, but its &quot;gentle giant&quot; plane is far more efficient and quieter than those of 20 years ago and Virgin is even planning to test fly a 747 on biofuel. Moves to reform air-traffic control so planes are not stuck in circling patterns are also vital. In Europe, this would cut carbon emissions by 12%. Some environmentalists, however, scorn these advances, saying such measures are a &quot;delusion&quot;, &quot;like holding out for cigarettes that don&apos;t cause cancer&quot;. &quot;The aviation industry is prone to vastly overstating the gains that can be made from technological improvements but sadly a climate friendly plane isn&apos;t on the horizon,&quot; says Emily Armistead of Greenpeace. &quot;The only way to deal with aviation&apos;s impact is to limit its expansion.&quot; So should we stop flying? If no one set foot on a plane again, it would undoubtedly help to stop climate change - though at the expense of killing off the tourism-based economies of many of the world&apos;s poorest countries. But in the real world, surely we have to take a more sophisticated approach: to choose airlines with greener, newer fleets, and thus encourage plane makers to prioritise environmental performance; to travel to destinations that help local communities; to take the train where possible; to reduce carbon emissions at home; and, above all, lobby politicians to tackle deforestation and to switch to green forms of energy. Do all this, and we can start to cancel flights in the knowledge that it really will make a difference.

Have a read of this, I want to say, and then go and cover yourself up a bit, love. For a sharp lesson in what it is to be the object of men&apos;s desire, Undressing Emmanuelle is a darkly discomforting read. It doesn&apos;t look like that sort of book, of course, since the publishers have gone for the same tactic that Just Jaeckin, the director of Emmanuelle, used for almost identical reasons: a kitschy, soft-porno cover shot of her that encapsulates everything we think we know about the Seventies - an era of sexual liberation and polyester fabrics in which the acme of sophisticated urban living was to sit half-naked in an oversized rattan chair. Which just goes to show. Nothing&apos;s quite what it seems. Emmanuelle, the liberated Frenchwoman whose sexual adventures 600 million people around the world paid to see, was actually Sylvia Kristel, a Dutchwoman, who disliked nudity, calls herself &apos;prudish&apos;, but accepted the role on its &apos;artistic&apos; merits. It makes her a star, though, and then traps her for life. She makes other films, but she&apos;s always still Emmanuelle. &apos;I was dressed, but people preferred me naked. I spoke, but they like me better silent or dubbed.&apos; She craved stardom, craved the attention, and it&apos;s not so hard to see why: the early chapters deal with her miserable childhood, her alcoholic parents, her mother&apos;s dislike of sex, her Catholic boarding school, her lecherous &apos;uncle&apos; Hans, and the heartbreaking day her father brought home his mistress and announced he was leaving them. Her big break came when she represented Holland in Miss TV Europe and her words could be straight from ITV primetime. &apos;I&apos;ve just got to be the prettiest and the most entertaining,&apos; she tells her mother. &apos;I&apos;m bound to get their attention ... this is my moment, my big moment. I&apos;m going to be star.&apos; It is her big moment: it leads to the casting audition for Emmanuelle, and then the shoot. (Sample sentence: &apos;Today I will be raped. I hate this scene. The violence, the physical constraint makes me want to run away.&apos;) And then it&apos;s released to overnight controversy and success and notoriety and a string of lovers who all want to sleep with her, or at least, Emmanuelle. She has them all: Roger Vadim, Warren Beatty, whoever her leading man of the time happens to be. Her love of champagne grows &apos;until it&apos;s a contractual requirement&apos;. And then comes cocaine, so widely taken that it&apos;s not so much a drug as &apos;more of a super-vitamin, something very fashionable, not really dangerous&apos;. She has a son by a Dutch intellectual but she&apos;s too strung out to look after him in Hollywood and he&apos;s sent to live back in Holland with her mother (&apos;I don&apos;t remember having been sad. In fact I was pleased, relieved that my son was escaping from that life, my life, my fog&apos;). And then, with the pick of any man in the world, she goes and chooses Lovejoy - Ian McShane - who tells her that &apos;all you&apos;ve got is luck and a nice arse&apos;. This is a car crash of a life with details which are the stuff of soap opera. Pregnant with Ian McShane&apos;s (unwanted) child, she&apos;s diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, and then, during a fight, falls backwards down a staircase and loses the baby. The police find her hallucinating in her flat with a stash of cocaine on the bedside table. Her films get worse and worse.

And &apos;sooner or later the debt must be paid ... women are charged a great deal for having been beautiful, unfairly different, attractive, for provoking unsatisfied desire&apos;. They are. Or, at least, she is. And it is, all in all, a strangely gripping tale.

Roy Keane on Marc Overmars, Republic of Ireland 1-0 Holland, World Cup qualifier, September 1 2001 The cocky Dutch sashayed into Dublin convinced they&apos;d get the victory they needed to stay on course for the following year&apos;s World Cup - indeed, their ever-humble manager Louis van Gaal claimed his side were so much more skilful than their hosts that even Irish fans would prefer them to win. Ireland may have outplayed the Oranje when drawing 2-2 in Amsterdam a year previously, but the Dutch had been depleted by injury - this time they brought their entire galaxy of stars (except drug-busted Edgar Davids), meaning the likes of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Patrick Kluivert, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Marc Overmars and Pierre van Hooijdonk would be let loose on an Irish defence that was missing three of its usual starters. Lansdowne Road jangled with nervous tension, but there was also something crazy in the air - and one man was determined to ensure the Dutch knew there was also madness on the pitch: 35 seconds into the game, Roy Keane crunched into Overmars like a tank into shack, almost crushing the little winger underfoot as Kluivert, seemingly on the verge of tears, hopped up and down in impotent outrage. The referee - a German, as Dutch journalists pointedly noted - didn&apos;t even book Ireland&apos;s captain. A minute later, the still-flustered Kluivert was sent through one-on-one with Shay Given ... and steered his shot wide. Thus were laid the foundations for a famous Irish victory. 2. Robert Pires on Patrick Vieira - Arsenal 2-0 Juventus, Champions League quarter-finals, first leg, March 28 2006 When Juventus visited Highbury in March 2006, the pre-game chatter was almost entirely devoted to one player - Patrick Vieira. But by the night&apos;s end Arsenal were being lauded as potential tournament winners after Cesc Fabregas had comprehensively subdued the former Gunner in the middle of the park. Yet it was not Fabregas, but rather Robert Pires, who instigated the match&apos;s defining moment - by dispossessing Vieira with a challenge so out of character that Highbury was still in shock when Fabregas crowned the subsequent attack with an opening goal. Five minutes before half-time Vieira had just picked up the ball and looked set to drive a trademark run into Arsenal territory when Pires, tracking back probably for the first time in his career, charged alongside his erstwhile team-mate and slid in, hooking his leg around the ball and toppling Vieira headfirst onto the turf. Pires leapt to his feet, laid the ball off to Thierry Henry, and within 10 seconds the ball was in the net. &quot;It is the first time I have done that in my 13-year career,&quot; beamed Pires afterwards. &quot;I even surprised myself!&quot; More importantly, he had ambushed Vieira - sabotaging the already fragile confidence of a man who was being savaged for recent performances in the Italian press and who was being upstaged on his old stomping ground by a petulant 18-year-old from Spain. Now humiliated by the last man on the pitch he would have expected to beat him at his own game, Vieira was done. 3. Benjamin Massing (and chums) on Claudio Caniggia, Argentina 0-1 Cameroon, World Cup, June 8 1990 Italia 90 was only the third time a sub-Saharan African team had qualified for the World Cup. In 1974 Zaire had gone out in the group stages after a 9-0 scalping by Yugoslavia, that free-kick and rumours of the Zaire government pocketing the players&apos; wages. In 1982 Cameroon put in a credible performance, only failing to progress from the group stages on goals scored. Their 1990 counterparts ran out in the first game against Argentina to the usual patronising murmurings of African &quot;naivety and indiscipline&quot; and, in all honesty, some of their defending was riotous. But, by God, did it work. Cameroon restricted Diego Maradona by putting two or three men at a time on him, and took the lead in the 67th minute. Argentina were already bruised (Andr\u00e9 Kana-Biyick had been sent off in the 61st minute) when Claudio Caniggia scampered through in the last few minutes. Two Cameroon players attempted to bring him down, before Benjamin Massing kicked him so hard that his boot flew off. It was not only a statement that Cameroon were a side that would not be intimidated, it was a signal that this was to be a bloody, brawling World Cup. &quot;Just after that match, we saw ourselves as world champions. And the results were there to show,&quot; said Cameroon&apos;s captain Stephen Tataw. With Argentina out of the way, his side had the confidence to play football with a little more lyricism, and with Roger Milla unleashed, they made it to the quarter-finals before losing - unluckily - to England. 4. Vinnie Jones on Steve McMahon, Wimbledon 1-0 Liverpool, FA Cup final, May 14 1988 Liverpool were the Team of the Decade. They had romped to the league title and were stick-on favourites to win their second Double in three years. They had 90% of the fans inside Wembley. How on earth could they lose to Wimbledon then, a team that had only entered the Football League 11 years earlier and that stayed out drinking until 11pm the night before the biggest game in the club&apos;s history? According to Crazy Gang boss Bobby Gould, it was because they were petrified. The Dons&apos; don Vinnie Jones, sent off 12 times in his career, believed that if he could stop Steve McMahon, Wimbledon could stop Liverpool. In The Spirit of Wimbledon: Footballing Memories of the Dons 1922-2003, John Fashanu says: &quot;At 3.01pm Vinnie went in for a tackle with Steve McMahon and that was the key moment. The tackle started at his throat and ended at his ankle. That was the game won; psychologically we had made our mark.&quot; Jones had taken lock and stock and should have been dismissed; but he reasoned the referee couldn&apos;t brandish his red card in the first minute in front of 100,000 people. McMahon never recovered from that assault, just as Liverpool never coped with Wimbledon&apos;s pre-match gamesmanship and &quot;Yidaho!&quot; war-cries in the tunnel. Dave Beasant&apos;s penalty save and Lawrie Sanchez&apos;s headed goal might be the moments best remembered from that weird and wonderful day, but it was Jones&apos;s own Anfield Rap that set the tone. 5. Norman Whiteside on Steve McMahon (Liverpool 3-3 Manchester United, Anfield, April 4 1988) In the pre-sanitisation world of 1980s football, contests between Liverpool and Manchester United, particularly at Anfield, were so hate-filled that they should probably have occurred after the watershed. No matter how many titles they won, Liverpool always had a problem with United, and beat them just once at Anfield in the league all decade. Even their sensational 1987-88 side, when 3-1 up and against 10 men after the sending off of Colin Gibson, couldn&apos;t force victory after Norman Whiteside came off the bench to raise hell. Liverpool&apos;s phony hard-man Steve McMahon, who had just toebunged in a superb third, was the cock of the walk in midfield. But he could barely walk when Whiteside came off the bench and, without even touching the ball, clattered him before whispering something sinister in his ear. Enough said. McMahon knew that he would not walk alone for the rest of the game, and he didn&apos;t fancy it at all. With Whiteside taking over midfield, United&apos;s 10 men came back for a famous 3-3 draw. &quot;I remember John Barnes getting an elbow in the Adam&apos;s apple,&quot; says Whiteside. &quot;I got him round the throat and then Steve McMahon tried to come near me and I think I stood on his little toe or something like that. I thought his little toe was around about his shin though, didn&apos;t I?&quot; 6. Jose Batista on Gordon Strachan, Uruguay 0-0 Scotland, World Cup, June 13 1986 Scotland needed a win to qualify for the second stage, Uruguay a draw, and it was clear from the start that Uruguay had absolutely no interest - in any sense - in playing ball. Within a minute Jose Batista took a shortcut through the back of Gordon Strachan; in truth, in the climate of the time it deserved only a yellow card, but Joel Quiniou sent him off. The effect was threefold: it stunned Scotland, it made Uruguay even more committed to their plan of kicking their way into the knockout stages - and, most crucially, it changed Quiniou&apos;s take on the game. At first applauded for taking no nonsense and sending off Batista, it slowly became apparent that he did not have the bottle to reduce Uruguay to nine men, even though the game was littered with fouls as bad as, if not worse than, Batista&apos;s. So Uruguay had carte blanche to cart Scotland all over the field - at times the brutality was mind-boggling - and got their goalless draw with ease.", "sentences": ["Ireland may have outplayed the Oranje when drawing 2-2 in Amsterdam a year previously, but the Dutch had been depleted by injury - this time they brought their entire galaxy of stars (except drug-busted Edgar Davids), meaning the likes of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Patrick Kluivert, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Marc Overmars and Pierre van Hooijdonk would be let loose on an Irish defence that was missing three of its usual starters."], "title": "The Joy of Six: Symbolic reducers, including Roy Keane, Norman Whiteside and Benjamin Massing", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/23/newsstory.sport11", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Roy Keane"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-25T08:17:35Z", "article": "Sculptor Anthony Caro is to unveil six new works this autumn.

The new, large-scale works, collectively called Passage, are made out of zinc-galvanised steel and are up to 5m long. Some are partly painted canary yellow and bottle green. They mark a new working process for Caro, who has previously used only natural elements such as rusted steel, wood or paper. According to Caro, the inspiration, and even some of the sculptures&apos; components, came from his Tate retrospective. &quot;I saw the metal supports that were supporting the Millbank steps,&quot; Caro says, &quot;and I used the same supports to create passages. I started them nearly three years ago when I was putting cast iron and steel parts together, and I had them galvanised to unify the surface of the metal in preparation for painting.

Apart from the Light Programme, there was no music in the house during the rest of the week, and anyway, the star of my parents&apos; collection of 78s was now heard only occasionally on the BBC. His discs, kept carefully in a cupboard in their paper wrappers, were placed on the turntable, the stylus lowered, and within a few notes we were all sobbing. For the singer, Leo Fuld, was renowned as the leading exponent of Yiddish song; he was, as it turned out, the last great Yiddish star. Einstein was said to be a fan. Fuld had had two smash hits: one was a cover of Sophie Tucker&apos;s My Yiddishe Momma, but it was the second, Wo Ahin Soll Ich Geh&apos;n (Tell Me Where Shall I Go), that had us crying our eyes out. Tell Me Where Shall I Go told the story in two devastating verses, sung in Yiddish and English, of a man with no country: Where to go, where to go Every door is closed to me To the left, to the right It&apos;s the same in every land There is nowhere to go And it&apos;s me who should know Won&apos;t you please understand Without actually stating it, Fuld was obviously talking about the hundreds of thousands of Jews in the postwar displaced persons&apos; camps. By the second verse, he has found a home: Now I know where to go Where my folks proudly stand Where to go, where to go To that precious promised land I am proud, can&apos;t you see For at last I am free No more wandering for me The words of that song and the emotions they aroused, the story of the Jewish diaspora, never left me: I could sing the whole song, on demand, and would do so whenever I tried to explain what Zionism meant to my parents&apos; generation.

The internet can throw up many surprises, but none so bizarre as the fate of Leo Fuld. Just before his death in Amsterdam in 1997, he had been discovered by Mohamed el Fers, a Dutch TV producer of Algerian descent. El Fers had produced Fuld&apos;s final album, The Legend, backed by an Algerian rai band, in front of a live audience of young Moroccans. You could download a couple of tracks, and when I clicked on My Yiddishe Momma, I heard the most extraordinary sound: a fusion of Arab north Africa and Jewish eastern Europe. At 84, Fuld&apos;s voice was still fresh and the crowd was going crazy, whooping as he announces that he&apos;s going to sing My Yiddishe Momma. I tracked down El Fers, and he told me the Leo Fuld story. He was born Lazarus Fuld in Rotterdam in 1912 and started out in the synagogue choir; at 16, he was leading services, while at night he was singing secular songs in Rotterdam&apos;s Cafe de Kool. In 1932, still only 19, he came to Britain to audition for the BBC, where he was noticed by bandleader Jack Hylton and became a radio star. Seven years later, he left for the US where he established a career as a singer of Yiddish songs, performing with Frank Sinatra. When he returned to Rotterdam after the war, his entire family - with the exception of one sister - had died in the Holocaust. In 1948, he wrote Tell Me Where Shall I Go, which became a worldwide hit. Fuld&apos;s career had three phases, El Fers says: the British one, the American one and the French one. In the latter, he performed with Edith Piaf and is said to have discovered Charles Aznavour. In the 1950s, he began to develop an Arab audience and toured the Arab world, still performing Yiddish songs. Then he moved to Las Vegas, but in 1992, at the age of 80, his career more or less over, he returned to the Netherlands. &quot;I thought he was dead,&quot; El Fers told me, &quot;but a friend said, &apos;He&apos;s very poor; everyone has forgotten him and he&apos;s living all alone in a tiny apartment.&apos; I remembered the records of my childhood, so I went to interview him and we became friends. He started playing me his old records.&quot; To El Fers&apos; ears, the cantorial music of the synagogue had an undercurrent of the Middle East. &quot;Nobody cared,&quot; says El Fers. &quot;He was 82 but still going. He had a kind of nightclub orchestra which was very bad, so I put him in contact with rai music from Algeria.&quot; El Fers got Fuld working again: &quot;He went on national television with these very young Algerian musicians and in front of an audience of young Moroccans, and they loved him. I have no idea what was the magic between them. Normally, they&apos;re very against Jews and shout about the Palestinians, but the audience wouldn&apos;t let him go.&quot; How did they take to Tell Me Where Shall I Go, I asked him? &quot;We were clever,&quot; he said, &quot;and we never played that song.&quot; Fuld didn&apos;t mind: &quot;If he could play, he would play.&quot; The song was not performed until El Fers got Fuld together with an arranger, and in 1997 they recorded The Legend. Suddenly, Fuld was a star again. Sony gave him a contract, and he was taken to meet the Dutch royal family. Sadly, however, he died a few months after the release of The Legend, aged 84. He went out on a high, with a new following and a new wife. The fusion of the heartfelt sounds of Yiddish and the Arab Middle East resonate still in Leo Fuld&apos;s work. People loved him because he sang from the heart. No more wandering for him. \u00b7 The Legend is available from Hippo Records (www.hipporecords.nl), Calabash Music (calabashmusic.com) or Sterns (www.sternsmusic.com)", "sentences": ["Just before his death in Amsterdam in 1997, he had been discovered by Mohamed el Fers, a Dutch TV producer of Algerian descent."], "title": "Linda Grant on Yiddish singing star Leo Fuld", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/26/worldmusic1", "tags": ["World music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-26T23:02:27Z", "article": "Arctic Monkeys are not a band known for dishing out lavish compliments to their fellow musicians. Earlier this year, however, they singled out one group for special praise. Asked by an exasperated journalist to name one band who they thought had &quot;got it right&quot;, they shot back with the Coral. That band they explained, embodied precisely the kind of characteristics they felt were important: they were highly productive, and &quot;free of bullshit&quot;. You can see why Arctic Monkeys would look up to the Coral. Like them, they were catapulted to fame at a tender age: when the Coral&apos;s debut album was released in 2002, frontman James Skelly was 20, which made him the oldest member. Like them, they developed a reputation both for a distrust of music industry hoopla (when they were nominated for the Mercury Music prize, they declined to attend the ceremony, instead sending a video of themselves in a Jacuzzi with a Freddie Mercury lookalike) and for a certain kind of unmediated plain-speaking: in one of the great biting asides in rock history, Skelly famously described Bruce Springsteen fans as &quot;the kind of people whose neighbour has built a fence three centimetres into their land and it&apos;s killing them&quot;. And like them, the Coral&apos;s fanbase extends far beyond the usual confines of the indie scene: Skelly describes their average audience as consisting of &quot;a mad hippy dancing at the back, a few little girls at the front, some 40-year-old blokes, and a gang of scallies over there pissing everyone off&quot;. Nevertheless, as Skelly and keyboard player Nick Power sit in the offices of their London publicist, fresh from a European tour in the company of Britain&apos;s biggest band, any suggestion of paternal influence over Alex Turner and co is greeted with hoots of derision. &quot;The worst thing that could possibly happen to the Arctic Monkeys,&quot; says Power, &quot;would be for them to listen to our advice about anything.&quot; Today, Power and Skelly laughs a lot, and discuss their forthcoming album Roots and Echoes with an undisguised zeal. It streamlines the band&apos;s disparate influences - psychedelia, doo-wop, the 60s R&amp;B of the Yardbirds, and the smooth crooning of Nat King Cole and Neil Diamond - into a coherent and polished rock album, and there is much talk of renewed enthusiasm, and use of the word &quot;boss&quot;. It makes for a marked contrast with my last attempt at interviewing them, in the front room of Skelly&apos;s tiny terraced house in his hometown of the Liverpool suburb of Hoylake, four years ago. Their debut album had sold half a million copies, their second, Magic and Medicine, was about to enter the charts at No 1, but an atmosphere of celebration was distinctly lacking. Skelly spent most of the afternoon colourfully lambasting his record label, which had apparently incurred his wrath by the simple expedient of promoting the band&apos;s forthcoming album (at one juncture he bewilderingly, described them as &quot;the kind of people who go to fuckin&apos; parties and think, yeah, that&apos;s a fuckin&apos; great record that Come on Eileen&quot;.) When the man who had signed the band telephoned and suggested visiting in order to smooth things over, Skelly threatened to lock him out of the house, then, revising this plan slightly, threatened to murder him. Today, he winces at the memory. &quot;I was just mentally fucked,&quot; he sighs. &quot;I just couldn&apos;t believe the music industry. Now I&apos;m not as naive, I know how it works, but at the time, I just couldn&apos;t believe it, and I think it sent me mental. My dad managed pubs, my granddad worked in a factory, so I thought, how can I really complain about this, but at the same time, it was wreckin&apos; me &apos;ead. It was sending me a bit, like, schizophrenic. We got signed and we were going to France in a tranny van with a load of bevvies and I was 20 and it was boss. But then suddenly, you&apos;re into touring, you&apos;ve got a No 1 album, it all happened dead fast. I thought, who the fuck am I?&quot; The situation was apparently made worse both by the fact that the Coral didn&apos;t actually have a manager and by their enormous intake of marijuana and hallucinogens. One European tour ground to a halt after the band arrived in Amsterdam and elected to go on what Power calls &quot;a three-day magic mushie mission&quot; instead of playing any gigs, a decision that, the keyboard player ruefully notes &quot;probably fucked up our chances in Europe for a good few years&quot;. None of their excesses or woes seemed to impact on their British success: even 2004&apos;s limited edition experimental album Nightfreaks and the Sons of Becker made the Top 5. But by the time their 2005 single In the Morning became the second most-played track on British radio that year (&quot;after Beyonc\u00e9, the bitch,&quot; smiles Skelly), the Coral were in a state of apparently terminal disarray. Guitarist Bill Ryder-Jones - 16 when the band were signed - had left &quot;to try and get his head together&quot;, while his remaining band members were contemplating splitting up entirely. &quot;I think everyone discussed it separately,&quot; says Skelly. &quot;I thought to myself, we could walk away here with a good thing. It&apos;s crushing when you think about it, but it&apos;s reality, isn&apos;t it? I think you need it to happen to remind you of how much you love it.&quot; Instead, the band retreated to Hoylake, where, despite being the area&apos;s solitary celebrity residents, they apparently enjoy anonymity. &quot;There&apos;s builders who are more famous round ours than we are,&quot; nods Skelly. &quot;Some of the really good plumbers around Hoylake are like fuckin&apos; Johnny Depp. It&apos;s the Hollywood of the building trades.&quot; &quot;The thing is, Hoylake inspires you, because you get the bug in you to escape,&quot; reasons Power. &quot;Every single one of my friends has either been away to sea or become a long-distance lorry driver or something. I think it&apos;s because, if you look out to the shore in Hoylake, there&apos;s nothing on the horizon, it&apos;s just endless.&quot; Skelly has a less romantic take on the motivational powers of their corner of the Wirral peninsula. &quot;I got home and I thought, I don&apos;t wanna fuckin&apos; be here for the rest of my life and there&apos;s only one way out. I ain&apos;t ending me fuckin&apos; days here. You need a bit of that, because sometimes I find it a bit hard to motivate myself. We got so bored, we ended up taking a day trip to Blackpool. We went in the Ghost House and everyone&apos;s true character came out. A fella dressed as Freddie from Nightmare on Elm Street jumped out and everyone sacrificed everyone else to save themselves.&quot; A lack of band unity in the depths of the Blackpool Ghost House notwithstanding, the return to Hoylake seemed to work. Ryder-Jones rejoined; Noel Gallagher loaned them his studio to record Roots and Echoes; the single Who&apos;s Gonna Find Me is currently enjoying a faintly terrifying omnipresence on the radio. They have availed themselves of a manager, ensuring that the days when the Coral would &quot;turn up in Zagreb in December with no food and a big bag of magic mushies&quot; are confined to history. &quot;You get up now and you get on the bus,&quot; marvels Skelly, &quot;and the tour manager&apos;s made you a toastie. It&apos;s boss.&quot; Despite the excesses and the mental illness and the cancelled tours and the public threats of murder, there are, the pair insist, no regrets. &quot;What would we have been doing if we hadn&apos;t done this?&quot; reasons Power. &quot;Packing boxes and getting bevvied in the evening? I&apos;ve loved it all, really, even the shit stuff.&quot; James Skelly nods his head. &quot;I have to say,&quot; he smiles, &quot;I&apos;ve had the time of my life.&quot;  \u00b7  Roots and Echoes is released on Deltasonic on August 6.", "sentences": ["One European tour ground to a halt after the band arrived in Amsterdam and elected to go on what Power calls &quot;a three-day magic mushie mission&quot; instead of playing any gigs, a decision that, the keyboard player ruefully notes &quot;probably fucked up our chances in Europe for a good few years&quot;."], "title": "Alexis Petridis meets the Coral.", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/27/popandrock.alexispetridis", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "The Coral"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-26T23:02:28Z", "article": "This month, gig-goers have mainly found themselves wading through muddy festival fields or facing the unexpected truth that cigarette smoke disguised a multitude of flatulent sins in our nation&apos;s venues. Thank goodness, then, for the dry, odour-free magnificence of fabchannel.com. Since 2001, the Dutch website has filmed gigs at Amsterdam&apos;s Paradiso venue. It now offers hundreds of concerts to watch, in full, for free. The picture quality from the pre-broadband days isn&apos;t high, but the sound is, as proved during British Sea Power&apos;s belting 2004 set. And as internet speeds have developed, Fabchannel&apos;s coverage has too. By the time the Arcade Fire rolled into Amsterdam in 2005, their typically rousing show was documented by several crisp cameras. New gigs are added at an amazing rate; among the recent highlights is a wonderfully riotous set from Brazilian electro-funk party monsters Bonde de Role. There aren&apos;t many better music sites on the web. If you&apos;ve ever wondered how producers like Timbaland actually make their tunes, you&apos;ll find enlightenment online courtesy of an aspiring young production duo from Queens, New York. Since March 2006, Mysto and Pizzi have posted videos on YouTube (youtube.com/mystoandpizzi) showing how they work their magic in the studio. Seemingly making the most of some childhood piano lessons, they&apos;ll demonstrate how they build a hip-hop banger using a keyboard to add layers of beats, basslines and hooks. The pair&apos;s talent is as obvious as their videos are entertaining (they&apos;re never averse to a spot of goofing about) and big-time commissions have begun to roll in. Recent videos have shown how the duo crafted a mighty official trance remix of Justin Timberlake&apos;s What Goes Around Comes Around, as well as the pulsing Dirty, one of the standouts from R Kelly&apos;s recent album. After watching their videos, you can&apos;t help feeling pleased for them. When Johann Sebastian Bach grew up in late 17th century Germany, his obsession with keyboard instruments propelled him towards becoming a classical great. But if young Bach were around today, he&apos;d probably be holed up in his bedroom with a laptop, composing avant-garde electro. Today&apos;s German electro scene is certainly one of the most innovative musical movements in Europe. Its poster boy is Apparat, a gangly, squash-loving Berliner with a virtuosic ability for bringing heart, warmth and melody to glitchy, minimal techno. Unusually for an artist&apos;s website, apparat.net lets you listen to all of Apparat&apos;s albums in full. They include his new release, Walls, and his 2006 collaboration with Ellen Allien, Orchestra of Bubbles. Both develop Apparat&apos;s driving &quot;chamber electro&quot; sound, with sumptuous live strings. &quot;In a better world American indie kids would eat [Apparat&apos;s] stuff up like cake,&quot; wrote stereoonstrike.blogspot.com recently.

Photograph: David Sillitoe So who&apos;s going to get the top job at the National Gallery? Well, first of all one might ask who would want it. Charles Saumarez Smith left after only five years in the post -- no time at all for a job of that kind. Rumours about his departure abound: insider gossip suggests tension, power-struggles and personality clashes through all layers of the gallery&apos;s administration recently. However, of the names that keep coming up, Gabriele Finaldi&apos;s consistently emerges as the favourite. He&apos;s currently number two at the Prado, he&apos;s about the right age (early 40s) and he&apos;s very well respected. On the other hand, his Prado job is great, he is allowed a fairly free rein and he gets on well with his director. Would he really want to leave all that? Stephen Deuchar is ambitious and may be looking for a change from Tate Britain - he is running a high-profile and much-loved gallery, but as a director of any one of the Tate galleries, one is still always going to be under the shadow of the capo di capi, overall Tate director Nicholas Serota. It would be very good news, in fact, if those appointing Saumarez Smith&apos;s successor looked beyond the list of usual suspects that people like me can come up with - beyond the legions of more-or-less interchangeable white Caucasian men in nice suits in their 40s. The headhunters will almost certainly cast their eyes abroad - there are plenty of good directors in the US -- but US museum directors tend to be paid a great deal more than their British counterparts. It&apos;s also worth noting that the National Maritime Museum directorship recently went to an Australian. But surely there is homegrown talent to be sought out, too. When Neil MacGregor was appointed to be director of the National Gallery in 1987, he was a rank outsider -- a magazine editor who got the job almost by fluke (Margaret Thatcher, apparently, was dead set against having an American in the post, which was the trustees&apos; favoured option). Yet he turned out to be one of the greatest arts leaders in the country and is now an utterly inspirational director of the British Museum. One gets the feeling that such a risk just wouldn&apos;t be contemplated now. Ironic, really, given that such a vast amount of money has recently been invested, in schemes such as the Clore Leadership Programme, specifically designed to train up British arts administrators to take on really big jobs. Since 2004, the only past Clore fellow to be given a really major international role is Axel R\u00fcger, who went from being a curator at the National Gallery to the director of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam -- a huge leap for R\u00fcger, which none the less shows every sign of working out well. It would be great if the National Gallery could give us all a real surprise when it makes its appointment this autumn.", "sentences": ["Since 2004, the only past Clore fellow to be given a really major international role is Axel R\u00fcger, who went from being a curator at the National Gallery to the director of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam -- a huge leap for R\u00fcger, which none the less shows every sign of working out well."], "title": "Who should get the top job at the National Gallery?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2007/jul/27/whoshouldgetthetopjobat", "tags": ["Culture", "Art and design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-27T23:12:25Z", "article": "Isabel is pregnant. With anyone else I would have smelt a rat, but not with Isabel. It is not long since things ended abruptly with her boyfriend, Vladimir, and she had been dreadfully cut up about it. I stammer some words of congratulation - or was it an accident? No, this baby was wanted, she says. She had been on holiday with her new boyfriend during the summer and they decided then that they wanted a child. And it happened, just like that. She is overwhelmed, she says; she hadn&apos;t expected it to happen so quickly. It is now five years since Paul and I decided we would like to have children. Five long years of miscarriage and medical investigations, ectopic pregnancy and failed IVF attempts. And Isabel falls pregnant just like that. Dumb luck. When I get birth announcements through the post - those pastel envelopes; the baby photo inside; the triumphant proclamation, &quot;We are proud to announce the birth of ...&quot; - I leave them unopened until the evening. On a work day I can&apos;t afford to feel the tears burning behind my eyes all day long. If I can get away with just sending a card, I do. If I have to go and visit the new mother, I put it off as long as possible. But the babies aren&apos;t the worst. I have more trouble with a pregnant belly than with a baby. Pregnant bellies are provocative, offensive. Their fullness reflects my emptiness. Their pride, my failure. And now Isabel is pregnant. I am taken aback. I&apos;ve known Isabel longer than I&apos;ve known Paul. We have the same background, the same interests, the same sense of humour. I know all about her boyfriends and her problems in love. I know her whole family, and she mine. We talk about everything. Or so I thought. I was not even aware that she wanted a child. She had never mentioned it. She is also a few years younger than me. We swapped notes: my problems with falling pregnant, her problems with men. She always fell for men who made her unhappy. She found nice men dull; they bored her too quickly. Noam, her latest, seemed to me to be a nice man. But I had no idea that she took her relationship with him so seriously. And now they are having a baby. It&apos;s as if the love of my life has just run out on me. I feel betrayed and excluded. Sidelined. Angry. Jealous - of Noam, with whom she has become intimate so unexpectedly, and of the pregnancy that has fallen into her lap. Painful telephone conversations follow in which we try to talk things through. I am not the only one who feels left in the lurch. She feels injured by my excessive reaction to the news of her pregnancy. Why is it so surprising that she is pregnant? Isn&apos;t she allowed to be? She had wanted to tell me, even though it wasn&apos;t easy. But when and how should she have done so? I was constantly preoccupied with myself. I could surely have seen it coming, if my eyes had been open. She is already 31, after all. So it&apos;s surely not such an unusual step? I reproach her for not having told me anything. If she only tells me when her heart is broken, how am I supposed to know that she is already in love with the next chap? She should have prepared me. Particularly since she knows how sensitive I am about the topic. A group of us meet for a meal in a cafe in Amsterdam. Isabel avoids me. I am close to crying. I sit next to Noam. I have to brace myself to congratulate him on Isabel&apos;s pregnancy. &quot;You didn&apos;t expect that, did you?&quot; he replies, laughing. The note of triumph I hear in his voice undoes all my resolve. I stumble outside and burst into tears. Noam comes after me and asks what is wrong. I get myself under control again and say to him that the news of the pregnancy had really surprised me. That I had had no idea that they wanted a child together. &quot;Isabel and I considered this to be something between the two of us. It is something intimate, which you don&apos;t share with anyone,&quot; Noam replies. His reaction pours oil on fire. I am now seething inside. Who does he think he is with his &quot;Isabel and I&quot;? He&apos;s bloody well new on the scene! Isabel is the friend I have shared joys and sorrows with for 15 years! How dare he reduce me to just &quot;anyone&quot;! In silence we go back in. And so now I have also insulted Noam, I gather from another of the numerous difficult telephone conversations with Isabel. After all, we had met regularly, we had eaten and laughed together. They both thought that I liked him. And now it seems that I had regarded him as just another casual fling. They had created that impression, I retort. She had never talked about him as the new love of her life. She wasn&apos;t living with him. How was I supposed to know it was so serious? Her response - that I was so self-absorbed that I had paid no attention to her for ages - hits home. She is right. Since my ectopic pregnancy I have hardly had time for her. First there was the operation, then Paul and I moved house, then we got married. Isabel came to visit while I was still in bed; she helped with the painting when I moved; she was master of ceremonies at the wedding. There had been far too much one-way traffic. Her other accusation hits home too. To my mind, she shouldn&apos;t be having a child yet. I should have been first. At the same time would also have been fine, but first I can&apos;t accept. If the sight of a pregnant woman I don&apos;t even know is difficult, seeing my best friend pregnant is simply intolerable. Even if she had prepared me for it, I would have had to dig deep within myself to go through this with her. Since she didn&apos;t do so, let her share this intimate experience with Noam. We phone one another occasionally, but uncomfortable silences develop in our conversations. We do not know exactly what to talk about. The intimacy has disappeared. Noam is right: having a child is something between the two of them. It is their child; I am on the periphery. Or I was. Ten years have gone by since Isabel announced her pregnancy. During those years, Paul and I finally gave up on IVF and went on to adopt two girls; Luisa is now nine years old, Sara is seven. Just slightly younger than Isabel&apos;s daughter and son. And once again Isabel is my best friend. It took us some years to mend our battered friendship, and sometimes I wonder if this would also have happened had I not also become a mother. Whenever possible we spend our holidays together, and as many evenings and weekends as we can. And yes, I must admit that we do chat about the kids while the children play together. Adopting my two girls has been the best thing that ever happened to me, and their wellbeing comes first. But I can&apos;t imagine a life without Isabel. \u00b7 The Baby Void, Judith Uyterlinde&apos;s book about her experiences of fertility treatment, is published by Summersdale", "sentences": ["A group of us meet for a meal in a cafe in Amsterdam."], "title": "First person", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/jul/28/familyandrelationships.family2", "tags": ["Life and style", "Family"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-28T23:10:06Z", "article": "\u2018In the forensic science course I took at university they used photographs of dead bodies. For ballistics they showed us a guy lying on the floor, and his head had burst. With a shotgun, the air in the pellet expands so that if you shoot into the head the skull blows up. It was just mush but there was an eyeball lying there. What made it human, what made it moving, was the detail. And I really wanted to describe these scenes.\u2019 Crime writer Denise Mina is talking about the starting point for her first novel, the award-winning Garnethill (1999), which she wrote when she was supposed to be working on her PhD at Strathclyde University. Mina and her present setting seem a million miles from such gruesome images. This friendly, funny mother-of-two is perched on the edge of a chair in the airy study of her spacious townhouse in the West End of Glasgow. One of her children is rampaging along the wide corridor outside the study door; her partner is baking bread in the kitchen. So far so normal. But those who know Mina\u2019s brilliant but gruelling Garnethill trilogy and the first two in her Paddy Meehan series know that her work is steeped in darkness. The main character in her trilogy, Maureen O\u2019Donnell, suffers and we suffer with her. The Field of Blood (2005), the first in the Paddy Meehan series, has a harrowing account of the murder of a child by older children. Mina\u2019s books have looked dispassionately at alcoholism, incest, mental illness and many forms of abuse. Her new novel, The Last Breath, the third in the Meehan series, is set in 1990, when one of those child murderers is to be released from jail. Meehan, by now a successful columnist living in a posh flat, is offered big money to do an interview with him. She isn\u2019t inclined to do so, partly because her attention is elsewhere - a former lover has been murdered, possibly by the IRA. She has inherited his house and, more importantly, the notes for the last feature he was working on. The plotting is clever, the characterisations deep, and Glasgow is well captured. The novel is another brilliant exploration of the themes of family, friendship and justice. Mina laughs ruefully at mention of her themes. \u2018Every time I write a book I despair because I say to myself, \u201cYou\u2019ve written the same fucking book again!\u201d Crime is a very hard genre to feminise. If you have a female protagonist she is going to be looking after her mum when she gets older; she is going to be worried about her brother and sister; she will be making a living while bringing up kids.\u2019 For her, justice is a more complex issue related to the requirements of the crime genre: \u2018Crime fiction now is big enough not to need tidy resolutions. But an open-ended resolution has to be made to work in another way. The concept of justice goes with achieving a pleasing solution for the reader, one which doesn\u2019t just have the bad guy shot but which answers those questions about what is just. There\u2019s a deep-rooted belief in a just world - and that makes for good mental health - but all the evidence is that the world isn\u2019t just, so people have to shift reality all the time to get a sense of justice. And I think that\u2019s what crime fiction explores in a really deep way.\u2019 Mina came to crime fiction after a contradictory childhood. Born in Scotland in 1966 to an engineer in the oil industry, she lived all across Europe until she was 16, going to boarding school in Perthshire and other schools in London, Paris and Amsterdam. Through friends of her parents in the diplomatic service she frequently attended children\u2019s parties at ambassadors\u2019 houses. At the same time she had a big, extended working-class family back in Glasgow. \u2018My upbringing was middle-class but my parents\u2019 families were both working-class so I had this odd combination of working-class background but in a privileged position.\u2019 She was \u2018famously naughty\u2019 and rebellious at her various convent schools and left at 16. \u2018I smoked a lot and I was fat and quite sulky - that\u2019s a bad mix.\u2019 Eventually she went to university to study law - \u2018that\u2019s a real working-class thing - if you go to university you have to do a vocational course\u2019 - but decided she didn\u2019t want to practise. \u2018I was 19 and really intense and I got quite disillusioned.\u2019 Then she came up with the idea for Garnethill. \u2018I\u2019d read so much right-wing crime fiction where they find the evidence and shoot the bad guy - I thought there must be another approach.\u2019 She always intended it as a trilogy, partly because it was too big a family story to fit into one novel and partly because she liked the triptych form in art history. The completed trilogy - the other novels are Exile (2001) and Resolution (2002) -has received justifiable acclaim, but she\u2019s not tempted to return to her central character. \u2018That would be a betrayal, a reunion tour. And, to be honest, they were really dark books and I got really depressed writing them - I was fucking glad they were finished. I dearly miss Maureen and her brothers but I could never be that intense again. I like to think of Maureen having a nice, quiet time in the Highlands, going off for coffee and making bread.\u2019 After a standalone thriller, Sanctum (2003), she pitched the idea of her current series, which will run to five novels.

And I started writing comics.\u2019 Indeed, she was the first woman writer to do 12 instalments of comic-book series Hellblazer. \u2018I said I\u2019d eat my own guts to write for Hellblazer. They said they hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. The series is about everything I\u2019m interested in: theology, detective fiction, the gothic. The guy who draws it lives in Argentina so I was climbing over walls when I was heavily pregnant to film the sites I was using.\u2019 She sees the Paddy Meehan series as a biography. \u2018Although in this new one it\u2019s not so much about her personality, it\u2019s about the events around her. She\u2019s more stable and static - that\u2019s daring for me. But I wanted to do the series as a biography of a character because I was interested in whether anyone ever changes and why?\u2019 She laughs suddenly. \u2018I\u2019ve met my best friend from 20 years ago through Friends Reunited and she said: \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed at all.\u201d I thought: \u201cGod - all this work I\u2019ve done, all the crap I\u2019ve gone through, all the personality traits I\u2019ve tried to shed and I\u2019m still the same!\u201d\u2019", "sentences": ["Born in Scotland in 1966 to an engineer in the oil industry, she lived all across Europe until she was 16, going to boarding school in Perthshire and other schools in London, Paris and Amsterdam."], "title": "Interview: Denise Mina", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/29/crimebooks.features", "tags": ["Crime fiction", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-07-30T10:20:43Z", "article": "TNT, the Dutch mail group, is planning a further aggressive expansion in the UK and elsewhere in Europe in a new drive to offset its declining postal business at home, it said today.

Volume growth was 37% in the second quarter.   TNT, which has capitalised on the running series of strikes by postal workers at Royal Mail, said organic growth in EMN was up 21.3% in the first half, driven overwhelmingly by its UK business. It has started up a new parcels business in Britain. But mail volumes in Holland declined by 3.5% in the second quarter.   The former Dutch monopoly, one of Royal Mail&apos;s biggest new rivals, has already indicated that it plans to develop a full-scale network in Britain rather than use that of its UK rival to deliver mail. Peter Bakker, chief executive, said today the group&apos;s new strategy would be disclosed in December.   Giving an upbeat outlook for the full year, Mr Bakker said operating income fell 2% in the second quarter to \u0080330m (\u00a3223m) because of one-off costs but half-year sales were up 9.6% at \u00805.4bn and profits up 2.6% at \u0080681m.

Harry Mulisch. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe Harry Mulisch is 80. His birthday was last Sunday, July 29, and there have been all kinds of celebrations in his native Holland, including an interesting homage from his publisher, which has commissioned six novellas from other Dutch writers, each taking one of Mulisch&apos;s own works as their starting point. Over here, though, hardly anyone (with the odd honourable exception) seems to have noticed. Of course, we&apos;ve been distracted by the adventures of a different Harry, but the fact is that we&apos;ve never been terribly interested in Mulisch. Only about a third of his books have been translated into English and even those don&apos;t seem to have been particularly popular.  It&apos;s a pity. Mulisch is one of the great contemporary European novelists. Although he is regularly described as &quot;a novelist of ideas&quot;, that&apos;s an unfairly depressing label; his books are actually rooted in character and narrative. He&apos;s a witty, playful writer, always messing around with history and religion, but never shedding his intense moral seriousness. His non-fiction - which includes an account of the Eichmann trial and a book about Wilhelm Reich - is still waiting to be translated. Every year, his name is among the usual candidates when people discuss who might win the Nobel prize for literature, but that shouldn&apos;t put you off. Nor should the fact that, this year, he was also in the running for the Man Booker International award. He missed the Man Booker, but the Nobel would be a nice - and appropriate - 80th birthday present. Celebrating his birthday seems particularly appropriate, since the accident of his birth presented Mulisch with the theme that has dominated his writing. Mulisch was born in Amsterdam, the son of an Austrian father and a Jewish mother, who only survived the war thanks to her husband&apos;s connections. Mulisch&apos;s best-known novel, The Assault, describes the moral cowardice of the Dutch during the Nazi invasion and Holland&apos;s post-war failure to examine or admit what really happened. The Assault was made into a successful movie, which won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1986. Another of Mulisch&apos;s novels, The Discovery of Heaven, was filmed in 2001, directed by Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 and starring Stephen Fry. At the time, it was the most expensive Dutch film ever made, but seemed to disappear without trace, barely even getting a release in Britain. That&apos;s no surprise. Like all the best novels, The Discovery of Heaven is really unfilmable. It&apos;s big and brash, often irritating, indisputably brilliant, and regularly claimed by critics as one of the best books of the 20th century. Mulisch&apos;s last book appeared six years ago, but he&apos;s apparently still writing. In a Guardian interview published four years ago, he said: &quot;I have the feeling I have endless time. I think you must live as if you will never die. People say you must think each day about death, memento mori. And every book will be your last, and so on. No. Live as if you will never die.&quot; Let&apos;s hope he still feels the same way today. Happy birthday, Harry.

Does this suggest that a) all brown people look the same? or b) there are people in the world who believe Brazil is part of Asia?&quot; This is not your typical pub quiz question, but then the woman posing it is not your typical quizmaster. Artist Yara el-Sherbini is probably Britain&apos;s only Muslim quizmistress. Her quiz nights are the latest in a series of witty, perturbing live-art works which have included her demonstration of how to make a carpet bomb &quot;Blue Peter-style&quot; out of a Persian carpet and a stand-up set of her own transgressive material. And Sherbini is just one of a new crop of Muslim artists whose confident feminist voices are offering fresh takes on gender politics and Islam. They range from Pakistani miniature painters to experimental performers, but share a uniquely charged position, simultaneously confronting conservative Muslims, western perceptions of Islam as intrinsically misogynist, and the male-dominated western art world itself. (If 2007 Turner prize nominee Zarina Bhimji - a Muslim woman - wins, she will be only the fourth woman to take the prize in its 22-year history). Although she&apos;s a practising Muslim, 28-year-old Slade graduate Sherbini clearly feels at home in the &quot;haram&quot; (non-halal) environs of the pub, dealing deftly with any raucous hecklers as she conducts her quiz from her perch on a bar stool. &quot;Growing up in Pontefract there were only pubs,&quot; she explains to me. &quot;In a town with such a tiny ethnic minority population there was no other choice but to socialise in pubs. Anyway, I believe [being a Muslim] is in my actions rather than the pub or place I&apos;m in. For me, it&apos;s not about whether you have a glass of wine or not, it&apos;s about maintaining good conduct and a good attitude, moral values and ethical beliefs. &quot;I&apos;m a very active Muslim, in my faith and belief and that&apos;s harmonious with my British identity, northern identity and mixed-race identity - it&apos;s not conflicting.&quot; Sherbini&apos;s mother is from the Caribbean, her father Egyptian and she spent part of her childhood in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. She says she didn&apos;t set out to be a Muslim quizmistress: &quot;It&apos;s more about playing with this trope of British popular culture, adding a thought-provoking element to the work in a humorous and playful way to get people to engage with the ideas.&quot; In the 2006 group show Who are you? Where are you really from? Sherbini&apos;s work was shown alongside that of Faiza Butt. In Butt&apos;s brightly-coloured felt-tip pen dot paintings of &quot;utopian impossibilities&quot; everyday people are juxtaposed with unlikely celebrity counterparts: a girl in hijab cheerfully embracing Elton John and Eminem; an Asian girl in winter woollies lined up alongside midriff-baring Madonna and a brazen Britney. &quot;They seem to inspire a love-it-or-hate-it reaction,&quot; says Butt, 33, in a gentle Pakistani accent. &quot;Some find them too explicit, others find them humorous and entertaining. By creating these situations, these utopian impossibilities in which two genders or races or classes which don&apos;t normally coexist appear, you raise the question, &apos;Why not?&apos;&quot; Butt left her native Lahore in 1999 to take up her masters at Slade, and subsequently taught there after marrying an Englishman and settling in north London. Many of the characters in her work pay homage to the second-generation British Asian students who Butt went on to teach at an inner-London sixth-form college. In reference to the Madonna and Britney painting, Butt points out that &quot;it&apos;s assumed the kind of sexual liberty these showbiz women represent is in opposition to the [modest] Asian girl I&apos;ve slipped in between them&quot;. In real life, the girl, who wore a headscarf, was a big Britney fan and performed a stunning rendition of Hit Me Baby One More Time at the college talent show. &quot;The main reason for making this piece was to say we shouldn&apos;t hold on to preconceptions about each other&apos;s backgrounds,&quot; she says. Having come from a staunchly feminist background in Pakistan, where she was involved in protests against Sharia law, Butt was surprised by how conservative some of her British Muslim art students were. Many of them objected to figurative art-making because they considered depicting the human form idolatrous and un-Islamic. &quot;In the end I did win trust because I was not trying to provoke them to make radical work and take their scarves off. My approach was more &apos;Keep your scarves on, but try to question things more than you have done as you move into adulthood.&apos;&quot; A contemporary of Butt&apos;s, Aisha Khalid, is one of the biggest names in the new miniaturist movement that originated in Lahore - where she and Butt both trained at the National College of Art - fusing the rigorously learned techniques of Mughal court painters with contemporary art practices. Khalid grew up in the small town of Shikarpur, where her sister wore a burqa from an early age and she herself went to school wrapped in a shawl to protect her modesty. The critic Virginia Whiles writes of the heavily veiled women who appear in Khalid&apos;s miniatures, &quot;They stand invisible yet resolute in their burqas ... Khalid&apos;s work distils a dual sense of oppression and subversion.&quot; American imperial aggression towards Muslim states is a recurring theme for Khalid. Infinite Justice, shown last year at Manchester Art Gallery, is a tantalising sea of cotton threads seemingly suspended in midair - but actually concealing hundreds of sharp needles. A black target emerges in the middle of the soft cloud, a reminder of the title of this series, which was made in the immediate aftermath of September 11. Anita Dawood, co-founder of London-based arts organisation Green Cardamom, which represents many of the new miniaturists, says that Khalid is in a uniquely powerful position &quot;as one of the first artists to have a career in the west without having to leave Pakistan&quot;. This is partly due to the boom in the Indian economy and art market and partly due to Khalid&apos;s fierce commitment to staying artistically rooted in her country of origin. &quot;We are living in Pakistan,&quot; Khalid tells me, &quot;and there are lots of issues there and in Afghanistan and Iran which I can&apos;t just ignore. I start the day with the newspaper and read every little article. My work is a mixture of very personal and political things, not one or the other.&quot; Khalid has a solo show next spring at the Pump House Gallery in Battersea Park, south London, and the centrepiece of her most recent joint show (she exhibits with her artist husband, Imran Qureshi) will sell for over \u00a330,000. But she has not always found the western art market so receptive. In fact, during a two-year residency at the Rijks Academy in Amsterdam, tutors suggested her work was too explicitly political (but only when it was critical of European cultural norms). Furthermore, they were concerned by her habit of sitting on the floor engaged in suspiciously feminised, craft-making activities such as embroidery. She turned the ideological clash into art, making a video installation - Conversation - a deceptively simple film of her hand-embroidering a flower and another &quot;foreign&quot; hand simultaneously unpicking it. Their artistic approaches couldn&apos;t be more different, but Sherbini, Khalid and Butt are all tussling with constricting models of femininity and of Islam. Sherbini insists that self-interrogating Muslim women like herself are more common than people think. &quot;I&apos;m not unique,&quot; she says. &quot;We exist but we don&apos;t have the visibility&quot;\u00b7 Yara el-Sherbini will host her next pub quiz on August 31 at Westow House pub at the launch of the Crystal Palace artists annual art fair. yaraelsherbini.com", "sentences": ["In fact, during a two-year residency at the Rijks Academy in Amsterdam, tutors suggested her work was too explicitly political (but only when it was critical of European cultural norms)."], "title": "Sara Wajid meets the Muslim feminist artists confronting perceptions of Islam", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/01/gender.religion", "tags": ["Gender", "Religion", "World news", "UK news", "Society", "Islam", "Women", "Life and style", "Feminism"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-01T10:30:00Z", "article": "Once upon a time, when men wore their hair long and women didn&apos;t wear bras, calling for the legalisation of cannabis was a vaguely radical request. It was a two-fingered salute to the powers-that-be, a demand that the grey-suited squares clogging up the corridors of power butt out of our lives and let us get our kicks however we please. Not any more. Today there&apos;s nobody squarer than a pro-cannabis activist. These dopes argue that smoking shit is &quot;responsible&quot; and &quot;civilised&quot; and far preferable to the apparently lethal activity of swilling lager on a Saturday night. They&apos;re less interested in legalising cannabis as a strike for individual freedom, than in proselytising about the benefits of cannabis as a means of social control. Over the past two weeks of heated debate about cannabis (not that anyone on dope can ever get properly heated about anything), the main justification put forward for legalising it is that it is Not Alcohol. Where booze apparently turns us into reckless, shouty, uncontrollable wife-beaters, dope makes us placid and polite and about as threatening as a castrated poodle. Many see cannabis as preferable to alcohol because it numbs our naughtiness and dulls our desires, and therefore is better &quot;both for the individual and for society&quot;. The authoritarian instincts behind the pro-dope lobby are clear in its ceaseless attacks on &quot;binge-drinking&quot;. As the author of Clearhead, a blog by a former cannabis-user, puts it: &quot;[Dope users] look upon the average drinker with a feeling of moral superiority.&quot; The Legalise Cannabis Alliance refers to alcohol as a &quot;hard addictive drug&quot;; it talks about &quot;drink-frenzied&quot; Britain, where every drunken Saturday night the &quot;police try to control the streets and the NHS struggles to cope with the alcoholic aftermath&quot;. Some commentators have asked why certain drugs are still illegal when the &quot;biggest drug problem is the sea of cheap booze&quot;, giving rise to a culture of &quot;dysfunctional drinking&quot;. On a news discussion board this week, one contributor summed up the stoners&apos; case against beer: &quot;The drunk = violent, unpredictable menace to society. The stoner = happy laid-back, peaceful consumer of many snacks.&quot; Such is the cannabis lobby&apos;s hostility to booze that the handful of short-lived dope cafes that sprung up in Britain in recent years banned booze from their premises. One had a sign saying: &quot;No alcohol or drunk and disorderly persons on the premises.&quot; Another advertised itself as &quot;a social meeting place that is alcohol-free and free from violence&quot; (we get the message: booze makes people mental!) and reminded patrons: &quot;Will you please bear in mind, alcohol kills 28/33,000 people every year.&quot; They sound more like petit-prohibitionists than radical experimenters. They&apos;re effectively breathing life back into the old Prohibition movement&apos;s argument that beer and whiskey can wreck family and social life, as they create &quot;safe zones&quot; where strictly no booze is allowed. Cannabis campaigners explicitly celebrate the drug&apos;s &quot;pacifying&quot; impact. The Hempire, a dope-smoking online collective, says &quot;cannabis is well known for its calming effects in healthy people&quot; and it can also &quot;help with sufferers from aggressive disorders&quot;. Traditionally, only totalitarian regimes dared to propose the use of drugs as a means of pacifying the populace. Now, supposedly radical dopeheads not only weep about the dangerous sea of booze flooding Britain (sounding like Ann Widdecombe on weed), they also offer cannabis up as a way of mending aggressive tendencies in society. Perhaps this is why some people in positions of authority, including top cops, have flirted with the idea of legalising cannabis: they see it as a safer, more acceptable and middle-class alternative to &quot;binge-drinking&quot;, that pastime of chavs and slags which results only in vomit and violence. Indeed, European authorities have already conducted cannabis-calming experiments on football fans. In 2004, the Portugese police adopted a Here We Blow policy, where they allowed England fans visiting the country to smoke dope, while simultaneously clamping down on drunken behaviour, on the basis that dope would &quot;reduce chances of punch-up between rival fans&quot;. The Legalise Cannabis Alliance celebrated this sinister social experiment designed to modify behaviour through drug-use. It argued that: &quot;If people are drinking they lose control; if they smoke cannabis they don&apos;t.&quot; In Holland in 2000, during the Euro 2000 football tournament, the authorities allowed cannabis cafes to remain open late and encouraged fans to spend their time smoking rather than drinking. One city official said this helped &quot;relax the fans&quot;. Roland Dam, founder of the Cannabis College, a dope information centre in Amsterdam, declared: &quot;There is always less trouble when cannabis is involved. Have you ever heard of anyone smoking a joint and then starting a riot?&quot; Some are hostile to booze because it is a social drug: it involves getting together with friends and downing drinks that make you talkative and rowdy and arrogant and horny. In contrast, cannabis is a mostly solitary pursuit: you do it on your lonesome and it makes you too dopey to hold a conversation, let alone put up a fight. As the Clearhead blog says: &quot;Cannabis users ... tend to be just as happy smoking alone or in a quiet group rather than in any raucous party atmosphere.&quot; All drugs should be decriminalised and people should be free to choose what they ingest into their bodies. But there&apos;s nothing remotely rad in the present-day campaigns for legalised cannabis. In fact, there&apos;s a strong whiff of social engineering in the demand to set dope free in order to &quot;relax&quot; the masses. It fits very well with today&apos;s therapy culture, which seems designed to expunge anger and other edgy emotions from the human mind and to put anything like fighting or rioting (tut tut) off the agenda. Today&apos;s celebration of dope is about emasculating cocky men and women in favour of churning out a generation of wasted conformists.", "sentences": ["Roland Dam, founder of the Cannabis College, a dope information centre in Amsterdam, declared: &quot;There is always less trouble when cannabis is involved."], "title": "Doping the masses", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/01/dopingthemasses", "tags": ["Law", "Drugs"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-01T22:51:28Z", "article": "After two months of torrential downpours, Britain still seems mesmerised by the floods that have swept the country. But all ministers seem able to say, with conviction, is that &quot;lessons will be learned&quot;. The question is, which ones? Some 150,000 people in Gloucester have learned to queue for water. The Environment Agency (EA) has learned that its mobile flood defence barriers are not much use when stuck on lorries marooned in the floods. Energy companies have learned that their sub-stations do not work well under water, milkmen that their milk floats do not, and the National Audit Office that fewer than half of Britain&apos;s cities have drainage and flood protection systems in decent working order. Ministers accept that Britain has 4.3 million people living in flood-risk areas, that a third of the area earmarked for new housing development is on floodplain land, and that some \u00a3240bn worth of housing and economic assets is vulnerable to flooding, but that does not mean anything will change. When the floods began in Yorkshire, I made a suggestion at prime minister&apos;s question time that developers should be made liable for flood damage during the first 20 years of a property&apos;s life. First stunned, then indignant, the construction industry insisted that this would be unfair and economically ruinous. It would make UK housebuilding unaffordable - as though the \u00a34bn of flood damage somehow was affordable. Plunder We live in a culture in which developers and the construction industry are allowed to plunder the present, leaving everyone else to pay for tomorrow&apos;s mess. The Association of British Insurers has reported that storm and flood damage in the UK doubled to more than \u00a36bn between 1998 and 2003. Its fear is that if London is hit, the flood damage could cost \u00a340bn. Development plans for the Thames Gateway, where 91% of new homes are planned for the floodplain, only add to the sense of impending gloom. The central issue, however, is not how we pay the bills for the upheavals climate change is bringing. Rather, it is to ask how we avoid the damage in the first place. We need a minor revolution in the relationship between government and the built environment. Britain sits on a wonderful legacy of Victorian drains and sewers. Unfortunately, we also sit on a backlog of under-investment in their repair and renewal. Faced with similar problems, Europe has taken a much more interventionist approach to planning powers and obligations. In four of the main German regions, much tougher planning laws have been set. A planning application will not even be looked at if it does not include reservoir facilities in its foundations. The logic is simple: if soak-away land is going to be removed, its water holding capacity must be replaced on site. German local authorities can also specify that rainwater harvesting and recycling must be incorporated as design features for all new buildings. It is a provision as relevant to drought as to flood. The Dutch are doing things on an even larger scale. Some 60% of their land is below sea level. They face the combined threat of encroachment from the sea and of flooding from any of the three major European rivers that run through the delta of their country. Already, the Dutch have the highest standard of flood protection in the world. Some \u20ac13bn (\u00a39bn) has been invested in raising and strengthening the dykes over the past decade. But above a certain height, dykes become a problem not the solution. So a new strategy, &quot;living with water&quot;, has been formulated. It will reallocate 1.2m acres of dry land as flooding zones. Rivers will be widened and new standards set for housing that has to be &quot;flood compatible&quot;. From Tewkesbury to Sheffield, Hull to Oxford, there are displaced families who would feel that the Dutch experiments are a dream world, somewhere between heaven and Hogwarts. In the Ljburg district of Amsterdam, floating houses have been built. Not far away, on the floodplain of Maasbommel, the Dutch are building permanently floating and amphibious homes. Anchored to mooring piles rather than fixed into foundations, the concrete-based homes rise and fall with flood water levels. Wiring and sewage is ducted through the mooring piles. In the newest, changes in water level are used to generate electricity to make the houses energy self-sufficient. The Dutch see a future that has to accommodate the &quot;hydrometropolis&quot; - major housing areas that partly float and may be surrounded by water. Tough conditions This is another world from the lessons being learned in Britain. So far, there are no suggestions that ministers will allow local authorities to set tough conditions for building on floodplain land - conditions requiring energy generation, rainwater harvesting, or flood-compatibility features to be obligatory in design. They show no signs of bringing water back into public ownership, making drainage replacement a duty, or including housebuilders in the flood liability chain. To allow the market to distort the future as it has distorted the present is to have learned nothing.  \u00b7 Alan Simpson is Labour MP for Nottingham South \u00b7 Email your comments to society@theguardian.com.

But trading standards officers yesterday warned children to steer clear of the skates after seizing a consignment of 50 apparently destined for UK streets. A hand-held throttle controls a 25cc engine built onto the back of the right boot with a one litre fuel tank. The &quot;cruising&quot; speed is put at 10mph and the skates can whizz along for more than an hour. Stopping is the problem. A shut-off button can throw the user forward. Trading standards officials are also concerned that the plastic petrol tank poses a fire risk. Officials were so worried that they would not be able to control them that they decided against putting them on to test them. Made in China, the &quot;gasoline skating shoes&quot; are not thought to have reached the UK until now. Customs officers discovered the consignment at Southampton airport and called in trading standards officials. David Morton, of Bournemouth council&apos;s trading standards department, said: &quot;These things are absolutely frightening and would have been every parent&apos;s nightmare had they been on the streets, especially as it is the start of the summer holidays. &quot;The engine is in a box on the bank on the heel of the right boot and weighs about 5kg (11lbs). It is 25cc and when you think that a moped has a 50cc engine then it is quite frightening how fast they can go. The skate has an exhaust vent and a cable to start the engine, just like a petrol-driven lawn mower. &quot;The hand-held throttle lever is attached to a 1-metre lead and there is a button which kills the engine and this is the only way of stopping. I haven&apos;t heard of anything like this in Britain before.

In the absence of Wenger, whose private jet remained grounded at Luton airport because of technical problems, Van Persie assumed a lone ambassadorial role before this week&apos;s Amsterdam Tournament but used the platform to launch a thinly veiled attack on Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool, all of whom Arsenal have trailed since 2005. When asked if he would be prepared to revert from attractive football to play for a side who won 1-0 every week and earned more trophies, Van Persie replied: &quot;Small chance. The way I see it, I would never give that up. There are only a few teams in Europe who play the way Arsenal play. I will always play for a team where I earn less money but play fantastic football rather than a team where you can earn lots of money and win every week 1-0, 2-0 and play the defensive style. &quot;I don&apos;t really like that. I play football because I like it. I don&apos;t like to run after people all game long; I like that they run after me. That&apos;s the way I see football.&quot; The 23-year-old was quick to suggest, however, that his commitment to Arsenal was allied to the future of Wenger, whose contract expires next summer. &quot;I don&apos;t really think that he is going to leave, and for me that would change some things because Ars\u00e8ne Wenger showed confidence in me,&quot; said the Dutchman. &quot;The first conversation I had he told me, &apos;Take it easy, trust me, your time will come&apos;, and all those words came true. When he leaves, and that&apos;s not the case, some things for me will change as well.

The Gunners signed the Brazil-born Croatia striker from Dinamo Zagreb following the sale of captain Thierry Henry. Eduardo moved to Europe at the age of 15, and took Croatian nationality in 2002. However, because he had not met the criteria of 75% of international appearances over the past two years, his application for a work permit went to an appeal.

Beamed around the arena were images of Henry, Arsenal&apos;s all-time record goalscorer, lifting the Amsterdam Tournament trophy in 2005. The Frenchman had scored 31 goals the previous season and would captain Arsene Wenger&apos;s side to the Champions League final. It will take some effort for the Brazil-born Croatia international to come even close to filling Henry&apos;s boots but he could not have made a more encouraging start. He looked lively in his 21-minute run-out against Genclerbirligi two weeks ago, could have had a hat-trick against Salzburg six days later and yesterday stole the show with a vibrant performance and the winning goal, his first for the club. Recent months have seen an almost constant stream of negativity emanating from the Emirates Stadium, but Arsenal, and Eduardo had cause to celebrate yesterday. Earlier in the day Home Office officials accepted the 24-year-old&apos;s appeal for a work permit in a hearing at Soho Square. He is now eligible for Arsenal&apos;s opening Premier League match against Fulham on Sunday week. &quot;I was at the hearing today and when I got here I received the good news,&quot; said Wenger, who flew to the Dutch capital by private jet after the hearing. &quot;Eduardo is a good footballer and we have seen that today. I&apos;m happy for him that it did not take long before he scored his first goal and he could have had two or three, like in the last game [against Salzburg], but he had a good performance.&quot; Eduardo&apos;s goal was a firm header past Marco Ballotta from Tomas Rosicky&apos;s corner after he found himself in a similar position as for the goal he scored against England in October&apos;s Euro 2008 qualifier in Zagreb. Although only 5ft 8in tall, as Wenger pointed out: &quot;He is good in the air for a small boy.&quot; Like Henry, Eduardo often drifts out to the left, yet has an uncanny knack of being in the right place at the right time. This ability had troubled Arsenal in last season&apos;s Champions League qualifiers, when Eduardo was playing for Dynamo Zagreb, and he is already showing signs the predatory instincts which some would say Arsenal desperately lack. &quot;When he played against us for Zagreb our defenders said he gave them a lot of work,&quot; said Wenger. &quot;He looked a good player then. He is a player who is very mobile and our game is based on mobility. He has integrated well into the team.&quot; Arsenal&apos;s opening goal came courtesy of Eduardo&apos;s striking partner, Nicklas Bendtner. The 19-year-old Dane collected a ricochet after Cesc F\u00e1bregas&apos;s drive was blocked, rounded Ballotta and neatly slotted into the net from a tight angle. &quot;At the moment he is a raw talent and not completely ready to start in the Premier League,&quot; Wenger said of Bendtner, who spent last season on loan at Birmingham in the Championship. &quot;There has been a lot of interest in him [from other clubs] all around Europe but I want to give him games to see what he can do. He&apos;s an intelligent boy but needs to adapt to the faster pace&quot;. Pace, along with the exploitation of wide areas, was a key feature of Wenger&apos;s team selection. He used Armand Traor\u00e9 to back up Ga\u00ebl Clichy on the left and Justin Hoyte to do the same for Theo Walcott on the right. After Bacary Sagna and Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 excelled on the right against Internazionale on Sunday it is clear where Arsenal&apos;s manager sees his side&apos;s point of attack this coming season. However the centre-back partnership of Philippe Senderos and Johan Djourou gave cause for concern. The Swiss pair rarely looked at ease and Arsenal were fortunate not to concede again after Goran Pandev&apos;s equaliser. Arsenal will learn of their Champions League third qualifying round draw tomorrow and play Ajax here on Saturday.

Like a gas it permeated us, like a liquid it filled us to the brim. Like a sheet of glass, it could be marked or stained by venial sin, or etched by mortal sin - in the latter case, industrial-strength repentance would be needed to make it clear again. Intimate with every part of us, it was neither in us nor of us; when we died, it would go on, without the body. We learned this at the same time as we learned our times tables and how to tie our shoelaces, and most people could grasp the metaphors involved. But when the priest came for the annual religious examination, he would hold out a piece of chalk and ask us to &quot;draw a soul&quot;; there was always some dimwit who swaggered up to the blackboard. Descartes, among others, fell into the dimwit&apos;s error. He thought the soul was located in the pineal gland, or at least that the pineal gland was a sort of information hub for spirit; he came to this conclusion after hacking up a great many carcasses, bought in the butchers&apos; shops of Amsterdam. The idea that the soul can be located, that it can be weighed, that it has colour and form, has persisted into the present century, as Mary Roach shows in her nimble excursion across the frontier into the next world. Is the soul, detached from the body, subject to the laws of gravity, or &quot;relegated to an eternity among the derelict satellites and Nasa detritus&quot;? Does the soul weigh 21 grams, as the title of the Hollywood movie suggests? Could the dead be heard if, as Edison thought, you could make a sort of psychic megaphone? At the end of the 19th century, and early in the 20th century, the air was full of disembodied voices, of invisible rays. Radios and telephones and X-rays were technological marvels; most people didn&apos;t understand them, but no one would accuse you of being a credulous fool if you claimed that your mother&apos;s voice was issuing from a bakelite handset. Dreams, phantoms, omens, apparitions - perhaps these marginal, troubling phenomena could be quantified, analysed, explained? Freud, for one, wanted so much to be thought of as a scientist. But states of mind, let alone states of the soul, proved resistant to verification, and the dead seldom speak when the qualified and accredited are listening. Their communications as recorded by professional psychics are so banal and garbled that they must be regarded as a sly cosmic joke. &quot;How is the weather?&quot; a discarnate entity is asked, in one current, properly funded American research project. The answer comes from the Beyond: &quot;It&apos;s like Florida without the humidity.&quot; Another shy spook confides: &quot;I can wear pleated pants now.&quot; The afterlife&apos;s answer to &quot;Do you engage in sexual behaviour?&quot; is a little hesitant, but can be summed up as a disappointing &quot;not really&quot;. Roach is an American columnist and science writer. She had a religious upbringing, claims to have had nun paper dolls, and engaged in &quot;the meagre fun of swapping a Carmelite wimple for a Benedictine chest bib&quot;. This over-privileged childhood has left her a little too pleased with herself and her &quot;bad attitude.&quot; She is the naughtiest girl at psychic school - a weekend course in raising spirits - and like many psychics themselves, she has a big ego, and can even show off about her shortcomings: &quot;My ignorance is not merely deep, it is broad; it is a vast ocean that takes in chemistry, physics, information theory, thermodynamics, all the many things a modern soul theorist must know.&quot; But she is energetic and canny in pursuit of haunted spell-checkers, spirit orbs, lab-induced temporal lobe seizures, electronic voice phenomena, ectoplasm, infrasound and near-death experiences. Skittish but smart, she knows how to navigate the marshy ground of self-delusion that is found between truth and lies, and she has captured the deep personal unpleasantness of many of the people who work in the spook trade - their aggressive irrationality, their intolerance, their unsubtle bullying tactics. But it is surprising she is not more impatient with her whole subject. It&apos;s easy to poke holes in supposedly scientific studies of mediumship, but perhaps they should not be undertaken at all. The afterlife has become a staple of trash TV and a branch of the leisure industry. It is no more useful to disbelieve in ghosts than to disbelieve in tenpin bowling or portable barbecues. A fair reaction to the puzzle of the afterlife is what Roach calls &quot;the Big Shrug&quot;. She touches, though, on some intriguing topics which could have merited further exploration - voice hearing, for instance, which recent Dutch research suggests is a phenomenon more widespread among the perfectly sane than anyone had imagined. &quot;It could well be that the main difference between skeptics and believers is the neural structures they were born with.&quot; Some people will never see a ghost, and some people can&apos;t help it; reason with them as hard as you like, they will not deny the evidence of their senses. At the end of her tour of the afterlife, Roach believes &quot;not much, but more than I believed a year ago&quot;. It is a mild conclusion to an entertaining book that is best when it is digressive. Her footnotes are a gruesome joy.

At the moment, though, we are not seeing Adams&apos;s distaste or Potter&apos;s despair but a rage about what airports do. The day before I was at Heathrow, two Americans, furious at the wait for passport control, spoilt a photo-opportunity for the head of the new border control agency. Earlier in the week, business leaders had warned that terrible airports threatened the City&apos;s growth and an international survey named British Airways as the European airline most likely to lose your luggage. Meanwhile, BAA showed the insolence of private monopolies everywhere by seeking a sweeping injunction to stop protesters against the new Heathrow runway coming within miles of the airport, an unintentionally telling attack on civil liberties, given that its customers wouldn&apos;t come within miles of its airports if they had the choice. Passengers are infuriated. Environmentalists are infuriated. Nice liberal columnists are admitting to feeling guilty about the contribution their flights to Tuscany will make to global warming, although not guilty enough to cancel their holidays. But I&apos;ve never heard anyone say that they feel angry or guilty about the noise their flight will inflict as it leaves the runway and roars over suburban streets. No one who lives outside a flight path mentions noise pollution, yet John Stewart of umbrella group Airport Watch told me that anger about noise, rather than climate change, drives most members of the protest movements against the expansion of air travel. Just as little things annoy people about airports - the limits on hand luggage, the staff cuts and &apos;a degree of ugliness that can only be the result of a special effort,&apos; as Douglas Adams said - so the unhappiness caused by aircraft noise seems to outsiders to be out of all proportion to the inconvenience. Daniel Gilbert, professor of psychology at Harvard University and the co-author of &apos;The Peculiar Longevity of Things Not so Bad&apos;, sympathises with the afflicted, however. Gilbert and his colleagues conducted experiments to show that intense emotions pass because the brain finds ways of compensating for the pain and anger, but small, niggling irritations infuriate without release. Intuitively, their conclusions feel right. If someone&apos;s partner or child dies, you expect them to feel intense grief, but don&apos;t expect that passionate misery will continue unabated. Indeed, if you met someone whose pain at a bereavement was as poignant 10 years on as it was on the day of the death, my guess is that you would regard them as unhinged. It&apos;s the little annoyances that dig their claws in. Professor Gilbert told me that aircraft noise was particularly grating because it was unpredictable. The brain learns to tune out &apos;things that are constant or periodic&apos; - a steady roar of traffic, for instance - but is thrown by the irregular. John Stewart added that a feeling of powerlessness united the citizens who have formed the anti-airport protest groups. If, contrary to Professor Gilbert, they found the roar of traffic intolerable, they knew that they could move from a main road to a cul-de-sac, he said. &apos;But with aircraft, they feel that wherever they move, the flight paths will follow them. They think there&apos;s no escape.&apos; The growth of air travel and the unwillingness of politicians to tax it mean their fears aren&apos;t wholly irrational. If nice liberal columnists and politicians will wring their hands but still take the cheap flights, the rest of the population will hop on them without a moment&apos;s remorse. Theirs seems a hopeless case, but the new social science of &apos;happiness economics&apos; may give them unexpected power. Despite the publicity, most people still don&apos;t know what happiness economics is and many who think they do imagine that it is a vaguely hippyish dogma of the sort that appeals to David Cameron or Anita Roddick. In truth, there&apos;s nothing soppy about it. Economists around the world are using it to put hard figures on pleasure and misery. To take a very simple example, suppose you are asked how happy you are on a scale of one to 10 and you say: &apos;Five.&apos; The next year, your pay doubles from \u00a320,000 to \u00a340,000 and you say you now feel at &apos;six&apos;. If you are fired a year later and your happiness falls to two, a statistician can claim that your unhappiness, at \u00a320,000 a point, would be worth \u00a380,000. In every developed country, economists are taking the data from government and academic surveys and making similar calculations, but on a vast scale. They are finding that, on average, unemployment brings an unhappiness that is out of all proportion to the loss of income and that long-distance commuting is everywhere far more stressful than previously thought, as, indeed, is noise from aircraft. Dutch economists looked at people living on the flight paths into Amsterdam airport. They found that they weren&apos;t compensated for the noise by cheaper house prices, because Amsterdam, like most British cities, doesn&apos;t have an efficient property market that allows its residents to make neat trade-offs. They calculated that the cost in misery from aircraft noise was about \u00a31.60 per flight. Start a meter running in every house on an urban flight path and you quickly reach enormous figures. In other words, people living near British airports could sue. Going to the courts may seem a fanciful prospect. But no one has ever accused lawyers of being slow to find new ways of drumming up business, and last week Chicago University&apos;s Law School held the world&apos;s first conference on the legal implications of the new research on happiness. Everyone agreed they were enormous. BAA and the airlines seem like overmighty subjects beyond the control of government and customers. But if the happiness economists are right, they may soon be cut down to size by colossal claims for compensation. It couldn&apos;t happen to nicer people.", "sentences": ["Dutch economists looked at people living on the flight paths into Amsterdam airport.", "They found that they weren&apos;t compensated for the noise by cheaper house prices, because Amsterdam, like most British cities, doesn&apos;t have an efficient property market that allows its residents to make neat trade-offs."], "title": "Nick Cohen: Heathrow devalues the price of happiness", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/05/comment.transport", "tags": ["Transport", "Airline industry", "Business", "UK news", "World news", "Heathrow"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-05T12:40:49Z", "article": "Resolution Life&apos;s attempt to merge with Friends Provident is turning into a gate-crashers&apos; paradise. The story so far is that Hugh Osmond&apos;s Pearl Group muscled in on the Friends deal. He has yet to make his intentions clear, though presumably he wants to hitch up with Resolution himself. A crowd of other uninvited - or semi-invited - guests is gathering in the garden ready to join the party, including Standard Life, which fancies teaming up with Resolution, plus Zurich and Old Mutual, who have their eyes on Friends. Who knows where this version of La Ronde will end, but the original marriage is highly unlikely to make it to the altar. A merger between closed-fund specialists like Resolution and Pearl would make more sense than teaming up with Friends, as the resulting &apos;uber-zombie&apos; would have more scope to cut costs and do deals. But Standard is one old flame that Resolution chief Clive Cowdery will find it hard to dismiss. Before starting to woo Friends, Cowdery made a low-ball offer for Standard ahead of the Scottish giant&apos;s float in July last year. He then made a second attempt in November, which apparently crumbled because Standard&apos;s chief executive, Sandy Crombie, wanted one of his own men, Trevor Matthews or Keith Skeoch, to succeed him. The fallout from those talks is thought to have led to the departure earlier this year of former Resolution chief executive Paul Thompson. But the logic of a deal is still there and Crombie is wondering whether this could be third time lucky. Standard has overcome its previous problems and will turn in good sales figures this week. The company wants to move from being a traditional insurer to a wealth manager and reckons that a merger with Resolution could speed that process. There would be obstacles, including raising finance to buy Resolution in a difficult market. Some in the Resolution camp might be unhappy, as Standard would be likely to have the upper hand. Then there is the question of whether Pearl would be any keener on a Standard deal than it is on the Friends idea. As for Friends, Zurich may be a decent prospect. Friends is believed to have turned to Resolution in preference to an approach earlier this year by South Africa&apos;s Old Mutual. French insurer Axa and Standard itself have been touted as possible partners, but neither company is keen to launch an offer unless the price is so low that it would be rude not to. In all the excitement, however, everyone seems to have forgotten about the policyholders, and there are millions of them. Resolution&apos;s army of customers includes those who bought policies from Britannic, Scottish Provident and Royal and Sun Alliance, while Osmond&apos;s come from the old Pearl Assurance and NPI. The most basic question is whether zombie funds are a good thing from a consumer viewpoint. Zombies eat up the &apos;living dead&apos; of the insurance world, big life assurance and pension funds that are closed to new customers. The idea is that they will run the funds more efficiently than the existing owners, so in theory policyholders should benefit. Osmond, for instance, claims to have paid out \u00a3500m to Pearl customers that they would not otherwise have received. But the plans contained in zombie funds are very long-term, so the true costs and benefits to savers will not be known for years. Not only that, but policyholders usually have no control over their funds being passed from pillar to post. This is not satisfactory. Osmond and Cowdery may be fine as owners, but the way the London stock market is going, people could find their pensions being sold without their consent to a Russian oil baron. It would be far better if policyholders were given a vote on the sale of funds, and the chance to transfer their cash, penalty-free, if they don&apos;t like the new owner. Whatever the outcome of the zombie war, the Financial Services Authority needs to keep a very beady eye on savers&apos; interests. Barclays&apos; eagle flies further from the nest As the battle for Dutch bank ABN Amro continues on its twisting path, it is easy to overlook the cumulative effect of the concessions Barclays has made in its eagerness to triumph over Royal Bank of Scotland. It has promised that corporate headquarters will move to Amsterdam and that nine seats on the board will go to ABN Amro apparatchiks, including its accident-prone chief executive Rijkman Groenink. The bank has also given a chair apiece to its new Chinese and Singaporean investors, who came on board to help the bid, leaving the 10 Barclays directors in a minority on the 21-man board. Even its eagle emblem is being knocked off its perch, though who knows whether it will be replaced with a clog or a dragon? Not that RBS and its two partners, Santander of Spain and Belgian operator Fortis, will have it all their own way. If Fortis fails this week to win shareholders&apos; approval for its planned fund-raising, the Three Musketeers will be in trouble. The deal is already less attractive for RBS now it cannot get its hands on ABN&apos;s US business, LaSalle. Provided Fortis does convince its shareholders, the consortium will remain in pole position. Barclays will have to work very hard to get its mainly paper offer up to a winning level - but it may have been hedging its bets.

Held in the Extreme 40 class, the fastest class of boats to race in the 181-year-old event, Robertson displayed an uncanny knack in her first racing series in these ultra-fast boats - a far cry from the Yngling keelboat in which she won gold in Athens. There were 15 races over three days and the eight-boat fleet was dominated by Robert Greenhalgh&apos;s Basilica, the overall leader in the season-long event that culminates in Amsterdam next month. But Robertson&apos;s performance, with her crew of Fraser Brown, Nick Hutton and David Carr, is remarkable as she had not raced a multihull before taking on the role of helmsman of the JP Morgan Asset Management boat and she recorded two first places in this series. Places change rapidly in these boats and the final event saw Robertson in every position during the 25 minutes of close racing. The performance of the British skipper must be compared with the other woman skipper, Carolijn Brouwer in Holmatro. The two are adversaries from the singlehanded Europe class in which Robertson won gold at the Sydney Olympics. Brouwer, in Holmatro, who has moved into the Tornado class catamaran for the Olympics and finished second in the recent world championship, finished just ahead of Robertson in the final, double-points scoring race. But Robertson had a seven point lead over the Dutch woman after 14 races and finished with a five point advantage. Robertson narrowly missed beating Nick Moloney with the Australians, Darren Bundock and Glenn Ashby, double world champions in the Tornado class. They finished fourth in the last race but had an overall two-point lead over Robertson. Greenhalgh&apos;s performance was outstanding and his boat handling was measurably superior to that of his opponents. He scored nine race victories on his way to winning the Cowes grand prix. His crew comprises his brother Peter, team manager James Grant and a fellow winner of the last Volvo Ocean Race, Justin Slattery. Robert Greenhalgh and Slattery sailed on ABN Amro, the boat that dominated the round the world event. In the rather more stately racing typical of Cowes week, Luke Bradley and Peter Harrison&apos;s Farr 52, Chernikeeff 2 was the winner of Class 1 and with it the Glazebrook Challenge Cup. The 52-footer beat the previous day&apos;s winner in the class, Sir Peter Ogden&apos;s 60-foot Spirit of Jethou, with the Australian 60ft Loki in third place after finishing first across the line but unable to hold her place on handicap.", "sentences": ["There were 15 races over three days and the eight-boat fleet was dominated by Robert Greenhalgh&apos;s Basilica, the overall leader in the season-long event that culminates in Amsterdam next month."], "title": "Sailing: Robertson impresses in the catamaran fast show", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/aug/06/sailing.sport", "tags": ["Sailing", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-06T00:37:34Z", "article": "Arsenal could hardly have completed their pre-season schedule with a more vivid reminder of the potentially bruising journey standing between them and a first piece of silverware since the 2005 FA Cup. A sticky evening in the Amsterdam Arena bears little resemblance to a frostbitten night at Ewood Park or the Reebok Stadium but the manner in which Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s side overcame physical, and at times brutal, opponents bodes well for the coming months. &quot;We are more than ready for the season now,&quot; said Ga\u00ebl Clichy, the left-back, who set up Robin van Persie to score the game&apos;s only goal three minutes from time. &quot;When you play for a club like Arsenal, Manchester United or Chelsea you want to win all the games. We know it&apos;s going to be difficult but we&apos;re going to try and be competitive in all the competitions we&apos;re involved in and we&apos;re capable of great things this year.&quot; Dennis Rommedahl, the former Charlton Athletic midfielder who signed for Ajax this summer, was less impressed by what he saw from an Arsenal team who lost Cesc F\u00e1bregas to a throat infection before kick-off and Emmanuel Adebayor, who is set to miss the start of the season with a groin injury. &quot;I think it will be really difficult for them this season,&quot; Rommedahl said of Arsenal&apos;s title chances. &quot;They have a few young players and, though they have experience, they have still to compete at the highest level. I think in Europe it will be even more difficult; they stand more chance in the Premiership. I think there will be bigger and stronger teams who will win the physical and technical [battles] and who will beat them.&quot; Despite taking home the Amsterdam Tournament trophy, which they also won in 2005, Arsenal might easily have left the Dutch city nursing a lengthy injury list before their opening Premier League match against Fulham on Sunday and Wenger will be relieved that his players emerged relatively unscathed. Having remonstrated with Henk ten Cate, the Ajax manager, throughout the second half, Wenger later claimed that &quot;the need to kick Arsenal has maybe gone over the border; it is a well known thing in England&quot;. The Arsenal manager described Johnny Heitinga&apos;s horrendously late tackle on Van Persie a minute from full-time as &quot;a very dangerous challenge&quot;. &quot;I was very disappointed with some of the challenges. I think some players were a little bit overboard, but we kept our nerve.

There was no overreaction.&quot; Van Persie, who as a former Feyenoord player was never going to enjoy a smooth evening, appeared to be the target of provocation and almost came to blows with Thomas Vermaelen on the hour. Nevertheless the 23-year-old scored his fourth goal of the pre-season period and provided further evidence that, fitness allowing, he can compensate for the loss of Thierry Henry&apos;s goals. &quot;Two years ago maybe he would have overreacted,&quot; Wenger said of the Dutchman. &quot;When you&apos;re kicked, the best response is always to score a goal. It&apos;s better than kicking anybody else; let your game talk for you. &quot;He&apos;s really matured on and off the pitch and he has gone through some difficult periods, because he was not always a regular and he had some problems at some stage off the pitch a few years ago, but I think that helped him to mature.

Couple that with the biggest comic talents in the Low Countries and the result, surely, is maximum mirth. Step forward the Amsterdam Underground Comedy Collective, a brotherhood of stand-ups whose number includes the Netherlands&apos; undisputed kings of comedy, Theo Maassen and Hans Teeuwen. Their material is poised between comedy and social rage - particularly in the case of Teeuwen, who hasn&apos;t performed in the Netherlands since the murder of his close friend, the film-maker Theo van Gogh, by a Dutch Islamist militant three years ago. The Dutch, Maassen says, fancy themselves as pretty funny. &quot;But then,&quot; he admits, &quot;every man thinks he&apos;s a good lover.&quot; I can vouch for Maassen&apos;s skills as a comedian, at any rate. He&apos;s a towering presence when I see him on stage in Amsterdam, with a neat line in sly provocation and some mind-bending one-liners: &quot;My friends tell me, &apos;Be yourself.&apos; But that&apos;s just not me.&quot; A celebrated joker in the Netherlands, 40-year-old Maassen once stole the Uefa cup from the football club PSV Eindhoven. (He owned up several years later, producing the trophy live on TV). According to Maassen, and as those familiar with Holland&apos;s sex and drug laws might expect, there are few boundaries to Dutch humour, and a veto on kowtowing to audience tastes. The members of this profit-sharing collective (which seems to include practically every stand-up in the country) &quot;push each other to go further, to &apos;fuck the audience&apos;,&quot; says their manager, Xander Wassenaar. The British attitude to crowd-pleasing confuses them. &quot;People tell us, &apos;At Edinburgh, make sure you make some jokes about the English, because Scottish people like that.&apos;&quot; Wassenaar looks disgusted. &quot;That doesn&apos;t happen here.&quot; So much for the cultural differences. What of the linguistic ones? The Dutch speak impeccable English, but stand-up is nothing if not idiomatic, and I wonder whether Maassen has had to adapt his act for a UK crowd. &quot;More than half of my material is not translatable,&quot; he says. &quot;When I say it in English, it&apos;s not funny any more.&quot; Give us an example. &quot;I have a joke in Dutch,&quot; he says. &quot;The muscle in your anus ...&quot; The sphincter? &quot;Yes. In Dutch, it&apos;s called the circle muscle. So I make this joke, &apos;I don&apos;t understand: my anus is a circle muscle so why are there stripes in my underpants?&apos;&quot; Maassen and Wassenaar fall about laughing. Then, collecting himself, Maassen says: &quot;In English, it isn&apos;t called the circle muscle, so it wouldn&apos;t be quite as funny.&quot; Quite. Maassen and Teeuwen are looking forward to being unknowns in Edinburgh. &quot;In Holland, I bring my reputation with me on stage,&quot; says Teeuwen. &quot;In Edinburgh, I can take them by surprise.&quot; I hope it doesn&apos;t ruin the surprise to reveal that Teeuwen&apos;s shtick involves having sex with a stuffed horse. He doesn&apos;t like comedy that has &quot;a message&quot;. &quot;Humour is interesting enough in itself,&quot; he says. &quot;If a joke is original and funny, you have to think about that a lot harder than some fake political, usually comfortable leftwing statement. The highest form of comedy is if the audience is laughing and have no clue why.&quot; That&apos;s a fine philosophy, but has left Teeuwen in a quandary, because the thing that&apos;s most on his mind isn&apos;t funny and is political. The documentarist and provocateur Theo van Gogh was murdered in December 2004 for making a short film about violence against women in Islamic societies, Submission, with the Dutch-Somali politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Teeuwen claims his decision to quit performing comedy in Holland preceded the killing, but admits the event has profoundly affected him. &quot;I think,&quot; he says, &quot;the country is still in shock. Theo was the symbol of free speech. If there was anything that could not be talked about, he was the first to talk about it. Not cautiously - he would go all the way. So the fact that it was him who was murdered had a great impact on Dutch society. It&apos;s not only Theo. The politician Pim Fortuyn got killed. And Hirsi Ali had to leave the country because she got threatened. So we&apos;re running out of big-mouths in Holland. And some people looked upon me as the next big-mouth.&quot; Teeuwen has clearly agonised over how and whether to address Van Gogh&apos;s killing in his work: &quot;I don&apos;t want to be political on stage, because I don&apos;t find it artistically interesting. But I do want to speak out for freedom of speech after Theo&apos;s murder.&quot; Whether in protest or through fear, Teeuwen hasn&apos;t performed comedy in Holland for three years, although he has launched a career as a Sinatra-inspired lounge singer. Maassen felt strongly enough about free speech to release a spoof single called Doodsbedreiging (Death Threat), after three Dutch rappers were given a suspended sentence in 2005 for threatening Hirsi Ali in song. &quot;I thought, &apos;No, they shouldn&apos;t have to go to jail. It&apos;s OK to say that in a rap.&apos; So I wrote a rap that issued death threats against everybody in the whole universe.&quot; &quot;If you death-threaten everybody,&quot; says Maassen, &quot;it loses its power.&quot; This is clearly a febrile moment in Dutch culture, with the right to offend both under attack and jealously guarded. Teeuwen&apos;s priority is &quot;an open discussion. We live in a society where men and women are equal, and gays and heterosexuals are equal. But certain religious cultures are in contrast with that.&quot; Whether Teeuwen will discuss these issues in his comedy remains to be seen. Theo Maassen, meanwhile, is not so reticent. &quot;Trouble makes for good jokes,&quot; he says. &quot;So for comedians, these are very interesting times&quot; \u00b7 Amsterdam Underground Comedy Collective is at the Assembly @ Edinburgh Comedy Room (0131-623 3030) until August 26.", "sentences": ["Step forward the Amsterdam Underground Comedy Collective, a brotherhood of stand-ups whose number includes the Netherlands&apos; undisputed kings of comedy, Theo Maassen and Hans Teeuwen.", "He&apos;s a towering presence when I see him on stage in Amsterdam, with a neat line in sly provocation and some mind-bending one-liners: &quot;My friends tell me, &apos;Be yourself.&apos; But that&apos;s just not me.&quot; A celebrated joker in the Netherlands, 40-year-old Maassen once stole the Uefa cup from the football club PSV Eindhoven.", "&quot;So for comedians, these are very interesting times&quot; \u00b7 Amsterdam Underground Comedy Collective is at the Assembly @ Edinburgh Comedy Room (0131-623 3030) until August 26."], "title": "How will the kings of Dutch comedy go down in Scotland? asks Brian Logan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/aug/06/comedy.edinburghfestival20071", "tags": ["Comedy", "Stage", "Edinburgh festival 2007", "Festivals", "Culture", "Edinburgh festival"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-07T09:32:00Z", "article": "At the down-at-heel venue where the incendiary genius of Doug Stanhope first blazed, a new star is born.

Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s players suffered from a perception that they could easily be bullied on the field last term but the French defender says their toils have made them steelier. &quot;Age cannot be an excuse for us because, now, the players have to understand how they have to play sometimes,&quot; said Gallas, who has watched stalwarts such as Thierry Henry and Freddie Ljungberg leave the club this summer while doubts persist over whether Wenger will extend his contract beyond the end of the season. &quot;We&apos;ve changed,&quot; said Gallas. &quot;Now we know we have to fight, to be compact and defend very well.&quot; There is evidence to back up such an assessment. Against Ajax on Saturday, even in a pre-season &quot;friendly&quot; tournament, Arsenal were confronted by the aggression and muscle which has alarmed them so regularly away from home in England. There were shades of the strong-arm approaches of Everton, Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers in Amsterdam and yet the Dutch were held off and, eventually, beaten. Both the Emirates trophy - three Internazionale players were booked before half-time against the hosts - and the Amsterdam tournament were won. Indeed Gallas, the vice-captain and an older head who turns 30 this month, has identified increased maturity and resilience in his team-mates this summer which may yet thrust Arsenal, unfancied by many, back among the title contenders. &quot;They are professionals and they have had one more year&apos;s experience behind them. As far as I&apos;m concerned they will be ready this season,&quot; said the France international. &quot;I realised that during pre-season. What I saw during the tournaments - against Paris St-Germain, Inter, Ajax and Lazio - it was different. The spirit was different. Everybody fought for his team-mate and when you see that you realise. I don&apos;t know why it&apos;s changed but something clearly has. I can&apos;t call them &apos;the kids&apos; - they&apos;re not kids any more - but the young players really want to win a trophy. They won&apos;t be bullied this season. They don&apos;t want people to keep saying Arsenal are just young kids. When I train with them I don&apos;t see them as young kids any more. I see only players who are ready to fight this season. &quot;The players understand better - sometimes it isn&apos;t just about playing well. You have to be ready, you have to fight when you&apos;re up against teams who play with long balls. I think this season everyone can compete against that. We can be physical enough to deal with that; I don&apos;t think teams can beat us that way any more.&quot; Arsenal have not claimed the Premier League title since their &quot;Invincibles&quot; swept all before them in 2003-04, and the emergence of Jose Mourinho&apos;s Chelsea, together with Manchester United&apos;s and Liverpool&apos;s continued development, has seen the club finish fourth in the last two years. Now there is cautious optimism at Tottenham that their north London rivals can even be edged out of a Champions League place this time around. &quot;People talk only about United or Chelsea winning the league, though this season will be different,&quot; added Gallas, speaking at the Premier League&apos;s &quot;Creating Chances&quot; flagship community programme event in London. &quot;A lot of clubs will be ready for the title race, like Tottenham, like Portsmouth, like us. So the Premier League will be very exciting. &quot;I&apos;m still confident we&apos;ll finish above Tottenham, though it won&apos;t be easy for us. This pre-season hasn&apos;t gone too badly. The Ajax game was a bit tough but, in the end, we did a good job. That has helped our confidence going into the season. Now we have to prove we can play without Thierry.

However, we then decided to widen our search to find the players that have appeared in music videos, and it appears the line between football and music is a little more blurred than you might think ... First up, there is the new Manchester United signing Carlos Tevez, who is also the front man in a band called Piola Vago, who play cumbia villera, a form of Argentinian shantytown/urban music. &quot;Here it&apos;s all hip-hop, all in English, so they don&apos;t understand a thing,&quot; Tevez told the Times of his old West Ham colleagues. &quot;They want to hear it, they ask me but I say no to them. If they don&apos;t understand, what&apos;s the point of making them listen to it?&quot; Interestingly, Piola Vago managed to hit the charts in Argentina with their song Lose Your Control, a jaunty little number which, according to the Sun, has Carlitos &quot;singing about whipping a girl and begging her for sex&quot;. A little less raunchy is the former Derby, West Ham and Hajduk Split defender Igor Stimac, who cut a record in Croatia as part of the Bohems just prior to the 1998 World Cup. &quot;The country went mad about it,&quot; recalled Stimac. &quot;We were the Bohems and the record was called Mary and Katie - it was just picked out of nowhere really. It was only me and a group of friends but the song ended up No1 for four months! I think the sales were really down to Croatia doing well in the tournament rather than my voice! I sang on the record and played guitar.&quot; Many thanks to Ed Gilbert for this clip of the Bohems in action. Reader Pablo Miguez pointed us in the direction of the former Argentina goalkeeper Germ\u00e1n Burgos and his predilection for music. Burgos, nicknamed El Mono (the Monkey), is the lead singer in a band called El Monos Supreme and he told the Sun: &quot;The buzz I am getting from my football is the same as I get when I am on stage singing in front of a huge crowd. I still love my music and my band will become a full-time thing when I retire from football - but the way things are going that could be five or six years away.&quot; Another player with a band to fall back on if his career inexplicably goes down the pan is Blackburn&apos;s Morten Gamst Pedersen, who fronts Norwegian boyband The Players, alongside fellow footballers Freddy dos Santos, Raymond Kvisvik, Kristofer H\u00e6stad and \u00d8yvind Svenning. Released in aid of the Soccer Against Crime campaign, the single became a hit across Scandinavia. Sadly, the link to the video appears to be broken, but if you can navigate through this Norwegian website you might be able to access it. Equally unlikely, but no less random was the musical &apos;success&apos; of BMD, according to Dave Boham in Amsterdam, who remembered the triumvirate of Benni McCarthy, Mario Melchiot and Dean Gorre attempting to make it big in music. &quot;We formed a group that we called BMD (based on all our initials) and started recording the track Midas Touch,&quot; said Melchiot. &quot;It was a rap/R&apos;n&apos;B record - very swingy, very easy on the ears.&quot; Hmm. &quot;It took a couple of months, by which time we were ready to perform in a club called Escape in Amsterdam. We had two girls doing the dance moves for us and it went off really well, and after that we were invited to appear on television, twice on a children&apos;s channel and also on a prime-time evening show frequented by stars like Janet Jackson and Diana Ross, so we were in good company!&quot; There are several other leads we have been unable to uncover any hard evidence of, so if you have clips of Andy Cole&apos;s video for Outstanding, Toni Polster&apos;s bongo-themed Eurotrash appearance or Jay DeMerit&apos;s Soccer Rocks single, be sure to mail them to us, along with any other examples we&apos;ve missed at knowledge@theguardian.com. INTERTOTO BRIGHT YOUNG THING &quot;What&apos;s the furthest that any team beginning their season in the Intertoto Cup has gone in the subsequent Uefa Cup?&quot; wonders Paul Davison. All the way to the final actually Paul, though just the once - in 1995-96 when a Bordeaux side featuring Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, Bixente Lizarazu, and Christophe Dugarry staggered through an incredible 18 European games to reach that stage before losing 5-1 to Bayern Munich over two legs. That was actually the first year the Intertoto Cup had been officially sanctioned by Uefa, offering a measly two Uefa Cup spots to the winners of its two &quot;semi-finals&quot; (effectively finals since there was no play-off between the winners) compared to the 11 on offer nowadays. There were no seeds back then either, meaning Bordeaux had to win a five-team group stage before playing three knockout rounds (the last of which was over two legs) just to reach the Uefa Cup first round. There were a further six two-legged ties to navigate in the Uefa Cup, the highlight of which came in the quarter-finals when they bounced back from a 2-0 defeat to Milan at the San Siro with a 3-0 win in the return fixture. Blackburn fans beware though: the epic campaign took its toll on Bordeaux&apos;s league form, and they finished their Ligue 1 season just four points and two positions clear of the relegation zone. Two further teams have reached the semi-finals since - Bologna in the 1998-99 season and Villarreal in 2003-04, but none have gone further. THIRD-CHOICE PETER &quot;During England&apos;s group game against Morocco at Mexico 86, Bryan Robson came off injured and threw the armband to Ray Wilkins,&quot; recalls Ruth Relfe. &quot;But Butch was sent off shortly after for throwing the ball at the ref, so who took the captain&apos;s armband?&quot; Easy answer here Ruth, or at least it was for the all-knowing FA historian David Barber. Ray handed the armband over to goalkeeper Peter Shilton - unsurprisingly, it was the first time more than two players had worn the England captain&apos;s armband in the same match. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;After Gary Neville was substituted against Poland, the England team contained no players from Manchester United,&quot; chuckled Martin Kinrade back in 2004. &quot;When was the last time this happened?&quot; It seemed like a really good question - but the answer was actually the month before, against Ukraine, when Gary Neville and Alan Smith were both brought off at half-time. In fact, you don&apos;t even have to go back too far to find when an England team last started without a United player: October 10, 1999, in a 2-1 win over Belgium at Sunderland&apos;s Stadium of Light. For the record, the starting line-up that day was: Seaman; Keown, Adams, Southgate; Dyer, Ince, Redknapp, Lampard, Guppy; Shearer, Phillips. More significant, perhaps, was the last time England began a competitive match without a United player. The answer? That fateful night of June 26 1996, when they lost to Germany in the Euro 96 semi-final. Gary Neville was suspended, David Beckham was six weeks away from changing his life from the halfway line at Selhurst Park, Paul Scholes was a supersub, Teddy Sheringham was a Spurs player, and Phil Neville was sat with his brother on the England bench.

He was the journeyman comic, plugging away at a teensy venue far from the festival&apos;s throbbing hub, and learning to accept, he says, &quot;that I was one among many comics who would only ever work at a certain level, who would never have their own television show or radio show&quot;. Then the fickle finger of fate points his way and Nichol wins the biggest prize in stand-up, the inaugural if.comedy award, which came in when Perrier bowed out. His success was met with a few raised eyebrows, if only because the prize has tended, recently, to reward out-of-nowhere young thrusters. But no one begrudged it him; in fact, he may even be the award&apos;s most popular recipient ever. &quot;The nicest thing,&quot; says the 42-year-old Canadian, on the eve of his Edinburgh return, &quot;was the outpouring of love. I always had this fear that I wasn&apos;t respected, but loads of people were coming up to me and saying, &apos;We&apos;ve always loved what you do.&apos;&quot; It wasn&apos;t always so, as Nichol&apos;s lurking paranoia suggests. OK, so he&apos;s as much an Edinburgh fixture as Greyfriars Bobby. And OK, he&apos;s been Perrier-nominated twice before, the first time back in 1993 with his (now defunct and utterly hilarious) musical-comedy troupe Corky and the Juice Pigs. But this Juice Pig has had his share of career troughs, not least when that band split, propelling a depressed Nichol in the direction of Britain. Nichol calls his performing mode &quot;controlled anarchy&quot;, but that&apos;s not the half of it. He&apos;s an explosion of eye-popping, blood-vessel-bursting, sweat-spattering (and, last year, totally naked) activity, an all-out comedy assault that pummels the audience into submission. It&apos;s an act that will surely one day kill him - or it would do, if he didn&apos;t prepare for Edinburgh by running marathons. &quot;I exercise a lot. And,&quot; he adds (and this is the most heroic sacrifice of them all), &quot;I remain sober all through Edinburgh.&quot; Yet his style was cultivated not in temperance, but in abject misery. The Juice Pigs&apos; split coincided with a crisis in Nichol&apos;s personal life, pitching him &quot;within three months from having development deals with Disney and working with [US station] MadTV, to losing my seven closest friends. And I thought that it all must be my fault.&quot; Relocating to the UK, he funnelled his neuroses into a new career as a stand-up: &quot;What came out was the anxiety, pain and desperation. I was a blast of rage.&quot; The comedy-as-fury shtick worked for a while. Nichol won a Time Out award in the late 1990s and a second Perrier nomination in 2002. But his aggressive manner was beginning to grate. Five years ago, I was terrified of Nichol&apos;s stand-up and would have crossed Princes Street blindfold to avoid him. &quot;Creatively, I was unhappy,&quot; he says. &quot;I had developed this character: a mad fucker who did anything for a laugh. It wasn&apos;t working. Or - it was working so well that people actually thought I was crazy.&quot; The true Phil Nichol had got lost. &quot;I&apos;m actually quiet,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m a homebody. I read books, I play guitar, I don&apos;t watch TV. But I sounded like I was this drug-crazy freak.&quot; Nichol&apos;s salvation lay in the last place most comedians would look: the theatre. A trained actor, he had appeared in Boy George&apos;s musical, Taboo. Then, just as his stand-up self-image was imploding, Edinburgh woke up to a bright new idea. Twelve Angry Men in 2003 was the first of what became a Fringe tradition: the straight play with a cast of big-name comics. In 2004, Nichol starred in One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest. In 2005, he won the Stage&apos;s best actor award in Edward Albee&apos;s The Zoo Story. Thus it was that, before his if.comedy success, Nichol was less prominent as a stand-up, and more visible as the Fringe&apos;s Busiest Man. Last year, as director of the Comedians Theatre Company, he played the lead in Eric Bogosian&apos;s Talk Radio and in his own production of Sam Shepard&apos;s True West. This August, my interview is sandwiched between a preview stand-up gig and rehearsals for the Australian drama Breaker Morant, which he directs. He&apos;s buzzing with excitement about Kenneth Ross&apos;s 1978 play, which stars Aussie comics Adam Hills and Brendon Burns, and tells the Boer war tale of &quot;how the authorities refuse to take responsibility for a direct order that they gave to their troops to kill prisoners&quot;. Nichol is also starring in Tracy Letts&apos; Killer Joe. No wonder Nichol is so hyper. If he weren&apos;t, we&apos;d have to dig him out from under the rubble of his workload. All this theatre activity has fed back into his stand-up, says Nichol, helping him phase out the &quot;mad, drug-crazed freak&quot; of old, and supplant him with less mad (but still drug-crazed) anecdotal one-man shows like last year&apos;s hit, The Naked Racist, a demented account of one improbable weekend in Amsterdam. Theatre has taught him narrative and to be unafraid of meaning. &quot;I&apos;ll never be a heavy comedian who has to have something to say,&quot; he says. &quot;But I want to know what it is I am saying, and to have a beginning, a middle and an end.&quot; This year&apos;s stand-up show, Hiro Worship, inspired by a meeting he had with a Japanese Rolling Stones fanatic, is about &quot;self-respect and stalkers and worshipping things&quot;. It is, like The Naked Racist, a true story. &quot;I change people&apos;s names,&quot; he says. &quot;And I paraphrase for comic effect. But if you add too much exaggeration and jokes to a true story, the audience won&apos;t believe it.&quot; Nichol refuses to accept, or care, that quality might suffer under such a workload, arguing that the reason for his 2006 success was precisely because he felt so active and fulfilled. &quot;My confidence and my self-esteem just grew and grew. I highly recommend it.&quot; The formula works so well, he&apos;s breaking with tradition, by returning to Edinburgh the year after bagging its top comedy prize. &quot;I&apos;m doing everything I was going to do anyway,&quot; says Nichol, unfazed by the acclaim. Past winners may have hotfooted it to the small screen but, while Nichol admits to having had &quot;meetings with everyone in television-land&quot;, they have yet to woo him. &quot;I don&apos;t really know what it is they want from me,&quot; he says. &quot;And I don&apos;t own a TV.&quot;  \u00b7 Phil Nichol is at The Stand Comedy Club until August 26.

Tam Dean Burn, actor Anyone who is having a festival moment and wants a relaxing and contemplative interlude should do their best to grab the table outside Henricks Bar on Barclay Place. It&apos;s a gorgeous little spot, 50 yards from the King&apos;s Theatre and 15 minutes&apos; walk from Princes Street. It used to be the Belfry Bar, but has been refurbished. Get yourself a bottle of wine and enjoy. Just down the road in Leven St is a butcher&apos;s shop called John Saunderson, which does free samples of Scottish strawberry wine at 13.5% proof, which is beautiful (you can buy a bottle for \u00a35.95). And when the sun is shining, head over to The Meadows and grab a seat outside the homespun caf\u00e9 there called The Pavillion, which has great coffee and toys for the kids. \u00b7 Tam Dean Burn stars in Venus As A Boy at Traverse 2 2. Jarkko Lehmus, Scottish Ballet After pounding the stage of the Playhouse or Edinburgh Festival Theatre, my colleagues and I head down to Broughton St, where the glowing purple and neon lights of Cafe Piccante attract the best after-party crowd in the city. This is the funkiest chippie in Scotland, and the menu is as strange and wonderful as the venue, with such house specialities as fried Snickers and Mars Bars - the latter of which I always opt for - served with a portion of the best chips in Scotland, and a cold beer. Come a certain point of the night, the owners have been known to crack open the decks, with DJs, glitter balls and even smoke machines, making it a truly surreal but must-do experience. My only complaint is that the tables are not quite big enough to dance on!&quot; \u00b7 The Scottish Ballet is performing at The Playhouse on August 18, 19 and 20, featuring the world premiere of Stephen Petronio&apos;s Ride The Beast, set to a Radiohead soundtrack 3. Martin Cousin, pianist  Oloroso at 33 Castle Street is a great place to chill out after a show. Inside has a light, contemporary feel, but the best place to be is on its roof terrace, which provides incredible views over the Firth of Forth and Edinburgh Castle. The menu is international and varied, although there&apos;s usually a curry of the day as the place is owned by a local Sikh. If the restaurant is busy during the festival period, the bar also does great food, plus you can order a to-die-for cocktail while you wait. \u00b7 Martin Cousin is performing at Over-Seas House, Princes St, August 21, 22 and 23 4. Emma Pollock, singer, songwriter and guitarist The Jolly Judge on James Court, Lawnmarket, is a beautiful old place, with an oak-beam ceiling, log fire and board games behind the bar. I&apos;m a board game fanatic, even though I always lose, so this is the place for a perfect evening out for me. Also, walking from the Scottish Parliament through Holyrood Park to Arthur&apos;s Seat is the ideal way for any visitor to appreciate the city and its architecture.  \u00b7 Emma is performing at Cabaret Voltaire on August 10 for the Fringe festival 5. Craig Grant, singer in Union of Knives Getting good food on tour is not always an easy thing but luckily Cabaret Voltaire is across the street from the City Caf\u00e9 (19 Blair St), which I think of fondly as &quot;the Nice &apos;n Sleazy of Edinburgh&quot;. It has gourmet burgers, excellent service, cheap, good-quality beers, a nice atmosphere and hot bar staff - if it had a killer jukebox, it&apos;d be THE bar and diner in Scotland.  The Basement on Broughton St offers novelty Hawaiian shirts, great decor, and almost has a Big Lebowski vibe going for it. I was drawn to the tuna steak with lime and chillied sweet potato, and it did not disappoint - it was incredible, and very reasonably priced.  \u00b7 Union of Knives play Cabaret Voltaire for the Fringe on August 18  6. Madeline and Tina Warren, Twinset &amp; Twirls  We&apos;ll be visiting our favourite little food take-away this August - The Baked Potato. It serves healthy, tasty, cheap and interesting food (not just baked potatoes), and it just happens to be vegetarian and vegan. It is also bang in the middle of all the Fringe excitement at the top of Cockburn St, which is full of other interesting independent shops. It is well worth waiting in the inevitably long queues that form outside this friendly place.  \u00b7 Twinset &amp; Twirls, are performing at Club Noir on Saturday 18 August 7. Sarah Stevenson, book keeper, Edinburgh International Book Festival The  Sheep Heid is probably one of Edinburgh&apos;s best-kept secrets. It&apos;s a good walk round \u2013 or over \u2013 Arthur&apos;s Seat (unless you prefer to catch the No 42 bus from Hanover St) and is located in the village of Duddingston. The atmosphere is fabulous and they serve up great food. Folk have been playing skittles here since the 16th century, and it is reputed to be the oldest working skittle alley in the world. The current alley was built in 1882 on the site of the old stable block.   8. Gemma Arrowsmith, starring in Field Study Elephant House on George IV Bridge has the best bagels in town. They do super cakes and excellent coffee. You are surrounded by elephant images in the form of hundreds of ornaments, along with many additional drawings people have added along the wall.  9. Jess Ransom, starring in Field Study  I love going to Favorit on Teviot Place to drink milkshakes and eat cake into the night. When it&apos;s 2am and you can&apos;t face another bag of chips, Favorit can dish up gourmet sandwiches, a pint of Stella or even a bowl of ice-cream. It is a cool place to round off the night and is usually free of the chaos which has swamped most places post-midnight. \u00b7 Field Study, a comedy sketch, is showing at Pleasance Courtyard, until August 27 (except 13th) 10. Brendan Hunt, comedian, Five Years in Amsterdam   There&apos;s nothing better than dancing at Late &apos;n&apos; Live at the Teviot, especially as it usually hosts great bands you have never heard of. A few years ago, I saw The Cat Empire who is now the biggest band in Australia, for what that&apos;s worth. It goes until 5am and it is just the best release for festival tension there is. On past visits, I always used to love a kebab shop called Marmaris on Clerk Street. It has now been expanded into a kebab emporium. For a Yank a kebab shop is never boring, it is a fascinating piece of local culture. \u00b7Five Years in Amsterdam is on at the Pleasance Dome, until August 27  \u00b7 For more information on the Edinburgh summer festivals log on to visitscotland.com/liveit", "sentences": ["Brendan Hunt, comedian, Five Years in Amsterdam   There&apos;s nothing better than dancing at Late &apos;n&apos; Live at the Teviot, especially as it usually hosts great bands you have never heard of.", "\u00b7Five Years in Amsterdam is on at the Pleasance Dome, until August 27  \u00b7 For more information on the Edinburgh summer festivals log on to visitscotland.com/liveit"], "title": "Top 10 Edinburgh festival hangouts", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/aug/08/festivals.edinburgh", "tags": ["Travel", "Festivals", "Edinburgh holidays", "Scotland holidays", "Food and drink", "Bars and clubs", "Restaurants", "Edinburgh festival", "Festivals", "Culture", "Restaurants"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-10T00:04:22Z", "article": "Robin van Persie&apos;s eyes tend to roll in exasperation these days whenever he is reminded of the task awaiting him. Thierry Henry has left Arsenal and the Dutchman is charged with filling the considerable void. &quot;A lot of players would tell themselves: &apos;Oh no, I have to be the top scorer, I have to do what Thierry did,&apos;&quot; he said. &quot;There are responsibilities but I would destroy my love of football if I kept telling myself I had to score 20 goals every season.&quot; It is an approach steeped in realism that befits a changed man. Van Persie arrived in north London in 2004 as a 20-year-old whose fractious relationship with his former coach at Feyenoord, the disciplinarian Bert van Marwijk, had threatened to wreck his reputation. There had been a very public dressing-down ahead of a Champions League qualifier against Fenerbahce while at his home-town club and fall-outs with experienced team-mates in Pierre van Hooijdonk and Thomas Buffel to suggest a talent was being wasted. Yet three years on Arsenal are welcoming a free-scoring team player back from injury who, if he may never match Henry&apos;s 226 goals in 364 appearances, could still spearhead this club&apos;s challenge. When Van Persie fractured the fifth metatarsal in his right foot having equalised in a 2-1 win against Manchester United in January he had plundered six goals in seven games. He did not play again but still finished as the club&apos;s leading scorer with 13. A sublime finish against Internazionale and a late winner against Ajax last Saturday have since given Arsenal both the Emirates Cup and Amsterdam tournament and the Dutch forward with the waspish left foot is relishing life back in the fold. The win in Holland served notice of Van Persie&apos;s new-found maturity. He was victim of an elbow from Thomas Vermaelen and an ugly challenge from John Heitinga which led to the forward being carried off but not before he had scored his 88th-minute winner. Such treatment might previously have seen the red mist descend, particularly given his history with Ajax. Three years ago he was attacked by fans who had invaded the pitch when Feyenoord&apos;s reserves played in Amsterdam and, having feared for his life, needed therapy to recover. Now there was satisfaction in a winning goal and, by the end, some of the jeers from the locals present had even turned to applause. &quot;People look at Robin in a different way now,&quot; said Giovanni van Bronckhorst, the former Arsenal and Barcelona utility player who moved to Feyenoord this summer. &quot;If you compare him now from the boy who made his debut for the Dutch team - I remember him as a wiry, self-confident kid - his development has been tremendous. He&apos;s more consistent now and stronger. He&apos;s ready to take over a role as a leader in the team, both at Arsenal and with Holland, and Dutch fans recognise him as a star player for the future of the national team.&quot; More recently Van Persie, who turned 24 this week, offered advice to members of the Dutch under-21 squad, granting them an insight into the mistakes he acknowledges he may have made himself under Van Marwijk at Feyenoord. He has benefited, strangely, from the trauma of being accused of rape in Holland in the summer of 2005, with the period spent in custody before all charges were dropped. Now, married to Bouchra and with a nine-month-old son in Shaqueel, his outlook is very different. His football has developed rapidly. In the Feyenoord youth team the boy who had grown up in Rotterdam playing street football with his friend Mounir el Hamdaoui - formerly of Tottenham - was a conventional No10 in Dennis Bergkamp&apos;s mould and obsessed with the skills of Diego Maradona. Yet Buffel played that role in the first team, with Van Marwijk using the youngster on the left. It was as a wide man that Arsenal signed him only for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, just as he did with Henry, to return his \u00a32.75m signing to the centre. &quot;Robin has been transformed,&quot; said Wenger. &quot;He has become a great passer of the ball and, for me, has improved to become a complete team player. His responsibilities are more intense now that Thierry has left. Before, it was all on [Thierry&apos;s] shoulders. Now it is more on Robin&apos;s but I don&apos;t want him to worry about that. He just has to enjoy his football.&quot; The maverick has struck a balance between lavish individual skills and industry. He is able to conjure memories of Henry&apos;s brilliance - there was a stunning volley against Charlton last season, and slick spins and finishes from unlikely angles - but has allied those flashes with selfless teamwork. The fact that Arsenal&apos;s strength is now more in the collective should help temper the level of expectation placed on the young Dutchman&apos;s shoulders. &quot;I&apos;ve seen Thierry, Dennis [Bergkamp], Robert Pires and Patrick Vieira all move on,&quot; said Van Persie. &quot;They all achieved so much here but, in football, there is a day when you come to a club and a day when you leave. It&apos;s not about me emulating what Thierry achieved. I&apos;m part of a squad and I believe in togetherness and team spirit. The fact that we play with that togetherness puts us ahead of others in the Premier League. This is a fresh start. I&apos;ve been out for six months, way too long.&quot; For Van Persie this is an opportunity to make up for lost time rather than fill the boots of the departed.", "sentences": ["A sublime finish against Internazionale and a late winner against Ajax last Saturday have since given Arsenal both the Emirates Cup and Amsterdam tournament and the Dutch forward with the waspish left foot is relishing life back in the fold.", "Three years ago he was attacked by fans who had invaded the pitch when Feyenoord&apos;s reserves played in Amsterdam and, having feared for his life, needed therapy to recover."], "title": "Don't mention the H-word as Van Persie fills his boots", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/aug/09/dontmentionthehwordasvan", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Arsenal"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-10T23:20:26Z", "article": "I have forgotten most of my life so far. This surprises me, because I have enjoyed it all so much: the summer days here in my tiny garden by the sea; the oddly quiet companionship of marriage; the coming of winter and the taste of snow on the air; the strangely exotic Christmas tree on the little green outside the Baptist church. Before I came back here to live, I travelled a fair amount and I clearly remember enjoying the journeys I made, mostly to the once melancholy cities of eastern Europe - Prague, Timis ...oara, Sofia, Skopje - though occasionally to other places when someone was needed at short notice: Paris, say, or Troms\u00f8; Buenos Aires, Santiago, Montevideo. I have spent time in most of the major cities of Europe and South America, but I remember very few details and, when I look back, what I see in my mind&apos;s eye is a street corner in Amsterdam or Budapest merging seamlessly into a broad, tree-lined avenue in Barcelona or Madrid: merging, or melding, swimming together the way faces in a dream merge into one eternalised other. The scent of melons reminds me of the fruit-seller who used to ride his cart through Sliema, pausing a while outside my rented apartment to offer me dark, slightly over-ripe melons and prickly pears, like sacs of sweet blood, for my day&apos;s lunch. The smell of dust and rain makes me think of the view over the Neva from my office in Saint Petersburg, a view that has stayed with me, when all the people I knew there, and everything I did, have long ago slipped away into forgetting. I have seen all these places, but I remember them only in fragments, only as glimpses, and I cannot fully separate one from another. It even happens that, from time to time, a glimpse will remain unclassified, its location and time mislaid, till nothing remains but a hummingbird poised at the mouth of a flower, or an early morning cafe with a caged bird on the counter that I think is probably Belgian, but could as easily be Greek. Or perhaps some lamp-lit promenade where, long ago, I encountered a beautiful, dark-eyed woman who reminded me of someone I had met years before: reminded me of her so much, in fact, that, for a moment, I thought she was an apparition, a ghost from my own imagination made flesh and blood, and touched with a darkness that she is never quite able to enter. Peach melba According to Mrs Beeton&apos;s Book Of Cookery And Household Management, Georges Auguste Escoffier created, for Dame Nellie Melba, a dish that &quot;consisted of ripe peaches poached in vanilla syrup and arranged in the centre of a bowl of vanilla ice cream&quot;. Cold Melba sauce, made from sweetened raspberries, was poured over the peaches and the bowl containing the dessert was presented on a dish of crushed ice. Dame Nellie Melba was born Helen Mitchell in the Australian city of Melbourne, from which she took her stage name. Chambers Biographical Dictionary tells us that she &quot;appeared at Covent Garden in 1888, and the wonderful purity of her soprano voice won her worldwide fame&quot;. I never doubted that I would see this ghost again. Even when I was married and busy with a job that made absurd demands on my time, even in the first days of solitude, when I realised that, of all the final states I had imagined for myself, I had never once considered that of widower, I thought she would reappear, not as a phantom, but as a palpable being. I once dreamed that my wife and I had a child, and it grew up to be a replica, in every detail, of this dark-eyed Italian woman whom I had known for less than an hour, 25 years before. There were times when I would wake in the dark and imagine that I had committed some terrible crime, a beautiful, perfect crime that had gone undetected for a lifetime, but must now be confessed and, if possible, forgiven. I would lie there for long minutes in a state of panic, trying to remember what I had done; and it was the fact that I could not remember that troubled me, far more than the notion of having done something terrible. How could I be forgiven, if I could not remember my sin? How could I ever repent, if I imagined myself blameless? Yet I was blameless - and in my waking hours I knew it. If I thought about it, if I considered the facts, I could say: I met her by accident, in the ice-cream parlour she ran with her husband and his mother; I met her by chance, because her children, Vincent and Angela, were at school with me, and if the fault belonged to anyone, it was theirs. Vincent was the classroom heart-throb, a confident, slightly cruel boy with Hollywood-Italian, matin\u00e9e idol looks in the making, and I admired him desperately. He was clever, but never a show-off; he had a wonderful disdain for priests and teachers, which he managed to communicate without ever being openly impolite; he was beautifully arrogant, with that air of knowing something that I could only guess at. His sister was a year older, but she and Vincent were very close, almost unnaturally so. He was the only boy she tolerated; the rest she looked down upon with the contempt of a girl already on her way to developing breasts and a pair of wide, Sophia Loren eyes, and who was therefore an object of bedazzled curiosity for every boy she met. Like Vincent, she knew things; like Vincent, she saw through everyone - and this was their special secret, this private knowingness that they had agreed, at some point in their young lives, not to turn upon one another. At home, they spoke Italian with their grandmother; in that mostly poor town, they had books of their own that were not borrowed from the school library, or a sympathetic teacher. Their father gave them outrageous sums of pocket money and took them in his car to places we could not have visited on the bus. One year they went &quot;home&quot; to Italy, to see relatives, and they came back brown as berries, with the knowing half-smiles of children who have visited the outside world, and had secrets they could have told, had they so wished. Most of all, they lived in The House Of Ice Cream. That was the name of their father&apos;s ice-cream parlour, a play, as I now know, on the family name. It was a beautiful name: della Casa, perfectly Italian somehow, and I thought, when I first learned what it meant, how foolish their father had been to squander that music just for the sake of wordplay. But then, that was part of the della Casa charm, that ability to squander. The sweets they made - peach Melba, Neapolitan ice, knickerbocker glory, banana split - were luxurious and gaudy confections that, in those years just after rationing, seemed extraordinary self-indulgences, and the only way to mark a special occasion, for adults and children alike. Yet it wasn&apos;t the ice creams that made for glamour so much as the fact that these children virtually lived in the shop, helping out, or minding the till, wandering into the kitchens where other children were never allowed, sitting at their own table with cups of coffee and talking quietly to one another in their own secret talk, or calling out in Italian to the women in the back of the shop, to the grandmother, who was only rarely seen, and to the mother, who was more or less invisible. No wonder I knelt down at Mass and, with a lingering sense of committing some terrible blasphemy, prayed, in my own fashion, for them to accept me, to take me in, to make me a creature of their world, however lowly, and for however short a time. The soul is present at the beginning, like mind, or grammar, but it takes a lifetime to emerge fully into its true being, like those desert plants that flower only once every hundred years or so. Everyone is headed towards a specific end, everyone is travelling towards the inevitable: not death, or not just death, but something equally mysterious. For me, it is a memory, a single, perfectly defined moment for which all the other moments have been surrendered, and to that extent it is a matter of choice. A choice made in the darkest shadows of the psyche, perhaps, but a choice, nevertheless. We are, as we grow older, the products of the choices we make, both conscious and unconscious, and the only wisdom we can ever attain is the wisdom to know how the process works, at the most hidden level. Our conscious and our secret choices sometimes contradict one another, that is only to be expected. There are choices we learn to make, and there is the matter of the soul, which operates beyond convention or common sense. The best fortune a man can have is to choose with his soul, rather than with his heart or his head because, then, there is always a secret, there is always a place in his marrow that remains intact, sacred and untouchable, a noli-me-tangere place, like that shadowy place in the garden where Mary encountered Jesus, and didn&apos;t even know who he was. I was shameless in my pursuit of the della Casas, which seems odd, looking back, after a life in which friends mattered little to me, a life in which my colleagues, my neighbours, even most of my family are barely remembered. Perhaps it has to do with what happened that summer. I am not one to believe in simple cause and effect, especially of the psychological variety, but the fact is that I have never had, nor have I ever missed having, any particular or special friends. So why I should have wanted so much to be friends with the della Casas is something of a mystery to me now. Perhaps I was piqued by their initial lack of interest, an obvious indifference that, because they were so much better than me, bore no trace of malice or venom. I suspect nothing is as beguiling to a child as disdain - and Vincent della Casa was a child prodigy in the art of disdain. In fact, it was only through his sister that I ever got to speak to him at all. I had tried for months to befriend Vincent, to no avail. Then, all of a sudden, everything changed. It was late in the holidays: the Thursday before the carnival, as I recall. I was standing by myself at the back wall of the play park, at the single vantage point that allowed me to see into the neighbouring garden, where the Covington sisters lived. The Covington sisters, Martha and Mary, loved wildlife, and they had arranged their garden to draw in birds I had never seen anywhere else: tree-creepers and nuthatches, long-tailed tits, odd, unidentified migrants that had strayed off their normal course. The Covington women were spinsters and they had lived together in that house since the dawn of time. Nobody ever spoke to them; even the baker and the butcher&apos;s boy exchanged their goods for the correct sums of money, counted out in advance and silently handed over on the doorstep. Sometimes, however, if I was patient, I could hear one or other of them speak in a quiet singsong, and I was enchanted by the sound, enchanted by the way they were slowly changing, one day at a time, into the things they most loved. It was Angela who found me there. She appeared at my shoulder, as if from nowhere, and gave me a curious look. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked. I didn&apos;t know what to say. I waved my hand vaguely in the direction of the Covingtons&apos; garden, and hoped that would be sufficient explanation. Angela smiled. &quot;Bird-watching,&quot; she said. I nodded. Someone else laughed, somewhere behind me, and I turned. I hadn&apos;t known Vincent was there, too, watching from about 10 feet away, and I felt suddenly unhappy, as if they had caught me doing something foolish or private. &quot;You like birds,&quot; Angela continued. She smiled patiently, as if addressing a child. &quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;They&apos;re all right.&quot; Vincent came closer. &quot;There&apos;s a carnival, this Saturday,&quot; he said. I nodded. &quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;I know.&quot; The fair came to town every summer but, that year, the council had decided it would be a carnival. To us, it had the sound of new times, of glamour and money and the end of the postwar austerity that had designated everything from sausages to kisses, if not scarce, then unjustified indulgences. Times had been hard and now they were going to be better. If only the powers-that-be had thought of it before, all they needed to keep us happy and malleable was a man on stilts and a parade along the high street, with ponies and ballerinas, balloons and floats, children waving flags and cheering, grown-ups in their church clothes eating candyfloss. &quot;Are you going?&quot; Vincent asked. I wanted to seem nonchalant. I knew how unattractive eagerness seems to people like the della Casas. &quot;Of course,&quot; I said. &quot;The whole town will be there.&quot; Vincent laughed at my quaint expression and gave Angela a meaningful look. &quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; he said, to her only. &quot;The whole town. Everybody except our mother.&quot; Angela seemed annoyed. &quot;I think what my moron brother is trying to say,&quot; she said, quietly, &quot;is, would you like to come to the carnival with us?&quot; I couldn&apos;t believe it, of course. Next, they would be suggesting we all meet up at The House Of Ice Cream for a vanilla sundae before the carnival began. &quot;Well?&quot; Vincent was watching me with some amusement. I suppose I looked as surprised as I felt. &quot;You could come round to the shop. Our grandmother could make us some coffee before we go.&quot; He peered at me, as if he were looking at some alien life form. &quot;You do drink coffee, don&apos;t you?&quot; I nodded. I had never drunk coffee in my life. Angela nodded back. &quot;That settles it, then,&quot; she said. &quot;We&apos;ll see you at our place on Saturday, at one o&apos;clock.&quot; Vincent studied me a moment longer, then turned and began walking away. &quot;Don&apos;t be late,&quot; he called back, without turning around. &quot;Or we&apos;ll go without you.&quot; If I said, now, that I couldn&apos;t wait for Saturday, I would be guilty of a half-truth. The fact is, I was almost as afraid of that blessed day as I was looking forward to it. I spent the whole of Friday wondering what I would say to these golden children, what I would do, how much money I could get out of my parents, whether I should offer to pay for my coffee, and a hundred other minor details of form and etiquette. Today, with the benefit of hindsight, I can see that the day we had planned to spend together would have been a disaster of the kind that makes a person self-conscious for years, if not for a lifetime. As it happened, however, I need not have worried. I didn&apos;t have a date with Vincent and Angela, I didn&apos;t go to the carnival and, betrayed, ashamed, and so liberated from all further concerns with the social niceties, I didn&apos;t have to be anything other than the awkward and solitary child I had always been. I didn&apos;t even get to taste coffee until much later. Somewhere, in some virtual library, there is a book to which my life is one long commentary. Not, I suspect, Moby-Dick or Bleak House, or even How To Win Friends And Influence People. Maybe something more like Household Management, by Mrs Beeton, all recipes and tips on etiquette, the cure for croup or how to get dried bloodstains out of suede. What that book should contain is a matter of some importance to me: no scriptures - that goes without saying - but maybe the odd, more or less dubious, more or less true old wives&apos; tale, some fragments of history and geography, a few tables and logarithms, perhaps, and - of this I feel quite certain - several pages of nothing but lists. There will be some foxing, naturally, and possibly a dark, camel-shaped ink stain on the spine, but what matters is that, somewhere in a margin, or in a tiny, almost illegible footnote, all of my real and imaginary lovers are mentioned by name. When I arrived at the shop, nobody was there. I had never seen The House Of Ice Cream empty before, and it was eerie, standing in that sunlit space, all the booths empty along the wall, the tables by the window deserted, nobody hurrying about taking orders, nobody behind the counter, watching the till. I didn&apos;t know what to do, finding it so still and, for a moment, I felt like an intruder, a burglar maybe - or maybe a ghost. Then a tall, dark, astonishingly beautiful woman appeared from the kitchens, wiping her hands on a crisp, white tea towel as she wandered through to the front of the shop with the air of someone who&apos;d be glad to be alone. I&apos;m not sure that she saw me at first or, if she did, she seemed not to be convinced I was really there, and it made me feel more like a ghost than ever. She waited a long moment, a puzzled look on her face, as if she had found some exotic animal in her ice-cream parlour, and wasn&apos;t quite sure how to handle it. Then she smiled. &quot;Hello,&quot; she said. &quot;Can I help you?&quot; She had a strong accent, but I understood her. It was just that I didn&apos;t know, for a minute, what to say. Her smile dimmed. &quot;Are you OK?&quot; she asked. &quot;You look...&quot; &quot;I&apos;m fine,&quot; I said. &quot;It&apos;s just...&quot; Suddenly I was aware that I was staring at her. She was, I realised, Vincent and Angela&apos;s mother, the famously reclusive Mrs della Casa, who always stayed in the back rooms and never spoke to anybody. &quot;I&apos;m Henry,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;m a friend of Vincent&apos;s.&quot; This wasn&apos;t exactly a lie, but I could see that she didn&apos;t quite believe me. &quot;I was supposed to meet him here. We&apos;re going to the carnival,&quot; I added, having come to the realisation, at that very moment, that we were not. &quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;but Vincent isn&apos;t here. I thought he had already gone...&quot; She gave me a weak smile to hide a concern that had more to do with my presence than with her children&apos;s bad manners. &quot;They&apos;re not here,&quot; she added, a little shamefaced, as if she thought I thought she was lying. I looked around the empty shop. &quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;I suppose I made a mistake... &quot; &quot;No!&quot; She seemed offended by the idea. &quot;I&apos;m sure it&apos;s not your fault.&quot; She shifted awkwardly from one foot to another. She was a very beautiful woman, perhaps the most beautiful I have ever seen, and at that moment, awkward, embarrassed, unsure of what to do next, she looked more beautiful to me than seemed possible for any merely human creature. &quot;Anyway,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;d better get off.&quot; She seemed even more offended by this. &quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;You wait.&quot; She glanced briefly at the back of the shop, as if she were afraid someone was listening, then she continued. &quot;Listen,&quot; she said, &quot;I&apos;m going to make you a peach Melba. Have you ever had a real peach Melba?&quot; I shook my head. I wanted to say that I would have preferred a coffee, but I didn&apos;t. &quot;It&apos;s all right,&quot; I said lamely. I was remembering my mother&apos;s favourite advice to me, offered in every possible situation, an ugly phrase that every child loathes. Don&apos;t be a bother. And the truth was, I didn&apos;t want to be a bother. I wanted to sneak off home and lick my wounds. But Mrs della Casa had different ideas. She had allowed herself to be offended by some idea that had crossed her mind and was off again before I could say anything. &quot;I don&apos;t mean peach Melba the way some people make it,&quot; she said. &quot;I mean proper, the way we make it here at The House Of Ice Cream.&quot; The way she said it, with just a hint of absurd exaggeration, made me realise she had been against the idea of the anglicised sign that hung outside the shop. She was Italian, and she saw no reason to be anything else, I suppose. &quot;The way I make it,&quot; she said. &quot;The best peach Melba ever.&quot; I nodded. I really hadn&apos;t wanted to be a bother, but I couldn&apos;t resist the offer and, besides, it seemed to me that she wanted to make this exotic dessert even more than I wanted to stay and eat it. &quot;I don&apos;t want to be any trouble,&quot; I let out weakly. &quot;No trouble,&quot; she said, serious again. &quot;You sit. Over there, by the window. I&apos;ll be back in 15 minutes.&quot; So I sat. Part of me expected Vincent and Angela to turn up after all, but the thought gave me no pleasure. Suddenly, it was a pleasure to be there, in that empty place, while everyone else was a few streets away, out in the glare of the sun, unblessed by these soft shadows, by the gold of the muted light behind the counter and the quiet that ruled while, somewhere in the kitchen, Mrs della Casa made me a peach Melba the old-fashioned way, with fresh peaches and crushed ice, and her own special raspberry sauce that, when the dish arrived, seemed impossibly crimson. It took less time to create than I had expected, but it was, as she had predicted, a kind of miracle, a magical thing that, sitting there on the table before me, seemed beyond time, beyond the flow of ordinary events and worries, beyond everything but love and art. &quot;Enjoy!&quot; Mrs della Casa said as she presented me with this masterpiece; then she started away, still half-smiling, pleased, it seemed, to have done this one thing for a boy she had assumed must be sad, or lonely, or upset. I wanted to detain her, then; I wanted her to stay with me, so I could let her see that I was none of those things, that I was, in fact, quite inanely happy. &quot;I&apos;m just going to the kitchen,&quot; she said as she passed the counter. &quot;I&apos;ll let you enjoy it by yourself, and when you&apos;re finished, you can tell me how you liked it.&quot; And with that she disappeared, out of the column of gold sunlight where she had been standing and into the darkness beyond. I sometimes ask myself what happened to the boy I am remembering now. Was he me? Am I him? I can imagine him disappearing a long time ago, leaving a space that anything could have filled - a potted plant, a cat, a photograph album - a boy with my face and hands who woke one morning and left the house early, dressed in the usual clothes, with a satchel on his back, a boy who seemed like any other, going about the usual work of a Wednesday morning. He got up, splashed cold water on his face, put some books and pencils into that bag and left the house, but he never appeared in school, not that morning, and not on any of the mornings that followed, a boy with my name and blood cells and hair, dressed in my waterproof jacket and gloves, walking away in the morning rain, his absence at morning assembly green as the scent of thuja, his Latin Primer still buried amongst the slut&apos;s hair and apple cores in the desk he left vacant, four places from the front of the class, between Laura Costello and Tom Morgan, children he had known all his life who only noticed him when he was gone, and only noticed then to wonder, for a few days, or a week at most, whether there was more to the story than whatever explanation they were offered for his sudden disappearance. A short time later, Mrs della Casa returned to the front of the shop. She was still smiling and I knew I wasn&apos;t being a bother, that she wasn&apos;t hurrying me to leave, but I could see that she did have something on her mind. She stood a moment at the till, thinking about something, perhaps working out what she wanted to say. Finally, she turned to me. I wondered if she knew how beautiful she seemed to me, at that moment, if she knew that my heart was fluttering in my throat. &quot;The peach Melba,&quot; she said, serious again. &quot;It&apos;s good?&quot; I wanted to say it was perfect, that it was a miracle in a glass bowl, an impossible event in a world where peaches came from tins and ice cream tasted like wax, but all I did was nod. &quot;Listen,&quot; she said, &quot;I don&apos;t think Vincent will be here for a while.&quot; I shook my head. I knew by now that I had been stood up. Vincent and Angela were probably laughing at that very moment about the trick they had played on me. Or, more likely, they had forgotten me altogether. &quot;But I have to go out somewhere,&quot; Mrs della Casa continued, looking worried. &quot;I have to go out for some minutes, no more.&quot; She gave me an uncertain look, as if she were trying to do some piece of complicated arithmetic in her head. &quot;I can stay here,&quot; I said. I wasn&apos;t sure about this, about whether this was what she wanted, or whether I could do it, but I didn&apos;t really have a choice. &quot;Can you?&quot; She looked relieved. &quot;I won&apos;t be gone for long.&quot; I nodded, sure of myself suddenly. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;ll stay and keep an eye on things. Take as long as you like.&quot; She smiled again at this, though there was a darkness in her face still and I knew the errand she had to run was something she would rather have avoided. &quot;You&apos;re a good boy,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&apos;t know why Vincent isn&apos;t here.&quot; I shook my head. &quot;It&apos;s fine,&quot; I said. &quot;It was probably just a misunderstanding.&quot; Neither of us was convinced. Mrs della Casa stood a moment longer, watching me, curious, a little puzzled. What was I doing in her ice-cream store on that particular Saturday afternoon, when the whole town was elsewhere? Why was I missing the carnival? Looking back, I see now that it was then, at that very moment when Mrs della Casa looked at me with that question in her eyes, that my fondness for solitary weekend afternoons was born. It had never occurred to me before, but I was one of those souls who prefer to be somewhere else when the carnival is passing along the high street, just as it had never occurred to me that unrequited love could be so precise and deliberate a thing, a choice that I had just that moment made, and would continue to make all my life, a private matter that had almost nothing to do with the object of that love. Now the two are moulded into one: solitude, quiet, the unregistered joy of sitting at a cafe window, gazing out at an empty street, the delicious sense of balance that comes of putting down a book and crossing an empty room to look out at the gardens, empty and still in the middle of the afternoon, when my neighbours are out at football games or supermarkets. A cat sits on the wall, a blackbird pauses on the lawn to look up, a shadow forms among the shadows in the holly tree, not a presence but an event, the world happening in its own time and space, outside the mind, unpeopled, witnessed by nobody - by nobody, really. Even if I am standing there, looking out, listening, it is the past I am seeing, the past I am hearing. I never catch up, I am never fully there. I am a millisecond behind the moment - and part of me is further back still, further away, sitting in an empty cafe, watching a woman turn away, hearing her say something, I&apos;m not sure what, then seeing her pass through the double doors and out, in her gold cotton summer dress and her miraculously white apron, out into the street, out into the sunlight, out into... Eternity. Which is to say: into the moment when she stops at the kerb, remembers she is still wearing her apron, and pauses a second - a second, no more - to take it off. It&apos;s only the briefest of pauses, only the slenderest moment of inattention but, in that second, on a day when there had been no traffic for as long as I had been sitting in The House Of Ice Cream, a van came speeding along the road - a little blue van, like the one the butcher used for deliveries - and struck her, full-force, throwing her up into the air and away, out of my line of vision. For a moment it seemed unreal, like a trick she or someone was playing on me, or a rehearsal for something that wasn&apos;t decided yet. Then I heard the noise of the brakes, as the van screeched to a halt, and somebody screamed. I jumped up and ran to the door - and all of a sudden, as if they had all been waiting for something to happen, there were people everywhere: a man bending over the fallen woman, another man standing by the door of the van, where the driver sat, staring at what he had done, in total shock. It wasn&apos;t the butcher. It was someone I had never seen before. I&apos;m not sure what I would have done, or what I wanted to do. Perhaps I would have run to where Mrs della Casa lay, so still, so obviously dead, but someone else had come, also from nowhere, and he was holding on to me, holding my shoulders just enough so I could give in and not move, so I could only stand and stare as, for one long minute, everything stopped, and a hole appeared in the universe I had known till then, a hole that was tiny and white and lit by the sun, a hole that, to any other eye, looked like a clean but slightly creased apron, lying on the Tarmac, where Veronica della Casa had dropped it. I have forgotten most of my life so far. People told me, when I was young, that I would remember more when I was older and I trust that I will. I trust that, as this quiet time in my final home lengthens and deepens, I will stop remembering every detail of the book I just read, or the conversation I had at the butcher&apos;s yesterday, and my mind - stiller now, quieter - will begin to piece together the corpus of my life, moment by moment, year by year, as an archaeologist puts together a man from a scatter of bones he has found in a midden. I look forward to that. I look forward to the day when I pass a girl on the library steps and, because patchouli is back in fashion, or because her hair has been brushed back in a certain way, I will remember myself as a young man, and so solve the mystery of who it was lived in my place, breathing and eating and making love through all those lost years. I look forward to remembering my wife as she was when we met, and not the golden, but slightly distant creature she became later. I look forward to having memories that I can see and smell: brief, but intense madeleine moments when everything comes back to me in gorgeous detail. I rather suspect, however, that I will, instead, continue to live in this limbo of unclassified sensations and mental snapshots till that promised moment when, at the very last, everything flashes before my eyes once more, a whole history unfolding and coming to life behind my eyes in milliseconds, like those Japanese paper toys that, the moment they are immersed in water, blossom into extraordinary and elaborate flowers: peonies, chrysanthemums, lilies. Perhaps then the moment when Mrs della Casa died will be just one of many moments, one flower in a bowl of brilliantly coloured flowers, unfolding and spreading in my memory, one petal at a time.  On Saturdays, I make myself a peach Melba. I make it the way Mrs della Casa made it, or I like to think I do. It never quite tastes as it ought, but then I could hardly expect a miracle of such proportions. These days, I could use better ingredients - freshly picked peaches, fuzzed with warmth and static; organic ice cream; vanilla pods from the Fairtrade store - but I stick to what she was obliged to use, because what I am searching for is not a perfect peach Melba, not a copy of Escoffier&apos;s original recipe, but the repetition of a moment. When I am done, I sit down at the table by the window and think about the high street, about the people elsewhere, crossing roads, shopping, meeting friends, stopping to talk for a moment, then moving on. I have to admit, I feel a certain quiet, slightly detached affection for them all: men, women, children; shop assistants, cooks, hospital porters; police superintendents. I think of The House Of Ice Cream as it was long ago - it calls itself a bistro now, and the della Casas are long gone - and how it might have been, had it survived. This is a scientific experiment, an attempt to fix a soul in place, like a butterfly on a pin, to see it entire and motionless for a moment. I think of sunlight on a plate-glass window and a blue van passing along a street, then I try to slow it all down, to see what really happened, to isolate the moment when I became someone other than I had been, someone other than the person I had been destined to be. It&apos;s the only moment of my life that I remember, and even then I cannot quite see it entire.  Here, from where I am sitting, I can see the garden, where a wave of forget-me-nots flows from under the shade of a currant bush and fades out into the gravel path. I can look up and watch the swallows flicker out from the brickwork on James and John Street, watch them scouting the warm air above the hedges, a constant play of shadows and light, but even as it happens it is receding into the past, it is all going and, when I try to grasp it, there is no now, no present moment, no fixed self to slip into and be, once and for all. I would like to say that peach Melba - the taste of the ice cream, or the way the raspberry bleeds into the ice and stains it a dark crimson - I would like to say that something brings it all back to me, but I cannot. What I taste is ice cream and peaches, what I see is crimson, what I hear is the twittering of the swallows overhead and, after all these years, I still cannot tell where my self leaves off and the world begins, as everything - self and world, soul and matter - falls away into nothingness, beautifully, elegantly and, as it must, leaving me stunned and bereft, and alone in my house, lost, or perhaps merely suspended, in the lingering and slightly overblown perfection of peach Melba. \u00b7 \u00a9 John Burnside, 2007", "sentences": ["I have spent time in most of the major cities of Europe and South America, but I remember very few details and, when I look back, what I see in my mind&apos;s eye is a street corner in Amsterdam or Budapest merging seamlessly into a broad, tree-lined avenue in Barcelona or Madrid: merging, or melding, swimming together the way faces in a dream merge into one eternalised other."], "title": "Summer short story special: Peach Melba by John Burnside", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/aug/11/weekend7.weekend2", "tags": ["Original writing", "Fiction", "Books", "Life and style", "Culture", "John Burnside"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-11T22:42:39Z", "article": "No one in their right mind would spend more time than necessary at Heathrow, but if you&apos;re forced to, cheap beds will be available from the autumn at Yotel, the pod-style airport hotel chain that launched at Gatwick in June.

The public reason is that the treaty is not the same as the constitution - on which a referendum was promised - that was supposed to supersede all previous EU deals, but which was killed off by hostile voters in France and the Netherlands. While much of the constitution has been salvaged, the new treaty is a more modest affair, one in a sequence of amendments to EU practice. Those amendments have never, in the past, been put to a public vote. The private reason is that the government would campaign for a &apos;yes&apos; vote and probably lose. It is precisely because Gordon Brown can&apos;t admit his fear of defeat that the Tories are pressing so hard for a plebiscite. They know that the official argument distinguishing a constitution from an &apos;amending treaty&apos;, while technically accurate, means precious little to a public deeply suspicious of everything signed in Brussels. The more the government is forced to parrot that line, the more it looks as if it has something to hide. But while there are easy points to be scored, leading a charge against the EU is dangerous for the Conservatives. They have to tread a line between standing up for British interests and retreating to an anti-European comfort zone. They want applause from sensible sceptics for talking about democratic accountability, but their loudest cheers inevitably come from xenophobes who think Brussels is a conspiracy against Old Albion. The Tories have not said how they would change the treaty to make it acceptable. And if they think no treaty would be acceptable, they might as well be lobbying to quit the EU completely. Any agreement on co-operation between governments - membership of Nato or the World Trade Organisation, for example - requires some compromise on national autonomy. The new EU treaty is no different, although the compromises are smaller, as former Europe Minister Denis MacShane argues on these pages, than the Tories are making out. They are certainly no bigger than those made in the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties. The Prime Ministers who signed those deals considered their passage through Parliament to be a sufficient seal of democratic approval. The problem is that, rather than be honest in public about the pros and cons of compromising sovereignty for international co-operation, British governments have been consistently cowardly. They don&apos;t make the political case for co-operation - that united in a single market, Europe has enjoyed freedom and prosperity unparalleled in its history, while divided, it lurched from insular nationalism to military rivalry to epic bloodshed. Instead, they pretend that the arguments and the treaties are purely technical and economic. No one believes that, and the result is ill-informed scepticism. Now the government is at it again, hoping that the debate over this treaty will just go away. Perhaps it will. If the Tories overplay their hand and sound too much like Ukip, people might get impatient for discussion of policies that more directly affect their lives. The Conservatives&apos; electoral record as a single-issue Europhobic party is not good. But the underlying public distrust will not have diminished. The moment when a government has to ask the British people whether or not they are on board with the European project will only have been deferred. The fact that Gordon Brown is afraid to ask that question is testimony to a systematic failure of courage and conviction in every government, Labour and Tory, for the last 30 years. They all understood political reality - that the EU requires compromise on sovereignty but serves Britain&apos;s national interest none the less - and failed to admit it to the public.", "sentences": ["They are certainly no bigger than those made in the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties."], "title": "Leader: It's time to tell the truth about Europe", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/12/leaders.politics", "tags": ["Politics", "European Union", "World news", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-12T11:57:51Z", "article": "A couple of weeks ago - and I apologise if this sounds irritatingly rarefied - I was having lunch with a friend, a former Booker Prize judge. We were discussing the formidable problem facing this year&apos;s jury (Howard Davies, Wendy Cope, Giles Foden, Ruth Scurr and Imogen Stubbs) in their search for the finest novel of 2007. Hasn&apos;t it, we asked, been a disappointing year for fiction? And how would they find enough books to muster a longlist of any gravitas? Well, never underestimate bookish types. The longlist, announced last Wednesday, is an impressively robust answer to a dilemma that I find it hard to believe didn&apos;t perplex them as much as it did us. Chucking out the big names - forthcoming and much-trumpeted novels from Michael Ondaatje, JM Coetzee and Jonathan Coe, among others - and replacing them with several writers unknown to even the most devoted disciples of contemporary fiction has yielded one of the most unpredictable and exciting contests for some years. For readers keen to sample new voices unmediated by an excess of hype and criticism, this is the place to look. It&apos;s a moot point whether booksellers feel the same way. In previous years, the longlist has been a flabby beast whose arrival has failed to translate into an appreciable uplift in sales. This year, for the first time, it was scaled down to a more manageable &apos;Booker Dozen&apos; - in reality, 13 novels. The idea, I would guess, was to deliver a nice, tidy package of books for bookshops to plonk on to their front-of-store tables in the quiet summer months. They can still do that, but with perhaps less gusto than if the list had been peppered with household names: the book trade fights notoriously - some might say shamefully - shy of the unknown, unless it is pretty, young and wearing a skirt. The skirtless Ian McEwan is hardly unknown; in fact, he ranks among the most recognisable of today&apos;s writers, hence his immediate elevation to the status of favourite. Nine years ago, he won the prize with Amsterdam, a tiny slip of a book. The victory was thought by some to be a consolation prize for the fact that neither Black Dogs nor Enduring Love had won. This year, On Chesil Beach, another tiny book, is in contention. Will it triumph because neither Atonement nor Saturday prevailed? Its many fans would rail against that simplistic summary, but it is not without basis. My view is that McEwan, a vastly accomplished novelist who can count diligence and clear-sightedness among his attributes, has nevertheless experienced a quite breathtaking over-inflation of his reputation. It is not his fault - it is ours. Other better-knowns include AN Wilson, Peter Ho Davies, Anne Enright and Nicola Barker, my favourite. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to recommend her novel, Darkmans, but I would suggest that you book a month off work and read it with some herbal sedatives by your side. It is brilliant but exhausting, and it is also more than 800 pages long. Of the others, it is difficult to read the runes. One can discern a strong interest in the past (Ho Davies and Wilson have both reimagined the life stories of Nazis, while Tan Twan Eng takes us to Penang in 1939) and in culture clashes (not least Mohsin Hamid&apos;s story of a Pakistani man caught in America after 11 September or Edward Docx&apos;s family tale, set in both London and St Petersburg).

The introduction of Yotel, a Japanese pod-style hotel from the company behind restaurant chain Yo! Sushi, inside the airport itself could relieve the pain for those travelling via Gatwick. Rooms can be rented for a minimum of four hours, but are cheap and good enough to warrant a stay even if you just need somewhere to snooze comfortably for a couple of hours.  At reception, chirpy staff take you immediately to your cabin - there&apos;s nowhere else to hang out. Spread along darkened corridors with no natural light, cabins are designed to resemble business class on a plane, though I thought them more like trendy ferry cabins. Premium rooms are 10 square metres and have a double bed, Standard rooms are seven square metres and have a large single in a cubbyhole. All have a fold-out desk with free internet access, en suite bathroom and plenty of storage in the bedside table, under the bed and on narrow shelves - not sure what you&apos;d put on them though, unless you take framed photos or Royal Doulton figurines on holiday. There&apos;s nothing to do but plug into the flat-screen entertainment system, which boasts 51 channels, 373 albums and hundreds of international radio stations. Mine didn&apos;t work properly and Channel 4 kept flicking off, and I was disappointed I couldn&apos;t get Alaska Public Radio Network: it would have been the perfect soundtrack to my salmon and haddock fishcakes, selected from a scanty dinner menu. Served in a cardboard box, they were similarly proportioned to aeroplane food, but much tastier. At bedtime you press a button to make the mattress unravel slowly from its sofa position, adjusting the lights from sunlight to a moody purple, represented on the keypad by a symbol depicting two pairs of intertwined feet. You&apos;re unlikely to get up to much in these thin-walled quarters though. When Oliver Reed started going at it with his co-star in Women in Love, I cringed and turned the sound down, worried what the neighbours would think.  A giant glass window looks out on to the corridor, and even with the blinds down you feel watched, like you&apos;re in some psychological sleep research experiment centre. And you won&apos;t get the best night&apos;s kip of your life, what with the buzzing air-con and staff giggling and pacing the corridors all night. But overall this is a brilliant invention. If only you could wake up in your final destination, rather than to the nightmare security queues, it would be perfect.  What we liked: Stylish interiors, friendly staff.  What we didn&apos;t: Technology malfunctions, noisy staff. Verdict: Absolutely brilliant, we&apos;ve waited too long for this.

The Vulcan is back and wants to take away your holidays. You might have thought the Tory barmy army had run out of feet in which to shoot themselves. But up pop the dynamic duo of John Redwood and George Osborne to tell the millions of Brits enjoying weeks of sun abroad and days of rain back home that the brief period when we had the legal rights to four weeks paid holiday a year are soon to be suspended by the Conservatives. Today in the Financial Times, George Osborne announces he wants to pick a fight with Europe. Yawn, yawn. Anti-European outfits are always announcing their fight with the EU. Open Europe, which specialises in closed minds on Euro reality, does so every day. According to the latest register of MPs&apos; interests, William Hague has made just short of a cool quarter of a million pounds from speeches in the last 12 months, and he never gets close to a microphone without his quips about foreigners and Europeans from the Les Dawson scrap book of xenophobic jokes ready to be deployed. We are used to Tory fibs on Europe, and the Observer leader on Sunday was right to rebuke Cameron for his dishonesty on the new EU treaty. But obsessing on Europe did William Hague no good when he led the party to Labour&apos;s second landslide victory in 2001. Remember his anti-EU rhetoric? &quot;I warn the British people that if they vote Labour, Britain will become a foreign land,&quot; intoned our William. Well they did, and Britain didn&apos;t. Now the Tories are at it again. Almost every day in August there has been an attack on Europe. William Hague fills the pages of the anti-EU press with his denunciations of the new EU treaty. Now George Osborne announces he wants a new fight with Europe. He says he will break existing agreements with Europe in the employment field. This is in line with the slow leak of the report by John Redwood, who is meant to be guiding Tory policy to new heights. In fact, the only strong point in his report is for Britain to pull out of EU social chapter obligations. Redwood, the Vulcanesque nemesis of John Major, is an obsessive anti-European. He wonderfully said that signing the treaty of Amsterdam (anyone remember that one?) meant &quot;the end of Britain&quot;. I think we&apos;re still here. But are the Tories wise to announce the end of the social chapter? The part of social chapter legislation that really impacts on UK citizens is the right to a statutory four weeks holiday. Paid holidays in Britain in the past were based on agreement, custom and practice, before Labour signed the EU social chapter in 1997 and made them law and mandatory. If Tories pull out of the social chapter then any exploitative employer - and alas there are many more of them around than the CBI and other bosses&apos; outfits care to admit - can decide not to allow workers paid holidays. You would not know it from the rhetoric of ministers since 1997, but it is thanks to Britain signing up to the EU social chapter there are now four weeks&apos; statutory paid holidays plus pay on bank holidays, which did not exist as legal rights before 1997. There is an iron rule of European politics which is that anything good emerging from the EU is immediately pocketed by national governments and presented as a wise and generous action by national ministers: when anything bad happens, national ministers duck under the duvet, and start moaning about the bossy EU commission. But on paid holidays - now under threat from the Conservatives - it is the EU we need to thank, along with the courage of Labour in those far-off days of 1997 when we were proud to be a pro-European party and enjoyed castigating the Euro-scepticism of John Redwood, William Hague and their staff ideologues, such as George Osborne and David Cameron. There is no evidence that allowing families and individuals to have legal paid holidays has done any damage to employers or to the British economy and Labour market. EU rules also protect workers against discrimination and encourage workplace consultation and, again, there is no evidence this has hurt the economy. Only someone with the unwavering political misjudgment of John Redwood and George Osborne would come up with an idea to attack EU rights to paid holidays in the middle of August. With luck, Dave Cameron won&apos;t u-turn on this latest hardline rightwing proposal. Labour should pray that the Tory leadership endorses this return to the unflinching hatred of workers and their unions associated with the Conservative past. We should get every bucket and spade vote from Cornwall to the Canary Islands if the Tories decide removing EU social rights to statutory paid holidays is a vote winner. Andrew Gilligan is no friend of Labour, but he protests in the Evening Standard that the Redwood-Osborne proposals to axe laws which give workers basic rights are crazy. Gilligan rightly points out that the 1974 Health and Safety Act protects all employees from dangerous practices which lead to fingers, or limbs, being cut off, workers falling from dodgy ladders, and RSI being rampant for keyboard slaves. Employers have also had to help with rules on lifting heavy loads or exposure to noisy environments, so that backs would not be turned to agony, or hearing lost. There is a wider problem on Europe that the Tories do not understand. The picture the Eurosceptic newspapers - and that includes most who write on economics and business - paint is out-of-date. Check the current issue of the Economist if you do not believe me. The pages at the back which print stats show the EU currently growing at nearly twice the rate of the US and well ahead of Japan. Britain is up there as a stellar economic performer - EU social chapter and health and safety rules included - but Germany, Austria and Sweden are out-performing the UK. Poland with a GDP growth rate of 7.4%, and the Czech Republic with 6.1%, are doing better than Asian tigers like Korea and Taiwan. In my own constituency of Rotherham, where steel output is vital, Europe remains the most important market for British steel. In 2006, there was a 16% increase in steel exports to EU member states compared to an 18% drop in exports to the rest of the world. Today UK steel is exporting \u00a31bn more in value than under the Tories and the big market remains the EU. We keep hearing that the future lies with China and India but we export eight times as much steel to Europe as we do to Asia. Those who continually decry the EU, and say it has no future, are doing great damage to the UK steel industry. In short, Europe is back. That is why President Bush and his father hosted President Sarkozy of France for lunch at their holiday home in Maine over the weekend. Washington, both under Bush and whoever succeeds, is looking for new friends and partners in Europe. For the Tories to start launching anti-European crusades, whether attempting to do away with the right of EU social chapter rights on paid holidays, or their call for a populist referendum to derail the new treaty (in the process defeating Gordon Brown&apos;s insistence that parliament should ratify international treaties) is a reversion to the form of Tory politics that destroyed the Major government.

The buying spree, which RBS is due to reveal to investors before the markets open today, began last Friday and was completed yesterday morning to take advantage of a temporary collapse in the Dutch bank&apos;s share price. RBS spent \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.35bn) hoovering up shares in ABN at \u20ac34 a share. The deal is likely to cement the lead already built up by RBS and its consortium partners, Belgian bank Fortis and Santander of Spain, in the race for ABN. The banks are in a pitched battle with Barclays, which announced its intention to buy ABN in an agreed merger earlier this year. RBS wrecked the fairytale ending Barclays planned for its record-breaking bank merger proposal with a higher offer in cash, compared with Barclays&apos; mainly share-based offer. The share buying spree overshadowed an announcement by Barclays yesterday that its bid had received regulatory approval from the Dutch finance ministry and main financial regulator in the form of a &quot;declaration of no objection&quot; (DNO). Barclays said the approval showed investors how its proposal was more advanced than the RBS bid, which is not expected to gain all the regulatory approval it needs until at least the middle of next month. John Varley, Barclays&apos; chief executive, said: &quot;The granting of the DNO is an important milestone in our proposed merger with ABN Amro.&quot; The Dutch finance ministry has to give a DNO to approve the takeover of ABN Amro by either Barclays or the Royal Bank of Scotland-led consortium. Barclays agreed to move its headquarters to Amsterdam and cut thousands of UK jobs as part of its merger proposal, angering unions and some investors who have argued that the bank should remain independent. Despite the lower value of its proposal, Barclays maintains that its offer will provide &quot;superior long-term value&quot; for shareholders. It would become the world&apos;s fifth largest bank if the deal goes ahead. Last month it startled investors with an audacious plan to link up with the China Development Bank and the Singaporean government&apos;s investment arm, Temasek, to increase the cash element in its bid. Barclays was able to table an improved \u20ac67.5bn (\u00a345.3bn) cash-and-shares offer for the Dutch bank after CDC agreed to inject \u00a37bn into the merger, should it go ahead, and around \u00a32bn if it failed. The RBS-led consortium plans to break up the Dutch bank and parcel up its operations between them. RBS, which has tabled a \u00a348bn approach for ABN, wants to take the wholesale banking operations and elements of its empire in the far east and China, leaving the retail operations in Europe, Brazil and other outposts to its consortium partners. So far it has won the backing of most analysts who predict that while the RBS offer is more complicated and will take longer to gain regulatory clearance, it offers more cash to investors. Yesterday, analysts at the broking firm Panmure Gordon said the firm favoured the RBS bid because the recent crisis in the credit markets would be likely to hit Barclays Capital. They argued that Barclays had significantly increased its lending to hedge funds and private equity firms that have come under pressure from rising interests rates and a squeeze on lending by major banks. &quot;Given BarCap&apos;s acknowledged expertise in fixed-income and the prevalence of highly-levered long strategies among the debt hedge funds, there is a material risk that some of BarCap&apos;s counterparties may be in trouble.&quot;", "sentences": ["Barclays agreed to move its headquarters to Amsterdam and cut thousands of UK jobs as part of its merger proposal, angering unions and some investors who have argued that the bank should remain independent."], "title": "RBS swoop grabs 3% of ABN Amro", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/14/4", "tags": ["Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-14T15:03:46Z", "article": "Coca-Cola has created a mini-movie to follow up the global success of last year&apos;s Happiness Factory TV ad, which told the story of an animated world inside a soft drink vending machine.

Holland v Italy (3-1 penalties), European Championship semi-final, Amsterdam ArenA, 29/06/00 Perhaps the biggest myth in football is the glorious 0-0. For most fans they are an article of faith: a match doesn&apos;t need goals to be great. Anyone who points out the truth - for every classic scoreless draw there are at least 100 stinkers - is seen as heretic or a lightweight; someone that doesn&apos;t really understand the game. Yet Holland v Italy was that rare thing: a 0-0 draw that was truly thrilling. Holland, the hosts and overwhelming favourites, dominated the early exchanges. By the half-hour they had enjoyed 70% possession and come close to scoring twice, with Dennis Bergkamp hitting the post and Patrick Kluivert shooting straight at Francesco Toldo. Italy were clinging on with 11 men, and they were soon to be clinging on with 10 after Gianluca Zambrotta saw a second yellow for tripping Bolo Zenden. Things quickly got worse for Italy when, three minutes later, Alessandro Nesta tugged Kluivert&apos;s shirt in the area. Yet somehow Toldo stretched his 6ft 5in frame to brilliantly save Frank de Boer&apos;s penalty. The pattern of the match was now hammered in stone: Holland attacking, Italy sitting back, soaking it up. Just past the hour, Holland won another penalty when Mark Iuliano chopped down Edgar Davids. This time Kluivert stepped up ... and stroked it against a post. As the match went on, Holland attacks became wilder, more ragged, like a fighter who doesn&apos;t understand why his inferior opponent won&apos;t go down. Three times they were nearly sucker-punched by the substitute Marco Delvecchio. In the end it went to penalties between the world&apos;s biggest shootout bottlers; the Dutch missed three from four to make it five out of six overall. One of the great rearguard efforts was complete. Sean Ingle 2. Arsenal v Real Madrid, Champions League last 16, Highbury, 08/03/06 With attacking line-ups out of fashion and safety-first counter-attack in vogue, most Champions League stalemates are less worth revisiting than the leftovers of last night&apos;s chicken doner. Real Madrid&apos;s trip to Arsenal last March, however, is the exception. After Arsenal&apos;s 1-0 win at the Bernab\u00e9u, Real had no choice but to attack; the Gunners, knowing their side&apos;s strength lay up front, simply chose to. With the stakes raised by both sides&apos; miserable domestic campaigns, nervous energy drove players about Highbury&apos;s narrow confines at 100mph from first whistle to last. Even with seconds to go, when Robert Pires took advantage of Iker Casillas coming forward for a corner to launch a ball towards goal from 60 yards, Roberto Carlos still found the legs to chase the ball down at the goalline. But what the nerves added in adrenaline they took away in composure. After five minutes Ronaldo failed to put away a header when unmarked five yards out, and a charging posse of Real defenders contrived to lay an inviting ball into the path of Jose Reyes only for him to blast wide. That neither side scored was testament only to great goalkeeping and errant finishing; the chances were almost constant. Reyes smacked the bar before Thierry Henry demanded a full-stretch fingertip save from Casillas and Philippe Senderos shanked a low cross just over his own bar. Raul is probably still trying to work out how Jens Lehmann denied him after his delicious initial volley cannoned off the inside of the post. The Arsenal fans present couldn&apos;t have cared less. Paolo Bandini 3. Werder Bremen v Bayern Munich, Bundesliga, Weserstadion, 22/04/86 This was the sort of genuine title decider for which Sky would probably produce a commemorative Advent calendar. With two games to go (and in the days of two points for a win), Werder were two clear of Bayern as they prepared to host them, but Bayern had a superior goal difference. So if Werder won the fat lady could do as she pleased; a draw and it was status quo; a Bayern win and the title was in their hands. There was history between the sides, and you didn&apos;t need Larry David to sense rancour right from the off. But a stinker of a game had a spray of something dramatic a minute from time, when Bayern&apos;s Soren Lerby was harshly found guilty of handball. Up stepped Michael Kutzop, who was as sure a thing from the spot as Matthew Le Tissier: he had scored eight out of eight that season, and 22 in a row at his previous club Offenbacher Kickers. But his foolproof plan was to wait for the keeper to move, so Bayern&apos;s Jean-Marie Pfaff stood still. Kutzop, whose heart was anything but still, was so frazzled that he struck it against the post. Bayern lived to fight another day - four days later, in fact, when they took the title by routing Borussia Monchengladbach while Bremen completed their Devon Loch tribute by losing at VfB Stuttgart. Rob Smyth 4. Italy v England 1997, World Cup qualifier, Olympic Stadium, 11/10/97 Playing for a draw comes about as naturally to the English as dignity, sobriety and magnanimity. But a draw was all Glenn Hoddle&apos;s side needed in Rome to qualify for the 1998 World Cup ahead of Italy (who would ultimately get there through a play-off) on a ground where the Italians had won all 15 of their World Cup qualifiers. When in Rome... And so it was that England got their draw with a startlingly sophisticated demonstration of the art of catenaccio; they were exceptional not just in their ability to effortlessly neuter a good Italian attack - Christian Vieri put a header wide in injury time but that was about it - but also to retain possession with real maturity in what turned out to be Paul Gascoigne&apos;s last hurrah. It was heady and, for England, unprecedented stuff. The back three of Tony Adams, Sol Campbell and Gareth Southgate were immense, while David Batty, a bouncer with a lot more brains than he was given credit for, and Paul Ince stood in front of them, taking the force of the Italian blows. That included a Demetrio Albertini elbow that led to Ince playing nearly 80 minutes of the match with a bandage wrapped around his weeping forehead (prompting Gazza, as dumb off the field as he had been intelligent on it, to make the moronic comment that he looked like a pint of Guinness). Plenty of pints of that and more were sunk during and after this game. Like all famous English triumphs, it was soaked in blood, sweat and beers. But, refreshingly, there was nothing English about the way it was achieved. RS 5. Ivory Coast v Ghana (11-10 penalties), African Cup of Nations final, Stade de l&apos;Amiti\u00e9, 26/01/92 Eight years earlier, when they&apos;d hosted the tournament, Ivory Coast had expected to win the trophy for the first time but instead they fell in the group stages. The Elephants&apos; elimination deflated public interest to such an extent that the country&apos;s president announced that admission to the final (between Cameroon and Nigeria) would be free. He also took to the airwaves to reassure his compatriots that the Elephants were guilty only of inexperience and would soon come of age. In 1992, his prophecy was fulfilled. The Ivorians made it to the final without conceding a goal. But Ghana, making a record seventh appearance in the final, were the favourites, even without the brilliant Abedi Pel\u00e9, who was suspended after being booked during the semi-final win over Nigeria. The Ivorian defence shackled Tony Yeboah and Nii Lamptey, keeping yet another clean sheet and taking a match that was high on intensity but short on drama into a famous penalty shoot-out that would make up for the unspectacular fare that had preceded it. Joel Tiehi and Isaac Asare missed one for each side but every other player - including both keepers - scored expertly. For the first time in international football history, players would have to take a second: when the Ivorians netted theirs, Ghana turned to experienced defender Tony Baffoe - whose penalty was saved. Who&apos;d have thought he was born in Germany? Paul Doyle 6. Real Madrid v Manchester United, Champions League quarter-final, Bernab\u00e9u, 04/04/00 Theory has it that a goalless draw away from home in Europe is an excellent result, but it hasn&apos;t been for Manchester United in the Ferguson era. Having been defeated in previous seasons by Rotor Volgograd and Monaco after first-leg away 0-0s, Sir Alex foolishly declared himself content to emerge from the Bernab\u00e9u with Mark Bosnich&apos;s goal unscathed. But United should have gone out to win the tie there and then in Madrid - they were reigning European champions, 10 points clear in the Premier League and scored 19 goals in their four games either side of the match in Spain. Real were in disarray, struggling merely to qualify for the following year&apos;s Champions League. Indeed, so wary were the Spaniards that on the morning of the game Marca published a front page comprising 14 lines of the same phrase: &apos;No nos asusta el Manchester&apos; (We are not afraid of Manchester). United, however, played cagily on the counter-attack, allowing the underdogs to regain their bark and their bite during a game of the highest technical quality. Real, in the middle of a five-year period in which they won the competition three times, had nothing to lose and, inspired by Steve McManaman and with the front two of Raul and Fernando Morientes at their most telepathic, besieged United&apos;s goal. Bosnich was forced to produce his most memorable performance in a United shirt, making brilliant save after brilliant save. At the other end 18-year-old Iker Casillas denied Andy Cole, who also missed a great headed chance early on, but Real had lost their inferiority complex and all that was lacking was the finishing touch that Raul would apply so deftly in the return at Old Trafford.

Well it&apos;s fifth versus sixth from last season at a sodden White Hart Lane, and after making canny additions to his side, David Moyes must fancy his chances of going one better than Martin Jol this season. He&apos;ll need his squad to stay injury-free to do it, but with once-a-red-now-a-blue Leighton Baines coming in at left-back and jack-of-all-trades Phil Jagielka offering cover to a strong defence and midfield, if Andy Johnson can find his shooting boots they&apos;ve got a chance. Martin Jol meanwhile, has more firepower than a US Navy warship and with Darren Bent starting tonight alongside Robbie Keane and Dimitar Berbatov he&apos;ll be hoping that his side&apos;s opening day defeat to Sunderland was just an early season blip. It&apos;s in defence where Spurs are short through injury, and despite collecting about 48 midfielders in three years, big Martin Jol still hasn&apos;t found one with the attacking nous of Tim Cahill or the assuredness and class of Mikel Arteta. It&apos;ll be an intriguing contest and I expect Everton to play on the break while Spurs will dominate possession. Excepting Roy Keane, this match also pairs the two Premier League managers you&apos;d least like to meet down an alley in the seedy early hours after a night on the ale.

While Spurs fan John Lally laments being stuck in a bar - presumably with a laptop and wireless connection - in New York instead of North London where it&apos;s wet and cold? It&apos;s not a bad second choice John. Sorry John, just realised you said &quot;stuck at your desk&quot; not bar. I think that&apos;s wishful thinking on my part. &quot;Moyes would get a few shots in - maybe Jol would lose an eye, but then big Mart would get close enough, and snap Moyes like a twig..... Nice eh?&quot; says Mark Cruise. Yeah, nice indeed Mark. Have you been watching Jean Claude Van Damme&apos;s Double Impact? 1 min Mark Halsey blows his whistle very hard indeed and we&apos;re underway. Keane and Berbatov connect well on the right and send Bent down the flank but Everton snuff out the danger. Goal!!! Spurs 0-1 Everton (Lescott 2 mins) What a start, as Everton win a free-kick on the right and Arteta whips it in perfectly for Lescott who heads down hard without a decent challenge to put Everton 1-0 up. 4 mins Stalteri has been caught out a couple of times already at left-back.It was his rash challenge that led to the Everton free-kick. 7 mins Spurs have come back strongly and are pulling Everton&apos;s defence around with some nifty movement from their attacking trio. 9 mins Bent hits a great shot across Howard who makes a smart save and Yobo scrambles Malbranque&apos;s follow-up clear. It&apos;s started at a right old pace this one. 11 mins Spurs are starting to dominate possession. Malbranque throws a reckless tackle in on Arteta midway inside the Spurs half and Arteta prepares to swing in another free-kick but he uncharacteristically send it high into the stands. 14 mins Andy Johnson chases a lost cause and creates a chance for Anichebe. But he hits it low and hard straight into the spongy midriff of Robinson. 16 mins Keane finds Malbranque in the Everton 18-yard box with a clever chipped pass but Yobo clatters into the Frenchman and takes the ball and everything within six yards of him to clear the danger. 19 mins A pulled hamstring forces Younes Kaboul off. He&apos;s replaced by Ricardo Rocha who immediately makes a superb tackle on Andy Johnson as he races down the flank. Spurs break and Zokora blasts high into the stands. 20 mins Steptoe, sorry, Phil Neville, crosses to little Leon Osman who does his best impression of Tim Cahill (to please Gary Naylor, no doubt) by jumping and heading just over the Spurs bar. 23 mins Spurs are dominating posession but their final ball is lacking. Jenas has wasted two good opportunities to cross. 25 mins The Tottenham faithful are taunting Everton with chants of &quot;hoof&quot; everytime they clear the ball. Goal!!! Spurs 1-1 Everton (Gardner 26 mins) Anthony Gardner does to Lescott what Lescott did to him by losing him in the box and scoring a carbon copy header for Spurs. Andy Gray does his best to avoid saying &quot;it&apos;s a funny old game.&quot; 29 mins Spurs fans celebrate by taunting Everton fans with chants of &quot;sign on.&quot; Strange bunch in North London. Now they&apos;re quieter than they were when they were losing. 32 mins Everton have settled into the game more now. They win a corner after Andy Johnson has a cross snuffed out but it comes to nothing. 35 mins The game&apos;s slowed down. It had to. It&apos;s been played at a rip-roaring pace. Much of that&apos;s to to with the torrential rain that&apos;s still lashing down onto the turf. Goal!!! Spurs 1-2 Everton (Leon Osman 37 mins) Arteta dinks a lovely cross over from the right and Anichebe has a header blocked before Leon Osman hits a volley into the roof of the net off the rebound. Gary Naylor is feeling smug no doubt. And my prediction is ruined. 39 mins Berbatov hasn&apos;t got near the ball for Spurs and they could really do with a piece of magic from him to get them back into the game. 41 mins Arteta is causing Spurs loads of problems. He&apos;s drifting from the centre to the right and nobody knows who should cover him. Free-kick for Everton. 42 mins Arteta takes it and lands it on the netting at the top-right hand corner. Good effort. 44mins Spurs look devoid of ideas and Everton are in control now. Another free-kick for Everton after a stupid foul by Malbranque. Alan Stubbs line it up. Goal!!! Spurs 1-3 Everton (Alan Stubbs 45 mins) Alan Stubbs smashes it from 30 yards and it clips the wall before beating a rooted Paul Robinson in the Spurs goal. 46 mins Spurs are booed off. They&apos;ve been poor but not as bad as at the weekend. They need some cut and thrust in midfield in my humble opinion. Mikel Arteta has bossed the midfield. He&apos;s a class act. Half-time emails &quot;Actually, never mind the game. How do pronounce your last name? does the r-o-u-g-h sound &quot;ruff&quot; or &quot;row&quot; or is there some other permutated pronunciation. Further, why the redundant &quot;g&quot; at the end of your first name?&quot; asks Philip Jackson. Well Philip it&apos;s pronounced &quot;ruff&quot;-&quot;lee&quot; as in roughly does it. My mum didn&apos;t want people to think I was called Gregory so she blocked the Greg off with an extra G. I was also called Gregg after Greg Lake of Emerson Lake and Palmer fame. Lucky me! &quot;Why do you guys have the latest minute by minute updates at the bottom of the page? Everytime I refresh the web page, I have to scroll to the bottom - which makes my web usage slightly more conspicuous at work?&quot;asks Sturat Campe. Because of my stupidity, Sturat. I&apos;ve now turned it around for you so you won&apos;t get rumbled by your boss. 46 mins We&apos;re back underway and Tottenham immediately go on the attack after no doubt getting a roasting off big Martin at half-time. Berbatov crashes a shot against the upright. This has started at a pace just like the first half. 49 mins Arteta is at it again. This time he dinks a short free-kick into the box, confusing the Spurs defence and almost sending Anichebe clear. 53 mins Jenas woefully over-hits a crossed free-kick from the right which sends Tim Howard scrambling backwards as it almost drops into the top left-hand corner. 55 mins &quot;I was also named after Greg lake from Emerson, Lake and Palmer&quot; says Lake Michigan from Chicago, Illinois. Hmmm. Really. Meanwhile, Spurs are struggling to get out of their own half and have reverted to the hoof tactics themselves. But they do win a free-kick on the edge of the Everton box. 58 mins Spurs have a free-kick on the edge of the box after a mix-up on the edge of the Everton box that resulted in a foul. Keane lines it up. 62 mins Keane grazes the post with the free-kick but Howard had it covered. Bent is replaced by Defoe. He&apos;s been really quiet and considering his pace you&apos;d have though he&apos;d have given 36-year-old Alan Stubbs a harder time. Defoe has a point to prove to the watching Steve McClaren. 64 mins Arteta whips in another dangerous free-kick and Paul Robinson gets caught in no-man&apos;s-land, but the ball goes out for a goal-kick. 65 mins &quot;I was called Ivan because I resembled a Russian peasant after I was born - covered in blood and crying. Which is how I feel now as a Spurs supporter,&quot; says Ivan Victor. Ooh. That&apos;s harsh Ivan. But meanwhile your team has just brought on Wayne Routledge for the abject Stalteri. Big Martin is going for it now with this line-up. 69 mins Everton are trying to slow play down. They look comfortable and are no doubt more than happy to hold onto the ball and frustrate Spurs. 70 mins Lescott heads a Paul Robinson clearance about 50 yards back to him and almost sends the rapid Andy Johnson through on goal. 73 mins Defoe shanks a wild shot out towards the corner flag in a desperate attempt to impress. 74 mins Andy Johnson tries to curl one around Paul Robinson after playing a return pass with Anichebe, but Robinson leaps at it and palms it away for the cameras. Andy Gray says Johnson&apos;s shot was &quot;deliberate&quot;. Of course, he&apos;d have buried that when he played for the Toffees. 76 mins Neil Clough has emailed in to say the Keane free-kick on 62 mins was a lot further away than I made out. Sorry Neil, that&apos;s me told. 78 mins Chimbonda angles in a low cross that skips off the turf to Defoe who blasts it at the nearpost, but Howard pulls off a wonder save to keep Everton&apos;s two goal lead intact. 80 mins Phil Jagielka is on for Everton to anchor the midfield. 82 mins Tottenham are huffing and puffing but getting nowhere. Their fans are flowing out of the exit gates already. 85 mins Andy Johnson races through and gets a snap shot in from the corner of the six-yard box which Robinson does well to parry. Johnson has been impressive and Steve McClaren may be tempted to give him a go against Germany. 87mins Chimbonda floats a free-kick in but Howard claims it easily. Everton fans chant &quot;we are top of the league&quot;. Well observed Toffees. 89 mins Johnson is sent clear from a Phil Jagielka tackle but his legs look drained of energy and he can&apos;t get a shot in. I&apos;m not surprised. He&apos;s run his socks off tonight. 91 mins Everton know they&apos;ve won it now and attack with potency. The impressive Leon Osman puts Andy Johnson in and Paul Robinson makes a great stop from his close range left-footed shot. Full-time It&apos;s all over at White Hart Lane and Martin Jol&apos;s expensively assembled team trudge off the pitch to howls of derision. Everton showed that they have the organisation and attacking threat to finish best-of-the-rest in the Premier League. Arteta was the best player on the pitch and if he keeps himself free of injury and with the return of Tim Cahill they&apos;ll do well this season. The pressure appears to be upon Martin Jol&apos;s shoulders already. Spurs need to find their best midfield and stick with it because too often they seemed to misread each other tonight.

The Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba), signalling concern at the government&apos;s plans to build tens of thousands of homes on the floodplains of the Thames Gateway in south-east England, recently published a report frankly subtitled Visions of a Flooded Future. In it, some suggest drawing on the mode of living of those people who are among the least likely of all to be fazed by floods: houseboaters. Floating solutions are in vogue, and it is not only fear of the weather that makes them so. Simple lack of space for housing and the monotony of so many developments have also focused attention on aquatic alternatives. In the Riba study, two of the authors propose building houses on telescopic legs along the Thames. Like amphibious structures already being tested on the banks of the Danube in Budapest, they would rise and sink with the floodwaters. Other dwellings, they suggest, could roam free, like the original houseboats. But houseboaters have not always been considered in such high esteem. They were once considered a lowly, despised lot. Part of the current appeal of houseboats is that, tightly adapted to conditions, they vary so greatly - narrowboats built for the 7ft-wide locks of the English canals, improvised reed-and-oil-drum rafts in Asia, the rustic floating cottages of Holland - but what they have in common is their origins in poverty. An exhibition in Amsterdam - capital of a country 70% of which lies below sea level - is marking the rich history of water dwelling in the city and is exploring how it could yet transform urban life in the face of the predicted future floods. Ties Rijcken, a Dutch engineer and houseboat visionary who contributed to the book that accompanies the exhibition, describes how barge skippers living on the British waterways would paint pictures of cottages and flower gardens on their vessels because they were too poor to afford them. The 500-houseboat village on Lake Union, in Seattle, one of the largest, longest established floating settlements in the world, also began, typically, as an extension of skid row. One local resident and a historian of the lake, Jeri Callahan, has been living afloat for decades. She says that &quot;there were houseboats here as early as the 1890s - primarily working-class folk. &quot;It was cheap housing: you might say one step above homelessness. Lumbermen, fishermen - folks good with their hands - could always find some cedar logs floating on the lake. They would lash them together and build a simple shelter against the winter storms, which was much cheaper than the fleahouses on dry land.&quot; Callahan, now in her early 70s, describes a sense of common purpose among houseboaters: &quot;It&apos;s like the boating community. If a boater has a problem, any other boater will go and help him. There&apos;s a commonality about being drawn to the water,&quot; she says. &quot;People so often associate only with people they grew up with or business associates, but on houseboats you can have a longshoreman living next to a professor and nobody cares who your grandfather was or how much money you make.&quot; Houseboat spirit Rijcken describes the houseboat spirit as one of being &quot;willing to make do with less, to tilt a bit, to go out in stormy weather to tighten the ropes&quot;. Yet an, &quot;I&apos;ll march to my own drummer&quot; mentality, as Callahan describes it, and the associated wild architectural heterogeneity seem to stick in the craw of the authorities. In south London, in 2003, following landlubbing residents&apos; complaints of unsightliness and noise, mayor Ken Livingstone sought to evict the 70 or so inhabitants of the tugboats, Humber keels, freight carriers and sail barges moored at Reed&apos;s Wharf, Southwark, although he failed in the face of a protracted and clever multimedia campaign. The mayor of Seattle, in 1962, with a World&apos;s Fair to organise, similarly wanted to rid himself &quot;of all the scuzzy houseboats&quot;, as Callahan puts it. &quot;We were still cheap housing then - students, artists, retired folks. He made it very difficult for the houseboaters.&quot; Their response, courtesy of a charismatic local political leader, seems paradoxical: they renamed their dwellings &quot;floating homes&quot; and asked to be subjected to property tax - to become, in other words, legitimate. The strategy worked, but it may have been the beginning of what many long-time houseboaters see as the end: gentrification. Thanks in part to a concentration of Microsoft millionaires (the company&apos;s headquarters are nearby) a houseboat-mooring alone on Lake Union can cost $700,000, a price to which some of the new houses - boxy, albeit buoyant, things, complete with stars and stripes - will add another $1m. In London, people seeking alternative affordable accommodation have been dismayed to find a narrowboat costs little less than a flat; the same disappointing scenario applies in Amsterdam. The houseboat pioneers must feel theirs is a familiar story. Like loft living in Manhattan and warehouse dwelling in Hoxton, east London, artists and other creative livers carved out alternative abodes only to be pursued by types with ample money but less soul. But houseboaters may yet have a kind of revenge. The advocates of the floating life at the centre of the Amsterdam exhibition complain that, on houseboats, the staid mores of settled life still prevail. &quot;Generally speaking,&quot; as Jord den Hollander writes in the exhibition book, &quot;&apos;who floats stays&apos; still hold true.&quot; He sees in the essential mobility of houseboats the potential for &quot;a completely groundbreaking urbanity, where public squares, cinemas and playgrounds&quot; could follow the population, rather than the reverse. Disused, windswept sporting fields could, he suggests, become a thing of the past. He envisages &quot;[a] city with an ever-changing face ... precisely the image that every port city used to have in its heyday&quot;. The old salts of houseboating might have another, slyer satisfaction at the appropriation of their way of life. Living on these latterday arks is not as suited to rugged individualists as you might think. There are not only the risks - rare on dry land - of sinking and collision and the constant struggle, as described by one Amsterdam houseboater, Maarten Kloos, against &quot;rust, rot, algae, dirt and mussels&quot;. There is also, a mere gangplank away from your neighbour, &quot;no privacy whatsoever&quot;.

One month after its launch, Paris&apos;s V\u00e9lib&apos;, or &quot;freedom bike&quot; scheme, has turned the city cycling mad. You simply pick up a bike from one of the ubiquitous stands, ride it along for your short trip and drop it back at any random stand at your destination. The first half-hour&apos;s pedal-time is free, with charges rising steeply afterwards. Day and night, tourists, commuters and returning party animals cruise by on the chic new machines. People have joyfully discovered the cheap new way of exercising en route to work or getting home drunk after the metro closes, hence a rush of hires after 1am. There&apos;s a glut of bikes deposited at stands at the bottom of hills and none left at the top, as people freewheel down from the heights of Belleville and Montmartre. So huge is the success of the V\u00e9lib&apos; that Paris is proclaiming a veritable &quot;v\u00e9lorution&quot;, reclaiming the streets for two-wheelers. This is not the first scheme to provide bikes for cheap short-hires - Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Oslo got there first, and Lyon was the pioneer in France - but Paris aims to be the biggest. More than 1.6m hires have been registered in the first month from the 800 bike stands around the city. Currently 10,600 bikes are in circulation, but by the end of the year that will double. The unisex bikes are provided by the poster advertising company JCDecaux to Paris city hall in return for ad space in the city, so at no cost to the taxpayer. It&apos;s a political triumph for Paris&apos;s socialist mayor, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, and his opposite number Ken Livingstone is so impressed that he has ordered a consultation on bringing the scheme to London. Even in the world capital of fashion, the municipal bikes have quickly become dernier cri. As the French first lady C\u00e9cilia Sarkozy attests, a chic French woman should never diverge from the strict colour scheme of black, grey or camel, and the bikes, with their metal casing, fit perfectly. Initially, they were derided by right-wing councillors for blending so well into the landscape that they risked being dangerously invisible. But, in fact, Paris has avoided a plague of garish neon bikes in favour of an understated colour scheme that looks good gliding down the boulevards. More important, the bikes are excellent. Laurent Fignon, twice Tour de France champion, was impressed, though he did warn that they weren&apos;t great for racing or riding hands-free. But perhaps that&apos;s a good thing. The Green party has congratulated Parisians for leaping on a scheme that shows that protecting the environment &quot;is not a punishment, but a delight&quot;. But for all the hype, has V\u00e9lib&apos; actually stopped people using their cars? Anecdotally, most people using the bikes are coming off public transport, seeking an alternative to bus, metro and expensive Paris taxis at night. At rail stations, so great is the rush for suburban commuters to jump on bikes rather than cram into Metro carriages that some have tried to lock up bikes on stands at night to secure them for the morning. But the increase in people cycling does seem to be boosting bike awareness and challenging the car mentality. Paris, with its wide streets, is already a better city for cyclists than London. And no, you don&apos;t wear shorts, helmet or pollution mask; most people prefer a suit or high heels. Blase cyclists can be seen negotiating the high-speed free-for-all that is the Place de la Concorde while puffing a cigarette and calling a friend. &quot;If a critical mass of people get on these bikes, it will change the way drivers react to cyclists - it will force the city to put in more cycle lanes,&quot; says Alexandre, an IT technician who has cycled to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es for lunch with a colleague who hasn&apos;t ridden a bike since he was 12. Wisely, they have taken the pedestrian underpass rather than negotiate the \u00c9toile roundabout at the Arc de Triomphe. Already taxi and bus drivers are complaining about the mass of inexperienced cyclists hogging bus lanes. Paris city hall has stamped rules of the road on the handlebars such as &quot;Don&apos;t cycle along pavements&quot;. But everyone knows rules are made to be broken. Of regular Paris cyclists, 71% admit to jumping red lights, over a third regularly go the wrong way up one-way streets, and more than half cycle without lights at night. There must be something in the air if even I decided to get on a bike for the first time since primary school. I can testify that, like all good things French, simply getting out a one-day Velib&apos; ticket at a roadside machine involves a Kafkaesque bureaucratic nightmare of special codes, endless button-pressing and loud swearing. I signed off a \u20ac150 deposit on my credit card for the \u20ac1 ticket that gave me half an hour&apos;s cycle time. (The prices for daily and weekly passes are different from yearly subscriptions - I told you it was complicated.) The spin around the Marais was lovely, but when I glided the bike back into a stand, the light, which should have been green, went red. Should I call the hotline? I asked passersby in what has been termed the new &quot;social networking&quot; as strangers in the street discuss bike hire (or panic about glitches). It was Sunday night, the line was closed. I rang the next morning and, yes, the kind lady established that something had gone wrong - my bike had been &quot;blocked&quot;. If I hadn&apos;t called I would have been billed for the equivalent of a summer biking holiday along the Canal du Midi. But despite teething problems, the V\u00e9libs have cheered up Parisians in a rainy August. The true test will come in September, when students, commuters and drivers return from their summer break and the roads fill up again and tempers fray. Crucially, the Velib&apos; is an alternative for those who have fallen prey to Paris&apos;s notorious bike thieves. &quot;I&apos;ve had bikes stolen so many times, I&apos;d rather just use these,&quot; says an advertising executive at a bike point at the H\u00f4tel de Ville. In the first month of the scheme, only around 100 of the 10,600 V\u00e9libs have been pinched. In Cambridge, when a similar project was piloted in the 1960s, the fleet gradually vanished. When another attempt was made in 1993, all 300 bikes were stolen on the first day.", "sentences": ["This is not the first scheme to provide bikes for cheap short-hires - Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Oslo got there first, and Lyon was the pioneer in France - but Paris aims to be the biggest."], "title": "Paris goes cycling mad", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/16/ethicalliving.france", "tags": ["Ethical and green living", "France holidays", "Paris holidays", "Green travel", "Cycling holidays", "France", "World news", "Life and style", "Travel and transport", "Transport", "UK news", "Environment", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-17T14:21:30Z", "article": "They want you as a new recruit ... Bearforce1 Every now and then the pop god coughs up something so perfectly conceived - the Spice Girls, Daphne and Celeste, 2 Unlimited, the Sex Pistols - that the only sane response is to drop to one&apos;s knees and worship. I give you Dutch band Bearforce1. They&apos;re a pop group. Comprised of bears. Not real bears, obviously. That would be stupid. Bearforce1 are gay bears, meaning men who are older, rougher, bigger and hairier than, say, the average boyband member. Not only do Bearforce1 have the best band name since Take That, they also posit the question: Why hasn&apos;t anyone thought of this before? Duh! It seems so obvious every svengali in Christendom must be slapping his forehead before rushing off to his nearest bear pit with a sheaf of blank contracts. The buzz is already building. Perez Hilton - America&apos;s snarkiest celeb blogger - did his pop nut. YouTube is already awash with grinning, laughing heterosexuals doing the Bearforce1 dance. How do we know they&apos;re heterosexuals? Because they&apos;re doing the Bearforce1 dance on YouTube. You shout &quot;Bear!&quot; And cross your wrists. &quot;Force!&quot; And salute. &quot;One!&quot; Hold up a finger. Then repeat steps one and two, replacing three with a double hip thrust. It&apos;s so simple your dad could do it. And he probably will. The bear dance is the new Hokey Cokey. Soon no wedding will be complete without champagne-tiddly old folks doing the bear. Not since the Chicken Dance has a dance so tickled the reptile brain stem. Not since the Village People&apos;s YMCA dance - still regularly performed by hordes of drunks at sporting events all over America - has a bop so successfully demolished barriers of sexuality and gender. But of course there are those who carp. &quot;Those aren&apos;t real bears,&quot; sneered a co-worker as the rest of my office fell about laughing as they did the bear. &quot;They aren&apos;t nearly fat or hairy enough.&quot; He might have a point. Even Chubby Bear (he&apos;s the chubby one) looks kinda slim&apos;n&apos;hunky with his XL polo shirt off. But that&apos;s like saying Take That weren&apos;t a real boy band. Because real boys are spotty, ugly and think dancing is gay. It&apos;s missing the point entirely. Although they claim to be the first ever bear band, the Force are actually the disco tip of a massive bear music iceberg. There&apos;s even a Bearapalooza featuring very serious bear rock acts, like political homo-hop bear rapper BiggNugg. But no Bear combo has had the mainstream impact of Bearforce1. The viral hype is ferocious. Yet - in what is either a stroke of marketing genius or a sign that the Bears were themselves taken by surprise - the band&apos;s website is teasingly devoid of Bear facts. All we know is that &quot;Robert from Belfast&quot; met &quot;Ian, Peter and Yuri from Amsterdam&quot; on holiday in New York last summer.&quot; And they thought it would be fun to form a boyband &quot;that didn&apos;t consist of smooth, polished 18 year-old boys with &apos;X- factor&apos;&quot;. It&apos;s like when Paul met John. Or when Ginger met Scary. From such accidental encounters are pop legends born. Does the inevitable mega-success of Bearforce1 spell the end of bear culture? Hardcore, old-school bears will claim it was over yonks ago anyway, shortly after the first Guardian journalist casually slung the term into a column to show how down he was with the whole big cuddly gay chap scene. But this is elitist foolishness. Older, larger, hairier gay men have had the bear scene to themselves for long enough. Now it&apos;s time for the rest of the world to join in. In the same way that the Spice Girls made feminists of us all, Bearforce1 are going to make us all bears. Who says so? Bearforce1 say so. All together now: Bear! And cross your wrists. Force!

In addition to the camera crews and journalists, clumps of police vehicles are parked up, and small groups of officers are keeping watch over the site - among them a police photographer, who trains a foot-long lens along the tents and marquees on the other side of a low fence. As he snaps away, a wizened-looking climate camper attempts to block his view with a huge white banner. Meanwhile, a group of drummers bash out what may or may not be a samba rhythm - an example, says one protester, of a tried-and-tested technique known as &quot;tactical frivolity&quot;. The camp - located on land that may eventually be cleared for a third Heathrow runway - formally opened on Tuesday, beginning a week of activity that will reach a peak this Sunday with a day of direct action aimed at BAA, the airport&apos;s owners. On the face of it, the campers&apos; point is simple enough: that if we&apos;re serious about scaling down our emissions of greenhouse gases, the people who own and run airports will have to abandon any plans for expansion and drastically scale them down. Friends of the Earth says that Heathrow contributes a third of the UK&apos;s aviation emissions, and flights from the airport pump as much CO2 into the atmosphere as five million cars, every year. (Environmentalists claim Heathrow&apos;s carbon output is 13.9m tonnes; BAA says it is 266,000 tonnes.) But protest is only one part of the exercise. To quote from the pamphlet handed to everyone who turns up, the camp is also meant to be &quot;an amazing living experiment&quot;: a temporary microcosm of the ideal society, brought to a damp field in Middlesex. Look around, and you quickly get the idea. Decisions are taken consensually at daily meetings. Campers can borrow two-wheeled transport from a &quot;bike library&quot;. There are methodically built compost toilets and a recycling system so thorough that it almost beggars belief. And campers can also make the most of scores of workshops, running from the straightforward (&quot;Climate Change For Beginners&quot;) to the arcane (&quot;Social Ecology: the future of anarchism&quot;). The day I arrive, there is a lot of talk about an incident that happened on Tuesday night. At around 7.30pm, the camp&apos;s organisers claim that 25 or so police - members, they say, of a surveillance squad called the Forward Intelligence Team - attempted a &quot;raid&quot;, trying to march into the camp until they were surrounded by campers and non-aggressively &quot;escorted&quot; from the site. While all this went on, several vans of riot police stood watch. At the camp, this short-lived flashpoint seemed to come as a surprise, though it fits neatly with the narrative that has been established in some of the more excitable parts of the media, based around the supposed arrival of &quot;hardcore&quot; elements and Sunday&apos;s day of action that will &quot;paralyse&quot; the airport. To borrow from the Kaiser Chiefs, Sky predicts a riot. With the proviso that the Climate Camp is sworn to non-violence, exactly what will actually happen is unclear. Alex Harvey, a 28 -year-old graduate student who acts as my &quot;escort&quot;, sticks to the camp&apos;s official line, whereby any talk about action on the runways is unequivocally rejected, but there can be no guarantees beyond that. She insists that recent rumours about hoax bomb calls to the airport are false. That said, she claims that the camp is &quot;much more likely&quot; to aim its actions at the nearby offices of BAA, Heathrow&apos;s owners. &quot;We keep saying that,&quot; she says, &quot;and no one&apos;s hearing us.&quot; Twenty-four hours before, I begin my day in very different surroundings, waiting for the bus that runs between Heathrow&apos;s main hotels and its four terminals, and talking to Derek and Anne Hodge. Having flown in yesterday from Sydney and spent the night at one of the airport&apos;s three Holiday Inns, they are en route to Cork, then Southampton, and then for a final fortnight in Spain. They are ex-pats who relocated to Australia 22 years ago; with their golf clubs and pile of upmarket luggage, they have the comfortable air of people whose retirement has turned out very nicely indeed. Before they set off, however, their nerves were jangled by news from the old world. On news bulletins on their adopted country&apos;s Channel 10, they tell me, warnings have recently been sounded about the decline of Britain&apos;s biggest airport, and the camp that has pitched up close by. &quot;The report was on TV the day before we left,&quot; says Anne. &quot;They said Heathrow was the worst airport in the world, and using it was more stressful than a divorce.&quot; And how has it been for them? &quot;It wasn&apos;t bad yesterday,&quot; says her husband. &quot;But it isn&apos;t half grubby. It really does look dirty. If you compare it with other airports - Sydney, say, or Bangkok - it&apos;s really not very good. When you come here, being British by birth, you really do think, &apos;I&apos;d like to be prouder of this.&apos;&quot; And the camp? &quot;Oh, that&apos;s absolutely stupid,&quot; says Anne. &quot;I&apos;ve seen An Inconvenient Truth, but I think the weather&apos;s probably always been cyclical. Then again, when we&apos;ve been getting ready to fly, I suppose I have thought, &apos;Should I do this?&apos; But living in Australia, what can we do?&quot; Her husband emits a muted grumble, tells me his politics place him &quot;to the right of Margaret Thatcher&quot; and suggests that the camp is the stamping ground of &quot;lefty teachers&quot;. Having picked us up from the hotel, the bus wends its way through a crowded landscape, all box-like architecture and towering adverts. According to an incongruous alliance of people who have been recently raising their voices, these 4.6 square miles are now among the most unpleasant places in Britain. The Mayor of London Ken Livingstone recently claimed that Heathrow &quot;shames London&quot; and offers &quot;appalling conditions&quot; in which passengers are effectively kept prisoner in a &quot;ghastly shopping mall&quot;. Sir Terence Conran thinks the airport has become a &quot;really horrible place&quot;. One government minister - Kitty Ussher, who sees to the affairs of the City of London - has talked about the airport&apos;s negative impact on the high-flying international financiers on whom we are so often told our national wellbeing depends: a matter, she says, of problems with security, passport control and a mind-bending layout that amounts to &quot;Heathrow hassle&quot;. The essential problem, according to some people, is the domination of the UK&apos;s airports by BAA - once known as the British Airports Authority, privatised in 1987, now owned by the giant Spanish corporation Ferrovial, and accused of behaving with all the arrogance of the archetypal private monopoly. In March, the Office Of Fair Trading referred BAA to the Competition Commission; as the latter puts its report together, plenty of voices have been claiming that Heathrow should be taken out of BAA&apos;s portfolio. The past few weeks, meanwhile, have seen events - thanks to ubiquitous media coverage, now bundled up into one of the biggest stories of the summer - that have only worsened Heathrow&apos;s troubles. In early August, having got wind of the camp&apos;s imminent arrival, BAA applied for a surreally wide-ranging injunction, focused on banning protest from an area far wider than the airport - including platforms at Paddington Station and certain junctions on the M4 - and preventing organisations including Airport Watch, an umbrella group that includes such well-known revolutionary groups as the Woodland Trust and the RSPB from protesting. Any half-decent PR adviser would surely have predicted the result: BAA received acres of bad press, and the camp was propelled into the national consciousness. And then, the high court granted an altogether more limited injunction than BAA was after, and, with an air of jubilation, the camp&apos;s organisers said that their plans remained unchanged. They pitched up on land that may eventually be concreted over by a runway that would increase the airport&apos;s annual flight numbers from 480,000 to more than 700,000. Largely populated by young enrag\u00e9s, the camp is also buoyed by the quiet support of rather older local people, many of whom have spent decades watching Heathrow eat into the surrounding landscape. These days, they tend to mention one place more than any other: Sipson, the village that a third runway would wipe from the map. Leaving aside the eco-protesters, there are not many lines to be drawn between Heathrow&apos;s local opponents and the politicians and business leaders - and passengers - who bemoan its currently shabby state. After all, the former want any plans for Heathrow&apos;s expansion to be abandoned, while many of the latter think its refurbishment and growth should only be accelerated. Underlying both their arguments, however, is Heathrow&apos;s essential problem. It boils down to this: why is one of the world&apos;s busiest airports and its surrounding netherworld located 15 miles from London, on a site chosen during the second world war, now boxed in by housing, and expanded and altered over 60 years with precious little strategic vision? You only need travel abroad to grasp what&apos;s wrong: while so many of the world&apos;s airports now offer acres of space, futuristic flash and carefully designed passenger comfort, Heathrow has the distinct air of a project made up as people went along. It is, in effect, a very British botch-up. Once I&apos;ve been dropped off at terminal three, my morning-long tour of Heathrow begins in a room known as the &quot;Star Centre&quot;, where banks of plasma screens flash up CCTV pictures of every corner of the airport. This morning, particular attention is being paid to the tunnel that takes 55,000 cars a day between the terminals, and rumours about a possible disruptive action involving a gang of cyclists who are reported to have just set off from London (as it turns out, they don&apos;t show up). In between explaining his job, Greg Ward, Heathrow&apos;s burly operations director, issues the odd dismissive aside about what he calls &quot;Camp Climate&quot;, while a WPC seconded here in case of early trouble from protesters (&quot;I&apos;m not allowed to talk to you,&quot; she says) splits her time between filling in a logbook and reading a paperback novel called Double Jeopardy. Twenty minutes later, I am sitting in a compact corporate meeting room with Mark Bullock, the managing director of BAA&apos;s Heathrow operation, promoted last month to being its public face after the departure of its chief executive Tony Douglas, who was last heard claiming that Heathrow was &quot;bursting at the seams&quot;. The past few months, I suggest, must have been trying, to say the least. &quot;What I know is, I inherited - if I can use that phrase - an airport that&apos;s handling 68 million passengers, and it was designed for 45 million,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ve got the two busiest runways in the world. So it&apos;s always going to be difficult to manage an operation like that. There are so many external events that can influence the performance of the airport. When you&apos;re operating at capacity, it only takes an incident from the outside - the kind of thing that will force a change in security measures - and the ability of the airport to cope with that is quite stressed.&quot; Bullock says that Heathrow &quot;isn&apos;t fixed, but it&apos;s moving in the right direction&quot;. (At BAA&apos;s HQ, tea is served in &quot;Making Heathrow Great&quot; mugs.) Like many of his colleagues, he claims that queues to pass through security checks now take no longer than 10 minutes - and bemoans the tendency of Heathrow&apos;s detractors to blame problems at check-in, passport control and baggage reclaim on BAA, when they are the chief responsibility of airlines and, in the latter case, the government&apos;s Border and Immigration Agency. When it comes to the camp, he says that he &quot;cannot countenance direct action that would seriously disrupt one and a half million people&quot;. He defends the attempted injunction as an example of BAA doing &quot;everything in its power&quot; to stop just that eventuality. But didn&apos;t its surreally wide terms hand the protesters a PR gift? &quot;The injunction needed to be quite widely worded,&quot; he says, &quot;because these people don&apos;t stand up and say, &apos;I&apos;m one of the people who&apos;s going to take direct action.&apos; You can&apos;t pin them down.&quot; Eventually, we get on to the subject of the third runway. An idea that was first mooted in the 1940s, it was decisively placed on the agenda in late 2003, when the government announced its support for new runways at Heathrow and Stansted (and, just to really inflame environmentalists, Birmingham and Edinburgh). A consultation process will begin next month; a public inquiry is expected to start in 2008. As late as 2001, BAA claimed that it &quot;would urge the government to rule out any additional runway at Heathrow&quot;, though it has now done a volte-face and decided to support the plan, which has only heightened local anger. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult, isn&apos;t it?&quot; says Bullock. &quot;You&apos;ve got to sympathise with people whose homes are in that area, which if it goes ahead, will be under a runway. That&apos;s why the consultation around the third runway needs to balance the social benefits of flying, the economic benefits to London and the UK of this hub airport, the climate impact, and the impact on individuals.&quot; Bullock talks about &quot;balance&quot; a lot, though for the residents of Sipson, there may not be much balance on offer. As and when the third runway is built, their village simply won&apos;t be there any more. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, quietly. &quot;That&apos;s where we&apos;d have to build the runway. And that&apos;s why we have noise insulation schemes, schemes to compensate people for the loss of the market value of their houses, a purchase scheme to buy other people&apos;s homes. But I accept ... you know ... We&apos;re never going to make those people happy in that situation. We can&apos;t, can we? It is very difficult for them.&quot; And is it difficult for him, taking those kind of decisions? &quot;As a human being, I feel for them, but you&apos;ve got to look at the greater good of society and balance out the benefits you get for the many, compared with the problems it causes for the few.&quot; Even with three runways, Heathrow could still lag behind many of its international competitors. Despite handling 10 million fewer passengers a year, Paris&apos;s Charles De Gaulle airport has four runways; Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol is 20 million behind, and it has six. In the towns and villages that nudge Heathrow&apos;s perimeter, there are suspicions that once a third runway is built, Heathrow will then expand again. &quot;Personally, I don&apos;t see that,&quot; says Bullock. &quot;And it&apos;s so far in the future that I&apos;ll be long gone by then. That&apos;s ... [pause] ... not something that we&apos;re contemplating.&quot; And if someone points out that BAA said much the same thing about the third runway, what&apos;s his response? Another long pause. &quot;That&apos;s an impossible question to answer, isn&apos;t it? Come back in 50 years&apos; time, and ask me - and who knows? But my answer can only be that there is no need for a fourth runway at Heathrow.&quot; My tour of Heathrow finishes with the building that is BAA&apos;s pride and joy. On the former site of a sewage works, just to the east of the central knot of buildings that contains terminals one, two and three, work is about to finish on terminal five. Designed by Richard Rogers, it will open in March next year to handle all the airport&apos;s British Airways flights, and boost Heathrow&apos;s passenger capacity by up to 25 million, thus relieving a good deal of the pressure that currently burdens the airport. It is a spectacular place, lit up by skylights that form huge arcs, and capped at one end by a vast window that looks out on Heathrow&apos;s runways. Once you have left the arrivals area, you are confronted with a very un-Heathrow sight: an outdoor piazza, replete with lines of trees. &quot;This will be an urban space, completely different from what you&apos;d expect at an airport,&quot; says Mike Forster, Heathrow&apos;s strategy development director, who rhapsodises about the new terminal. &quot;Essentially, it will be a little part of London.&quot; Once the project is completed, work on updating Heathrow will continue: terminals three and four will be refurbished, and terminals one and two will be replaced by a new building, to be called Heathrow East. For some people, unfortunately, the promise of a gleaming future rings rather hollow. Back in the existing terminal three, having flown into Stansted from the Republic of Ireland, 41-year-old Jack Fitzsimons is en route to Mauritius. He has arrived at Heathrow eight hours early. &quot;This place is just chaotic,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s terrible. I used terminal three about a month ago, and it was just overwhelmed. I think of Heathrow as a nuisance airport.&quot; The next morning, I spend a few hours in and around Sipson, the village that nudges the climate camp, where plenty of local people view Heathrow as an increasingly painful headache. Bryan Sobey, the 78-year-old president of the Harlington and Sipson Residents&apos; Association, has been living here since 1951, watching as the airport was transformed from &quot;a few Nissen huts&quot; into the leviathan of today. As we talk, his wife Ann occasionally comes into the front room, carrying bulging lever-arch files that contain two decades&apos; worth of cuttings, correspondence and official documents relating to plans for a third runway. One of the most recent is spread out on the table in front of us: a BAA &quot;Master plan&quot; map, in which the proposed site of the new runway is represented by an anvil-shaped blob, coloured royal blue. Look hard at the map and you can see what are there now: around 700 houses, most of them built in the wake of a guarantee from government in 1953 that even if Heathrow expanded, Sipson would remain untouched. Sobey spent much of his working life as a Heathrow customs officer, and claims to have always been troubled by the ad hoc developments that made Heathrow the higgledy-piggledy place it is today. &quot;They&apos;re all bolt-ons, and none of them work effectively,&quot; he says. &quot;It should never have been designed like it was, but nobody knew what would happen to air travel back then. We&apos;re still stuck with an airport designed in the 1940s that&apos;s been adapted, by piecemeal development, over the years. But that&apos;s what we do in this country: we build piecemeal rubbish.&quot; In nearby Russell Gardens, I meet Christine Taylor, her sister Jane, and mother Sheila, who has spent all of her 75 years in and around Sipson (and never used a plane - &quot;too terrifying&quot;, she says). She does not take much persuasion to map out the lost geography that lies underneath Heathrow&apos;s runways, terminals and surrounding roads. The aforementioned Holiday Inn, she says, was once a set of allotments. Along Bath Road - the unappealing dual carriageway, now lined with hotels, that marks the airport&apos;s northern boundary - there were once neighbourhood shops. She talks about orchards, and the long-lost fruit and vegetable farms that were once the area&apos;s main source of work. Her daughters are among the leading lights of a local campaign group Notrag (the No Third Runway Action Group), and of the opinion that any plan to expand Heathrow would represent &quot;madness&quot;. With the third runway looking ever-more likely, they tell me, families have been moving out of Sipson at speed, selling their homes to buy-to-let landlords who then rent them out to low-paid airport employees. Two years ago, says Jane, 10 Chinese hotel workers were discovered living in a nearby one-bedroom house. Five would sleep during the day, five at night. They were only discovered when all 10 arrived in the house at the same time, and a fight broke out. In Cranford, an array of houses and shops that has the bleak sense of a community locked into a long decline, the story is very similar. Jagraj Sran owns a property business called Heathrow Estates, and has watched a steady exodus over the past two or three years. &quot;A lot of families are leaving,&quot; he says. &quot;With all the talk of a third runway, there is a panic.&quot; Even without the prospect of expansion, you can see why people would want out: at around the forty- fifth second of every minute, a plane streaks overhead, making a noise so loud that any conversation has to stop. On a long residential street called Berkeley Avenue, where the houses&apos; double-glazed windows are 50% funded by BAA, the sound is truly deafening: an immense roar that has been known to shake the tiles from the roofs. Sarupa Soni - who, now aged 68, has lived in her house for 42 years - says she is woken by the planes at five o&apos;clock every morning, and the noise goes on until 11 at night. &quot;It is very, very annoying,&quot; she assures me. &quot;But you have to stop yourself getting bothered by it.&quot; Standing in her back garden as yet another plane comes thundering into land, you can only marvel at her resilience. A mile or so down the road, meanwhile, the Camp For Climate Action&apos;s second afternoon brings a kind of uneasy tedium. While more planes roar by, the police carry on watching and the drums play on. The campers busy themselves with their workshops, while serried camera crews and journalists wait idly by - as in the terminals, engaged in that ubiquitous Heathrow pastime of quietly waiting for something to happen.", "sentences": ["Despite handling 10 million fewer passengers a year, Paris&apos;s Charles De Gaulle airport has four runways; Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol is 20 million behind, and it has six."], "title": "Heathrow has become Britain's 'nuisance airport'.

But, if it doesn&apos;t hit the nosebleed heights of last year&apos;s award-winning Naked Racist, the Nichol shtick remains unfailingly impressive. I found myself laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of someone throwing this amount of fevered energy into the act of entertainment.

An epic landscape experiment is underway in the Netherlands. Its aim is to make Holland, the most developed of all European countries, wild again. Its method is to establish a vast network of natural habitats and wildlife corridors. Frans Vera, one of the ecologists driving the project, imagines it as a &apos;green circulation system&apos; that will allow the freer movement of non-human species around north west Europe. Plans for the project show a mesh of green arteries, veins and capillaries, covering much of Holland and infiltrating Germany and Belgium. The heart of this system is Oostvaardersplassen, an uninhabited coastal region of polder, scrubby savannah and wetland that, for nearly 40 years, has been allowed to run wild. Herds of red deer, Heck cattle and Konik ponies graze its drier reaches. Sea eagles and marsh harriers hunt its skies. Bittern, stork and egret haunt reed beds. Millions of geese, ducks and waders migrate through. Oostvaardersplassen&apos;s biodiversity is remarkable. So is its proximity to Amsterdam - just 20 miles to the city&apos;s east. And so is its scale: 5,600 hectares, roughly a quarter of the area of the capital. Imagine the proportional equivalent here. A region the size of the Isle of Wight, in the position of south west Essex, turned over to its animals and plants ... The management of Oostvaardersplassen is deliberately minimal. In this respect, it is truly a wild place. For our word &apos;wild&apos; derives from the Old Norse villr, meaning uncontrolled or self-intending. Wild land, by this etymology, is self-willed land. Land that proceeds according to its own laws and principles. Land whose habits - the growth of its trees, the movement of its creatures, the distribution of its streams and reed beds - are of its own devising and execution. By 2018, if all goes to plan, Vera&apos;s &apos;National Ecological Network&apos; will involve 730,000 hectares: 17 per cent of Holland&apos;s total area. The existence of this brilliantly ambitious initiative testifies to the Dutch government&apos;s commitment to ecology and landscape (what a contrast with Britain), as well as to the general greenness of Dutch culture. Could Britain go wild in a similar way? Only a few years ago, the idea would have been laughable. Recently, however, &apos;wilding&apos; has moved to the forefront of British conservation theory. Public interest in the values of wildness has also risen, a trend visible in television (the huge viewing figures for Coast and Mountain), in tourism, literature (the popular and critical rise of writing about nature) and photography, sculpture and painting. There are &apos;wilding&apos; projects now underway in Britain which resemble the Dutch example in ethos, if not in size. I recently visited two: both remarkable, both inspiring. The first, Wicken Fen in Cambridgeshire, has a &apos;100-Year Vision&apos; developed for re-wetting a great tongue of land. This future fen would extend from Wicken in the north to Stow in the south, with an access corridor down into Cambridge itself, allowing the fen to become the city&apos;s &apos;green lung&apos;. As the area expands - reclaimed from surrounding farmland - it will be grazed by Highland cattle, Konik ponies and possibly water buffalo. The second is the Wild Ennerdale project. Ennerdale is a remote valley in the western Lake District, whose headwall rises to a cirque of magnificent mountains: Great Gable, Pillar, Kirk Fell, Haystacks. Through its upper reaches flows the clear-running Liza, which fills Ennerdale Water. To my mind, Ennerdale is the greatest valley in England. I once spent a winter night walking the mountain ridge that forms its western border, moving over snow in moonlight so bright I could read by it. Looking down into Ennerdale, I felt I was glimpsing another country. Ennerdale is jointly owned by the National Trust, the Forestry Commission and United Utilities. Five years ago, after consultation with various stakeholders, these three signed up to a &apos;wild&apos; vision statement for the valley, to increase the wildness of Ennerdale by &apos;allowing natural processes a greater hand in shaping the valley&apos;s landscape and ecology over the long term&apos;. In practice, this means that forestry will be reduced. Motorised transport will be restricted. Fences will be removed. Vast spruce plantation will be thinned and regenerated with native species: juniper, birch, ash, alder, poplar. Almost all commercial extraction will cease in the valley, save for the tapping of the lake for drinking water. The contrasts between Wicken and Ennerdale are many. Fen and fell; forest and marsh; north west and south east. But both projects are tethered by similar practicalities and both are devoted, in different degrees, to the idea of wildness. This is most powerfully the case in Ennerdale. No one knows what will happen in the valley once it has been left to itself. This is what makes the project so exciting. Because of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, most of the valley is accessible to the public. People will be able to watch the transformation of Ennerdale for themselves. I intend to return every year or two for as long as I can. Ennerdale and Wicken are not alone. Ambitious re-wettings are underway at Alkborough, Wallasea, Alnmouth and Freiston. Wildlife trusts across England are working out how to join up their holdings. Native woodland regeneration is occurring all over Scotland, including at Loch Katrine in the Trossachs. There, the Forestry Commission Scotland has begun a massive reforestation scheme. The goal is to link the Katrine forest westwards to the RSPB woods at Inversnaid, and eastwards to the Woodland Trust&apos;s Finglas property, running from Loch Lomond to Callader. So connections are beginning. British conservation is moving away from its &apos;crown jewels&apos; mentality of isolated and cosseted sites. Fen is being linked to fen, forest to forest, glen to glen, heath to heath. Slowly, the Dutch example is being emulated. Acceleration is possible, too, for as the Common Agricultural Policy reforms itself, more and more farmland will come up for sale. Indeed, Britain differs from Holland in this exciting respect: it has the space to create several large-scale core wildernesses. In the future, we might prove our tolerance of the notion that, as ecologist Mark Fisher puts it, &apos;human activity should not dominate every hectare of the landscape in Britain&apos;. Is this vision of a wild Britain impractical? Not with political and cultural will, of which there is an increasing amount. Is it desirable? Undoubtedly ... environmentally, economically, morally, spiritually and socially. Take a minute to imagine a transformed British landscape. A Britain in which you could walk for a day and not leave the cover of trees. A Britain of elk, lynx, perhaps even wolves. A Britain filled, in the words of geographer Bill Adams, with &apos;new spaces for nature, both in the landscape and in our lives and imaginations&apos;. \u00b7 Robert Macfarlane&apos;s The Wild Places (Granta) is published on 2 September", "sentences": ["So is its proximity to Amsterdam - just 20 miles to the city&apos;s east."], "title": "Imagine a Britain running wild", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/19/conservation", "tags": ["Environment", "Conservation", "Travel", "United Kingdom holidays"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-19T22:49:50Z", "article": "Simon Woodroffe has promised to stop being a showman. But coming from the man who brought us raw fish on conveyor belts, starred in Dragons&apos; Den and took a one-man show to the Edinburgh Fringe, can we believe he has become too reticent to put himself forward as the face of the Yo! brand? It certainly proved hard to convince him to be interviewed. The reason he agreed, he says, is that he has another potential major success on his hands. And he wants to be seen as a weightier businessman these days. &apos;I want what we do to speak for itself, rather than me being a media tart all the time, and allow others in the organisation to receive credit.&apos; Woodroffe has played the eccentric and the entertainer. He has been accused of being a one-hit wonder, even if that hit was as original and as much fun as Yo! Sushi. But now it seems he wants to play the wise entrepreneur, a voice of counsel behind the scenes, and there is a new hotel venture for which he has big ambitions. Yotel is another Japanese-inspired concept, where you rent windowless rooms by the hour; a four-hour stay costs \u00a325. Yotels can be put in unpromising locations, as there is no view to worry about and they fulfil a need for more flexible stays. &apos;The plan is to grow internationally immediately and we have the money to do it,&apos; says Woodroffe, who has Middle Eastern backing for Yotel. The first Yotel opened in May at Gatwick airport and Heathrow and Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol will follow shortly. Several others are close to being signed up. The plan is to establish some 50 Yotels at major transport hubs and cities, from Paris to Hong Kong. Woodroffe believes Yotel will become one of the world&apos;s top 10 hotel groups. Yo! Sushi took off but it had problems expanding, mostly because of poor site selection, and in 2000, Woodroffe stepped back from day-to-day management and Robin Rowland was appointed chief executive. The business was almost bust, but recovered and three years later there was a management buyout that left Woodroffe with a 22 per cent stake, \u00a310m in cash, and royalties &apos;in perpetuity&apos;. &apos;There are two sides to Simon,&apos; Rowland says. &apos;There is the showman, but people mistakenly think there is no depth. He has a serious side.&apos; Woodroffe was self-taught as a businessman, with no corporate experience, when he set up Yo! Sushi. Now, say those around him, he has mixed with a lot of other successful entrepreneurs, and has learnt from them. He is no longer a hands-on manager, so operational management at Yotel is in the hands of its chief executive, Gerard Greene. He says: &apos;Simon is more confident and more relaxed now. He has matured, he&apos;s got some money in the bank... but he&apos;s still completely potty.&apos; Woodroffe concedes he was never any good at operating Yo! Sushi: &apos;The trick is to find out what you&apos;re good at and stick to it. I&apos;m good at the creative side, at mentoring, at publicising.&apos; Woodroffe has other businesses in the offing, including Yo! Zone, &apos;an alternative social occasion where a beautiful spa meets dancing by the pool&apos;, and Yo! Home, which promises an original take on the city-centre apartment. While he used to say Virgin was his business model, he has clearly had second thoughts on slapping his brand on a range of businesses in the style of Branson. The Yo! website lists half a dozen existing and future ventures then adds: &apos;That&apos;s it. No car hire, mobile phones, internet cafes, bridal ware, watches or colas. Just solid, high-profile innovative businesses that are fun.&apos; He is keen that his businesses are genuinely different from what exists, rather than making Yo! one giant brand extension. &apos;I&apos;m 55. I want to do five really good projects. My advice is to be innovative, do something that turns you on.&apos; Woodroffe - who was considered too nice as a panellist on Dragons&apos; Den - believes business practice has changed. It is not, he argues, the hard-talking, sell-your-granny ruthlessness seen in The Apprentice. &apos;I&apos;ve not met many Alan Sugars. Rather than win at the expense of others, why not work together?&apos; He is often spoken of as a Labour party donor, but only ever gave \u00a31,000 - though he says he is considering giving more. As a former public school drop-out, he concedes that he does not come from the Labour heartlands but is enamoured of this government. &apos;Labour are a pretty good management team and I&apos;m scared to change to another management team.&apos; He left Marlborough with just two O-levels and soon afterward had a spell in prison for dealing cannabis. He had a hotchpotch career in theatre and rock music before setting up Yo! Sushi. Even now, after the Yo Sushi \u00a310m, he lives on a houseboat in Chelsea with his 17-year-old daughter, goes out with Cherie Lunghi, gets around town on a Vespa, and says he is not wealthy.

The family, including Bernard Lewis, the company&apos;s founder and chairman, paid themselves a total dividend of just over \u00a352m, up from \u00a317m in 2005. A good proportion of that was generated by the sale of the company&apos;s Spanish hotel chain for a profit of \u00a363.7m. The company has assets of \u00a3897m, an increase of 25 per cent compared to last year. Bernard Lewis, 81, set up his first shop in north London after the war and went on to build a chain of clothes shops which were rebranded Chelsea Girl in the 1970s.

Lately, though, Lee&apos;s sideline has eclipsed his own artistic output. U2&apos;s How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb , Snow Patrol&apos;s Eyes Open and Editors&apos; latest were all his productions. Somehow, Lee has found the time to knock out a short album. It&apos;s both more rocky and less original than you might expect. The amusing &apos;I Like It, Yeah&apos; cribs Calvin Harris, but &apos;Run Me Over&apos; welds LCD Soundsystem melodics to a guitar riff awkwardly.

Snaith sets himself up for a fall by opening with &apos;Melody Day&apos; and &apos;Sandy&apos;, the album&apos;s euphoric high points, but what an elegant fall it is, through the percussive intensity of &apos;After Hours&apos; and the lysergic oscillations of &apos;Irene&apos;. A bittersweet delight.  Killian Fox Kula Shaker Strangefolk  (Strangefolk) \u00a310.99  Britpop-era stars Kula Shaker&apos;s decision to reform certainly shows chutzpah. After making a splash with their debut K, a collection of cod-Indian psychedelic rock as gratifying as a tandoori pot noodle, they became one of Britain&apos;s least-loved bands, the result of a pretentious follow-up album and obnoxious frontman Crispian Mills. Strangely, then, Strangefolk isn&apos;t awful. The lyrics are as fatuous as ever - &apos;I&apos;m a dic, dic, dic,&apos; sings Mills on &apos;Great Dictator (Of the Free World) &apos;: you tend to agree - but musically they&apos;ve ditched the hippy-mystical bombast for a softer sound with shades of the Beach Boys. Who knows, they may find musical redemption yet.  Hugh Montgomery Tunng Good Arrows  (Full Time Hobby) \u00a311.99  Folktronica may be a clunky concept but it produced, in Tunng&apos;s Comments of the Inner Chorus , one of last year&apos;s loveliest records. Now beefed up to a sextet, Tunng attempt to create something bolder and more dramatic from their blend of pastoral pop and sonic bricolage. Sadly, that extra ambition scuppers them here; a consistent folkiness sustained COTIC &apos;s sense of enchantment but these broader experiments in acoustic pop yield a fragmented album. Good Arrows is not without its charms; the jaunty bounce of the &apos;Bullets&apos; chorus, for example, contrasts wonderfully with horrorstruck lyrics. But overall, this is less than spellbinding.  Ally Carnwath Various Sound of the World  (Warners) \u00a312.99  The annual compilation from radio DJ and writer Charlie Gillett cannily divines &apos;world&apos; music&apos;s mercurial spirit, which seems to find different hotspots each year.

Belize&apos;s Andy Palacio offers another example of a tiny place with its own distinctive style. Many of the 33 tracks here feature displaced artists (Ethiopians in Amsterdam, a West African from Mallorca) and music that is hybrid going on mutant - the avant-garde sounds of Fiona Soe Paing&apos;s &apos;No Man&apos;s Land&apos; are a case in point.

That is certainly the case with their extraordinary, seven-minute exploration of &apos;Dear Lord and Father of Mankind&apos;, which takes the old hymn into realms of pure collective imagination.

His latest work to receive its UK premiere at the Albert Hall formed part of a typically uncompromising programme devised by Oliver Knussen. Sebastian im Traum, first heard in Amsterdam 18 months ago, sees the 81-year-old Henze returning to one of his earliest influences: the expressionist poet Georg Trakl. But this is not a valedictory; nor does it wallow in the autumnal tone of the poem that inspired it. In fact, what is striking is the purposefulness that Henze threads through this 15-minute piece. It begins with a treading pulse low in the orchestra, which rises up through a mellifluous trio of flutes before gathering pace. Short, hopeful, ascending phrases weave together as Henze structures his orchestra into layers, low instruments alternating with high ones, winds conversing with strings. But it&apos;s that first sense of pulse that underpins the entire work, with throbbing, rocking, even-note rhythms that are disturbed only when a burst from the violas sends things skipping. Bar the odd untidy moment, the BBC Symphony Orchestra were on good form. Schoenberg&apos;s Five Orchestral Pieces led smoothly into the glinting world of Knussen&apos;s own compact gem of a Violin Concerto. The eloquent solo part was played with assurance, if occasionally not quite enough grit, by Leila Josefowicz. Stravinsky&apos;s Rite of Spring was heard in a 1943 revision that makes little obvious difference until the final pages, when a leaner orchestration makes the frenzy clearer and harsher. Under Knussen, the introduction was gentle but evocative, the rest poised and brisk. His gestures are almost comically succinct; if you watched him with the sound turned off, you might think he was conducting Haydn.", "sentences": ["Sebastian im Traum, first heard in Amsterdam 18 months ago, sees the 81-year-old Henze returning to one of his earliest influences: the expressionist poet Georg Trakl."], "title": "BBCSO/Knussen Royal Albert Hall, London", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/20/proms2007.proms1", "tags": ["Music", "Proms 2007", "Proms", "Classical music", "Festivals", "Culture", "BBC Symphony Orchestra"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-20T23:00:30Z", "article": "The whole point is to do it again,&quot; J\u00fcrgen Grobler says quietly at the secluded and suddenly deserted Lac d&apos;Aiguebelette as he reveals why he is the most enduringly successful coach in British sport. His six crews of rippling rowers, preparing for the world championships which begin this weekend, are back at their hotel in Novalaise, an hour from Lyon. As they wolf down a hearty lunch, burping and wisecracking after a brutal training session, their coach studies the lake with compelling intensity. Despite the heavy cloud turning the water a shade of metallic grey, it is as if Grobler can already see a familiar tinge of gold, silver and bronze. In an extraordinary career, moving from East German communism to life on the sedate banks of Henley-on-Thames, Grobler has won an unprecedented haul of medals over the last 35 years at successive Olympic Games, World Cups and world championships. Even more than Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent, the iron-willed rowers with whom he shared so much glory, Grobler has produced a remarkable sporting legacy. &quot;I won my first Olympics medal as a coach in 1972 and since then the ambition is not to miss out at any big event. The only time it went wrong was in 1984 when the GDR [German Democratic Republic] boycotted the Los Angeles Olympics. I had pain because we went through everything in training before the authorities stopped us. I never want that same empty feeling and that&apos;s why I&apos;m always hungry to win more.&quot; There is a striking symmetry to the arc of Grobler&apos;s 35-year journey. After winning his first bronze at the 1972 Munich Games he returns this week to the same city with serious medal hopes in three of the six world championship categories. His coxless four, unbeaten in 27 races, are closing in on gold - just as they plan to do in Beijing next year, when Grobler expects to add to his personal tally of 15 Olympic gold medals. Yet it was to the east of Munich, in Magdeburg, an industrial town on the River Elbe, that Grobler first imagined himself as a coach. In 1963, at the age of 17, he decided to devote his life to coaching. His father, an architect, was dubious - especially with two other sons bound for medicine and physics. &quot;He was not so supportive of my idea,&quot; Grobler remembers. &quot;My father said, &apos;How can you live from sport?&apos; It was new thinking and even my teacher said I should lower my aim and do the same as him - work at a school. I said, &apos;No, I want to coach.&apos; And I got on to a course where they only took 15 students from hundreds of applicants. It was a five-year study of high-performance sport which gave a wonderful foundation.&quot; If much of East Germany&apos;s sporting programme has been blighted by subsequent doping scandals, Grobler argues that in terms of rigorous professionalism and scientific innovations the GDR was years ahead of the west. By the time he became East Germany&apos;s youngest ever rowing coach, Grobler had embraced computer technology and hydrodynamics as he revolutionised the ancient art of men using oars to propel a boat across water. The computers, then, were as big as houses. Grobler&apos;s ambition was just as large. His success opened the way for a dramatic switch when, in January 1991, he accepted an offer to coach in Britain. Grobler&apos;s amazement on his arrival is still obvious. &quot;There was just the River Thames, some boats and a shed. The rowers used it as a gym and it was cold and hard. We had no heating and no money. I was a little shocked because it was like going back 20 years. It made me admire the rowers even more. &quot;Steve Redgrave had already won two Olympic golds and so I didn&apos;t come like I was the guru. I also saw how much tougher it was than the GDR, where everything was funded and athletes were regarded as important. Here, even Steve had to fight to get money to go to a regatta. Some rowers took bank loans to fund themselves in an international year. I would watch Steve and the others take the Union Jack to represent their country, funding themselves all the way, and I couldn&apos;t believe it.&quot; Redgrave and Grobler changed the course of British rowing and the coach believes his most famous oarsman actually helped transform this country&apos;s attitude towards international sport. &quot;When I came here there was still this British thing about underdogs. Back then losers were more popular than Steve. In articles it was almost like you had to apologise for winning. But Steve, on his way to winning gold at five Olympics, became the model. It was his breakthrough in professional thinking that changed British attitudes. Now the public loves success and they are very proud of British winners.&quot; Grobler&apos;s impact on Redgrave between 1991 and 2000, when he defied all odds to win three more Olympic gold medals, was profound. &quot;Steve, along with Matthew, was very open. When I said we needed high-altitude training in 1992 it didn&apos;t matter that they had no money. They just said, &apos;You&apos;re the boss&apos;. They allowed me to make big changes - even when they didn&apos;t like it. &quot;The stroke is the big-name seat. So when I told Steve I wanted to move him from stroke to the bow seat it was tough. I start doing it in training and when I said we should try it in competition he makes a funny noise. So I leave it for a while and then I suggest it again. He accepts it then and the boat goes like a dream because Steve sees he can play an important role there. It was the same with Matthew, who had it even more difficult. They would be interviewed as a pair and no one ever asked Matthew a single question. It was all about Steve. I felt so sorry for Matthew, but he coped very well. Steve was also growing up and saying, &apos;It&apos;s us two - not just me&apos;. &quot;The thing I liked most about these guys was that our first question was always &apos;How can we win again?&apos; It was never &apos;How can we make money?&apos;. We discussed whether they should make more speeches, because they could earn some money. I supported them in one way but I also reminded them that if they stopped winning they would make no speeches at all. The important thing was to keep training and winning.&quot; Grobler has little hesitation when pinpointing his sweetest moment in rowing. &quot;It has to be the Olympics in 2000 when Steve won his fifth gold [in the coxless four] after he&apos;d had so much pain in 1996 and said, &apos;If I ever get in a boat again you must shoot me&apos;. While training for 2000 he got diabetes and we had so much pressure on us. So when we did it I felt the tears because it was great for Steve but it was also great for the three others. This was my hat-trick of Olympic golds with Matthew and Tim Foster and James Cracknell got their first. It was very special.&quot; Grobler&apos;s most recent triumph, at the World Cup in Amsterdam this June, is described with almost as much pleasure. With typical invention he combined his unbeaten coxless four and gold medal-chasing pair as part of a &quot;Super 8&quot; who would come together for one regatta. &quot;It was amazing for me to coach an eight at international level. As chief coach you pick the smaller crews first and bring all the other guys in the eight. Coaching the biggest boat is time-consuming and so it was a dramatic decision.&quot; He pauses for reflection. &quot;When I asked the rowers I could see they were very surprised. But then they said, &apos;Yeah, that&apos;s a great idea. It&apos;ll be big fun!&apos; That&apos;s what you want to hear from young people. But part of the reason I did it is that, with the Olympics coming up, the four are under pressure. Journalists keep reminding them they haven&apos;t lost in 27 races. But the New Zealanders and Dutch are very close and I don&apos;t want to give them many chances to see us in action. So it kept the opposition guessing while giving us variety in training. &quot;Before the final I was more pumped-up than ever because this was my chance to coach an eight to a big victory. We are up against specialist crews but in the final we led all the way and it was even more satisfying for me that our regular eight also got bronze. To have 16 British rowers on the podium was a wonderful feeling that makes me want to keep winning.&quot; When asked if, after Beijing, he might consider trying for gold with an eight at the London Olympics, Grobler&apos;s face cracks open in a grin of anticipation. &quot;It would be another big challenge and so I would definitely not say no to the idea now. It is a huge ambition of mine to coach successful British crews at their home Olympics in 2012.&quot; As he allows himself to briefly look ahead, the 61-year-old laughs in delight. &quot;You see why I have the perfect answer when people say I should write a book. I tell them I am far too young and that I have a lot more races ahead. How can there be a book when the story is far from over?&quot;", "sentences": ["It was very special.&quot; Grobler&apos;s most recent triumph, at the World Cup in Amsterdam this June, is described with almost as much pleasure."], "title": "Rowing: Grobler has more chapters to write", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/aug/21/sport.sport", "tags": ["Sport", "Rowing"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-21T23:30:31Z", "article": "It is a very long time since a friendly really was a showpiece but it still seemed peculiar to find England using a match with Brazil to prepare for the serious business of facing Estonia.

The oddity of it all is compounded by the fact that 90,000 people have still paid to be at Wembley tonight. England, whatever the true priorities, have to be sufficiently in earnest to keep faith with those fans. As Steve McClaren knows from the raw experience of being beaten by Spain six months ago, friendlies somehow become significant when his side loses one. A little contentment would not go amiss either when the critical moments of the Euro 2008 qualifiers are imminent. Andy Johnson withdrew from the squad yesterday because of fluid on his knee and McClaren made the familiar complaint of all international managers. &quot;I&apos;ve been involved with England for six years now,&quot; he said, &quot;and I don&apos;t think there&apos;s been any occasion where we&apos;ve sat down and named the 11 players we wanted to.&quot; Maybe not but his line-up is liable to be more convincing than expected and, in theory, it should have an advantage over a particularly depleted Germany. Training this morning and a check on a few individuals who are carrying knocks will be needed for confirmation but the side could contain eight members of what is theoretically his best line-up: Paul Robinson, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry, Ashley Cole, David Beckham, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and Michael Owen. He will be happy, as well, to send out Micah Richards, Michael Carrick and Alan Smith. McClaren confirmed that Beckham had been particularly lively and sharp at training yesterday. It is as if LA Galaxy&apos;s star has made it a priority to silence talk of his ankle knock and the debilitating effects of flying from America each time he turns out for England. While he holds on to his place there could be a youngster immediately behind him on the flank who is getting ready to grip an opportunity. The 19-year-old Richards should be at right-back if Ferdinand and Terry occupy their normal berths at the heart of the defence. He impressed there on his debut for England in Amsterdam last season and, as Gary Neville&apos;s recovery from an ankle problem continues to take far longer than had been expected, the Manchester City player must have it in mind to make the position his own. McClaren might have been egging him on, so enthusiastic was he about Richards. &quot;People are raving about him, quite rightly, for his performances,&quot; said the manager. &quot;One man&apos;s injury is another man&apos;s opportunity. It can put you in the team.&quot; Even so McClaren is very far from wearying of the old guard. Owen is actually a mere 27 but injury tribulations in the past year or two would have been enough to make anyone haggard. His season began, as a substitute, in the closing half-hour of Newcastle United&apos;s draw with Aston Villa at the weekend. That outing was a relief to McClaren. &quot;Michael is a big, big player for us,&quot; he said, recalling the striker&apos;s work for England late last season, including a goal in the 3-0 European qualifying win in Estonia. &quot;We will be giving him some minutes [against Germany] in preparation for when we play Israel and Russia in three weeks&apos; time. He is a genuine world-class goalscorer.&quot; With Johnson ruled out and the Liverpool striker Peter Crouch suspended for the Israel match, it would be logical for McClaren to partner Owen with his fellow Newcastle player Smith. The latter was subdued against Brazil in June but the manager feels he was still getting over the broken leg he suffered while at Manchester United. &quot;He has since had a pre-season,&quot; said McClaren. &quot;Alan Smith&apos;s commitment is fantastic and he&apos;s needed that to come back from injury.&quot; Though the player is now regarded as something of a midfielder at St James&apos; Park, England will have no qualms about making him the spearhead of the team. Tonight&apos;s occasion carries a more sombre meaning for Robinson, whose form has shaded off with Tottenham Hotspur. McClaren confirmed that he remained No1 with England but faces &quot;competition&quot;. That comes, primarily, in the impressive shape of the recalled veteran David James So far as the manager is concerned, this week&apos;s involvement with England is almost a period of respite for his men after a run of three &quot;hectic&quot; fixtures in a week with their clubs. Perhaps they needed to convene to be reminded of the substantial challenges that continue until the closing match in Group E, against Croatia at Wembley. A friendly is peripheral but any win over Germany is stimulating for England.", "sentences": ["He impressed there on his debut for England in Amsterdam last season and, as Gary Neville&apos;s recovery from an ankle problem continues to take far longer than had been expected, the Manchester City player must have it in mind to make the position his own."], "title": "Kevin McCarra: England in need of a confidence boost", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/aug/22/newsstory.sport9", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Friendlies"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-23T23:04:07Z", "article": "It began as a rash, a summer virus of a familiar kind, but by yesterday morning had become an epidemic, leading readers to fear for their sanity. Within the pages of a single British newspaper, it was reported that pensioners risk sexually transmitted infections because of their energetic bedhopping; that daily exposure to the sun may help to prevent cancer; that so-called good cholesterol might actually increase the risk of heart attacks; and that permitting nurses to write prescriptions is putting patients at risk. But, although the Daily Mail has it worse than most, it is not an isolated case. Elsewhere in yesterday&apos;s news were reports that yoghurt may kill you, as may &quot;weekend mini-breaks&quot;, while noisy neighbours can bring on cardiac arrest, potentially fatal insect bites are increasing in Britain - and making children wait to use the loo on motorway trips might make them susceptible to urinary infections. On the positive side, zebrafish might cure skin cancer. Virulent as ebola, this outbreak of medical fear is partly explained by the conditions of journalism. The reports on which the fear pieces are based are generally published in medical journals, where they&apos;re offered for sober peer review. Such a process will acknowledge that bodies are unpredictable and still often unknowable, and the pill that cures one patient can kill another. This means that medical research, rather like law, becomes an adversarial system, proposition and counter-claim alternating. So, a week after one lot of doctors say that sunbathing will give us all skin cancer, another laboratory asserts that a tan may protect against colon carcinoma. However newspaper reporting, a broad-brush form, tends to present the headline findings without statistical balance - how many grannies actually have the clap? What proportion of UK funerals is caused by the stress of the neighbours turning up the radio, or by taking a few days in Amsterdam? This approach has not changed, but what is new this summer is the increase in space for tabloid quackery because of a general decision to give Gordon Brown a period of quarantine from the kind of anti-government coverage that has filled front pages for years. Blair scare has been replaced by health scare. A deeper explanation, though, is psychological or anthropological. By interesting coincidence, Channel 4 this week screened a remarkable film by Richard Dawkins in which he examined the paradox that, though homeopathy and other alternative medical therapies are scientifically ridiculous, they are successful for a significant number of patients. His conclusion was that, though homeopathic treatments consist of water and a speck of something else, they work because the practitioners of the art are generally kind, gentle people who offer a length and intensity of care impossible for GPs. What alternative medicine is offering is that old parental medicine: TLC. In the film, Dawkins didn&apos;t link this with his other area of investigation - the durability of organised religion - but there surely is a connection. Alongside the &quot;selfish gene&quot; best-sellingly identified by Dawkins, there seems to be a &quot;fear gene&quot; or &quot;lonely gene&quot; that predisposes people to respond to kindness and reassurance, even to the extent of reversing illness and injury. The cliched idea of doctors playing God here takes on a new meaning. What the writer Anthony Burgess called the &quot;God-shaped hole&quot; that many humans feel the need to fill can also present itself as a doctor-sized gap and, in a world becoming more generally secular outside pockets of religious intensity, is perhaps more likely to do so. Just as religious doctrine can make life more tolerable by offering scientifically unverifiable promises that bring psychological benefits, so does alternative medicine. But the extent to which health has become a displacement religion - a desire for a spotless body replacing that for a pure soul - is shown by the daily diet of scare stories in the papers. In most religions, the hope of the faithful is encouraged by fear of what may happen if they fail to comply. The media, with burning sermons every day, including Sunday - warning that what you&apos;ve got in your fridge or your genes may finish you off - are the Book of Apocalypse of the Church of the Latter-Day Quacks; the medical correspondents and headline writers its high priests. This matters because worship of the god of the body has consequences. These may not be as serious as the perversions of organised religion - jihad, murdered abortion doctors - but they still matter. The worst that can happen from the reports of octogenarians with gonorrhoea is longer queues in Boots as arthritic fingers fumble out the change for a packet of three. Other sermons, though, have potentially fatal consequences. The bewilderingly conflicting pieces on the mechanics of blood pressure and cholesterol may convince patients to abandon medication. The injunction to let children pee whenever they need could lead scores of cars to pull on to the hard shoulder where, road statistics show, they face much greater risks than urinary infection. The biggest medical risk, though, is reading a summer newspaper, in the car or anywhere else. That can really make you sick. comment@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["What proportion of UK funerals is caused by the stress of the neighbours turning up the radio, or by taking a few days in Amsterdam?"], "title": "Mark Lawson: Feeding the fear gene", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/24/comment.health", "tags": ["Health", "Society", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-23T23:07:54Z", "article": "Almost every major record label seems to have an archive of recordings by Sviatoslav Richter, whether made in the studio or taken from his recitals.

Capriccio may be an acquired taste, but Strauss connoisseurs value it highly. The composer called it a &quot;conversation piece&quot; and its central debate about the relationship between words and music in opera was one that preoccupied him throughout his career.

A clear sign that the team see these championships as a platform towards winning their target of three medals at next year&apos;s Beijing Olympics is the presence of the World Cup trophy in the team&apos;s hotel lobby. It was won by Britain for the first time last month. But with the leading nations picking up momentum towards the Olympics, the team manager David Tanner knows that defending the two gold medals won last year at Eton in the men&apos;s four and women&apos;s quad will be difficult. In addition, the team are expected to secure their Olympic berths and Tanner points to this as his priority for Munich: &quot;The first and most important thing is that we qualify boats for the Olympics here. And there will be some very tough calls.&quot; Tanner knows that the toughest call, not just for the British team but for the other traditionally strong rowing nations like Germany and the United States, is the remarkable rise of the Chinese team. Tanner explains: &quot;The Chinese team was rampant [at the World Cup regatta] in Amsterdam this year, where they won five events and medalled in others.&quot; One of those Amsterdam victories was over the British women in the quad sculls. There, the world champions could find no answer to the Chinese mid-course surge. But Tanner is confident that, after some injury worries to Katherine Grainger, his top women&apos;s boat will reassert themselves: &quot;We are perfectly capable of being up with the Chinese women. They&apos;re not unbeatable and we believe we can do it.&quot; China are fielding a men&apos;s four, but they should not prove the biggest problem for Britain&apos;s other world champion crew. Yet the men&apos;s coach J\u00fcrgen Gr\u00f6bler&apos;s top boat face their biggest challenge yet if they are to win a third successive gold. Both New Zealand and Holland have beaten the British this year and the American crew contains their top performer Bryan Volpenheim, whose crew famously beat Gr\u00f6bler&apos;s four at Lucerne in their last race before the Athens Olympics. It was in part the extra speed found by their nearest competitors which induced Gr\u00f6bler to change his crew&apos;s technique after Lucerne. But Steve Williams, bow in the British four, is unfazed by the opposition: &quot;We haven&apos;t really thought an awful lot about them, which might sound a bit funny.&quot; But, Williams explained, that was not out of disrespect: &quot;We don&apos;t talk about them in our sessions but we put all our energy in trying to get our shop right.&quot; The British four have been tested in training by the speed of Britain&apos;s single sculler Alan Campbell, who a year on from his fifth place in last year&apos;s world championships is in much better shape. Tanner explained: &quot;Alan&apos;s sculling better than ever before.&quot; But in what Tanner describes as a &quot;beastly&quot; field, including Olaf Tufte, the Olympic champion and New Zealand&apos;s world-record holder Mahe Drysdale, Campbell will do exceptionally well to win a medal. Apart from the presence of the Chinese, Tanner pinpoints the threat of the small nations - more than 70 countries have entered boats at this year&apos;s championships and many of those target certain events. In the men&apos;s double, one such crew is Estonia, who stand in the way of the ambitions of Steven Rowbotham and Matt Wells, who want to turn last year&apos;s bronze medal into gold. The same is true for the men&apos;s lightweight crews. In particular, the speed of the men&apos;s four, who won at the World Cup regatta in Lucerne, has been impressive. But, as Tanner says: &quot;That win was important but if they want to repeat it here, they must step up another level.&quot; Medal prospects Gold Men&apos;s four Steve Williams, Peter Reed, Alex Partridge, Andy Hodge Women&apos;s quad Annie Vernon, Debbie Flood, Fran Houghton, Katherine Grainger Silver or bronze Men&apos;s single Alan Campbell Men&apos;s double Steve Rowbotham and Matt Wells Lightweight men&apos;s four Richard Chambers, James Lindsay-Fynn, Paul Mattick, James Clarke Lightweight men&apos;s double Mark Hunter, Zac Purchase Outside chance Men&apos;s eight Tom Parker, Tom Stallard, Tom Lucy, Tom Solesbury, Josh West, Richard Egington, Robin Bourne-Taylor, Alastair Heathcote, Acer Nethercott (cox)", "sentences": ["Tanner explains: &quot;The Chinese team was rampant [at the World Cup regatta] in Amsterdam this year, where they won five events and medalled in others.&quot; One of those Amsterdam victories was over the British women in the quad sculls."], "title": "Rowing: Chinese are biggest danger as British crews aim for Olympic berths", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/aug/25/sport.sport", "tags": ["Sport", "Rowing"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-25T22:53:49Z", "article": "The statistics are mind boggling: 600 DJs, 65,000 clubbers, 40 venues.

The revelation came following the arrests of seven more teenagers yesterday, including two girls, from the Croxteth and Norris Green areas of north Liverpool that border Croxteth Park, where Rhys was shot dead last Wednesday. The teenagers range in age from 15-19. Two other boys arrested last week have been released on police bail. Locals are circulating the name of one teen they believe to be the killer. A police spokeswoman confirmed they were in possession of a grainy image of the killer taken from CCTV footage of the area around the Fir Tree pub where Rhys was killed. Chief Superintendent Chris Armitt, head of criminal justice at Merseyside police, said: &apos;We have recovered a number of CCTV images. We need to ensure those images are in the best possible condition, so they have been sent away to be enhanced and enlarged. This will take days.&apos; The Observer can also reveal the key witness to Rhys&apos;s murder was just two yards away from the killer as he fired the shots. Speaking publicly for the first time, the young mother told how she looked into the eyes of the killer as he paused after firing. &apos;He looked over at me, right into my face, then fired two more shots,&apos; said the woman, who was waiting for her daughter and has asked to remain anonymous. &apos;He was between 13 and 15 years old, white and on a black BMX, wearing a dark, hooded top. He turned at the same time and I saw his eyes. When he had fired two more shots, the boy calmly cycled away and I ran past Rhys, who was on the floor, and grabbed my daughter.&apos; The new arrests came hours after the shooting of two bouncers in the Penny Lane area of the city and on a day of high emotion as Rhys&apos;s father, Stephen, and his brother Owen, 17, attended the Everton versus Blackburn Rovers football match at Goodison Park. A minute&apos;s applause was held before the match and both sides wore black armbands. Last night, the civil rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson criticised a culture that allows youngsters in Britain to turn to gangs and said those harbouring Rhys&apos;s killer were conspirators to murder. Police sources familiar with the Liverpool underworld have told The Observer that the city&apos;s thriving gang culture is being orchestrated by corrupt private security firms who are using teenagers to help run their drug-dealing and protection rackets. The firms offer companies, building sites and shopkeepers &apos;protection&apos; against the gangs to whom they supply &apos;pollen&apos; - cannabis containing large amounts of the hallucinogenic chemical, PCP. Teenage gangs such as the Croxteth Crew and the Nogzy, who come from Norris Green and are blamed for much of the area&apos;s violence, work for the private security firms, according to the sources, who also said some members could earn up to \u00a31,000 a week. &apos;The firms say to legitimate businesses, &quot;We can get rid of these kids for you, if you pay us,&quot;&apos; said one source, who estimated there are some 500 gang members in the city and between 3,000 and 4,000 drug dealers. Members of the teen gangs are used to regularly bring in small supplies of &apos;pollen&apos; from Amsterdam through airports in the north of England, so that if they get stopped they will not receive jail sentences. Last night plans for informants to anonymously tip off the police about illegally held guns were being drawn up by the Home Office. Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said the Home Office was also considering neutral &apos;drop-off zones&apos; where weapons could be handed in. She said her priority was to get guns off the streets, amid mounting public alarm about the recent spate of shootings involving young children and teenagers. It is estimated much of the &apos;hijack&apos; trade in stolen lorries on Britain&apos;s motorways is carried out by criminals working for the private security firms. In recent raids on a number of security companies, 14 people were arrested and more than 1.5kg of cocaine recovered.", "sentences": ["Members of the teen gangs are used to regularly bring in small supplies of &apos;pollen&apos; from Amsterdam through airports in the north of England, so that if they get stopped they will not receive jail sentences."], "title": "Parents join emotional tribute at Everton as police net widens", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/26/ukguns.ukcrime1", "tags": ["Rhys Jones", "UK news", "Crime", "Gun crime", "World news", "Liverpool"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-26T22:50:26Z", "article": "The August bank holiday signals a sea change in holiday habits. After this weekend, the airports will start to calm down, children begin to return to their classrooms and the oppressive temperatures in southern Europe will lift. Now, in short, is the perfect time for a city break.  Easyjet has seen a surge in bookings to Barcelona, Faro, Malaga, Paris and Alicante but search hard enough and you should find reasonable fares - including flights from Luton to Paris, leaving on 5 September, returning on the 11th, for \u00a359 return, including tax.  Lastminute.com has seen increased demand for the southern part of Europe, fuelled by the disappointing weather in Britain this summer. Bookings to Rome are up 170 per cent on last year but the company has a two-night package to the city, staying at the three-star Hotel Villa St Dominique on 7 September, flying from Heathrow, but returning to Gatwick. The cost is \u00a3179pp.  Barcelona offers the best of both worlds - a city with a beach on its doorstep. Its nocturnal ways mean renting a flat is an ideal way to experience it. Barcelona-home.com has plenty of accommodation to chose from and displays the size and location of the flat clearly - weekend breaks beginning on 7 September start at \u00a3153.  Lisbon&apos;s popularity has boomed recently but for those free this week ITC Classics has a four-night break staying at the Four Seasons hotel for \u00a3669pp including flights, transfers and B&amp;B accommodation. It&apos;s a saving of \u00a3110pp on the normal price, but you must depart before 31 August.  Ryanair is pushing northern Europe with \u00a310 flights to Oslo, Stockholm, Bremen and Brussels in September. High demand for southern Europe has raised prices (although there are a few flights from Bournemouth and Prestwick to Marseilles for \u00a310 and \u00a318 respectively).  Should the long-promised Indian summer happen, Amsterdam has canals to lounge by (and museums to haunt if it doesn&apos;t). Expedia has three nights at the Hilton Amsterdam for \u00a3307pp, a saving of \u00a3120pp, including flights from Heathrow on 14 September. Meanwhile British Airways Holidays has four nights in Salzburg from \u00a3397 including flights from Gatwick and B&amp;B accommodation at the four-star Hotel Auersperg.  For those who prefer not to fly, Irish Ferries has good availability on their Holyhead to Dublin route. A three-night break staying at the four-star Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel, a 20-minute drive from the centre of Dublin, costs \u00a3382 for two people including ferry crossings.

The defending champions beat the German squad by one second and the Chinese by two with a sparkling performance that indicated they will be the team to beat. The British women not only won a direct place in the final but showed they have cast off the injury worries surrounding Katherine Grainger. Although the Scot has been moved back from stroke to bow, the British still recorded the fastest time of the day. Grainger said she was confident of reversing their defeat in Amsterdam by China in June. The quad&apos;s victory was crucial because it ensured the British women became the first boat in the team to qualify for Beijing. &quot;The Olympics next year is our key focus and now we&apos;ve ticked that box,&quot; said a delighted Fran Houghton. Her reaction was understandable because Grainger&apos;s disc injury meant Annie Vernon had to be moved up into the stroke seat. But the 24-year-old showed no signs of being overawed and set a cracking early pace. The Germans were a length behind after the first quarter and, though they tried everything to get back on terms, the damage had been done. Vernon revelled in the experience of covering the numerous German moves. &quot;It&apos;s been a sharp learning curve for me and I feel much more in the action.&quot; The lightweight men&apos;s crews were in superb form as they dominated their fields.

Hannover 96 were actually happy to escape Munich relatively unscathed on Saturday: losing 3-0 with 10 men must be rated a decent result in these unreservedly red days. In his last-ever Bundesliga season, Oliver Kahn has been so utterly redundant in the Bayern goal that S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung advised him to open up an allotment in his six-yard-box, as &quot;growing radish, cucumbers and carrots would be more sensible than futile waiting for shots on his goal&quot;. Goalscorer Mark van Bommel warned that, &quot;no one&apos;s ever won every game,&quot; but he seemed unsure whether to heed his own warning. Bremen and Stuttgart at least kept up the pretence of a pursuit by both winning by the smallest of margins. Werder had a very tough time in N\u00fcrnberg but were saved by their 19-year-old Austrian amateur Martin Harnik. &quot;We avoided total collapse and are slowly making progress,&quot; said involuntary Aston Villa target Per Mertesacker. The champions Stuttgart, too, were a bit rusty. Mario Gomez, who had sat out Germany&apos;s trip to Wembley in order to recover for the much tougher match against newly-promoted MSV Duisburg - they actually play with a goalkeeper - was on hand to secure all three points for VfB. The real stars of this weekend, however, were two teams who are rarely spoken of in positive terms - if they are spoken of at all, that is. A quick look at the table confirms that VfL Bochum and Arminia Bielefeld, both perfectly inoffensive representatives of the Bundesliga-species &quot;grey mice&quot; (a German phrase for unfashionable teams) are currently flying higher than a kite in Amsterdam. &quot;Can Bayern stop Bielefeld and Bochum?&quot; wondered Die Welt, in a rare outbreak of wit. In Bielefeld, a city in Westphalia famous for, ahem, nothing much at all, they were celebrating all night after beating Hertha BSC Berlin 2-0 on Saturday. Hertha had been the better side, but Arminia somehow won and their manager Ernst Middendorp, a man not adverse to the odd tipple, quickly gave everyone two days off and reached straight for the Chardonnay. Middendorp, or &quot;Power-Ernst&quot; as they call him in the Sch\u00fccoArena, is one of the Bundesliga&apos;s secret attractions, a man so obsessed with success that he&apos;s often compared to Cologne&apos;s ex-cocaine addict Christoph Daum. &quot;I&apos;m crazy, but he&apos;s insane,&quot; the ex-sporting director R\u00fcdiger Lamm once memorably observed. Middendorp, in his third spell at the club, was voted Bielefeld&apos;s manager of the century two years ago and seven points from nine constitute the club&apos;s best start to a season in 25 years. Middendorp had to wait nearly 10 years to get back to the club that he really loves. After his second spell came to an end in 1998, he coached Asante Kokoke and Accra Hearts of Oak in Ghana, Traktorsazi Tabriz (Iran) and the Kaizer Chiefs, where they called him &quot;Middendraw&quot; because his preference for results-oriented football was at odds with the fans&apos; clamour for entertainment. Upon his return to the Bundesliga, he baffled everyone with a plethora of anglicisms and over-complicated grammar, but also managed to save Bielefeld from seemingly certain relegation in the process. A recent incident that resulted in an eight-month driving ban proves that his wild days are not quite over, but Middendorp has certainly mellowed. Gone are the days when he was constantly clashing with the press and once dismissed a request for a radio interview with the immortal line &quot;Knien Sie nieder, Sie Bratwurst!&quot; (Kneel down, you frying sausage!). Middendorp must be credited with getting the maximum out of Bielefeld&apos;s modest squad, but some praise should also go Artur Wichniarek, their Polish striker. Wichniarek, who is incessantly referred to as &quot;King Artur&quot; in the tabloid press, is the sensitive type. Last season he complained that the club printed a T-shirt in honour of crowd pleaser Jonas Kamper and decided to wear a top bearing the word &quot;topscorer&quot; in protest. He then mysteriously picked up thousands of votes in the fans&apos; poll for player of the year - hackers had obviously manipulated the voting but Wichniarek was so upset by the suspicion of foul play that he threatened a return to Poland. Fortunately for Bielefeld, he stayed. His goal on Saturday puts him on course to become the highest goalscorer in the history of Bielefeld. The current record stands at 28. Bochum manager Marcel Koller is the opposite of Middendorp, the most sober and diplomatic coach you could imagine. After his side beat Hamburg 2-1 on Friday night to briefly occupy top spot, he joked that he would photograph the table and hang the picture in his room. That&apos;s the most bravado he has ever mustered. Koller&apos;s quiet pragmatism never stood a chance in the cauldron of Cologne but he&apos;s worked wonders at Bochum, in tandem with Baddiel and Skinner favourite Stefan Kuntz, the sporting director. (His name is actually not pronounced like Immanuel Kant, in case you wondered.) Kuntz has unearthed a number of cheap but excellent players, like last year&apos;s topscorer Theofanis Gekas. This season, smart signings include French midfielder Marc Pfertzel and Stanislav Sestak from Slovakia; newspapers have dubbed Bochum &quot;little Bremen&quot; for their clever dealings. Can the grey mice do to the fat cats of Bayern what Itchy does to Scratchy? That might be a tad optimistic, but the Bundesliga wouldn&apos;t mind if they could at least nibble at Kahn&apos;s vegetables a bit.

The worst case of this musical estrangement I can recall was at last year&apos;s Proms, when Bernard Haitink conducted Mahler&apos;s 2nd Symphony.  Now, I&apos;m a big fan of Uncle Bernie, and this was the sort of repertoire in which he should have excelled; but for some reason it just wasn&apos;t happening for me. Perhaps it was the humidity, or the fact that I hadn&apos;t found myself an acoustically perfect place in which to plant myself. Or maybe it was that my poor, long-suffering girlfriend - never that keen on Mahler to begin with - was feeling ill and so spent half the performance looking as though she was one brass chorale away from passing out. Whatever the case, I found the whole performance disappointingly prosaic, especially in light of the high expectations I&apos;d had for it. But a disappointing performance is one thing: what really pained me was that everyone else seemed to have had such a ball. The audience erupted with applause, showering St Bernard with bravo after bravo. &quot;Prom of the season,&quot; a friend later told me; one of the best Mahler Seconds he&apos;d ever heard. Were we at the same performance? I found myself struck by the same question on Friday night, when Haitink returned to perform Bruckner&apos;s 8th Symphony with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam. It should have been a real occasion, but no matter how hard I tried I just couldn&apos;t get into it. Far from being transported to that magical Brucknerian plane where time seems to stand still, I felt every last foot-throbbing second of the symphony&apos;s 80-minute span - and I wasn&apos;t at all happy about it.

Rarer, however, are the tea towels that the artist painted on himself. Recent research undertaken by Louis van Tilborgh, of Amsterdam&apos;s Van Gogh Museum, has focused on the works by the artist which are not painted on canvas. At times late in his career the painter ran out of canvas and used whatever he could lay his hands on. Sometimes he overpainted existing works, sometimes he used paper, and on occasion cloth. An examination of a group of works dating from Van Gogh&apos;s time at the mental asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole in Saint R\u00e9my de Provence reveals that the artist used a tablecloth or tea towel for The Large Plane Trees (now in the Cleveland Museum of Art) and Wheatfields in a Mountainous Landscape (now in the Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, Otterlo). The Art Newspaper speculates that the cloth came from the asylum kitchens, and says a tiny grid pattern of red rectangles is faintly visible where the paint is thin. This ties in with a letter the artist wrote to his brother, Theo, on November 16 1889, requesting new supplies of canvas - which did not arrive until weeks later. According to Mr Tilborgh, Van Gogh tended to use unorthodox materials only when he had to, so these oils on tea towel tend to be dated together. Van Gogh was often short of money and materials. This month art historians discovered a lost Van Gogh, Wild Vegetation, hidden under another painting in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Painted in June 1889, it was discovered in an x-ray of The Ravine, which Van Gogh painted on the same canvas four months later, the Van Gogh Museum said yesterday. &quot;One of our specialists looked at the x-ray and recognised it as resembling a drawing from the museum,&quot; said Natalie Bos, a spokeswoman for the museum. In May 1890 Van Gogh moved from Provence to Auvers-sur-Oise, about 20 miles from Paris. Two months on he would shoot himself in the chest and die, but he began by working at a terrific rate and apparently ran out of canvas again. He started painting on tea towels with a red border - perhaps from the kitchen of the Auberge Ravoux, where he was staying. The works on this material are two still lifes of flowers in a vase, both in private collections, and Daubigny&apos;s Garden, in the Van Gogh Museum.

Carlyle Capital Corporation, which has $22.7bn largely tied up in mortgage-backed securities, raised $322m only last month by floating on the Amsterdam-based Euronext exchange. Disgruntled clients have accused it of failing to keep them informed of events. In an open letter to investors yesterday, John Stomber, chief executive, said a liquidity squeeze across markets was worse than the crisis caused by Long-Term Capital Management&apos;s demise in 1998. Because its investments are worth less, the Channel Islands firm&apos;s lenders have demanded extra collateral. To meet these requirements, it has offloaded 5% of its assets for $900m - at a loss of up to $40m. Its Washington-based parent, Carlyle Group, has lent $100m in seven days to help it meet commitments. Mr Stomber told investors in a letter: &quot;We designed CCC&apos;s business model to withstand a liquidity event equal to the events of October 1998, when the demise of Long-Term Capital Management threatened the financial markets. We believe the recent liquidity disruption is significantly worse than the events of 1998.&quot; Carlyle Capital joins a long list of institutions pummelled by the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage industry. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Carlyle&apos;s private equity rival, has seen a similar liability develop at its offshoot KKR Financial Holdings.

Enthusiasts are said to be lining up to own one, and investors are also calling the company. The man behind the revival is Stephen Wynne - a car mechanic originally from Maghull in Merseyside who spent 25 years maintaining many of the almost 9,000 DeLoreans that made it off a Belfast assembly line in the early 1980s. The &quot;new&quot; DeLoreans will be built in a suburb of Houston, Texas, where Wynne has a 3,700 sq m warehouse chock-full of DeLorean car parts, which were sold by the liquidators when the company flamed out after less than two years of production. Former General Motors car designer John DeLorean established the DeLorean motor company in Northern Ireland using \u00a378m of British taxpayer money. He was able to convince the British government that the world wanted a stainless steel muscle car. However in the end he was unable to convince enough customers to buy one. The liquidators arrived in 1983, a year after DeLorean was charged with conspiring to sell $24m (\u00a312m) worth of cocaine to keep his company afloat. He accused the FBI of entrapment and was eventually acquitted. But he was never able to make a comeback in the auto industry, and died aged 80 in 2005. The initial business plan of the new DeLorean Motor Company is to make 24 or 25 cars a year starting in 2008. Since news of the car&apos;s revival hit the headlines in the US, Wynne said the phone has been ringing off the hook and his website has been inundated. &quot;We could already be sold out for next year&apos;s production,&quot; he said on Tuesday. Wynne moved from Liverpool to southern California in 1980 to work on Jaguars, Triumphs and Peugeots. He then started to specialise in servicing DeLoreans, because no one else there wanted to touch them. Over the decades that business grew into vehicle restoration, and then, as the supply of &quot;donor cars&quot; dried up, the new DMC started to hand-build a new car from scratch every two months. Wynne estimates there are still about 7,000 original DeLoreans on the road. He believes the main reason for the cars&apos; longevity is that owners have treated them as a collectible and have resisted running them into the ground. Recently, spurred on by potential customers and DeLorean enthusiasts who visited his Houston headquarters, Wynne decided to start an assembly line to build two cars a month and sell them for nearly $58,000 each. &quot;I knew 10 years ago I wanted to do this, but I couldn&apos;t go around saying so, because people would have thought I was a nutcase,&quot; he said. Already in place to service existing cars and the upcoming vehicles, DMC has five dealerships in the US and one in Amsterdam for its European customers. Although the new assembly line will be funded with cashflow from the existing maintenance and restoration businesses, Wynne is tempted to seek investment to allow him to buy parts in bulk and therefore less expensively. He said several of the &quot;high net worth&quot; individuals who have contacted him recently with a view to investing in the company have had a constant reminder of the glamour of the vehicle through re-runs of the Back to the Future films. &quot;We have a great brand because of all the exposure we have had over the past 20 years from the movie. There isn&apos;t a time of day that Back to the Future isn&apos;t playing somewhere in the world,&quot; he said. Wynne believes DeLorean can benefit from1980s nostalgia. He hopes to learn from the likes of Harley-Davidson when it comes to expanding his brand&apos;s reach. Harley sold more than $72m worth of clothing and accessories just in the past quarter. &quot;I think we have an equally interesting brand for the global market as a result of the Back to the Future exposure.&quot; For now, however, T-shirts and cuddly toys are on the back burner, as Wynne readies his assembly line and lives the dream of many a car buff. &quot;For every car guy to think about being a mechanic and then ending up with your own car company ... it doesn&apos;t get any better than this,&quot; he said.", "sentences": ["Already in place to service existing cars and the upcoming vehicles, DMC has five dealerships in the US and one in Amsterdam for its European customers."], "title": "Back to the present for DeLorean", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/30/usnews.internationalnews", "tags": ["Business", "US news", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-08-31T11:15:32Z", "article": "The intricacies of the haka, the ritual war challenge made by the All Blacks before each rugby match, are explained in a new Adidas ad.

It&apos;s one of life&apos;s great mysteries, like the anomalous trajectories of unmanned spacecraft in the outer solar system or the ongoing career of Vernon Kay. Why did they decide, en masse, that men should wear Yves Klein blue this summer? Do they get together and vote on it? Is there a debate? How shrill and hysterical do you imagine a debate involving fashion designers would become? So there&apos;s something pleasing about one colour predicted to be big in the next few months. It&apos;s not that I&apos;m fussed either way about yellow. A jaunty antidote to dowdy autumn tones it may be, but if, like me, you have a pallid complexion, it&apos;s going to do you no favours, unless you actively want to look as if you&apos;re on the verge of death. It&apos;s just that I know from whence the penchant for this colour came. The answer, as I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve guessed, is traditional Dutch clogs. Patriotic to a fault, Amsterdam designers Viktor &amp; Rolf had every model in their autumn/winter show wearing bright yellow wooden klompen: there were men in three-piece suits wearing klompen, men in bow-ties wearing klompen, and one man in tight leopard-print trousers and klompen decorated with paintings of windmills, who you can only hope was handsomely renumerated.

Andy Hodge, Alex Partridge, Peter Reed and Steve Williams discovered that their closest rivals had found an extra gear. During a first morning of tightly fought Olympic-class finals, the men&apos;s pair Colin Smith and Matt Langridge produced a finely timed sprint finish to take third behind the exceptional Australian world champions and New Zealand&apos;s 2005 winners. The women&apos;s double scullers Elise Laverick and Anna Bebington missed silver by two-hundreds of a second behind Olympic champions New Zealand with the Chinese duo a length ahead. In the adaptive events 23-year-old Tom Aggar took the gold medal in the men&apos;s single sculls at his first attempt, but the mixed four, the defending champions, were edged into second by Germany. Just off the medal podium in fourth were single sculler Alan Campbell, the men&apos;s double scullers Matt Wells and Steve Rowbotham and, shockingly, British rowing&apos;s banker, the coxless four. &apos;Our base speed wasn&apos;t quick enough,&apos; said Andy Hodge. It was the last race of the morning and Britain&apos;s flagship crew took off from the start as normal, leading through the first signal - but ominously only by a whisker. Just short of the halfway point they were third by less than a second to Holland and made their move. But, although they picked up speed, New Zealand and Italy began to come through with Britain unable to resist. They finished over a length behind the winning Kiwis, while ahead of them the Dutch succumbed to Italy for silver. &apos;We pushed and pushed, working very hard,&apos; said Reed, &apos;but we weren&apos;t firing on all cylinders. It&apos;s not been completely comfortable for a couple of months. You want it to be simple and fluent - but today it wasn&apos;t.&apos; Coach Jurgen Grobler has a problem and he will need to review his Olympic plans over the winter. It may be that going for early success at Henley and in the three World Cup regattas, which Britain&apos;s team won decisively, blunted their performances here, while Italy, New Zealand and France, racing less often, focused on building speed through the season to hit their peak at the right time. The men&apos;s pair have had an eventful season, winning World Cup gold in May, joining a Grobler super eight with the four to win in Amsterdam and then got ill. But they were on song yesterday. Fifth at halfway they moved up to third and were still moving on New Zealand when they ran out of river half a length adrift. &apos;That was a great result for us,&apos; said Smith. &apos;But the four&apos;s performance could lead to big changes in the crews for Beijing and maybe the end of our pair.&apos; The women&apos;s double had raced in only one regatta before these championships due to Bebington&apos;s injury, but they stormed past Romania and nearly caught the legendary Evers-Swindell sisters at the line. Laverick, a bronze medallist in Athens in this event, is back in winning form. Alan Campbell was disappointed, but upbeat about his fourth place. &apos;It was very, very tough out there,&apos; he said. So, too, the men&apos;s double scullers: &apos;We were going for gold,&apos; said Wells. &apos;Maybe we overcooked it. Certainly the title is possible in Beijing.&apos; By reaching yesterday&apos;s finals, all five boats (and four of today&apos;s) also secured their Olympic qualifying slots for next year, although the personnel could change.

Today&apos;s column features three Scheveningen System events starting in Liverpool, where the Summit Match between the UK and China will get underway on Tuesday and continue until Sunday. There are six British men players - Michael Adams, Nigel Short, Jonathan Rowson, Nick Pert, Gawain Jones and David Howell - and two women: Jovanka Houska and Ketevan Arakhamia-Grant. Each man will play each of their Chinese opponents, Wang Yue, Bu Xiangzhi, Ni Hua, Zhang Pengxiang, Wang Hao and thirteen-year-old Hou Yifan - easily the world&apos;s best girl player - once each; while the two women will play Shen Yang and Ding Yixin three times each. Just a few years ago, the UK would surely have been favourites but in the interim China has developed into a real chess superpower and the first four Chinese men mentioned are all well in the top hundred with Wang Yue at 2696 the current world number 22. I&apos;m going to Liverpool to commentate and there&apos;ll be an interim report next week. Most of the Chinese squad have come straight from the 4th China v Russia match which has been taking place in Nizhny Novgorod. In contrast to Liverpool, this featured five men and five women each and was a double-round Scheveningen event. The Chinese took the early lead and were ahead at the half way mark by 27.5-22.5 though this was overwhelmingly due to their women for the Russian men led by 13-12. In the second half the Russians closed and with two to go the lead had been reduced to 41-39 overall with the Russian men now well ahead on 21.5-18.5. However the Chinese men won both of the last two rounds ending with a crushing 4-1. Meanwhile the Russian women had fought back in the second half but it wasn&apos;t enough and the final score was 52.5-47.5 overall, with the Chinese men winning 25.5-24.5 and their women by 27-23. Dutch multimillionaire Joop Van Oosterom&apos;s most famous tournaments are the annual Amber events in Monaco. However, for a decade he or rather his &apos;Association Max Euwe&apos; have also run a series of battles between Men and Women. These came to an end last year with a new contest between Youth or rather &quot;Rising Stars&quot; and &quot;Experience&quot; won rather heavily by the former; and the second edition has just been taking place at the NH Krasnapolsky Grand Hotel in Amsterdam. With &apos;Experience&apos; strengthened by ex-FIDE Champion Alexander Khalifman, who is just 42 and the &apos;Rising Stars&apos; weakened by the absence of Magnus Carlsen this promised to be a closer contest than last year and has proved to be so, In fact the Experience team took some time to get going and were trailing 8.5 -11.5 after four rounds. But in round five when the Experience team all played White they scored 3.5-1.5 to end the first half just 12-13 behind. The second half has also been very competitive and with two rounds to go the overall score was 21-19 to the Rising Stars. Artur Yusupov has been doing best for the older team and he had 4.5/8 together with Predrag Nikolic. Part of the prize for the top Rising Star is a place at next year&apos;s Amber tournament so competition is fierce and Sergey Karjakin had their top score of 5.5/8 ahead of Jan Smeets 5. The Chinese players tend to have very aggressive and unconventional styles creating many very tense games. However here Zhang Pengxiang (who certainly doesn&apos;t look here like the current world number 65) went way over the top against the Russian Champion and was cut down right out of the opening.

Speaking after a British four finished out of the world championship medals for the first time since 1993, Grobler rejected criticism that he had made key errors in the crew&apos;s preparation. The 61-year-old also said the result &quot;was not a disaster&quot; for Britain&apos;s hopes of winning a fours gold for the third Olympics running.   The man who coached Redgrave and Pinsent to successive wins in the Olympic fours event was unequivocal that, in the final, his crew had badly underperformed. And this despite the fact that in training, they had recently clocked the fastest fours times that Grobler had ever recorded.   Tellingly though, the view of top coaches watching in Munich was that, under pressure the British world champions&apos; technique was not as confident or fluid as in previous years.  And while the 61 year old men&apos;s chief coach admitted that he did not have ready answers, to his crew&apos;s poor performance, he met head on the charge that his decision to change his crew&apos;s technique at their Tyrolean altitude camp just six weeks before the championships had played a major role.  &quot;The technical change we made in Silveretta was not a big factor in the defeat,&quot; he said. But after the race, Alex Partridge, who could not row in his crew&apos;s first defeat this year at Lucerne said he thought their rowing this year had become too complicated, with power and length being sacrificed for rhythm and smoothness.  Grobler&apos;s decision to race his four as part of an eight has also come under closer scrutiny. Though his makeshift crew won in Amsterdam, the four missed the chance to beat their main rivals from Holland and New Zealand. However, Grobler claimed that result had helped his four.  &quot;In one way we had a good season,&quot; said Grobler. &quot;We had good fun and that&apos;s what the sport should bring.&quot; And though the Chief Coach could be justifiably proud having qualified five out of six men&apos;s crews for Beijing, he did admit that his crew may have suffered because he was too busy with other crews and coaches.

Pavarotti, hailed by many as the greatest tenor of his generation, underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer last year. A local television station in his home town of Modena, Antenna Uno, said the singer was surrounded by members of his family and close friends. AGI news agency cited sources as saying the 71-year-old opera star was in a &quot;very serious condition&quot;. In a dispatch from Rome, the agency said he was being attended to at home by cancer specialists. Pavarotti - often described as the greatest tenor since Enrico Caruso - was released from the Policlinico hospital in Modena on August 25, after more than two weeks of tests and treatment. He was taken to the hospital on August 8, suffering from a high fever and respiratory problems. The reported deterioration of his condition came the day after Italy&apos;s culture minister had awarded him a newly-created prize for his contribution to the arts. Pavarotti was the first recipient and no date was set for an award ceremony. Announcing the honour, Francesco Rutelli, who is also a deputy prime minister in Italy&apos;s centre-left government, described the opera star as &quot;currently waging a mighty battle against illness with the same determination with which he established himself in the world&quot;. The singer, who has helped to give opera a new, mass audience, underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer at a New York hospital in July 2006. Before the operation he had been planning to resume his farewell tour. Since undergoing surgery, however, he has made no public appearances and has had at least five courses of chemotherapy. He made his debut as Rodolfo in Puccini&apos;s La Boheme at Reggio Emilia in 1961 and reached the first great peak in his career in 1972, when he received 17 curtain calls at the Metropolitan Opera in New York from an audience that heard him hit nine high Cs. But it was the 1990 football World Cup that transformed him into a global celebrity, with a fame that extended far beyond opera houses. His spine-tingling interpretation of the Puccini aria Nessun Dorma, the competition&apos;s theme song, was a worldwide hit. On the eve of the final, Pavarotti joined Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras in the first of the immensely successful Three Tenors concerts. His &quot;popera&quot;, which led him into performances with Sting and U2, appalled purists, but demonstrated to millions that classical singing could be as thrilling as pop or rock. Like many a great singer before him, Pavarotti combines a sublime voice with an exasperating temperament which has earned him the title of the &quot;king of cancellations&quot;. In 2003, he married his secretary, Nicoletta Mantovani, after the collapse of a 34-year marriage to his first wife, Adua Veroni. He has a daughter by his second marriage and three by the first. On Tuesday, La Scala opera house in Milan announced it would join a theatre in Modena in organising an international competition for young opera singers dedicated to the tenor. In a statement, La Scala said the contest would be a chance &quot;to pay tribute to the career of Luciano Pavarotti, a symbol of Italian music in the world&quot;. Life and times Born in Modena, Italy in 1935, the son of a baker, Luciano Pavarotti&apos;s passion was for football. He had wanted to pursue a career as a professional player, and it was not until he was nine that he first got a taste for singing. He was involved in the town chorus with his father, a fine tenor, Pavarotti later explained, but who had given up the possibility of a singing career because he suffered from nerves. After completing his teacher training and working at an elementary school for two years, Pavarotti decided to study singing. While studying, he became aware that he had perfect pitch. &quot;Everything I had learned came together with my natural voice to make the sound I had been struggling so hard to achieve,&quot; he said later. His professional debut was in April 1961, as Rodolfo in Puccini&apos;s La Boheme at the opera house in Reggio Emilia, and he went on to perform in Amsterdam, Vienna, Zurich and London. His breakthrough performance in the US was in 1972 where he achieved nine high C&apos;s in the signature aria of Donizetti&apos;s La fille du r\u00e9giment and had 17 curtain calls. International fame beckoned when he joined forces with Jos\u00e9 Carreras and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and they performed a series of concerts during the World Cup in 1990. The subsequent record became one of the biggest selling classical albums. His concert in Hyde Park in London drew a record attendance of 150,000. He gave his final performance in an opera in Puccini&apos;s Tosca in New York in March 2004.

The names of Caruso, Gigli, Pavarotti are code for operatic achievement, while the legendary divas they partnered only register with opera fans. Modern recording technology ensures that the spell-binding heroic expressiveness of great tenors can work its magic anywhere. Historic voices are for all time. Since the mechanisation of memory, we need no longer rely on the pallid words of critics or historians. Luciano Pavarotti, who has died aged 71 of pancreatic cancer, grew up in the 1940s listening to the previous golden generation of tenor stars on record and radio. So the presence of the past underpinned his own recorded achievement as a singer. His family were enthusiastically musical and, aged four, he was apparently standing on the kitchen table singing the Duke of Mantua&apos;s La donna \u00e9 mobile from Rigoletto as a party trick. He modelled himself on what he heard, and used recordings to take account of the competition, dead or alive, throughout his career. Nature equipped him with one of the most individual, unmistakable and beautiful voices there has been. In his 50s, thanks to records and the increasing refinement of public address systems in the enormous, sometimes open-air concert venues where he performed, he became probably the richest opera singer in the history of music. But his thriving career, in fact, coincided with the steady decline of Italian opera. The Pavarotti phenomenon was a triumph of marketing. His name was given to a men&apos;s perfume. His first wife, Adua Veroni (with whom he had three daughters, Lorenza, Cristina and Giuliana in the 1960s), launched Stage Door Opera Management in 1987, which became a leading Italian agency - though she confessed to &quot;never being very fond of opera&quot;. Pavarotti made his debut at the Teatro Municipale, Reggio Emilia, in northern Italy, on April 29 1961, in the part of Rodolfo in La Boh\u00e8me, conducted by Francesco Molinari Pradelli. He became a superstar 11 years later, on February 17 1972, when he sang Tonio in Donizetti&apos;s delightful La Fille du R\u00e9giment at the New York Met. &quot;I had to sing nine high Cs in a row before I won the public&apos;s attention,&quot; he said later. After this Met triumph, Herbert Breslin took over his public relations and turned him into a television celebrity. A huge white handkerchief became his characteristic recital prop. Pavarotti and his warm knowing grin were soon familiar at every level of society. He was on the cover of Newsweek and Time magazines, and there were Pavarotti masterclasses on US television. He launched the Pavarotti Philadelphia international voice competition. His ease and potential on television was first demonstrated in 1963 to an audience of 15 million people on ITV&apos;s Sunday Night at the London Palladium, when he was standing in for Giuseppe di Stefano at Covent Garden. It was a role he frequently returned to at the Royal Opera House. The operatic tenor is very much a 19th- and 20th-century phenomenon. The taste for Verdi and verismo that Pavarotti&apos;s remarkable gift helped sustain may not last forever. Until Bellini and Donizetti came along (some of whose high-lying bel canto tenor roles helped to reinforce Pavarotti&apos;s early fame), the opera world was dominated by castrati. These were adult males singing soprano in such heroic roles as Julius Caesar or Alexander the Great, whose parents had (usually) collaborated with the Roman Catholic church in their castration, and who, in a few cases, garnered pop star-like fortunes. Even in the age of Verdi, however, there were no hysterical Italian fans rioting about tenors. But by the late 20th century the phenomenon of the three tenors, Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras, helped opera compete a trifle longer with football as a vehicle of Italian social mobility. Seldom in the history of opera would three such stars of the same voice have been seen together on stage, even for an impresario&apos;s gala. Carreras&apos;s illness clinched the gimmick. Each of the three earned so much money for a third less effort that the temptation was irresistible. If serious money can still be made singing songs a century old, perhaps opera cannot be written off yet - though Puccini, the last universally popular opera composer, died in 1926. Pavarotti&apos;s voice will cast a shadow for years to come on new aspirants. Yet on stage he took no role composed later than 1926. That was not his fault. The flood of Italian music faltered and stopped. A few of the classless Italian and Neapolitan gems that served him as encores in recitals - like Volare and Un amore cos\u00ec grande - were postwar. But those thousands who filled his pockets and flocked to rain-sodden fields and unlovely arenas to hear him amplified through loudspeakers would not have been interested in songs from postwar operas - if there had been any popular Italian operas from the 1950s onwards, which there were not. His lavish and beautifully lyrical tenor needed appealing melodies. Has any tenor ever used the text with more immaculate musical expressiveness? Verdi, Bellini, Donizetti and Puccini showed him off at his eloquent (and, as he aged, increasingly robust) best. He sang a little Richard Strauss - the Italian tenor in Der Rosenkavalier was perfect typecasting. He was sublime as both son and father in Mozart&apos;s Idomeneo, at different stages of his career. He learned a few extra parts until he turned 60 (Verdi&apos;s Don Carlo, Giordano&apos;s Andrea Chenier). But his repertoire was almost entirely a manageable range of roles that he had sung throughout his career. Not for Pavarotti, therefore, the adventures of Domingo, equally successful and almost contemporary, who could study Tchaikovsky and Wagner minutely and turn out not quite idiomatic Russian and German. Pavarotti stuck to the tradition represented by well-recorded earlier giants like Caruso, Martinelli, Bjoerling, Bergonzi and Corelli - who, in turn, had stuck mainly to the Italian rep. He could apply his extraordinary ear, and polish and adjust his detailed approach so that the result was newly minted and fresh as a musical experience. He was an inspired perfectionist when it came to the fundamentals of his art: the ideal moulding of poetry to a heavenly line of music. Let there be no mistake, Pavarotti really was a triumphantly fabulous artist. He never distorted the true colour and purity of the vowels that he was singing. His words were always limpidly clear, expressively registered and dramatic. Fans of Domingo would suggest that their man could act, whereas Pavarotti only sang. But acting is not something you do, it is something you are. Pavarotti acted not by demonstrating or showing off the characteristics of the part, but by defining its inward emotional essence in how he uttered the music and the text. It was absolutely part of the authentic operatic tradition that he was never fluent at reading music. According to the Daily Telegraph&apos;s Rome correspondent in 1997, Pavarotti relied &quot;on his ear and his own rudimentary form of annotation to learn a musical work&quot;. In the Corriere della Sera, he admitted he was not a musician: &quot;I don&apos;t go in too deep. The musical score is one thing and the singing part is another. If you have the music in your head, and you sing it with your body, you&apos;ll be all right.&quot; He learned his songs by becoming familiar with the words, which he would print out in a notebook alongside signs showing the melody rising or falling. So much for the old operatic debate about whether words or music come first. Pavarotti could make the music and words adhere to each other completely naturally. Both were in a sense laid on to his large frame in a way that made their delivery second nature. This wonderful quality of acting out the meaning, including the dramatic meaning, through the words as musically realised was fundamental to his genius as a performer. The natural beauty of the sound he commanded was, in the end, more significant than the fact that he could sing top notes far more effortlessly than the hard-working and supremely competent Domingo (who could never sing as high comfortably anyway). Pavarotti was born in Modena, northern Italy. His father, Fernando, was a baker with a vast record collection who sang tenor in his spare time in the Corale Rossini, a local chorus; his mother worked in a tobacco factory. The boy was often looked after by his grandmother. It was a close family; even much later, Pavarotti cancelled performances at Covent Garden because of his father&apos;s illness. In fact, both his parents lived on into the 21st century. The young Luciano joined the Corale Rossini and sang alongside his father in his mid-teens. In 1955, aged 19, he was with them at the International Eisteddfod in Llangollen, where they won top prize. He attended a teachers&apos; training college to become a PE teacher. But when he qualified, the family took a vote on allowing him to study singing, and agreed to his wish, no doubt partly because it was fulfilling his father&apos;s own dream. He took lessons in Modena from the tenor Arrigo Pola before moving on to Ettore Campogalliani in Mantua, an experienced repetiteur and voice coach who absolutely understood the way in which Italian tenor singing ideally handles the passagio. This is the name for the part of the voice above top G where the tenor has to turn the vocal sound so that its natural resonance can glow and vibrate without forcing and without overstressing the weight of breath support behind the lyrical vibrato. The consistently elegant, expressively refulgent way that Pavarotti sang through the passagio was the secret of the remarkable longevity of his voice as an instrument. But the truth is he was a natural - born into an ideal situation, where there was ample sensitivity and musical intelligence around him about his chosen art. Of course, such an impeccable technique could not be acquired through lessons. The beautiful and natural sound that Pavarotti started out with simply needed to be polished and strengthened. In 1961, still only 25, Pavarotti won the Achille Peri competition, and married Adua Veroni after an engagement of eight years. The reward for winning the competition was to make his debut in Reggio Emilia. Over the next 30 months, he sang at provincial opera houses in Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and Ireland. He was Rodolfo, the Duke in Rigoletto, Alfredo in La Traviata, Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor and Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly. In Dublin, he was spotted by a Covent Garden talent scout and engaged as understudy to di Stefano for the role of Rodolfo. In fact, Pavarotti did the whole run of performances - except for one sung by di Stefano. His Royal Opera House debut, on September 21 1963, was heard by the Guardian&apos;s Philip Hope-Wallace: Pavarotti &quot;made a good impression ... he seemed modest, sang with musicianly feeling and uses a pretty, clear, lyrical voice to some effect&quot;. His Scala Milan debut (in the same role, conducted by Herbert von Karajan) was still two years away. Then the pace of his career quickened. He sang Edgardo in Lucia in Amsterdam; in July 1964, he was Idamante at Glyndebourne (opposite Richard Lewis&apos;s Idomeneo for 12 performances), later declaring, &quot;What I learned there was to sing piano&quot; - from Jani Strasser, the legendary head of music, who taught him the role. At 28, Pavarotti&apos;s style was impeccable, the ease and beauty with which the text was realised were utterly irresistible, the perfection of support and focus at the top were a model. Listening today to the recording of that August&apos;s Prom performance (it is still available on CD), the contrast with Richard Lewis&apos;s muddy Anglo-Italian demonstrates exactly what was going to make Pavarotti a world-beater. The conductor John Pritchard recorded Idomeneo again 19 years later in Vienna, with Pavarotti in the title role. In February 1965 he made his US debut in Miami, as Edgardo to Joan Sutherland&apos;s Lucia, conducted by her husband Richard Bonynge, a team with whom he would make a large number of important recordings. He returned to Covent Garden with Sutherland for La Sonnambula (as Elvino), and toured Australia with the Sutherland-Williamson company in L&apos;Elisir d&apos;Amore (Nemorino became a signature role for him), Traviata, Lucia and Sonnambula. In 1966 Abbado conducted him in I Capuleti e i Montecchi at La Scala. He had performed the Duke in Rigoletto with Tullio Serafin at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo during the earliest stages of his career, and now he repeated the role with Gianandrea Gavazzeni. Later, in 1969, at La Scala, he also sang Des Grieux in Massenet&apos;s Manon (in Italian). But what mattered most in 1966 was his legendary appearance with Sutherland at Covent Garden in La Fille du R\u00e9giment in June. The point was that he sang the high Cs in full voice, though Donizetti had expected them to be sung in head voice. Full voice means without any adjustment towards falsetto or even modified falsetto, the sound when the soft palette is pressed down. Head voice would have meant not going into the passagio and sustaining that sort of modified shout, which is how tenors make their top notes exciting. But Pavarotti had a relaxed natural vibrato right through, so there was no need for him to mix in any kind of lightness or lack of body at the very top: his singing was all of a piece. This ability was a sort of piratical feat, and Decca (Pavarotti&apos;s recording company) used the title King of the High Cs on a record he made. The success and fame of this achievement for a time helpfully focused his work on the bel canto repertoire in which Bonynge and Sutherland were contemporary pioneers, with roles like Arturo in Bellini&apos;s I Puritani and Fernando in Donizetti&apos;s La Favorita. Considering the length of his career, and the flair with which he recognised work that was right for his gifts, the fact that Pavarotti stayed with a particular corner of the repertoire at such an important developmental stage may well have strengthened further his extraordinary technique. A period devoted to lighter, more lyrical roles was the foundation for a carefully calculated expansion of his repertoire. Roles he later undertook included Riccardo in Un Ballo in Maschera, Ernani, Rodolfo in Luisa Miller, Manrico in Il Trovatore, Cavaradossi in Tosca, Calaf in Turandot (which gave him his World Cup aria, Nessun Dorma), Idomeneo and Enzo in La Gioconda. After the success of his high Cs at the Met and the engagement of Breslin, he started to extend the number and scale of recitals that he undertook, starting with one in Liberty, Missouri, in February 1973. Pavarotti performed in so many provincial centres all over the world that his recognisability, popularity and fame registered everywhere. Sales of his records were enormous, even if recitals reduced his availability for work in important opera houses. The range of roles he sang regularly or frequently on stage was much more limited than his recorded legacy suggests. Recitals and, eventually, epic amplified solo performances in arenas accommodating thousands of listeners, were a major factor in his working career. Photographs from the 1960s show that Pavarotti was not thin - though he was a handsome, if usually unaristocratic, figure on stage. By the early 1970s, he was significantly overweight. But his father, too, cut a bulky shape, which was clearly in the genes. Reporters interviewing Pavarotti always referred to this. When asked his weight, he would reply, &quot;Less than before,&quot; and when challenged what exactly that was would respond, &quot;More than now&quot;. He wrote his autobiography, My Own Story (1981), and took part in a movie, Yes, Giorgio (1982). After 1983, with Breslin&apos;s encouragement, he teamed up with Tibor Rudas, the promoter of Frank Sinatra and Neil Diamond concerts. He sang to 7,500 people in a heated tent in Atlantic City. The fee for similar occasions would be $100,000 and a percentage of the ticket sales. In 1984, he sang to 20,000 at Madison Square Garden, New York. During the 1980s, he sang only half as many opera performances each year as Domingo, and the latter&apos;s repertoire of roles was twice as large. But Pavarotti made enormous amounts of money, in part by turning himself into a painter, which had long been a hobby. A print of one of his paintings fetched $2,500, though he was sued by the author of a how-to-draw book, who claimed he had copied her examples. Ventures that were not artistic successes included directing opera (a Favorita at La Fenice in Venice, after which he explained, &quot;It was not much fun. I was too nervous.&quot;) and singing the title role in Otello in Chicago with Georg Solti conducting. The performances and public rehearsals, in Chicago and later Carnegie Hall, were recorded and edited on to a CD but the result was unimpressive. His Radames, in Aida at Covent Garden in the 1980s, was also unconvincing, with his enormous frame covered up in a tent-like frock. His involvement with various younger singers, some of whom had won prizes at his competition, only occasionally led them towards successful careers. Some of these proteges were very close to him, as were some of his secretaries. He had sung at almost every opera house of note, during a longer than 40-year career. Finally, though, the voice was not quite living up to expectations. His first marriage came to an end when, in his 60s, he took up with his former personal assistant Nicoletta Mantovani, a woman 35 years his junior - their wedding, in 2003, was celebrated with a banquet for 600 guests, including Sting, Bono and Donatella Versace. They had a daughter, Alice. He began to cancel performances that looked as if they should have been final appearances, and announced that he would retire on his 70th birthday in 2005. His schedule of 40 mainly concert performances in 2003 was rumoured to earn him $35m. He did 34 Three Tenors concerts around the world between 1990 and 2003. But his medical condition began to interfere with his plans, and after starting a farewell world tour in 2005 he discovered he had pancreatic cancer. An operation was declared successful and Pavarotti announced he would return to the stage in 2007 after convalescing. This summer he had been working on a recording of sacred songs to be released in 2008, and teaching a select group of students. His last performance of a staged opera was at the Met on March 14 2004. In February 2006 he opened the Winter Olympics in Turin, singing Nessun Dorma transposed to a more suitable pitch for a tenor of his years. Pavarotti&apos;s kind of astounding international celebrity made it difficult to stop. According to Decca, he was the most popular artist in the history of the classical recording industry. Perhaps, he was even more famous than Caruso. He was probably the last great lyric tenor in a noble line: his kind of music - by Puccini, Verdi and other Italian operatic greats - is increasingly distant from contemporary taste. When he was born, Mascagni and Giordano were still alive and writing: they have had no Italian operatic heirs. Pavarotti possessed a voice of pure gold that matured in strength and depth of colour as he aged, without losing its innate ravishing beauty, precision and expressiveness. He was a unique phenomenon. \u00b7 Luciano Pavarotti, tenor, born October 12 1935; died September 6 2007", "sentences": ["He sang Edgardo in Lucia in Amsterdam; in July 1964, he was Idamante at Glyndebourne (opposite Richard Lewis&apos;s Idomeneo for 12 performances), later declaring, &quot;What I learned there was to sing piano&quot; - from Jani Strasser, the legendary head of music, who taught him the role."], "title": "Luciano Pavarotti", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/06/guardianobituaries.obituaries", "tags": ["Italy", "World news", "Music", "Culture", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-09-06T16:04:26Z", "article": "Ian McEwan is in the running to be only the third author to win the Man Booker prize for a second time, having secured a place on the shortlist this afternoon with On Chesil Beach. However, his inclusion may raise some eyebrows among the literary community due to the slightness of his book which, at less than 200 pages, is felt by many to be a novella rather than a novel. McEwan is joined on the six-strong shortlist by Nicola Barker, whose novel Darkmans, a contemporary ghost story set in modern day Ashford, is a critical and popular favourite, and Lloyd Jones, whose Papua New Guinea novel Mister Pip, according to Amazon, saw the biggest Booker-driven sales boost from all the books on the 13-strong longlist. Also on the list are Anne Enright whose fourth novel The Gathering tells the story of the 12-strong Hegarty family, and Indra Sinha whose Animal&apos;s People provides a campaigning portrait of an Indian community which was blighted by an American chemical company. Meanwhile, Mohsin Hamid&apos;s The Reluctant Fundamentalist, set against the backdrop of the political unrest that followed the attacks on the World Trade Centre on 9/11, was described by Jonathan Ruppin, buyer at Foyles bookshop as a &quot;stunning novel and my choice to win&quot;. After making headlines for its restrained, thoughtful and - at 13 novels as opposed to the usual 18-plus - mercifully brief longlist, the Booker judges have, perhaps, inched back towards safer territory with today&apos;s shortlist. As well as the inclusion of bookies&apos; favourite McEwan, they have omitted all four of the first-time novelists featured on the shortlist (Peter Ho Davies, Nikita Lalwani, Catherine O&apos;Flynn and Tan Twan Eng). The only high-profile casualty at the shortlist stage is AN Wilson, who had been longlisted for his fictional portrait of Hitler: Winnie and Wolf. Speaking after the event, this year&apos;s chair of the judges, Howard Davies, admitted that choosing a shortlist from what was widely regarded as an adventurous and intriguing longlist had been tough. &quot;We hope,&quot; he said, &quot;that the choices we have made after passionate and careful consideration will attract wide interest.&quot; Davies is joined on the judging panel for the 39th Man Booker prize, worth \u00a350,000 to the winner, by poet Wendy Cope; by Giles Foden, former deputy literary editor of the Guardian Saturday Review and author of The Last King of Scotland; by biographer and critic Ruth Scurr; and by actor and writer Imogen Stubbs. If McEwan wins, he will follow in the footsteps of JM Coetzee (who won for The Life &amp; Times of Michael K and Disgrace) and Peter Carey (True History of the Kelly Gang and Oscar and Lucinda) as a double winner. The judges&apos; verdict will be announced on Tuesday October 16 at an awards ceremony at the Guildhall, London. The shortlist Darkmans, by Nicola Barker The despised past revenges itself on the concrete culture of superstores and motorways which has been hurled on top of it at Ashford, Kent. The language of mediaeval jesters leaks into the estuary English of a group of inhabitants who begin to be plagued by mysterious darkmen. Barker, who lives in east London, has won the lucrative Impac award. Her novel Clear was longlisted for the 2004 Man Booker. On Chesil Beach, by Ian McEwan McEwan&apos;s story, both lyrical and explicit, only 166 pages long, opens with a honeymoon dinner overlooking the sea in the early 1960s. The couple love one another, but she has never felt sexual passion, he is anxious about coming too soon, worries neither of them can discuss. Neither, fatally, has a sense of humour. McEwan, a pre-eminent British novelist, was first shortlisted for the Booker prize with The Comfort of Strangers in 1981, won it with Amsterdam in 1991 and was shortlisted again with his bestselling Atonement in 2001 Mister Pip, by Lloyd Jones The poor white is known as Pop Eye in his village on the south Pacific island of Bougainville. When civil war encroaches, he occupies the deserted schoolroom, teaching Matilda and her classmates from the only text available - Dickens&apos; Great Expectations. Pip, Magwitch and Miss Havisham become legends to the villagers, keeping them company through atrocities. Lloyd Jones, a New Zealand author, has visted Papua New Guinea three times, once staying with the revoluitionary commnander of the real-life conflict in Bougainville. Animal&apos;s People, by Indra Sinha The youth&apos;s nickname is because the horrific poisons leak in Khaufpur (a thinly disguised Bhopal) distorted his spine so badly that he has to go about on all fours, rump stuck in air. Yet he has a witty, rude tongue, still hopes for love and can - in his unorthodox way - help his stricken neighbours in their crusade for compensation. Sinha was born and raised on India. He became an award-winning advertising copywriter. This is his second novel. The Reluctant Fundamentalist, by Mohsin Hamid Academically, with strings of straight As, Chiangez is the best that Pakistan and Princeton can offer; and his job with a blue-chip valuation company is the foremost dream America can offer an immigrant - so he is puzzled to find himself half-glad about 9/11. Hamid&apos;s background at Princeton and in US management consultancy gives him an unusually acute take on US business and global policy. He now lives and writes in Britain. The Gathering, by Anne Enright Liam, the bright, heavy-drinking one in the Hegarty family, has drowned himself, and his sister Veronica is home to mourn him. Her search for the key to Liam&apos;s stunted life takes her back to the sexual history of her grandparents and their suitors.

The names of Caruso, Gigli and Pavarotti are code for operatic achievement, while the legendary divas whom they partnered only register with opera fans. Modern recording technology ensures that the spell-binding, heroic expressiveness of great tenors can work its magic anywhere. Historic voices are for all time. Since the mechanisation of memory, we need no longer rely on the pallid words of critics or historians. Luciano Pavarotti, who has died aged 71, grew up in the 1940s listening to the previous golden generation of tenor stars on record and radio. So the presence of the past underpinned his own recorded achievement as a singer. His family were enthusiastically musical, and aged four he was apparently singing the Duke of Mantua&apos;s La Donna \u00c8 Mobile from Rigoletto as a party trick, standing on the kitchen table. He modelled himself on what he heard, and used recordings to take account of the competition, dead or alive, throughout his career. Nature equipped him with one of the most individual, unmistakable and beautiful voices there has been. In his 50s, thanks to records and the increasing refinement of public address systems in the enormous, sometimes open-air venues where he performed, he became probably the richest opera singer in the history of music. But his thriving career, in fact, coincided with the steady decline of Italian opera. The Pavarotti phenomenon was a triumph of marketing. His name was given to a men&apos;s perfume. His first wife, Adua Veroni (with whom he had three daughters, Lorenza, Cristina and Giuliana in the 1960s), launched Stage Door Opera Management in 1987, which became a leading Italian agency - though she confessed to &quot;never being very fond of opera&quot;. Pavarotti made his debut at the Teatro Municipale, Reggio Emilia, in northern Italy, on April 29 1961, in the part of Rodolfo in La Boh\u00e8me, conducted by Francesco Molinari Pradelli. He became a superstar 11 years later, on February 17 1972, when he sang Tonio in Donizetti&apos;s delightful La Fille du R\u00e9giment at the New York Met. &quot;I had to sing nine high Cs in a row before I won the public&apos;s attention,&quot; he said later. After this triumph, Herbert Breslin took over his public relations and turned him into a television celebrity. A huge white handkerchief became his characteristic recital prop. Pavarotti and his warm, knowing grin were soon familiar at every level of society. He was on the cover of Newsweek and Time magazines, and there were Pavarotti masterclasses on US television. He launched the Pavarotti Philadelphia international voice competition. His ease and potential on television was first demonstrated in 1963 to an audience of 15 million on ITV&apos;s Sunday Night at the London Palladium, when he stood in for Giuseppe di Stefano as Rodolfo at Covent Garden. It was a role he frequently returned to at the Royal Opera House. The operatic tenor is very much a 19th- and 20th-century phenomenon. The taste for Verdi and verismo that Pavarotti&apos;s remarkable gift helped sustain may not last for ever. Until Bellini and Donizetti came along (some of whose bel canto tenor roles helped to reinforce Pavarotti&apos;s early fame), the opera world was dominated by castrati. These were adult males singing soprano in such heroic roles as Julius Caesar or Alexander the Great, whose parents had (usually) collaborated with the Catholic church in their castration. Even in the age of Verdi, however, there were no hysterical Italian fans rioting about tenors. But by the late 20th century, the phenomenon of the three tenors, Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras, helped opera compete a trifle longer with football as a vehicle of Italian social mobility. Seldom in the history of opera would three such stars of the same voice have been seen dead together on stage, even for an impresario&apos;s gala. Carreras&apos;s illness clinched the gimmick. Each of the three earned so much money for a third less effort that the temptation was irresistible. If serious money can still be made singing songs a century old, perhaps opera cannot be written off yet - though Puccini, the last universally popular opera composer, died in 1926. Pavarotti&apos;s voice will cast a shadow for years to come on new aspirants. Yet on stage he took no role composed later than 1926. That was not his fault. The flood of Italian music had faltered and stopped. A few of the classless Italian and Neapolitan gems that served him as encores - such as Volare and Un Amore Cos\u00ec Grande - were postwar. But those thousands who filled his pockets and flocked to rain-sodden fields and unlovely arenas to hear him would not have been interested in songs from postwar operas - had there been any popular Italian operas from the 1950s onwards, which there were not. His lavish and beautifully lyrical tenor needed appealing melodies. Has any tenor ever used the text with more immaculate musical expressiveness? Verdi, Bellini, Donizetti and Puccini showed him off at his eloquent (and, as he aged, increasingly robust) best. He sang a little Richard Strauss - the Italian tenor in Der Rosenkavalier was perfect typecasting. He was sublime as both son and father in Mozart&apos;s Idomeneo, at different stages of his career. He learned a few extra parts until he turned 60 (Verdi&apos;s Don Carlo, Giordano&apos;s Andrea Chenier). But his repertoire was for the most part a manageable range of roles that he had sung throughout his career. Not for Pavarotti, therefore, the adventures of Domingo, who could study Tchaikovsky and Wagner minutely and turn out not quite idiomatic Russian and German. Pavarotti stuck to the tradition represented by earlier giants such as Caruso, Martinelli, Bjoerling, Bergonzi and Corelli - who, in turn, had stuck mainly to Italian repertoire. He could apply his extraordinary ear, and polish, and adjust his detailed approach so that the result was newly minted and fresh as a musical experience. He was an inspired perfectionist when it came to the fundamentals: the ideal moulding of poetry to a heavenly line of music. But he never distorted the true colour and purity of the vowels that he was singing. His words were always limpidly clear, expressively registered and dramatic. Fans of Domingo would suggest that their man could act, whereas Pavarotti only sang. But Pavarotti acted, not by demonstrating or showing off the characteristics of the part, but by defining its inward emotional essence in how he uttered the music and text. In keeping with operatic tradition, he was never fluent at reading music. According to the Daily Telegraph&apos;s Rome correspondent in 1997, Pavarotti relied &quot;on his ear and his own rudimentary form of annotation to learn a musical work&quot;. In the Corriere della Sera, he admitted he was not a musician. &quot;I don&apos;t go in too deep. The musical score is one thing and the singing part is another. If you have the music in your head, and you sing it with your body, you&apos;ll be all right.&quot; He learned his songs by becoming familiar with the words, which he would print in a notebook alongside signs showing the melody rising or falling. So much for the old operatic debate about whether words or music come first. Pavarotti could make the music and words adhere to each other completely naturally. Both were in a sense laid on to his huge frame in a way that made their delivery second nature. This wonderful quality of acting out the meaning through the words was fundamental to his genius as a performer. The natural beauty of the sound he commanded was, in the end, more significant than the fact that he could sing top notes far more effortlessly than the hard-working and supremely competent Domingo (who could never sing as high comfortably anyway). Pavarotti was born in Modena, in northern Italy. His father, Fernando, was a baker with a vast record collection who sang tenor in his spare time in the Corale Rossini, a local chorus. His mother worked in a tobacco factory. The boy was often minded by his grandmother. It was a close family; much later, Pavarotti cancelled performances at Covent Garden because of his father&apos;s illness. In fact, both his parents lived on into the 21st century. The young Luciano joined the Corale Rossini and sang alongside his father in his mid-teens. In 1955, aged 19, he was with them at the International Eisteddfod in Llangollen, where they won top prize. He trained to become a PE teacher, but when he qualified, the family took a vote on allowing him to study singing, and agreed to his wish, no doubt partly because it matched his father&apos;s own dream. He took lessons in Modena from a tenor, Arrigo Pola, before moving on to Ettore Campogalliani in Mantua, an experienced repetiteur and voice coach who understood fully the way in which Italian tenor singing ideally handles the passagio - the part of the voice above top G. The consistently elegant, expressively refulgent way that Pavarotti sang through the passagio was the secret of the remarkable longevity of his voice as an instrument. But the truth is he was a natural. Of course, such an impeccable technique could not be acquired through lessons. The beautiful and natural sound that Pavarotti started out with simply needed to be polished and strengthened. In 1961, still only 25, Pavarotti won the Achille Peri competition, and married Adua Veroni after an engagement of eight years. The reward for the win was to make his debut in Reggio Emilia. Over the following 30 months, he sang at provincial opera houses in Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and Ireland. He was Rodolfo, the Duke in Rigoletto, Alfredo in La Traviata, Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor and Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly. In Dublin, he was spotted by a Covent Garden talent scout and engaged as understudy to di Stefano for the role of Rodolfo. In fact, Pavarotti did the whole run of performances - except for one sung by di Stefano. His Royal Opera House debut, on September 21 1963, was heard by the Guardian&apos;s Philip Hope-Wallace: &quot;He seemed modest, sang with musicianly feeling and uses a pretty clear, lyrical voice to some effect.&quot; His Scala Milan debut (in the same role, conducted by Herbert von Karajan) was still two years away. Then the pace of his career quickened. He sang Edgardo in Lucia in Amsterdam, and in July 1964, he was Idamante at Glyndebourne (opposite Richard Lewis&apos;s Idomeneo for 12 performances), later declaring: &quot;What I learned there was to sing piano&quot; - from Jani Strasser, the legendary head of music, who taught him the role. At 28, Pavarotti&apos;s style was impeccable, the ease and beauty with which the text was realised were irresistible, the perfection of support and focus at the top were model. Listening today to the recording of that August&apos;s prom performance (it is still available on CD), the contrast with Richard Lewis&apos;s muddy Anglo-Italian demonstrates exactly what was going to make Pavarotti a world beater. The conductor John Pritchard recorded Idomeneo again 19 years later in Vienna, with Pavarotti in the title role.

In February 2006, he opened the winter olympics in Turin, singing Nessun Dorma transposed to a more suitable pitch for a tenor of his years. Pavarotti&apos;s astounding international celebrity made it difficult to stop. According to Decca, he was the most popular artist in the history of the classical recording industry, perhaps even more famous than Caruso, and probably the last great lyric tenor in a noble line. When he was born, Mascagni and Giordano were still alive and writing: they have had no Italian operatic heirs. Pavarotti possessed a voice of pure gold that matured in strength and depth without losing its innate ravishing beauty, precision and expressiveness.  \u00b7 Luciano Pavarotti, tenor, born October 12 1935; died September 6 2007", "sentences": ["He sang Edgardo in Lucia in Amsterdam, and in July 1964, he was Idamante at Glyndebourne (opposite Richard Lewis&apos;s Idomeneo for 12 performances), later declaring: &quot;What I learned there was to sing piano&quot; - from Jani Strasser, the legendary head of music, who taught him the role."], "title": "Obituary: Luciano Pavarotti", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/07/guardianobituaries.opera", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-09-07T08:44:00Z", "article": "Ian McEwan is in the running to become only the third author to win the Man Booker prize for a second time, having secured a place on the shortlist yesterday with On Chesil Beach. However, he is likely to face stiff competition from the virtually unknown New Zealand-born author Lloyd Jones, whose novel Mister Pip was installed as favourite for the \u00a350,000 prize. After the massacre of entries from long-established writers when the longlist was announced, last night&apos;s shortlist of six, from which the winner of the most respected of all fiction awards will be chosen, offered fewer surprises. The judges omitted all four first-time novelists on the long list, and the only high-profile casualty yesterday was AN Wilson&apos;s fictional portrait of Hitler, Winnie and Wolf. Instead, McEwan and Jones are joined by Nicola Barker, whose novel Darkmans, a contemporary ghost story set in modern-day Ashford, is a critical and popular favourite. Also on the list are Anne Enright, whose fourth novel The Gathering tells the story of the 12-strong Hegarty family, and Indra Sinha whose Animal&apos;s People draws a campaigning portrait of an Indian community blighted by an American chemical firm. The final shortlisted book is Mohsin Hamid&apos;s The Reluctant Fundamentalist, set against the backdrop of the political unrest that followed the attacks on the World Trade Centre on 9/11. It was yesterday described by Jonathan Ruppin, buyer at Foyles bookshop, as a &quot;stunning novel and my choice to win&quot;. The judges&apos; chairman, Howard Davies, said: &quot;Selecting a shortlist this year from what was widely seen as an exciting longlist was a tough challenge. We hope the choices we have made, after passionate and careful consideration, will attract wide interest.&quot; McEwan&apos;s inclusion is likely to raise some eyebrows among the literary community due to the slightness of his book which, at fewer than 200 pages, is felt by many to be a novella rather than a novel. William Hill said it had installed Mr Pip as favourite because of the &quot;unprecedented&quot; money being placed on the book, which until a month ago was a 20-1 outsider. The bookmaker was by no means alone in noting a groundswell of interest in Jones&apos;s tale of a Pacific island which grows enthralled with Dickens&apos; Great Expectations when it is isolated during wartime. Amazon found that Mr Pip sustained the biggest percentage increase of all books on the Man Booker longlist after it was announced. &quot;It is a real achievement to grow sales in the way Mr Pip has,&quot; Amazon&apos;s head buyer Kes Nielsen said. Mr Davies told the Guardian last night that it was &quot;rubbish&quot; to suggest that McEwan - who won in 1998 with Amsterdam - was a runaway certainty for the prize. &quot;All five other authors are very close to him in the view of the judges.&quot; Rodney Troubridge, fiction head at Waterstone&apos;s, said: &quot;Even if he doesn&apos;t pick up the prize in October Ian McEwan can only be seen as the big winner in this year&apos;s Booker. &quot;If he wins, then the already bestselling On Chesil Beach will do even better, and his reputation as probably our greatest living - and relatively young - author will continue to grow. If he loses, whover else on this shortlist of less established writers wins will be dubbed David against his Goliath, and they will always be referred to as &apos;the writer that beat Ian McEwan to the Booker&apos;. &quot;That said, I do think that Ian McEwan is on unstoppable form&quot;. Mr Ruppin, promotions buyer at Foyles, said: &quot;Booksellers and buyers need not worry about the lack of household names because the list is full of the literary giants of the future.&quot; The other judges are the poet Wendy Cope, Giles Foden, author and former deputy editor of the Guardian Saturday Review, biographer and critic Ruth Scurr and the actor Imogen Stubbs .

Soon, zZz had built up a live reputation and their demo, Bikini Inferno, was released.

But friends said yesterday her poise and control should not be misinterpreted, or held against her. &quot;She may seem focused in public,&quot; her old friend Jill Renwick said. &quot;But in private she is a broken woman. She is devastated by what has happened, can&apos;t speak about it sometimes. In public she is able to keep it together as she believes that is what is best for Madeleine.&quot; Silence It was inevitable the media would focus mostly on Mrs McCann - the mother&apos;s story. For the first few days she let her husband Gerry, who is more used to speaking in public, do the talking, but she broke her silence after attending Sunday morning mass in Praia da Luz three days after Madeleine disappeared. Clutching &quot;Cuddle Cat&quot;, Madeleine&apos;s old cuddly toy, she stood at her husband&apos;s side while he thanked local people for their support and appealed for help in finding their daughter. Then she spoke up: &quot;Please continue to pray for Madeleine,&quot; she said. Her voice cracked as she added: &quot;She&apos;s lovely.&quot; Since then she has been in the media glare, answering ever more intrusive questions about the May night Madeleine vanished, her feelings and the guilt she might feel for leaving her alone in an unlocked room as they dined at a nearby restaurant. In some interviews Mrs McCann risked censure for insisting the children were safe. Of course, she wished she was with Madeleine at the moment she was taken. But asked in her first solo broadcast interview, on Radio 4&apos;s Women&apos;s Hour, whether she felt guilty, she said: &quot;I have come to terms a little bit with that ... I didn&apos;t feel I was taking a risk.&quot; Subsequently she has been quicker to express regret. &quot;I just felt I had let her down and I was desperately sorry we weren&apos;t there,&quot; she told the Guardian last month. The McCanns have also been criticised for the slickness of their publicity campaign. But friends say the couple believe it is the best way to find the truth about what happened. Perhaps significantly, Mrs McCann has also started to give more details about what happened on the night, spelling out in the same Guardian interview that someone &quot;broke in&quot; and took Madeleine. Earlier in the summer she and Gerry danced round this detail. An extraordinary aspect has been the McCanns&apos; strong faith. There have been times of doubt - Mrs McCann admitted on the BBC that she had asked God: &quot;Why do this to Madeleine? Why have you let this happen?&quot; But their faith has remained solid. Besides, Mrs McCann has had to concentrate on the twins. Work on the campaign has been fitted around trying to look after them. Nothing in her background - or her husband&apos;s - could have helped them prepare for the onslaught they have faced. From a working class family in Liverpool, she had, from an early age, set her sights on a career in medicine. Mrs McCann studied medicine at Dundee University and initially trained as a gynaecologist, passing her exams with flying colours. Then she changed tack, becoming an anaesthetist. She met Gerry McCann while they were junior doctors at Western Infirmary, Glasgow. When she went to New Zealand to work he followed her and they fell in love. The couple married in 1998 and moved to the Midlands two years later when Mr McCann became a cardiologist at Glenfield hospital in Leicester. Mrs McCann decided to become a GP so she could have more time with her husband and with the family they hoped for. Pregnant It was not until late 2002 that Mrs McCann became pregnant with Madeleine after IVF treatment. The pregnancy was smooth and she swam every day to keep her and the child fit. They did not know they were expecting a girl until Madeleine was born. In 2004 she became pregnant again, with twins, Sean and Amelie. Life seemed perfect. Mr McCann&apos;s job took him briefly to Amsterdam. The family went too and when they returned moved into a large house in the village of Rothley near Leicester. Mrs McCann spent a day and a half working as a GP in Melton Mowbray. Friends say they are a good team - Gerry more intent on furthering his career, Kate focused on the family. After more than four months in Portugal the family were planning to return home and she was considering giving up her job to campaign against child trafficking. Yesterday&apos;s developments have thrown it all back into chaos. The speculation The McCanns&apos; story is that they were dining at a tapas bar close to the holiday flat where their three children had been left asleep. They were checked on regularly until, at some time after 10pm, Mrs McCann went into the ground floor flat and discovered that her daughter had vanished Has the arrival of fresh forensic evidence this week shown up some inconsistency in the McCanns&apos; story? Does it support theories broadcast by the Portuguese press that police believe Madeleine may have died on the night she disappeared, possibly in the holiday apartment itself? In her own words I think at worst we were naive. I mean we&apos;re very responsible parents. We love our children very much and I don&apos;t think any parent could imagine or consider anything like this ever happening. Interview with Sky News, May 25 It&apos;s important not to lose sight of the fact we haven&apos;t committed a crime. Somebody has. Somebody&apos;s been there. Somebody&apos;s been watching. They took our daughter away and we can&apos;t lose sight of that. How can someone do that to a child? I&apos;ve just got to keep focused and positive.&quot; Interview with the News of the World, August 5 The criticism is very hard and very hurtful. Considering what we are going through already, it seems very cruel. I know this is a small group of people. Most have been very supportive. We have had thousands and thousands of letters from people and every line of every letter they have written has helped us get through another day. I have had hundreds of people get in touch and say, &apos;We do exactly what you have done. Don&apos;t ever blame yourself, you have to remember here who has committed the crime. It was someone who broke in and took Madeleine from the bed.&apos;&quot; Interview with the Guardian, August 10 In our heart of hearts we&apos;d both rather know - even if that means we have to face the terrible truth that Madeleine might be dead. But I can&apos;t prepare myself for bad news. I simply don&apos;t know how ... until you&apos;re in that situation you can&apos;t even begin to imagine what it is that gets you out of bed. You just have to go on. And it doesn&apos;t take the guilt away ... I ask myself &apos;Why did I think it was safe?&apos; But it felt safe. You don&apos;t expect a predator to break in and take your daughter ... Interview with Woman&apos;s Own, August 14 Everyone I know who had been to Portugal with their children said it was very family friendly, and it did feel like that. If I&apos;d had to think for one second about it, it wouldn&apos;t have happened. I never even had to think like that, to make the decision.

The investor, asset management group Knight Vinke, has demanded a shake-up at the bank after telling HSBC chairman Stephen Green to conduct a &quot;fundamental review of the group&apos;s strategy in consultation with shareholders&quot; or risk falling behind in expanding markets such as China. The campaign, understood to be orchestrated by Knight Vinke&apos;s director of investment Glen Saurez, is expected to appeal to other HSBC shareholders for support. It first wrote to HSBC in May and has held a series of meetings with senior bank staff in recent months, including the group&apos;s finance director Douglas Flint. Knight Vinke holds less than 1% of HSBC, but has a track record of forcing through mergers and changes of strategy at target companies where it holds investments. It said in a statement that it intends to engage &quot;in a constructive dialogue&quot; with the HSBC board and other investors &quot;over the future direction and governance of the group&quot;. It declined to comment further on its demands. The firm was started in 2003 by chief executive Eric Knight who achieved prominence in the battle over oil company Shell and its decision to end its joint UK/Dutch board structure that had been in place for more than a century, and locate to Amsterdam. Mr Knight was chief critic of the &quot;confusing&quot; split roles for executives at Shell and the management&apos;s failure to create a streamlined board structure and nimble decision-making process. His firm&apos;s criticism of HSBC follows the same pattern. It is understood he believes the current board of 17, of which 14 are non-executive directors, is unwieldy and lacks focus . The firm&apos;s \u00a31.5bn flagship fund is backed by investors including Calpers, the California state pension fund. HSBC is Europe&apos;s biggest bank and has grown rapidly over the past 10 years. In July it revealed group profits rose 14% to $14.2bn (\u00a37bn) in the first half, against $12.5bn for the same period last year. But critics have argued it has become cumbersome and too slow to capitalise on its strengths. The bank was last year forced to set aside \u00a31.7bn to cover bad loans in the United States, which prompted it to issue its first-ever profit warning. HSBC said it was always keen to talk to shareholders, but argued that its board structure was designed to address a complex international operation and was in line with rival bank boards.

Steve McClaren was deprived of his liberty early as England, after a couple of victories, got themselves into trouble in Group E. A more recent spell has had the air of atonement, with David Beckham, David James, Sol Campbell and Emile Heskey beckoned back from involuntary retirement. There has been a sheepish pragmatism to the phase, but it too must come to a close. One way or another, life is about to change again for McClaren. That could happen because he gets the sack, but England will be in control of their own fate in the Euro 2008 qualifiers should they beat Russia tomorrow. Getting to the finals is a realistic target and hitting that mark would change the manager&apos;s circumstances. Perhaps he can never enjoy the heroic status attained by Sven-Goran Eriksson with the 5-1 despatch of Germany, but McClaren would relish a security that empowered him anew. He has a hankering to be different, as he showed when appointing as his assistant Terry Venables, a person with the sort of interest in tactical theory that is largely treated as eccentricity in England. McClaren sought originality when he got the England post. The policy was also pragmatic since it distanced him from Eriksson in that short period before the Swede returned to these shores and was abruptly hailed all over again as a sophisticated continental. Ditching Beckham was the crude yet popular device by which McClaren could show he was his own man. For his first match, the friendly with Greece, there were accolades for fielding Steven Gerrard on the right. The Liverpool captain certainly had ample experience of appearing there for his club but has never actually liked doing so. So now Gerrard is back in the centre and the issue will never have to be confronted until that elusive day when he, Owen Hargreaves and Frank Lampard are all fit and baying to be picked for the two available slots in the middle. Should England proceed to Euro 2008, though, McClaren might have pause for a rethink regarding formations. His major alteration to date came at a most peculiar juncture. The manager had a penchant for picking a back three now and again at Middlesbrough. Having a bash at it with England in Zagreb, though, was bizarre. The trio in defence looked unsure of one another&apos;s positioning and totally oblivious to Eduardo da Silva&apos;s whereabouts as he headed the opener in a 2-0 defeat. It was a strange path to follow when there are so few believers in a back three, even if Russia prove to be among them tomorrow night. England&apos;s footballers could not be expected to flourish in a formation that is not in the repertoire of their Premier League clubs. For all that, there is cause for McClaren to feel restless about forever trusting himself to 4-4-2. The English version, with the wingers urged to go careering on the flanks, is exhausting in summer tournaments. In that regard, the 4-3-3 used by McClaren for a friendly in Holland that ought to have been won, instead of drawn, was thought-provoking. When the players on the wings withdraw slightly there is a compact 4-5-1 which offers little scope for the opposition to break through and should make it simpler to recuperate by keeping possession. A variety of that, in Manchester United&apos;s 4-2-3-1, brought the Premier League title back to Old Trafford with flair and also a defensive record almost as good as Chelsea&apos;s. In McClaren&apos;s case he might worry about having Michael Owen without an obvious partner at centre-forward, and goals might be more elusive if Wayne Rooney appeared there instead of him, as he did for that friendly in Amsterdam. There are many options, at least, for deep-lying schemers and attackers. On the right alone the candidates include, among others, the tricky Shaun Wright-Phillips and, when fit, the speedier Aaron Lennon. Should Beckham not return, the manager could also consider sitting David Bentley there, so long as he has been kitted out with a set of Three Lions earplugs. McClaren must make use of the licence he will enjoy if England qualify from Group E. It is good to reach the finals, as several predecessors have done, but then he has to differ from them by hitting on a system that works in the swelter of a major competition.", "sentences": ["A variety of that, in Manchester United&apos;s 4-2-3-1, brought the Premier League title back to Old Trafford with flair and also a defensive record almost as good as Chelsea&apos;s.

Both Morton and Ouseley were astonished by the offspring of this union, two foals who were clearly Arabian horses, but &apos;both in their colour, and in the hair of their manes, they have a striking resemblance to the quagga&apos;. Quaggas were a kind of zebra, but it was mainly their heads and shoulders that were striped. They belong to a small, sad club (whose members include the passenger pigeon and the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger) of animals for whom we know the exact day on which they became extinct. The last quagga died in Amsterdam zoo on 12 August 1883. At the time, the species went unmourned, as no one realized she was the last one. Why should the offspring of Ouseley&apos;s animals look like quaggas, when both parents were horses? Morton had a theory. A few years earlier, he had owned a male quagga which he had hoped to domesticate. But like the other zebras, quaggas are practically untameable - bad-tempered and stubborn, zebras not only bite, they refuse to let go - even today, more zookeepers are injured by zebras than by lions or tigers. The indigenous people of South Africa had never managed to ride them and thus Europeans were not met by troops of African cavalry when they started their encroachments. (The history of Africa might have been rather different if zebras were as tractable as Eurasian horses.) Morton had been &apos;desirous of trying the experiment of domesticating the Quagga&apos;. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Africa&apos;s diseases proved the biggest obstacles to European efforts to colonize the continent. Among the many scourges the whites faced was sleeping sickness, which attacked both Europeans and their horses. Zebras and quaggas are largely immune to the disease, and Morton seems to have been one of a number of Europeans interested in cross-breeding them with horses to produce a hybrid that would be better adapted to African conditions. In 1788, the German naturalist Johann Georg Gmelin observed that the quagga was &apos;thicker, and more strongly made than the Zebra, and is more tractable, having sometimes been broken to the draft&apos;. During Morton&apos;s lifetime, a traveller to South Africa reported that his host kept &apos;a tame quagga . . . for the purpose of making experiments in improving his breed of horses&apos;. But reports of the quagga&apos;s temper and tameability were mixed: a few years after Morton&apos;s experiments, a British naturalist observed that the one he had seen &apos;is not very docile, being much more wild than the Zebra&apos;. While another commentator suggested that it might nevertheless be possible &apos;to reclaim this creature, and to subject it to the service of man&apos;. Morton acquired a male quagga and crossed it with a chestnut mare. He described the result as a female horse &apos;bearing, both in her form and in her colour, very decided indications of her mixed origin&apos;; she had evidently retained either her father&apos;s stripes or his filthy temper - probably the latter, since Morton seems not to have repeated the experiment. However, it was the same chestnut mare, the quagga&apos;s former mate, which Morton had sold on to Ouseley. And it was this mare that then produced further quaggalike foals - even when she was mated with a perfectly ordinary horse. Her foals had striped legs and stiff, short manes that stuck straight up like a zebra&apos;s, instead of hanging down like a horse&apos;s. Stripes do occur occasionally in breeds of domestic horses, but are very rare in Arabians; neither Morton nor Ouseley had even seen manes like these on a horse before. It appeared as though the mare&apos;s encounter with the male quagga had permanently altered her, leaving some indelible imprint of &apos;quagga-ness&apos; that affected the offspring of her later matings. This incident struck Morton as sufficiently unusual that he brought it to the attention of his friend William Hyde Wollaston, president of the Royal Society of London (of which Morton himself was a fellow). In 1821, Morton&apos;s letter was published in its journal, the Philosophical Transactions, under the modest title &apos;A Communication of a Singular Fact in Natural History&apos;. The notion that a male could influence the female&apos;s subsequent offspring by other males was not new, but had typically been dismissed as little more than folk myth. Now, however, lent authority by the influential members of the prestigious Royal Society, the quagga effect became an established - if &apos;singular&apos; - scientific fact. Nearly fifty years after Morton published, even Charles Darwin remained convinced that &apos;there can be no doubt that the quagga affected the character of the offspring subsequently begot by the black Arabian horse&apos;. He referred to the case as one of the crucial puzzles he needed to solve when trying to devise a theory of biological inheritance. Darwin, like others struck by Lord Morton&apos;s mare, believed that the male quagga had made some sort of lasting impression on the female horse. By some unknown means, the character of his species had left its mark on her, but no one knew how: was it, as some thought, a mental impression, an idea of quagga-ness that the mare retained in her mind? Or was it something tangible, some particle or fluid in the male&apos;s semen or blood that had been passed on and retained? Might the male subsequently lose interest in female quaggas and pursue only mares? This book is about how some of these mysteries were unravelled. Long before Darwin, most people knew that for most organisms, as for humans, both males and females were needed to produce offspring, but even after centuries of investigation and speculation, no one knew exactly why, nor exactly what each contributed to their progeny. Given that some creatures managed without sex, what was its purpose? And what about inheritance? Why do most children look like their parents, while some are more like one of their grandparents? How are the characteristics of animal or plant breeds passed on and preserved over generations? And, given that creatures only ever give birth to creatures of the same species, where do new types of organisms come from? Given that species remain largely constant over generations, how and why do they sometimes vary? Lord Morton&apos;s explanation of his mare&apos;s striped foals may appear unlikely, even ridiculous, as may many of the later attempts to resolve his puzzle. To understand how and why they made sense at the time, we need to be aware of the centuries of thinking about reproduction that had preceded Morton&apos;s experiment. \u00b7 Jim Endersby, 2007 and William Heinemann, imprint of The Random House Group.

This followed Ramsay&apos;s kicking in another guide, Harden&apos;s London Restaurants 2008, in which he failed to pick up the top three accolades of &quot;top gastronomic experience&quot;, &quot;highest food rating&quot; and &quot;highest overall rating&quot; for the first time in, again, seven years. Richard Harden, co-editor of the guide, said: &quot;Failing some major redirection of Ramsay&apos;s energies back to his London restaurants - and away from America, TV studios and pubs - this is beginning to look like the end of the era of Ramsay&apos;s unchallenged dominance of the high-end culinary scene.&quot; Matthew Norman, the Guardian&apos;s restaurant critic, said he was unsurprised by this fall from grace: &quot;Someone as arrogant and narcissistic as Gordon would write this off as tall poppy syndrome. But it is inevitable and obvious that it is impossible for him to maintain standards when he is spending time shuttling between a restaurant in New York and I don&apos;t know how many in London - and is, I hear, planning to open in Paris as well. &quot;Everyone agrees that his flagship restaurant, 68 Royal Hospital Road, is stunningly good - to achieve two Michelin stars you have to be perfect, and to get three you have to achieve a level of perfection that is almost preposterous. But I&apos;ve not been impressed with some of the recent ventures he has lent his name to. I thought the Boxwood Cafe was extremely average and although I liked his gastropub, The Narrow, it was derivative and not that adventurous. La Noisette was appalling.&quot; Eyebrows have also been raised about Ramsay&apos;s ubiquity in advertising campaigns. &quot;I think that Gordon Ramsay is a fantastic chef who has very high standards in the kitchen. Unfortunately the same high standards don&apos;t always seem to apply to his choice of Ramsay-endorsed products and companies,&quot; wine writer Tim Atkin said. &quot;Think Walker&apos;s Crisps. Think Asda. Think BT. On the drink side, I don&apos;t know what he is doing promoting Gordon&apos;s, a mediocre, mass market gin, and I don&apos;t think he should have appeared in the window of Threshers off-licences puffing their wines. He gives the impression of being prepared to do almost anything for money.&quot; Mr Borkowski said Ramsay was in danger of doing &quot;what we in the trade call &apos;a Linda Barker&apos; - she started off being quite an interesting style expert, but then very quickly after appearing on Changing Rooms seemed to be in everyone&apos;s face all of the time, sitting on sofas and making a fortune but getting on everyone&apos;s nerves.&quot; However, Will Smith, co-owner of the Michelin-starred Arbutus and Wild Honey restaurants in London, said that the sneers may be fuelled by envy. &quot;I am sure there are many people jealous of Gordon Ramsay&apos;s success. When you have been at the top for so long you are always open to criticism. With multiple outlets you are always going to be exposed to doomsayers. Is it realistic to expect his flagship restaurant to always be voted number one?&quot; he said. It was in New York that Ramsay had his first real taste of failure, when his much-hyped eponymous restaurant at the London hotel was given a lukewarm reception by US critics. Frank Bruni from the New York Times said the venture lacked excitement and relied on &quot;familiar French ideas and techniques that have been executed with more flair, more consistency and better judgment in restaurants with less vaunted pedigrees&quot;. Legendary prowess Even his legendary prowess was called into question earlier this year, when it emerged he hadn&apos;t actually caught the sea bass he was shown apparently spearing on his Channel 4 show The F-Word. After the fisherman who actually made the catch blew the whistle, the broadcaster was forced to admit that the item, in which Ramsay said he felt &quot;like a fucking action man&quot;, before he appeared to catch and cook the food, had &quot;let down&quot; viewers. Of course, the work isn&apos;t exactly drying up for Ramsay. There&apos;s the rumoured Paris opening, plus another in Ireland, and he has two new books out next month alone. Not to mention a cameo on The Simpsons, in which he teaches Homer Simpson how to cook. Talking about the show, at least, it seemed to be business as usual: &quot;I hope they keep the swearing in,&quot; he said. Kitchen empire Ramsay&apos;s restaurant recipe \u00b7 Given the frequency of his four-letter outbursts, it seems appropriate that Gordon Ramsay began his professional life as a goalkeeper for Rangers. Born in Scotland, he was raised in England but moved back to play for the club until an injury led to an HND in hotel management. \u00b7 Ramsay spent his kitchen apprenticeship at the apron strings of illustrious - and Michelin-starred - chefs, including three years with Guy Savoy and Jo\u00ebl Robuchon in Paris. His first headline role came with Aubergine, owned by Marco Pierre White. Awards and book deals rolled in, though he left Aubergine after a bitter falling out that still rumbles on. \u00b7 In 1998 Ramsay opened the first outpost of his own empire - the eponymous Gordon Ramsay. His next restaurant, Petrus, took a whole seven months to win a Michelin star. Since then the empire has expanded by the year, including the Connaught hotel (now closing). \u00b7 2004 saw the beginning of his TV career, with Ramsay&apos;s Kitchen Nightmares striking fear into the hearts of small business owners everywhere. Other series followed, and even his wife had a column in Grazia. \u00b7 Global ambitions were perhaps inevitable, but even the thick-skinned Ramsay must have been shocked at the mauling his new American outpost received.

If you have bare ground after the harvest, now is the time to decide what you want to do with it through winter. It will sensible to cover it one way or the other to keep out weeds and to prevent goodness and nutrients being eroded and leached away. If you have thuggish perennial weeds (e.g. ground elder or horsetail) and have run out of steam trying to unearth them, it might be worth covering some of the area with black polythene or silage bags. Plants cannot live without light. You can make slits to plant vigorous growers like potatoes or squashes next year while leaving the weeds to gradually fade away. It can take two to three years to eradicate the toughest ones. The common practice of using old hessian-backed carpet is frowned on now due to the chemical content. Otherwise consider some over-wintering green manures. They have much the same effect, shading out weeds, preventing erosion particularly on light soils - but they come bearing gifts. When dug in, they add humus to the soil. Italian ryegrass is a good choice for heavy soils as the penetrating root systems help to break it up - the downside is that it is tough to dig up. Winter beans store nitrogen in their roots, released into the soil as they rot down - ideal if you plan to sow leafy crops in spring. http://www.kitchengardens.dial.pipex.com/greenmanure.htm If you can get others (or your Committee) interested in sharing, why not buy seed wholesale? Try here. A cold frame or a miniature polytunnel is a great investment for winter crops. Even hardy crops benefit from a little protection and end product will be more succulent for having had a sheltered life. A cold frame can be constructed quite simply out of an old drawer with a glass (or safer) polystyrene cover. Instructions here and here.  Good DIYers can also make their own small polytunnels with hoops of wire and polythene or, better still, some of the new horticultural fabrics. They are the best invention ever for the organic gardener as they keep out, not just the cold, but also the pests, while letting water through. Or you can buy them in kits.  Put cloches over parsley and chervil to keep them going through autumn. Split clumps of chives. They will die back with the frosts but re-sprout in spring. Pot some up for the kitchen windowsill to keep up supplies. Salad leaves are worth growing all year round. They are expensive in the shops and a doddle to grow, even in winter. Choose a sheltered, sunny spot and grow them under cover. Sown now, winter lettuces like the old classics &apos;Arctic King&apos; and &apos;Winter Density&apos; grow slowly, gently ticking over to mature around January.  More exciting though are the vigorous and colourful orientals for cut-and-come-again leaves. Joy Larkcom - the unchallenged authority on oriental vegetables (and author of the definitive book of the same name) - recommends a sowing now of mibuna, mizuna, green-in-the-snow, mustard, pak choi, komatsuna and texcel greens. In my experience the ready mixes of oriental saladini and stir fry leaves also work fine even in winter and you don&apos;t need to buy so much seed. An additional blessing is that slugs and snails generally leave them well alone.  Carrots for spring can be sown now in the cold frame. &apos;Amsterdam Forcing&apos; is a tried and tested variety. Sow on ground that was manured for the previous crop. A new variety that I am looking forward to trying this year is &apos;Nantes Fruband&apos;. Recommended by the RHS, it are said to sail through cold weather for the earliest crops of succulent spring carrots.  Sow spinach for spring. Make several sowings a week or so apart and select the strongest to grow on.  To do your bit for nature, make a few insect hotels for the hibernating lacewings, ladybirds and solitary wasps that demolish garden pests. All you need to do is gather some short lengths of hollow sticks. Lengths of bamboo are ideal. Bind them together with string.

In fact, the words &quot;banking&quot; and &quot;panic&quot; have been linked for just about as long as financial institutions have existed. No less an authority than the top US investment bank Lehman Brothers, for example, blames the start of the western world&apos;s first identifiably financial crash and subsequent bank run on the moment when some incompetent and unimaginative corporate bean-counter in the accounts department of the Holy Roman Empire decided it would be a fun idea to debase its coinage. And that was in 1622. Then there was Holland&apos;s 1637 tulip bubble, during which a single tulip bulb could briefly fetch six times the average wage or, if you were very lucky, a six-bedroomed piece of prime real estate beside one of Amsterdam&apos;s premier canals (one particularly precious speciemen, the Semper Augustus, was apparently once sold for 6,000 Dutch florins at a time when a tonne of butter cost 100). You would have thought, too, that Britain&apos;s South Sea Bubble of 1720 might have taught us all a few lessons about exaggerated claims of future returns and fevered, easy-money speculation, but of course no: after losing a terrifying \u00a320,000 on the venture, even Sir Isaac Newton was induced to observe that he could &quot;calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men&quot;. Again, according to Lehman Brothers, the 18th century saw 11 banking and financial crashes and the 19th another 18, including American banking crises in (to keep things brief) 1819, 1837, 1847, 1857, 1873, 1884, 1890 and 1896. There were a healthy 33 such storms in the 20th century, chief among them the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Japanese financial turmoil of the 1990s. All, to varying degrees, have caused considerable distress to investors and savers large and small. Stuffing the lot under your mattress may not be such a crazy notion after all. Victorian banking crisis By the late 19th century, the City of London and its banks - huge, hierarchical, top-heavy, complacent - seemed all but unassailable. But they were not. In 1866, for example, the bill broker and discount banker Overend, Gurney &amp; Co collapsed with debts of \u00a311m, a breathtaking sum at the time. The company&apos;s directors were promptly tried for fraud, but not before they had triggered a financial crisis that saw some 200 other companies, including many smaller banks, go out of business. In 1878, the City of Glasgow Bank also collapsed, its \u00a35.2m &quot;deficiency of capital&quot; reportedly ruining all but 254 of its 1,819 shareholders. These misadventures did, however, have the beneficial effect of prompting our nation&apos;s leading financial institutions to behave with a shade more financial responsibility, notably by doing their accounts, underpinned by the establishment of the Bank of England as a lender of last resort. The panic of 1907 This was a big American crisis during which the stock market lost half its value, the economy fell into recession, banks and trust companies suffered countless and catastrophic runs and the National Bank of North America collapsed. It was sparked, apparently, by a decision by a few New York banks to retract loans but soon spread nationwide and eventually led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System, America&apos;s central bank, in 1913. For a number of reasons we do not pretend to understand, it appears that a key player in the crisis was a Mr F Augustus Heinze and his splendidly named Knickerbocker Trust Company, whose dodgy dealings in the financial and commodities markets helped precipitate a stock market crash. The end of the American economy as we know it was, however, averted by one JP Morgan, who sorted the problem out by organising money transfers between the banks, setting up international credit lines, and buying up cheap shares in fundamentally healthy outfits. He did quite well out of it. The Wall Street crash The grandaddy of all modern financial disasters began with a frantic flurry of selling (more than 12m shares) on Black Thursday, October 24 1929. Trading slowed somewhat over the next few days, but a sudden slump in share prices gave it second wind, and on October 29, Black Tuesday, the world&apos;s foremost capital market crashed, with investors selling a total of 16,410,030 shares, a number not exceeded until 30 years later. Some $14bn was wiped off the value of the New York Stock Exchange in the first day alone, obliging unhappy NYSE clerks to work until 5am the next morning to record all the transactions. By 1933, some 11,000 of America&apos;s 25,000 banks had gone bust (although most of the big boys, the Morgans and Rockefellers and Lehmans, survived) and millions of investors were ruined, 11 of them famously jumping from upper-floor windows of Wall Street as the scale of the catastrophe - and of their own losses - became apparent. This was a crash so enormous, so profound, that it marked the end of one era and the start of another; the Roaring Twenties came to a close, the Black Thirties began. Over the next few years, America&apos;s jobless total climbed to 13m and millions lost their homes in the Great Depression. Stock prices were still 75% below their 1929 peak as late as April 1942, and it took the market as a whole a quarter of a century to recover. The Wall Street crash, you may not be surprised to learn, followed a decade-long speculative boom during which millions of investors piled into the stock market and borrowed to buy more. Rising share prices prompted more and more people to invest and more and more banks to lend more and more, creating a classic economic bubble. By the time the end came, brokers would lend you as much as 60% of the face value of the shares you wanted to buy. To those with a little knowledge of economics, this may sound alarmingly familiar. Also familiar may be the fact that the American president of the day declared it would be inappropriate to intervene. BCCI Banking collapses don&apos;t come much bigger than that of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, closed down by the Bank of England in July 1991 after regulators found it was up to its neck in such worthy activities as fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, arms trafficking, smuggling, unlawful property dealing, bribery and the support of terrorism. Around a million investors in more than 70 countries, including Crown jeweller&apos;s Garrard&apos;s, got burned as BCCI, which was founded in Pakistan in 1972 and once claimed assets of $25bn, was shown to have mislaid a cool $13bn. Money from Abu Dhabi, the Bank of America and possibly the CIA went into setting up the bank, which expanded at what can only be called suspicious speed throughout the 1970s, growing from 19 branches and $200m of assets in 1973 to 150 branches and $4bn in 1980. Despite this apparent success, the financial journalist Dan Atkinson later reckoned that the bank was most probably spending its customers&apos; deposits rather than investing them - in other words, was technically insolvent - as early as 1977. Reports of serious problems, however, did not really start to emerge until the late 1980s, and it was not until March 1991 that the Bank of England commissioned accountants PriceWaterhouse to carry out a full inquiry. This found, with splendidly British understatement, that BCCI had been guilty of &quot;widespread fraud and manipulation&quot;. A 1992 US report went further, concluding that BCCI was &quot;not an ordinary bank. It was set up deliberately to avoid centralised regulatory review, and operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. Its affairs are extraordinarily complex. Its officers were sophisticated international bankers whose apparent objective was to keep their affairs secret, to commit fraud on a massive scale, and to avoid detection.&quot; Creditors claimed that the Bank of England had left &quot;an untamed monster on the loose&quot; for way too long and sued it for \u00a3850m; the case eventually collapsed with both sides having racked up legal fees of more than \u00a3100m. The collapse of BCCI is widely seen as one of the world&apos;s greatest financial scandals. Nor, it has to be said, was it one of the finest chapters in the history of our financial watchdogs. Barings Bank BCCI was big; Baring&apos;s was old. It was, in fact, the oldest merchant bank in the City until it went spectacularly belly-up in 1995, following losses of some \u00a3827m by one of its traders, the now-legendary Nick Leeson, on futures contracts. Baring&apos;s was so old (it was founded in 1762) and grand that despite Britain being at war with France, it had helped to finance the Louisiana Purchase, by which the United States bought nearly a quarter of its current territory from the French in 1803. It was also old enough to have been in trouble before, needing to be rescued by the Bank of England in 1890 from a spot of over-exposure to bad Argentine and Uruguayan debt. Neither its illustrious history nor its many high-level connections with, for example, the British royal family could save it, however, when &quot;rogue trader&quot; Leeson let rip in the bank&apos;s Singapore offices between 1992 and 1995. In charge of both the bank&apos;s trading operations on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange and of the proper and accurate accounting of those trades, Leeson effectively reported to himself and was therefore able to conceal his shortfalls on the futures market by simply reporting losses as profits. With the help of account number 88888, the hidden so-called &quot;five-eights account&quot;, the trader successfully concealed his mounting losses from head office in London until the Kobe earthquake precipitated a slump in Asian financial markets. A Bank of England bailout failed and Barings was formally declared insolvent on February 26 1995, whereupon it was snapped up by Dutch banking and insurance giant ING - for a quid. US savings and loans crisis Savings and loans institutions in the United States were essentially small local banks that made home loans and took deposits from savers. Dating back in many instances to the 1800s, they were comparable in many ways to Britain&apos;s building societies. In the 1970s and 80s, however, financial deregulation encouraged S&amp;Ls to venture into far choppier financial waters, offering unfeasibly complex products and lending imprudently large sums in direct competition with the major US commercial banks - but without the banks&apos; expertise, and outside the banks&apos; strict regulatory framework. Predictably, large numbers of them found themselves in deep trouble, and a run began first of all on S&amp;L institutions in Ohio and Maryland in 1985. Some 1,000 of America&apos;s 4,000-plus S&amp;L&apos;s would eventually go belly-up in what one US economic professor later called &quot;the largest and costliest venture in public misfeasance, malfeasance and larceny of all time&quot;. And since the federal government had insured many of the individual deposits in the S&amp;Ls, it found itself facing a mammoth liability when they collapsed: the total cost of the bailout came to $150bn. Another regulatory triumph! Argentinian banking crisis On April 19 2002, in a desperate attempt to prevent the collapse of the economy, the Argentine government was forced to order the indefinite closure of all of the country&apos;s banks. Falling GDP, high government spending, rampant corruption, endemic tax evasion, rising unemployment and soaring public debt had finally put the wind up savers. They had lost all confidence in the country&apos;s economy and begun besieging their banks to withdraw their pesos, convert them into dollars and invest them abroad. In a move that went down very badly with an already unhappy populace, all banking and foreign exchange transactions were halted. This was even tougher than the restriction introduced a few months earlier that had prevented them from withdrawing more than the equivalent of $500 a month of their own money (in fact, being a resourceful people, many Argentinians had managed to obtain court rulings overturning that particular law, successfully taking out more than $100m a day. By the time the full freeze was ordered, experts estimated the Argentine banking system had been bled of more than 10% of its cash). At one stage security staff in the Buenos Aires headquarters of HSBC opened fire on the protesters. The Dawes, Tomes, Mousely, Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank In the fine musical Mary Poppins, Mr Dawes, the elderly banker who employs the children&apos;s father, optimistically attempts to persuade young Michael to put his money in the bank on the grounds that &quot;If you invest your tuppence/Wisely in the bank/ Safe and sound/ Soon that tuppence/ Will compound.&quot; Not only will the lad get a slice of the action in &quot;railways through Africa, dams across the Nile, majestic self- amortising canals and plantations of ripening tea&quot;, promises Mr Dawes, but he will &quot;achieve that sense of stature/ as your influence expands/ To the high financial strata/ that established credit now commands&quot;. Michael, understandably reluctant to entrust his precious tuppence-worth of pocket money to a baritone banker with full backing orchestra, protests, prompting the other customers in the bank to take fright and frantically begin withdrawing their lives&apos; savings. This in turn forces the Dawes, Tomes, Mousely, Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank to temporarily suspend trading. The children&apos;s unfortunate father, who - perhaps tellingly - is called Mr Banks, faces disciplinary action and is eventually fired for triggering the first run on the bank since 1773. The enduring popularity of this film might be seen as evidence of a popular lack of confidence in the banking system.", "sentences": ["Then there was Holland&apos;s 1637 tulip bubble, during which a single tulip bulb could briefly fetch six times the average wage or, if you were very lucky, a six-bedroomed piece of prime real estate beside one of Amsterdam&apos;s premier canals (one particularly precious speciemen, the Semper Augustus, was apparently once sold for 6,000 Dutch florins at a time when a tonne of butter cost 100)."], "title": "When banks go bad: a short history of banking crisis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/sep/19/business", "tags": ["Money", "Business", "Northern Rock", "Current accounts", "Savings"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-09-19T23:04:46Z", "article": "The Cambridge History of the English Language is a prodigious work which chronicles in six volumes and some 4,100 pages the language&apos;s development from the earliest traces to its modern global diaspora. That the work exists in this form - indeed, that it exists at all - is due in good part to the scholarship, energy, acumen and personality of its general editor, Professsor Richard Hogg, who has died of a heart attack, aged 63. Born in Edinburgh, Richard attended that city&apos;s Royal high school and university, graduating with first class honours in 1967. He met his wife-to-be, Margaret, at a party in the flat of Robin Cook, then secretary of the university Labour club. Edinburgh in those years was a special place for anyone interested in language. Angus MacIntosh (obituary, November 2 2005) had built arguably the finest English language department in the world and the waves of Chomskyan theoretical linguistics were breaking on European shores. Inspired by these currents, Richard undertook a doctorate on the syntax of present-day English - subsequently published as English Quantifier Systems (1977) - while at the same time working as a research assistant on MacIntosh&apos;s Middle English dialect project. It was the historical and dialectal strand which was eventually to blossom into an outstanding scholarly career. Beyond Edinburgh, important influences on his thinking and intellectual development included the then doyenne of the history of English, Barbara Strang, and the perceptive and idiosyncratic Charles Bazell, with whom he kept up a regular correspondence. In 1969 Richard and Margaret were married and settled in Amsterdam, where he had been appointed to a lectureship. He subsequently moved to Lancaster University, and from there, aged only 36, to the Smith chair of English language and medieval literature at Manchester, a position he held until his death. Over the next decade he produced a stream of articles and a textbook on metrical phonology, co-authored with his doctoral student and later colleague, Chris McCully. This research culminated in the first volume of the Cambridge History (1992) - which he edited and to which he contributed a 100-page chapter on the phonology and morphology of Old English - and in the first volume of his authoritative A Grammar of Old English (1992). Volume two was almost complete at his death. The originality and importance of this work was recognised in his election as a fellow of the British Academy in 1994. A few years later, with Bas Aarts from University College London and his Manchester colleague David Denison, he was a founding editor of what soon became the field&apos;s leading journal, English Language and Linguistics. He and Denison also edited A History of the English Language (2006). Richard excelled in research, teaching and administration. As dean of the arts faculty at Manchester from 1990 to 1993, he oversaw a fraught merger with the theology faculty, and later fulfilled a number of administrative roles within the British Academy. He was a dedicated and effective teacher whose lectures were notable for an informal style which masked a formidable erudition. He had the happy knack of adapting as easily to the demands of the beginner as to those of advanced and doctoral students who shared his own enthusiasms. One class project involved recording voice samples and playing them to unsuspecting outsiders, who were asked to assess the speaker&apos;s personality. One of the voices was Richard&apos;s own, which was judged to be that of &quot;a family man - kind and generous&quot;. He not only sounded like one, but was a devoted family man. He and Margaret were a close couple and he followed with love and pride the sporting and scholastic successes of his sons Daniel and Robert, escorting them regularly to watch Altrincham FC, for whom he had an unaccountable passion. His range of interests was wide, encompassing football, film (his web page includes a link to Pedro Almodovar), folk music and fine wine. As a good Scot, he enjoyed malt whisky, the novels of Ian Rankin and watching England lose football matches. His election as a fellow of the Royal Society Edinburgh in 2004 was a source of particular pleasure. He shared his native land&apos;s historic bond with France, planning in meticulous detail the family&apos;s regular holidays there. Most of Richard&apos;s published work betrayed his love of solving problems, the more complicated the better. The same cast of mind was evident elsewhere in his early enthusiasm for computers and his unnerving fascination with the intricacies of faculty budgets. Latterly, however, he had become interested in the way linguistic and professional norms become established and transmitted. This figures significantly in the monograph on the history of English dialectology (the outcome of a Leverhulme senior fellowship), which remained three-quarters complete at his death. He was slated to succeed a long line of eminent scholars in giving the biennial Sir Israel Gollancz memorial lecture at the British Academy next year. Like all his work, it would have been original, provocative and entertaining. Richard is survived by his wife, his children and his father Charlie. \u00b7 Richard Milne Hogg, historian of the English language, born May 20 1944; died September 6 2007", "sentences": ["In 1969 Richard and Margaret were married and settled in Amsterdam, where he had been appointed to a lectureship."], "title": "Obituary: Richard Hogg", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/20/guardianobituaries.obituaries", "tags": ["Education", "Books", "English and creative writing", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-09-21T23:00:27Z", "article": "It&apos;s not exactly a rarity to see visitors behaving oddly on the streets of Amsterdam.

It is also widely believed that Putin will seek to run the country from behind the scenes and stand for president again in 2012. But in Russian politics true friendships hardly ever exist and loyalties are normally based on personal interest. There is no reason to think Viktor Zubkov, the new prime minister and Putin&apos;s likely heir, is an exception. But if such a clash of interests does come about, Putin won&apos;t be on strong ground. His successor will have huge formal powers at his disposal.

Dressed in white lingerie, her bleached blonde hair bathed in red light, the prostitute beckoned men towards her and the unmade bed behind. &apos;They say we give Amsterdam a bad reputation,&apos; she said, pushing her window open slightly. &apos;Rubbish. This is the only reputation we have.&apos; Last week, the city announced that it would be closing down a third of its famed brothels. Within a matter of months, 52 of the iconic window displays that line the streets of the busy red-light district will disappear. Come January, the blinds will be drawn down on the window that frames the blonde prostitute, looking down over the canal, and the sign above her that reads &apos;raam verhuur&apos; (windows for rent) will also be gone. The 22-year-old was fed up. &apos;I was thinking of quitting anyway,&apos; she said. &apos;So this will make the final decision for me.&apos; As she spoke, a young, drunken man hollered, &apos;30 euros&apos;. Looking slightly offended, she pointed across the canal and quietly said: &apos;I think you should try that part of the district.&apos; Her building is one of those where the rent is highest and the sex most expensive. It is owned, like so many of the brothels, by property magnate Charlie Geerts, who gave up a year-long battle with the authorities last week and finally sold up. In a deal worth \u00a318m, officials will buy 18 buildings from Geerts - known as Amsterdam&apos;s Emperor of Sex - and close down the &apos;windows&apos;. The final decision came from the city&apos;s mayor, Job Cohen, who argued that the brothels were attracting crime and money-laundering to the area. &apos;We want to get rid of the underlying criminality,&apos; he told a TV station last week. Those who live above and beside the windows have been fairly supportive of the move. One man, who refused to be named, said that prostitution was a core part of the area and he did not want it to disappear completely. &apos;But we are getting more and more petty criminals here,&apos; he said. &apos;Hopefully by cutting down on the brothels the problems will be better controlled.&apos; Cohen and others in the city know that the prostitutes posing and preening in their windows are a huge draw for visitors. This weekend, the roads and alleys, lined with old-fashion street-lamps, were packed with tourists from all over the world. Outside the Casa Rosso theatre, large crowds were trying to get in to watch the live sex shows from red velvet seats. A few hundred yards down the street, an erotic museum was also busy. &apos;Most people think the decision to close the windows is absurd,&apos; said the man on the door. &apos;It is not reasonable,&apos; shouted Joshua Saley, an 18-year-old on holiday from Woking. &apos;This is a place where you can be yourself.&apos; His friend, Michael Bailey, said: &apos;The one place on Earth where you are allowed to do what you want.&apos; Beside them a tour group headed away from the canal towards another part of the district. Led by their guide, Chantal Moreno, a 28-year-old woman who takes tourists around the area three times a week, they stared in shock at the women beckoning them towards the windows. As they entered another square, they stared up at the Oude Kerk - or old church - towering above them. &apos;A church,&apos; some of the tourists gasped as they caught sight of Amsterdam&apos;s oldest monument, &apos;in the red-light district?&apos; Its giant, arched, stainless steel windows loomed over the neon lights, tourists, expensive restaurants and women. Moreno led her group towards a brightly lit shop. As they walked they passed &apos;Belle&apos; - a metre-high bronze statue of a woman in high heel boots with her hands on her hips and her hair pulled up above her head.  Below a sign reading: &apos;Respect sex workers all over the world.&apos; Finally they arrived at the Prostitution Information Centre, which is run by Mariska Majoor, a 39-year-old woman who used to work in the windows two decades ago. For 14 years, Majoor has run the centre in order to support women in the area and inform tourists about prostitution in the Netherlands. It is also a souvenir shop with mini statues, T-shirts, mugs, paintings and key-rings. The tourists soon noticed, however, that in place of the models of buses or buildings were those of shapely women in high-heeled boots, leaning against images of the city&apos;s famous lampposts.  A huge mural, stretching from the floor to the ceiling, covered one wall, depicting scenes of women in windows. The image was painted by Majoor&apos;s father. &apos;It is his way of dealing with it,&apos; she said. Close by, he had also painted a wooden folding screen with pictures of women dressed in lingerie with their faces lit by a warm red light. While drinking wine, the group chatted to Majoor about her own experiences. Dressed in lace-up ankle trainers, tight black trousers, a grey jumper and cap, Majoor explained that she was now married with a young daughter. Most tourists, she said, walked around the area &apos;open-eyed and open-mouthed&apos;. Certainly along the alleys close to her shop men and women stopped to gawk at the prostitutes. Women have been standing in the windows around this area for years but only since 2000 did the shops become legally licensed. When Majoor worked there from 1985 to 1990, the &apos;rooms were more dirty, with cockroaches&apos; and girls as young as 16 were joining the business. Now, she argued, that was not possible. Legalisation had made the city safer for prostitutes, who now had to prove that they were 18 or over. Speaking to visitors she said that part of the reason politicians were closing the windows was because they were ashamed of the red-light district. &apos;They do not have to be proud of window prostitution,&apos; she said. &apos;But they should feel proud of the fact that here a free person can be the person they want to be and that the authorities do what they can to make everybody safe in this city.&apos; Majoor argued that the partial closure announced last week could actually make things worse for the women. &apos;The government are trying to get rid of criminal organisations but they have picked on the wrong people,&apos; she said. &apos;They really have to do something about the pimps - and a pimp is never an owner of a brothel.&apos; She is worried that a shortage of windows will push woman away from the safe, monitored areas. The battle over the spaces that are left could attract more criminals to the area, she said. Prostitution, she added, existed in every city, in every country, in every part of the world. All that was different here was that it took place in public - and that made the women less open to exploitation and abuse.", "sentences": ["On the edge of a cobbled path that runs along a canal in the heart of Amsterdam, a pretty woman lit her cigarette, struck a pose and smiled at the tourists pouring past.", "&apos;They say we give Amsterdam a bad reputation,&apos; she said, pushing her window open slightly.", "In a deal worth \u00a318m, officials will buy 18 buildings from Geerts - known as Amsterdam&apos;s Emperor of Sex - and close down the &apos;windows&apos;.", "&apos;A church,&apos; some of the tourists gasped as they caught sight of Amsterdam&apos;s oldest monument, &apos;in the red-light district?&apos; Its giant, arched, stainless steel windows loomed over the neon lights, tourists, expensive restaurants and women."], "title": "Amsterdam closes a window on its red-light tourist trade", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/23/travelnews.amsterdam", "tags": ["Travel", "Amsterdam holidays", "Netherlands holidays"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-09-23T22:47:53Z", "article": "Ever since the arrival of the camera phone, the experience of gig-going has changed. It&apos;s not simply that fans will insist on waving them above their heads in preference to the distinctly more rock&apos;n&apos;roll cigarette lighter; it&apos;s that after the event, there will inevitably be grainy footage immediately available on YouTube. For something better than the shaky view from Row Z, the live concert film remains a box office draw. Next weekend and the one after, this newspaper is giving away two classics: Prince dazzling in concert in 1987 in Sign O&apos; The Times; and Talking Heads&apos; 1984 masterpiece Stop Making Sense, which still deserves to top any list of the genre&apos;s best-ever. It almost sounds heretical, but both show off the artists&apos; brilliance to better effect than any of their studio albums. From Elvis and the Beatles to Eminem in 8 Mile, there has long been a tradition of pop stars acting in movies built around their stage personas; and there have been celebrated music biopics, such as Milos Forman&apos;s multi-Oscar winning Amadeus, Taylor Hackford&apos;s recent Ray and Anton Corbijn&apos;s forthcoming film about Joy Division&apos;s Ian Curtis, Control. At the Venice Film Festival earlier this month,Todd Haynes won acclaim for I&apos;m Not There, in which six actors play Bob Dylan. One of the &apos;Dylans&apos;, Cate Blanchett, was named best actress. But while that approach might take us closer to the real Dylan than any other, surely nothing brings us nearer to his music than footage of the singer in performance. When a publicist told me that a forthcoming film of Sigur Ros in concert lasted two hours, there were certainly doubts: would anyone be prepared to stand in line with a bucket of popcorn to catch a documentary about four Icelandic post-rockers staging a series of quirky gigs in their homeland? But rather than proving to be the cinematic equivalent of watching a glacier melt, time flew by. Likewise with Martin Scorsese&apos;s Shine a Light, originally scheduled for a cinema release this month but now pushed back to next year. Other than a brief segment, in which the harassed director is hilariously given the run-around by Mick Jagger, the film simply details a Rolling Stones gig at the Beacon Theatre in New York last September. What results is quite the equal, in my experience, of catching the band in the flesh; and from the back at Twickenham Stadium, you certainly don&apos;t get to see that flesh in all its weathered glory. Unless, of course, you&apos;re just staring at the giant video screens; in which case, you might as well have stayed at home. Scorsese told the Observer Music Monthly last month: &apos;I was trying to figure out a narrative structure, then I abandoned that... it&apos;s really about performance.&apos; The Stones have form in this area. In 1968, Jean-Luc Godard took film of a group of counterculture warriors discussing the imminent revolution and yoked it to footage of the band in the studio slowly working up &apos;Sympathy for the Devil&apos; for his movie that later took that name. In 1970, the Maysles brothers documented the band&apos;s ill-starred concert at Altamont for their compelling Gimme Shelter. Albert and David Maysles were serious documentary-makers, interested in the significance of teen hysteria, and in 1964 the pair had captured the Beatles&apos; first trip across the Atlantic in What&apos;s Happening! The Beatles in the USA. Working in the same vein was DA Pennebaker, whose Don&apos;t Look Back, filmed in 1965 and released two years later, remains the definitive portrait of Bob Dylan at that time. Neither of those films makes our list of 10 classic concert films, if only because their merit is derived in large part from what you see offstage; likewise Scorsese&apos;s Dylan documentary No Direction Home, but not his timeless Last Waltz. The film-makers&apos; approaches vary; what makes each film great is, ultimately, the greatness of the performers in question. There&apos;s nothing wrong per se with Michael Winterbottom&apos;s 2004 film 9 Songs, in which live footage of contemporary indie acts is interspersed with graphic scenes of sexual intercourse; it&apos;s simply that you expect a bit more spunk from Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and co. Likewise The Cramps: Live at Napa State Mental Hospital - an extraordinary record of the psychobilly band&apos;s gig at one of California&apos;s biggest mental institutions in 1978, but something which pales on repeated viewing. Not the Led Zep flick The Song Remains The Same? Or Girls Aloud Live? Ah, but then some choices must remain deeply personal. \u00b7  Caspar Llewellyn Smith is editor of Observer Music Monthly Best concert films (in no particular order) Jazz on a Summer&apos;s Day Bert Stern&apos;s 1960 documentary of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival features performances from the Thelonious Monk Trio, Dinah Washington, Louis Armstrong, Chuck Berry and more, but it left its mark because of its impressionistic approach to proceedings. Stern (a fashion photographer later celebrated for his portraits of Marilyn Monroe) mixed shots of the musicians with images of Newport Harbour and Narragansett Bay, and white-sailed yachts taking part in trials for the America&apos;s Cup. Some crowd scenes were faked, being added subsequently; there was no narration; and fans have been left frustrated - the cameras skip Chuck Berry duck-walking through &apos;Sweet Little 16&apos;, for instance. But what resulted was a visual poem truer than any more conventional film. Woodstock Eleven years after that Newport date, the great unwashed converged on Max Yasgur&apos;s farm in upstate New York for a very different kind of festival. An incredible 120 miles of film footage were shot to document the event but director Michael Wadleigh still missed performances from luminaries such as the Grateful Dead, the Incredible String Band and Ravi Shankar. Never mind: there are hair-raising contributions from Country Joe and the Fish, Sly and the Family Stone, Crosby, Stills and Nash, and Jimi Hendrix, whose reconstruction of &apos;The Star Spangled Banner&apos; remains arguably the hippie era&apos;s most powerful artistic statement. Even without any brown acid, the film remains a trip, the inspiration for last year&apos;s excellent Glastonbury directed by Julien Temple. Sign O&apos; The Times The great rock writer Nik Cohn was unequivocal: he&apos;d seen Jimi Hendrix and James Brown play, but for him the greatest live performer of all time was Prince. Thanks to his run of 21 nights at the O2 Arena, half the country has had the chance to make their own assessment of the purple genius&apos;s merits this summer. But few could claim that these shows have touched the heights of his Sign O&apos; the Times tour 20 years ago. The film of those gigs was purportedly taken over four nights in Rotterdam and Antwerp but the quality of the footage meant that reshoots were necessary at Prince&apos;s Paisley Park Studios, when a spurious narrative was created through a sequence of inter-song dramatic devices. The viewer couldn&apos;t care less when the results were this exhilarating. Elvis (1968) Comeback Special This is when the artist who more than any other had created such freedom for the Woodstock generation returned to the fray. The irony was that for the past eight years Elvis had been wasting his talents in Hollywood, and seemed entirely to have lost touch with contemporary rock&apos;n&apos;roll. Colonel Parker, his manager, planned an NBC TV special for Christmas 1968 in which his charge would sing seasonal songs. Instead Elvis and young producer Steve Binder hijacked the concept, and for the key segment in the show placed the King in the company of his favourite old henchmen- musicians such as drummer DJ Fontana. Seated around a small square stage - the performance later proved the inspiration for the MTV Unplugged series - the group tore into old standards such as &apos;Tiger Man&apos;. Elvis, dressed in black leathers, recovered his mojo; the show proved a huge hit. It remains the quintessential rock&apos;n&apos;roll experience. Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars On 3 July 1973, from the stage of London&apos;s Hammersmith Odeon, David Bowie announced: &apos;Not only is this the last show of the tour but it&apos;s the last show we&apos;ll ever do.&apos; Cue pandemonium, although it was only the Ziggy Stardust character that Bowie was retiring. Director DA Pennebaker had made the seminal Dylan film Dont Look Back in 1965 (released in 1967), its unreleased companion piece Eat the Document, which followed the singer&apos;s next UK tour, and also Monterey Pop a chronicle of the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. Both festival and film proved highly influential when Woodstock rolled around. The Bowie film contained fascinating glimpses of rock&apos;s greatest chameleon off-stage, but for most part, Pennebaker, a master of cinema verite, played it straight. The Last Waltz Martin Scorsese helped edit the Woodstock film. On Thanksgiving Day 1976 he filmed his old buddies the Band at the Winterland Ballroom, San Francisco, playing their last ever gig after 16 years on the road. Joining them were friends including Ronnie Hawkins, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Ringo Starr, Muddy Waters and inevitably Bob Dylan. It remains a moving document, with wonderful performances, but also seems to mark the end of a possibly more innocent, certainly more self-indulgent era. Famously, a huge lump of cocaine had to be painstakingly removed, frame by frame, from Neil Young&apos;s nostril in the editing. Little wonder that punk was just around the corner. Stop Making Sense David Byrne walks on to an empty stage with an acoustic guitar and a portable cassette player and starts playing &apos;Psycho Killer&apos;. Slowly, the rest of Talking Heads join him - a new member for each new song. There were few audience shots, and the crowd&apos;s applause is heard only low in the mix. Director Jonathan Demme&apos;s 1984 film - shot over three nights in December 1983 - was like no concert movie ever seen before. The New York band helped define the new-wave era, and seemed like hoary rock apostates. But the beauty of Stop Making Sense is that, unusually, the camera lingered on the musicians in the act of performance, with no close-ups of guitar solos or other such fripperies. Rather than being lost as an artefact of its time, the film remains as fresh as ever, even if that famous suit has long since gone out of fashion. Buena Vista Social Club In 1996 American guitarist Ry Cooder found himself in Havana, Cuba, with the producer Nick Gold to make an album with two musicians from Mali and a group of Cubans. Visa problems meant the Malians were a no-show but Cooder pushed ahead anyway, and in six days made a record with veterans who&apos;d once played together at the old Buena Vista Social Club. The rest is history - but history documented in no-frills fashion by Paris, Texas director Wim Wenders, who filmed the full group subsequently playing together in Amsterdam and at New York&apos;s Carnegie Hall for his documentary. Suddenly, &apos;Chan Chan&apos; was a worldwide hit. Leonard Cohen: I&apos;m Your Man Confusingly, this 2005 film by Lian Lunson doesn&apos;t feature Leonard Cohen in performance until its very end. Rather, it sees a dozen of his famous fans singing his songs at a 2005 tribute show at the Sydney Opera House: including Beth Orton essaying &apos;Sisters of Mercy&apos;, Jarvis Cocker measuring himself against &apos;I Can&apos;t Forget&apos;, and Rufus Wainwright taking up residency of &apos;Chelsea Hotel No 2&apos;. Meanwhile, there are scenes of Cohen in interview at home in Los Angeles, as gnomic in his utterances as ever: it&apos;s through their songwriting that the great artists really reveal themselves. Heima In the summer of 2006 Sigur Ros returned to Iceland from a gruelling world tour to play on home soil (much of it volcanic). There were two big open-air shows but otherwise the band travelled to remote locations, often performing in front of only a handful of local people. The resulting film, which will be screened at the BBC Electric Proms next month and also released on DVD, is much like the band: relentlessly quirky, but often staggeringly beautiful.", "sentences": ["The rest is history - but history documented in no-frills fashion by Paris, Texas director Wim Wenders, who filmed the full group subsequently playing together in Amsterdam and at New York&apos;s Carnegie Hall for his documentary."], "title": "Caspar Llewellyn Smith on the best concert films ever", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2007/sep/23/features.review37", "tags": ["Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-09-24T11:30:00Z", "article": "As part of the EU&apos;s &quot;in town without my car&quot; initiative, hundreds of small towns and major cities across Europe - including London, Brussels and Amsterdam - and beyond, closed off their town centres for the annual car-free day this weekend. The broader European mobility week, which took place from September 16-22, had &quot;streets for people&quot; as its main theme. In London, more than 30,000 cyclists enjoyed a 14-km stretch of the city closed off to traffic on Sunday. China&apos;s first attempt to join the car free day movement was a failure, with Chinese motorists in Beijing and other cities largely ignoring the ban. On Sunday, Brussels saw reportedly the biggest car-free day in Europe. The entire inner city area of the Belgian capital was closed to motor vehicles, bringing with it an unusual kind of tranquillity to the city&apos;s normally busy streets. For those accustomed to the hustle and bustle of a major city, the silence, coupled with legions of cyclists, skateboarders and pedestrians was somewhat eerie. According to the city&apos;s mobility minister Pascal Smet, this year was the most successful yet, drawing hundreds of thousands of participants. He also unveiled plans to hold two car free days next year. Although this annual event helps raise awareness of environmental issues and allows pedestrians and cyclists to claim the city streets as their own, it does little to challenge the pre-eminence of the automobile, since it is held at the weekend when people are less likely to need or use their cars anyway. Ironically, it may also add to emissions rather than cut them. For instance, the Brussels car-free day attracted people from across the country, thousands of who drove in on what would normally be a quiet Sunday and parked their vehicles in satellite car parks just outside the city limits. Since the first car-free day was launched in 1994, the global movement has become an enormous success, with more than a thousand cities in some 40 countries now taking part annually. However, it is now time to take the experiment to the next level. I believe that all 27 European Union member states should agree to hold a car-free day on a regular weekday. Governments recognise the future need for society to wean itself off its unhealthy dependence on the automobile, both for environmental reasons and to face up to the challenge of a possible energy crunch in the coming decades. Why should each national government not demonstrate the workability of a &quot;car light&quot; existence by introducing a complete ban on private vehicles for one day either nationwide or in their capital cities? During that day, the authorities would mobilise all their spare public transport capacity to deal with the surge in commuters and make free bicycles available for the day. Employers could encourage more of their workers to telework. Of course, the creaking public transport network in many European cities would probably struggle under the additional pressure, but I believe that, with careful planning, public authorities could pull it off. If successful, such an enlarged experiment would up the stakes and show people that the right mix of decent investment in public transport, car sharing schemes and other initiatives could remove their need to own a car and slash the number of car trips they make. For me, every day is already a car-free day. I do not own a car nor even have a licence. Ghent, the progressive Belgian university town where I live, is an incredibly bike-friendly city. In the mornings, I cycle on designated bike paths along a scenic canal to the station or take the tram to the station, where an express train takes me to Brussels in under half an hour. During the ride, I sit back and relax with a book, while motorists stress on the tailbacks on the motorway. I believe a &quot;car light&quot; existence is already entirely possible for tens of millions of Europeans. How dependent are you on your car? Are you ready to trade in your motor for some healthy pedal power?", "sentences": ["As part of the EU&apos;s &quot;in town without my car&quot; initiative, hundreds of small towns and major cities across Europe - including London, Brussels and Amsterdam - and beyond, closed off their town centres for the annual car-free day this weekend."], "title": "Carefree, car-free", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/24/carefreecarfree", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Environment", "World news", "London", "China", "Transport", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-09-26T09:24:20Z", "article": "&quot;Holly came from Miami F-L-A, Hitchhiked her way across the USA, Plucked her eyebrows on the way, Shaved her legs and then he was a she ...&quot; That&apos;s how Lou Reed made Holly Woodlawn, the Warhol Factory superstar and legendary drag queen, famous in his 1972 song Walk on the Wild Side. Here&apos;s Woodlawn&apos;s expanded version: &quot;I was 15 years old and failing at high school in Miami Beach because I was too busy partying. I was supposed to go to summer school to catch up and really didn&apos;t want to, so I joined some of these Cuban queens to go to New York. I hocked some jewellery and we made it all the way to Georgia, where the money ran out and we had to hitchhike the rest of the way. &quot;Atlanta, Georgia, of all places - you could expect to be tarred and feathered and murdered in those days! But we survived and I remember the first time I saw New York: the Emerald City. I thought the sidewalks were made of diamonds because of the specks of mica in the asphalt. It was 1962. Marilyn had just died. I lived on the streets like everyone does when they run away. I met some girlfriends who took me in and we found a place in Queens. I was really lucky. I met this guy who fell in love with me and asked me to be his girlfriend. I started taking hormones for a sex-change and lived as his wife, working in the days as a clothing model at Saks Fifth Avenue. Oh, the things I did! And for six or seven years they never knew I was a boy. Not a clue!&quot; I meet Woodlawn at her apartment in West Hollywood, Los Angeles&apos; gay village or ghetto, on a sweltering hot day. In a few weeks she&apos;ll be in the UK to promote an exhibition of paintings of herself by the British artist Sadie Lee, showing her in a less glamorous guise than usual. &quot;I said, &apos;Why don&apos;t you paint me as everyday me for a change, instead of all peaches and cream?&apos;&quot; she says. As we sit on her balcony talking, we&apos;re favoured with an ambient soundtrack that, appropriately, seems more redolent of Manhattan than of sleepy California: a fire nearby means that we&apos;re constantly interrupted by screaming sirens. &quot;All right, already,&quot; howls Woodlawn. &quot;Find the fucking fire and shut up. I swear, West Hollywood is breeding pyromaniacs today.&quot; The Holly Woodlawn of 2007 is a far cry from the sweet-voiced cross-dresser who made her first splash in the film Trash in 1970, fake-masturbating with a Miller beer bottle to considerable acclaim. Back then - during what we must inevitably call her 15 minutes of fame - she was one of the many drag queens and hustlers at the lower end of the Warhol social scene, congregating around his Factory studio and at hangouts like the bar Max&apos;s Kansas City. &quot;The mole people,&quot; Factory manager Billy Name called them. &quot;The amphetamine people.&quot; At the other end were the rich, famous and powerful: Jim Morrison, Yoko Ono, Janis Joplin, author George Plimpton. The 61-year-old man who answers the door today is out of drag, bent and frail, though indefatigably cheerful, using a Zimmer frame because of various slowly fusing discs in his spine that, he says, are unimaginably painful and incurable. &quot;Oh no, this is IT, honey, downhill all the way from here on!&quot; He rises at six; by 11 his painkillers have slurred his speech a little and fogged his memory. The outrageous spark is still there and the stories are as funny as ever, but delivered with a weariness and frustration he blames on the pills. I play nursemaid a little, fetching coffee and cigarettes from the nearby market, and getting the phone for him when it rings, treading carefully around his untidy, sparsely furnished apartment, with its bed and carpets covered in fag ash, and its one shrine-like photo of Andy, Candy, Holly and others in its most visible corner. I ask him about his alter ego, the boy born Haroldo Santiago Franceschi Rodriguez Danhakl. &quot;I don&apos;t even know who he was,&quot; he says. &quot;When I was younger, I was extremely shy and living in what&apos;s now Miami Beach. My father had a nice job. I guess we were middle income. I had good schools. I just was unhappy because I didn&apos;t know who I was. I didn&apos;t associate with the other kids in school, the suburban-minded ones. Plus I came out very young. I was raised in Puerto Rico for the first few years of my life, where the culture is more Caribbean. Everyone&apos;s naked, it&apos;s hotter, you come out earlier. I was having sex when I was seven and eight in the bushes with my uncles and cousins - of course, they were only 11 or 12 themselves. I was raised in a house full of women and my uncle was gay. We lived in a little tiny town, so those were my role models. Then Miami Beach. All the Cubans arrived after Castro took over, and that&apos;s where I really came out, on 21st Street in Miami Beach.&quot; The same month that Woodlawn hitchhiked north, July 1962, Warhol had his first major art show not 10 blocks from where we&apos;re talking, at Irving Blum&apos;s Ferus Gallery. Although the Campbell&apos;s Soup paintings didn&apos;t sell well at the time, Warhol had arrived. The night the show closed, Marilyn Monroe died three miles away in Brentwood, causing Warhol to work a poster image of her from the 1953 movie Niagara into his famous Marilyn screenprints - which in time turned him into, in the words of the American critic Wayne Koestenbaum, &quot;our greatest philosopher of stardom&quot;. To some extent, Woodlawn was a product - or an exemplar - of his ideas. Although she didn&apos;t become a full-fledged Factory insider until 1969, she was very much on the same scene. She&apos;d decided against the sex-change by this point, though: &quot;Honey, once they cut it off, it&apos;s OFF!&quot; And she didn&apos;t get to know Lou Reed until after A Walk on the Wild Side came out, but nonetheless saw many early shows by the Velvet Underground and Nico. &quot;I was just one of the audience,&quot; he says. &quot;I used to go to the Exploding Plastic Inevitable at the Dome, with all that colour and insanity, with Gerard Malanga [Warhol&apos;s assistant] brandishing a whip and Mary Woronov from Chelsea Girls dancing. So I was very happy when I gradually became a Warhol superstar. I felt like Elizabeth Taylor! Little did I realise that not only would there be no money, but that your star would flicker for two seconds and that was it. But it was worth it, the drugs, the parties, it was fabulous. You live in a hovel, walk up five flights, scraping the rent. And then at night you go to Max&apos;s Kansas City where Mick Jagger and Fellini and everyone&apos;s there in the back room. And when you walked in that room, you were a STAR!&quot; Trash, a film improvised and shot in 1969 in the basement apartment of its director, Warhol&apos;s manager Paul Morrissey, was the nearest Woodlawn came to broader fame. A kindly, soothing presence on screen, Woodlawn certainly had acting ability: her horny, drug-happy character is the film&apos;s highlight. &quot;That beer bottle scene is to my career what eating dogshit was for Divine in Pink Flamingos!&quot; The gay director George Cukor is said to have tried to get Woodlawn nominated for an Academy award, but the issue floundered, perhaps predictably, on whether Woodlawn belonged in the Best Supporting Actor or Actress category. Since then, Woodlawn has published her autobiography - the toothsome and scandalous A Low Life in High Heels - and made a cult career in drag. Although based in New York until a couple of years after Warhol died in 1987, Woodlawn has lived on the west coast ever since. And she&apos;ll be in London shortly. &quot;It&apos;s all blossomed into this week of Holly Woodlawn. I&apos;ll be busy every day, at parties and shows. Who knows? Hopefully I&apos;ll come home with a whole bra-full of money!&quot; &apos;I was worried that she might be a diva&apos; Sadie Lee on the kiss that led to her Woodlawn paintings The first time I met Holly, I went down on one knee and kissed her hand. I was at a festival in Amsterdam four years ago; she turned up surrounded by about 100 people, with a gold lam\u00e9 dress and fantastic auburn hair, pouting and waving. During a screening of Trash, I stepped out and saw her sitting alone in the bar. She clocked my smart suit and beckoned me over. I bought her a glass of Chardonnay and knelt down. It was a real Hollywood moment. She has been photographed all her adult life. Everybody has always gone for her glamorous, artificial drag-queen side. I wanted to paint her as she is now, without any airbrushing. I worried that she might be a diva, and refuse to be pictured like this. But she said she trusted me. I spent a week in her LA apartment, working intensively. I&apos;d arrive early and put a tape recorder in the middle of the room to record our conversations, just like Warhol used to do. Then we&apos;d break for a drink and a rest. It was just like spending time with an old friend. Holly is a complex person, so I could only ever hope to capture a small part of her. She&apos;s not as strong as she used to be, but she&apos;s not a victim, either. Despite her failing health, she&apos;s proud and dignified. I hope that comes through in the paintings. \u00b7 And Then He Was a She, paintings of Holly Woodlawn by Sadie Lee, is at the Drill Hall, London, from Monday to November 11.

But theclimate is changing. Last week the city announced it was closing down athird of its infamous brothels, and in April, its &quot;coffee shops&quot; were forcedto choose between serving alcohol or dealing in officially-toleratedmarijuana. Most chose the weed, but from next summer the Dutch will ban smoking in all public outlets. How exactly this will affect the wacky baccy trade is unclear, but things will never be the same again in one of the world&apos;s most progressive and tolerant cities. However, it&apos;s not all bad news. You won&apos;t find many locals in the grass emporiums anyhow: most have grown out of those kind of joints (or at least grow their own \u2026). Ask an Amsterdammer and you will find that the city actually has a thriving caf\u00e9 culture to rival anywhere else in Europe. A Dutch caf\u00e9 is more than just a greasy spoon: many serve a delectable variety of beers and liqueurs (for actual coffee, hot and made from beans, you need a koffiehuis by the way); some open until 3am or even later. So take a moment to check out the alternative to the alternative scene. Here&apos;s just 10 to try, but if you hit four of Amsterdam&apos;s caf\u00e9s every night it would take a year to cover them all. Altogether a far more civilized way to blow your mind \u2026 1. Cafe Welling You&apos;ll hear talk of Amsterdam&apos;s &quot;brown caf\u00e9s&quot;, but what are they? Well, aside from the tobacco-stained walls that give them their name, there&apos;s an untranslatable word in Dutch \u2013 gezellig \u2013 meaning cosy, intimate, relaxed. Beloved of concertgoers and a stone&apos;s throw from the museums, you&apos;ll realize from the intellectual hubbub that this one is where Holland&apos;s literary crowd hangs out. Though you&apos;re unlikely to recognize them, it&apos;s predictably adorned with portraits of famed clientele (&quot;most of them are dead, anyway,&quot; admits the barman). \u00b7 J.W.Brouwerstraat 32, behind the Concertgebouwcafewelling.nl/; +31 (0)20 662 01 55 2.

Having graduated from &quot;beer school&quot; in Belgium, the manager Peter van der Arend is now something of a national expert. Oak panelling and bartenders in crisp white aprons add to the rather gentleman&apos;s club-like feel, but watch out - some of the ales on offer pack a head-spinning 10.5% alcohol content.

Brouwerij &apos;t IJ Brouwerij &apos;t IJ is the first name to spring to the lips of Amsterdam&apos;s besandalled beer lovers, and with good reason, since in the bowels of the old grain store sits the city&apos;s most celebrated microbrewery. Zero for d\u00e9cor \u2013 the spartan interior is reminiscent of a school canteen \u2013 but full marks for drinking. And where else in the world can you booze away inside an old windmill?

Wynand Fockink If beer&apos;s not your scene, try jenever, the Dutch answer to vodka or schnapps. Decked out much as it was back in the 17th century, this is as much a museum as a gin joint. And just like &apos;t IJ, call in advance and they&apos;ll show you round the in-house distillery with all the free samples that entails. Before arrival, then, line your stomach with a plateful of Holland&apos;s rather offbeat bar snacks, such as bitterballen, a kind of spherical meat croquette, or Gouda cheese dipped in mustard.  \u00b7 Pilsteeg 31, between Warmoesstraat and Oudezijds Voorburgwalwynand-fockink.nl/en/home.html; +31 (0)20 639 26 95 5.

Part of it has now been shored up with stone, leaving the wooden spiral staircase eerily embedded in the back wall. Aside from the reproduction Rembrandt-era paintings, there&apos;s something of a simian theme \u2013 back in the olden days, sailors returning from their travels tended to abandon unwanted monkeys here (and the barroom itself is cramped enough to show you how it felt to be stuck in one of their cages). \u00b7 Zeedijk 1, facing Centraal Station. +31 (0)20 626 84 01  6.

Moreover, Latei is as much a late-night bric-a-brac store as it is a caf\u00e9, packed to the rafters with Tupperware and junk from fake nylon hair to kitsch tapestries of racehorses to 1980s seven-inch vinyl singles.

De Jaren The art-deco grand caf\u00e9s on Rembrandtplein (such as De Kroon or l&apos;Opera) tend to fill up with lary stag-nighters from Romford these days, so for a touch of class try De Jaren instead. The other side of the coin to the gezellig brown caf\u00e9, its theatrical interior is open, airy and bathed in light \u2013 strangely akin to a modern church or town hall \u2013 and the canal-side terrace affords a picturesque view of the old city. \u00b7 Nieuwe Doelenstraat 20-22, near Muntpleindiningcity.nl/cafedejaren/en/index.html; +31 (0)20 625 57 71 9.

The emphasis on red lighting, black mahogany and sexy glass fittings put it at the other end of the scale to Arendsnest, so expect pricey cocktails rather than down-to-earth ales.

Just how you&apos;d imagine an opium den to be, Rokerij&apos;s carvings and mandalas from the Indian subcontinent give it a pleasingly exotic ambience.

The news that Telecity, that was taken private two years ago and merged with rival Redbus, is further evidence that investor appetite for internet ventures is on the rise.   The company initially floated in the late 1990s raising about \u00a3120m which it spent building massive data centres to host websites and run online applications. Its valuation rocketed to \u00a31bn during the boom, but when the bubble burst the company&apos;s backers 3i and California-based Oak Hill Ventures took Telecity private for about \u00a358m.   3i and Oak Hill Ventures own two-thirds of the merged business with Redbus&apos; three main shareholders controlling all but 10% of the rest of the business. That 10% is split among former employees and management.

It already has 18 across seven European cities.   Chief executive Mike Tobin, who joined Redbus in 2002, admitted that the original data centre market had very little substance as many of the dot.com companies using their facilities had no viable business models.   &quot;There was no real substance, no real business there,&quot; he said. That has changed with the rollout of broadband access and the rise of downloadable content and services such as internet TV.   &quot;The demand drivers today are very different from the lack of demand drivers there was five or six years ago.&quot;   Telecity has clients including Sony, ITN, Ernst &amp; Young and the BBC and reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of \u00a310.3m for the six months to end June on revenues of \u00a346.1m.

The photograph, taken on August 31, caused a media frenzy, with reporters rushing to the Rif mountains in northern Morocco to try to track her down. She was named yesterday as Bushra Binhisa, a five-year-old local girl from a family who have lived on a farm in the region for generations. Clarence Mitchell, the McCanns&apos; family spokesman, said: &quot;Clearly, if these reports that the girl in the photograph isn&apos;t Madeleine are true, it is disappointing news. &quot;This is why Gerry and Kate refused to comment on individual sightings and why I was advising caution overnight.&quot; Doubts over the photograph had been expressed throughout yesterday despite claims by Clara Torres, who took the picture, that &quot;either it&apos;s her [Madeleine], or she&apos;s got a twin sister&quot;. Ms Torres was on holiday with her fiance and family when she shot the photograph, nearly four months after Madeleine went missing. She gave a round of radio and television interviews yesterday, insisting that the girl was Madeleine. After learning last night that it was not, she said: &quot;I did what I had to do. It was not my intention to raise false hopes.&quot; Mr Mitchell had urged caution following a series of previous sightings, all of which have proved to be inaccurate. The latest Moroccan sighting - the fourth in the country - had initially been given greater credibility because it was the first to be accompanied by a photograph. The picture soon appeared in newspapers and on websites around the world and sparked a hunt that led to Bushra&apos;s family home yesterday. Hamid Binhisa, an olive farmer, told the London Evening Standard: &quot;Bushra is my little girl. She is not Madeleine. I do feel sorry for her parents, I hope they find Madeleine. But Bushra is definitely my daughter.&quot; Hafida, the girl&apos;s mother, said: &quot;Even in this remote backwater people have heard of Madeleine McCann.&quot; Family friend Mustafa Hadid said: &quot;We are all shocked that people could think that Bushra was Madeleine. She does have a resemblance but blond and red-haired children are not that rare in this part of Morocco. The people are Berbers and they come from a different stock than people in the south of the country. Bushra&apos;s father is just a farmer, so he would not have read the newspapers.&quot; Portuguese police have received thousands of phone calls since Madeleine disappeared on May 3. Reported sightings have come from Morocco, Spain, France, Switzerland, Belgium, and even Argentina and Guatemala. Portuguese police are understood to be working on the assumption that Madeleine is dead. In June two people were arrested in south-west Spain after what was reported to be an attempt to extract money from the McCanns in return for information about their missing daughter. In the same month, the McCanns were delayed from taking a flight from Berlin to Amsterdam, as part of their hunt across Europe, after a man called claiming to know the whereabouts of Madeleine. In a separate development yesterday, the board of the Find Madeleine campaign approved an extensive advertising campaign appealing once again for information about the missing girl. Esther McVeigh, one of the directors, told the Guardian that the \u00a380,000 spent on the billboard and newspaper advertisement campaign represented the single biggest expenditure of the fund to date. She said that it was likely that the campaign, originally targeted at Spain and Portugal, would be extended to include Morocco, even though the latest sighting appeared not to be Madeleine.", "sentences": ["In the same month, the McCanns were delayed from taking a flight from Berlin to Amsterdam, as part of their hunt across Europe, after a man called claiming to know the whereabouts of Madeleine."], "title": "Spanish tourist's claim of Madeleine sighting in Morocco proves false", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/sep/27/world.ukcrime", "tags": ["UK news", "World news", "Crime", "Morocco"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-09-26T23:22:35Z", "article": "Grande Bretagne: nul points. Fans of the Eurovision Song Contest would have felt at home last week watching Britain pick up no prizes at the European Commission&apos;s e-Government Awards, organised to encourage IT-based efforts to modernise public administration across the EU and beyond. In fact, Britain did better than its lack of silverware (and the domestic reputation of government IT projects) would suggest. We contributed five of the 52 projects selected to exhibit at the EU ministerial e-government conference in Lisbon. Of 20 countries featured, only Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain managed more. Britain&apos;s exhibits covered an impressive spectrum of activities: e-petition services from Downing Street, the South Yorkshire e@SY Connects partnership, IT training for the socially excluded carried out by 6,000 UK Online centres, the city of Newport&apos;s impressively joined-up public service - and direct.gov.uk, heroically destined to replace 688 existing government websites by 2011. Unfortunately, none of Britain&apos;s finalists caught the judges&apos; eyes. Certainly, the five winners each showed a bit of X-factor. The city of Besan\u00e7on, in southeastern France, won its trophy for sustainable efforts to bridge the digital divide by handing out recycled computers and open source software. Amsterdam has reduced the bureaucracy involved in licensing a cafe or restaurant to a single online form. The German government - traditionally a laggard in e-services - picked up the &quot;effective and efficient administration&quot; for its success in automating connections between different arms of government. And Italy&apos;s national online police station was judged &quot;most inspiring good practice&quot; for enabling citizens to file reports online. Britain was in fact the first European country to enable citizens to report crimes online, but the service has now been suspended. This week, the UK police portal displays the sad message: &quot;Not available at present. Please contact your local force&quot;. The project that really knocks the UK in to the second division, however, is from Norway - a self-service web portal called Mypage which not only allows citizens to carry out transactions across government, but also to inspect what data official bodies hold on them.  Britain, in theory, is moving in the same direction. Gillian Merron, Cabinet Office minister in charge of e-government, told the Lisbon event of plans to develop a single sign-on service which will notify all relevant official offices when we move house, change jobs or suffer a bereavement. That concept, a holy grail of e-government for the past 10 years, now has new impetus thanks to the Treasury&apos;s enthusiasm for centralising IT systems. It will almost certainly be based on the Government Gateway, an authentication and secure messaging service built by the old Office of the e-Envoy. Presumably the ID card will also have a role - Merron made a point of praising efforts by Austria and Belgium to introduce multi-purpose chip-cards that act as authentication tokens to government services. What&apos;s missing from the British scheme for one-stop government is any acknowledgement of, let alone enthusiasm for, citizens&apos; rights to see what information the system holds on us. A wander around the e-government exhibits in Lisbon last week showed how seriously this right is taken elsewhere in Europe. If Gordon Brown&apos;s government is serious about a renewing the relationship between the government and the people, it should follow this example. \u00b7 If you&apos;d like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["Amsterdam has reduced the bureaucracy involved in licensing a cafe or restaurant to a single online form."], "title": "Michael Cross: British e-government fails to achieve the X-Factor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/sep/27/guardianweeklytechnologysection.comment3", "tags": ["Technology", "Politics and technology", "Politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-09-27T22:58:32Z", "article": "Sir John Parker, chairman of National Grid, and Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian steel billionaire, are to become non-executive directors of EADS, Airbus&apos;s parent group, in a radical shake-up of the supervisory board that could see representatives from China and Dubai joining.

They have not been shown. They have not been told. Today they may stand on Waterloo bridge, look east and see a city that has been familiar to them all their lives. Tomorrow they will see something completely different, thanks to their mayor, Ken Livingstone. On my estimate 20 towers each more than 300ft high are planned, or proposed, to rise within half a mile of the Thames in inner London, with another 20 situated at random further back. Towers will be visible from every open space and down every street. The horizontal skyline of the capital will be transformed into a series of point blocks set in piazzas, shrinking the scale of what has always been essentially a street-based, intimate urban landscape. Downstream of Waterloo bridge the view will be dominated by a 43-storey tower of flats opposite the Temple, approved over the summer, immediately behind the National Theatre on the South Bank. Dwarfing even the 440ft wheel of the London Eye, this building will thrust itself into every London vista from the Embankment and the Thames bridges to Trafalgar Square and St James&apos;s Park. I have yet to meet anyone aware of its coming. It is of no published architectural quality and serves no public or ceremonial purpose. It is just a block of flats. Beyond it will rise a visual wall of glass skyscrapers along the river&apos;s south bank, two at Blackfriars, another behind Tate Modern, a higher King&apos;s Reach tower at London Bridge and at Bermondsey the 1,000ft &quot;glass shard&quot;, taller even than the highest structure at Canary Wharf. Behind this wall on the curve of the river will be the new City of London. The box-like blocks of the 1980s will be overwhelmed by a forest of &quot;shape architecture&quot;, parodies of Norman Foster&apos;s Gherkin by designers eager to impress the ever pliable City planners. There will be the 1,000ft &quot;Helter-skelter&quot;, the &quot;Cheesegrater&quot;, the &quot;Pinnacle&quot; and the &quot;Walkie-Talkie&quot;. These children&apos;s toy pastiches will be accompanied by banal Mies van der Rohe copies such as the Heron Tower. There has been no public debate or consultation on any of this. There is no vision or declared ideal of how new and old should marry in the future city. It will just happen because no authority has the guts to set individual developments in any wider context. The view upstream from Waterloo bridge will be no less extraordinary. At Vauxhall, opposite Tate Britain, the 50 storeys of Vauxhall Tower are about to rise, luxury flats approved by John Prescott against the pleas of local council, residents and planners, and against his own inspector. Rumour has it that Prescott wanted to rile his officials to show he was boss. No evidence justifying Prescott&apos;s decision has ever been published. His tower will be joined in a cluster by three others of similar height. These are not communities but urban fortresses, worse than anything inflicted on London in the 60s or 70s. Back from the river will be other blocks, each dominating its neighbourhood without regard for sightlines or area conservation. Two towers will loom over Waterloo station, and another over Elephant and Castle. Two towers are to rise over Victoria station, at one point rumoured to be of 50 storeys, dwarfing Belgravia and Pimlico and crushing the view of the Palace of Westminster from Waterloo bridge. A 43-storey giant is planned at Paddington Basin, disregarding the zoning that has so far held that development to medium height. Towers are also proposed for Chelsea Harbour, Warwick Road (the &quot;Tesco Tower&quot;) and Islington. Tony Blair gave Livingstone power to overrule any local opposition to these structures, including from London boroughs. While the mayor may consult local opinion, like a good neo-Blairite he can give himself permission to disregard it. The effect will be to render the banks of the Thames a wall of glass. Richard Rogers, Livingstone&apos;s partisan adviser (with a mighty slab by the river at Battersea), professed to want a &quot;string of pearls&quot; along the water. Moscow&apos;s Yuri Luzhkov, no less ambitious a building mayor than Livingstone, has some respect for his city&apos;s style and heritage. Livingstone and Rogers are erecting merely a wall of profit. They have no truck with streets or diverse neighbourhoods, which lack the architectural prominence of towers. Such riverside enclaves as Hays Wharf, Borough Market and the Globe will become huddled oases, rendered out of place and thus easier for future generations to eliminate. None of this is planned. It is urban anarchy. Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, even capitalist New York, have published policies on high buildings, with bans, height limits and zoning regulations. There are no towers in Greenwich Village or SoHo, and none in the historic quarters of other European cities. The closest parallel to what is happening to London is Shanghai and various banana republics, to which the mayor&apos;s office bears more than a passing resemblance. London&apos;s old zoning was cursed by the way central government overruled it whenever it chose. Hence Macmillan was lobbied by Conrad Hilton and Royal Dutch Shell and allowed towers to intrude on Hyde Park and to dominate the South Bank. But at least there were rules. Today London is the only developed city in the world that has none. The mayor&apos;s published policy states that he will allow high buildings &quot;where appropriate&quot;, unspecified. The reality is that a private citizen must adhere to restrictions on his windows, basements or skylights, but a developer with a deep pocket and access to Livingstone can potentially build anything he likes. This is utterly corrupt. The response from architects grovelling for the fame of a tower in their CVs is that they are &quot;only obeying orders&quot; from clients, and that tall buildings are &quot;the future&quot;. Such cliches are code for money, and would never be used if similar anarchy were to be visited on these architects&apos; backyards. One of the many ironies of Livingstone&apos;s policy is that he and his lobbyists boast of London&apos;s commercial attraction as depending on just the conservation-based urban texture to which he is opposed. Livingstone&apos;s forebears at County Hall used his arguments to try to demolish Covent Garden and Soho, as he has demolished Bishopsgate. It is conservation, not skyscrapers, that holds the key to London&apos;s future economic vigour. The mayor sometimes claims, ludicrously, that his towers are about &quot;affordable housing&quot;. Angry at Islington rejecting a 40-storey monstrosity that he wants in City Road, he claims it is for &quot;London&apos;s poorest citizens&quot;. Apart from the bribe of a few cheap flats (which never stay affordable for long), these towers are never for the poor. They are extravagant constructions requiring astronomical rents because above 300ft a third of their volume must go on services. That is why office skyscrapers are so hard to let, and why backing for the Bermondsey shard has recently collapsed. Livingstone&apos;s towers answer to his curious edifice complex. They are for the rich and he knows it. He just cannot kick the habit, familiar to lapsed leftwingers, of loving those with money. I suspect that even the rich, when they see what he has done to their city, will hate him for it. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, even capitalist New York, have published policies on high buildings, with bans, height limits and zoning regulations."], "title": "Simon Jenkins: Size is everything to a mayor consumed by edifice complex", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/28/communities.comment", "tags": ["Society", "Communities", "UK news", "Local politics", "Politics", "London politics", "London elections 2008", "Ken Livingstone", "London"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-09-29T22:56:58Z", "article": "Nature&apos;s Engraver: A Life of Thomas Bewick, by Jenny Uglow (Faber, \u00a39.99) Horace Walpole dismissed wood engravings as &quot;slovenly stamps&quot;. But, according to Jenny Uglow, Thomas Bewick&apos;s fingers could coax &quot;images of haunting depth and subtlety&quot; out of a block of boxwood. Born in 1753 into a family of Northumberland tenant farmers, he was a rough, clumsy lad who hated school but loved drawing and nature. As an adult, the no-nonsense Bewick rejected copper for the &quot;plebeian craft&quot; of wood engraving. His jewel-like vignettes of rural life captured a countryside threatened by the industrial revolution and urbanisation. Bewick&apos;s art is rooted in the valley of the Tyne but, as Uglow says, is universal. His tailpieces (which filled space at the end of pages) are miniature masterpieces: beautifully observed and full of humour. A squirrel pauses on a branch and looks as if it is about to leap off the page; a piglet dashing across the grass is brought up short by its own reflection in a bell jar; a black crow studiously ignores a scarecrow sporting a three-cornered hat. A superb biography, written with as much sensitivity and attention to detail as one of Bewick&apos;s woodcuts. PD Smith  iWoz: The Autobiography of the Man Who Started the Computer Revolution, by Steve Wozniak with Gina Smith (Headline Review, \u00a38.99) History was made on June 29 1975. It was the first time that someone typed a character on a keyboard and saw it appear on a computer screen. The person typing was Steve Wozniak and the computer was the Apple I. Before that day, computers didn&apos;t have screens and keyboards; &quot;after Apple I, they all did&quot;. Wozniak was 25 and worked at Hewlett-Packard designing calculators. In what must be one of the worst commercial decisions ever made, HP turned down his revolutionary home computer. Instead, Wozniak set up Apple, together with 21-year-old Steve Jobs. Their first order was worth $50,000, twice Wozniak&apos;s salary at HP. From his nerdy boyhood to the chip-by-chip account of designing the first low-cost computer (the Apple II), Wozniak&apos;s autobiography is amusing and very readable. He clearly feels he needs to set the record straight: he didn&apos;t engineer the first Apple computers (Apples I and II) with Jobs: &quot;I did them alone.&quot; So there. iWoz also has some valuable advice for budding engineers: believe in yourself and work alone. The Apple III was designed by committee, which is why (says Wozniak) it failed commercially. PDS Good and Bad Power: The Ideals and Betrayals of Government, by Geoff Mulgan (Penguin, \u00a39.99) It is a political truism that you need to read books to be a good leader but good leaders don&apos;t have time to read. For most of his tenure as prime minister, Tony Blair had Geoff Mulgan as his head of policy, and he has certainly read a book or two. The result is this blisteringly good examination of, well, the history of government and the current state of government throughout the world. Mulgan is clearly some kind of genius who knows the answers to all the big questions: about how we govern, and are governed; how revolutions come about; what people want from their governments; about distribution of wealth; about good government being that which gets to &quot;transcend the base realities&quot; and succour our souls. He really should be ruling the world. But I suppose sharing his secrets, gleaned both from first-hand experience of government and from reading writers, philosophers and politicians across millennia and continents in such a brilliantly erudite way will do. Isn&apos;t it annoying, though, that there are people on the policy frontline who know all this stuff and yet still the trains don&apos;t run on time?  Nicola Barr The Beautiful Fall: Fashion, Genius and Glorious Excess in 1970s Paris, by Alicia Drake (Bloomsbury, \u00a38.99) &quot;Elegance,&quot; said a teenage Yves Saint Laurent, &quot;is a dress too dazzling to wear twice.&quot; It was on the attainment of such fabulousness that Saint Laurent and his sometime friend and rival Karl Lagerfeld based their careers - nay their very lives. Drake&apos;s book takes us through those careers, through 1970s Paris at its taste-obsessed, hedonistic best - or worst. There are wonderfully heady descriptions of Saint Laurent&apos;s garments giving women &quot;the confidence of men&quot;, alongside hilariously terrifying depictions of some of the most beautiful women in the world walking backwards out of rooms to prevent him catching a rear view. Drake is good, too, at bursting the bubble, describing Lagerfeld careering around St Tropez on a moped in hotpants and a string of pearls, and seeing how his exquisite &quot;taste&quot; must have looked to those outside of fashion. It is all good fun, but as the party draws to a close with the arrival of Aids in the early 1980s, the image-obsession, abusive boyfriends, multiple lovers and desperate hangers-on grow as tiresome as they are tired, and it feels a bit too much of an effort to care for such dreadful fashion &quot;victims&quot;. NB Nobody&apos;s Home, by Dubravka Ugresic, translated by Ellen Elias-Bursac (Telegram, \u00a39.99) At first I was wary of the delicacy and quietness of Ugresic&apos;s style in these short essays and sequences on exile, mobility, migration, being there and being somewhere else, often at the same time. Her style isn&apos;t quite fey, it&apos;s too robust for that: more miniature - tiny details peered at close up. But it grew on me, because her details are so very good: her fear of the dominant ficus plant in former Yugoslavia; her near-contraband purchases in Berlin; precise flavours from behind the-iron-curtain-as-was, including an archaic can of zgushchenka, Soviet-era Russian condensed milk that could be spread like jam. It is not all ostalgia for the former east&apos;s vanished parallel consumer world. She is just as exact on the meaning of the Vietnamese nail parlour in present-day New York, and on Amsterdam: its trees, its migrants who smuggle parrots and wash the dead for a living. I happened to read the Amsterdam sequence in exactly the picture-windowed, venerable Dutch cafe she wrote about, and felt dizzy as her description of the city overlapped and then overlaid the city outside the glass.

The original King of the Jungle Johnny Weissmuller was born in what is now Romania, but his family moved to the United States when he was a baby. By the time he was 25, he had become the first man to retain the Olympic 100metres freestyle title. The swimmer won two other golds in 1924 and one in 1928, and set 28 world records, but real stardom still awaited. In 1932, he took the title role in Tarzan the Ape Man - after writer Edgar Rice Burroughs&apos;s original choice, Herman Brix, broke his shoulder. Weissmuller played the role of Lord of the Apes in 11 more films and was pictured on the iconic cover of the Beatles&apos; Sgt Pepper album. He died in 1984 and, at his request, his trademark Tarzan cry was played three times as his coffin was lowered into the grave. 2. The Rock needs his Mummy Dwayne Johnson (you can see why he changed his name) would have been an NFL player but for injury. Instead, he took to wrestling and tried out several monikers before settling on The Rock. You&apos;d think that WWE, with its costumes, pantomime action and bitter feuds, would be the perfect nursery for Hollywood. Hulk Hogan dashed that theory in The Nanny. But, although The Rock&apos;s roles in The Mummy Returns and The Scorpion King weren&apos;t going to win him a place at RADA, he still made the highest-paid acting debut in history. 3. Fair cop for Bubba A Super Bowl winner with the Baltimore Colts in 1970, Bubba Smith was known for his considerable size. Following his retirement from the NFL, Smith moved into TV and film, appearing in such shows as Wonder Woman and Charlie&apos;s Angels. It was his bulk- standing 6ft 7in and weighing more than 18 stone - that enabled Smith to gain his greatest role to date, as the softly spoken florist-turned-police officer Moses Hightower in Police Academy (he appeared in all but one of the six sequels). He&apos;s still acting, with low-budget horror flick Blood River on the way. Be afraid. 4. Esther Williams, pool beauty The Californian was a champion breaststroke and freestyle swimmer, whose Olympic hopes were dashed when war forced the cancellation of the 1940 Games in Tokyo. Williams&apos;s appearance lent itself to showbiz and she was hired to appear alongside Weissmuller, who pursued her off-stage, in The Aquacade, a pool-based musical revue. This led to a prolific movie career that began with Double Life alongside Mickey Rooney in 1942. Williams broke her neck diving off a tower while filming Million Dollar Mermaid in 1952 but recovered and now gives her name to a line of swimming pools. She is 86. 5. Nicole Kidman&apos;s other half When taekwondo was first introduced as an Olympic sport at the Seoul Games in 1988, Dana Hee took the women&apos;s lightweight gold (although we doubt anyone dared call her lightweight to her face). After a brief career as a model and an extra, Hee put her martial-arts expertise to use, becoming an award-winning stuntwoman in films such as Terminator 3 and Mortal Kombat. She is also Nicole Kidman&apos;s personal stunt double and, at 45, remains one of the industry&apos;s top daredevils. With the unfortunate nickname, Heewoman. 6. Jim Brown makes it into the Dirty Dozen The former Cleveland Browns running back is considered by some to be American football&apos;s greatest player. Brown had made his acting debut in Rio Conchos in 1964 while still playing, but the film that launched him was The Dirty Dozen in 1967. He still acts occasionally and appeared in The Running Man, with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Mars Attacks. 7. California belongs to Arnie Is bodybuilding a sport? We probably wouldn&apos;t ask Schwarzenegger - aka Conan the Barbarian - that, even at this distance. Some say that the five-time Mr Universe has never stopped playing himself since doing just that in the 1977 documentary Pumping Iron, but in The Terminator he created one of modern film&apos;s most memorable roles. 8. Carl Weathers comes back from the dead. Almost The former Oakland Raiders linebacker went from villain to hero in the Rocky series as his Apollo Creed character changed from the eponymous boxer&apos;s rival to his coach and friend. When Sylvester Stallone asked to use footage of him from earlier films in last year&apos;s Rocky Balboa, Weathers declined unless he was given a part in the latest instalment. Unfortunately, Creed had been killed in Rocky IV and Stallone refused. Weathers did, however, work for the US military last year, as an acting coach for 350 Arab-Americans who were playing the part of insurgents in a dummy Iraqi village at a GI training camp in the California desert. 9. Herman Brix: third time lucky Shot-putter Brix just missed out on gold at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam - fellow American John Kuck beat him by four-and-a-half inches - then in 1931 he lost the starring role in the first talkie Tarzan movie. Making his movie debut in American football film Touchdown, Brix broke his shoulder, ruling him out of the 1932 Olympics and further medal glory. Typecast as a strongman (including, eventually, Tarzan) and refused serious roles, Brix left Hollywood in 1938, changed his name to Bruce Bennett, and returned to launch a 20-year movie career that included acting alongside Humphrey Bogart in Sahara and Joan Crawford in Mildred Pierce. Brix continued to parasail and skydive well into his nineties, and died earlier this year at the age of 100. 10. C Aubrey Smith takes the walk of fame As a fast bowler for Sussex, Charles Aubrey Smith was known for an unusual run-up that earned him the nickname &apos;Round the Corner&apos;. He played only one Test - against South Africa in 1889 - but captained England to victory, taking five for 19. He was 50 when his Hollywood career blossomed, typecast as a stiff-mustachioed upper-class Englishman. When not on screen with Elizabeth Taylor (Little Women) or Ralph Richardson (The Four Feathers), he starred with Boris Karloff and David Niven on the field, as a founder of the Hollywood Cricket Club. He was knighted in 1944, four years before his death.", "sentences": ["Herman Brix: third time lucky Shot-putter Brix just missed out on gold at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam - fellow American John Kuck beat him by four-and-a-half inches - then in 1931 he lost the starring role in the first talkie Tarzan movie."], "title": "October's ten", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/30/features.sport1", "tags": ["Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-09-30T00:04:47Z", "article": "There&apos;s a Riot Going On: Revolutionaries, Rock Stars, and the Rise and Fall of &apos;60s Counterculture by Peter Doggett  Canongate \u00a325, pp598 Stand by for the avalanche of books, articles, films and reprints that will make the 30th anniversary of insurgent 1968 feel like yesterday. For some of us - but not all. Remember, those of you who hoped you&apos;d die before you got old, that there is a generation for whom 1968 is history, something their parents recall with nostalgia, ambivalence, horror or embarrassment and to whom the forthcoming retrospectives might impart fresh ideas. Moreover, a lot has happened since the 30th anniversary of 1968 that warrants more than a glance over the shoulder on the 40th. There are cautionary lessons or inspiration to our postmodern world of cacophonous and vacuous politics with its supposed &apos;counterculture&apos; as mass marketplace. There have been riots across France. The western culture that inspired insurrection against communism during 1968 has mutated into a phantasmagoria that engulfs, rather than liberates, eastern Europe. Conversely, a youth movement across Latin America draws more than ever on communist icons of 1968. Only a fool could fail to hear terrifying echoes of Vietnam - and worse - in the catastrophe of Britain&apos;s and America&apos;s enterprise in Iraq. Most recollections of 1968 are already appearing in Europe, to mark uprisings in Paris, Prague, Berlin and Rome. Leaders of insurrection in France, Daniel Cohn-Bendit and Alain Krivine, published new books this year. From Germany come books about Rudi Dutschke and the flamboyant Fritz Teufel and his &apos;Kommune Einz&apos;. Antonio Negri, mastermind of insurgency in Italy, has never stopped writing from prison or since his release in 2003. In the US, Tom Hayden&apos;s new book is about Ending the War In Iraq. A paperback edition of the late Abbie Hoffman&apos;s Revolution for the Hell of It came out last year. The British book market is quieter, perhaps because Tariq Ali has recalled 1968 so many times, but probably because no First World country has quite so thoroughly negated the spirit of 1968 as Britain. So this account of seven years&apos; rebellion, with 1968 at its core, comes from Peter Doggett, who once wrote an acclaimed book about country music. It is an estimable cuttings job, an encyclopaedic narrative of the revolutionary movements in Britain and America and their uneasy relationship with rock musicians who gave them voice. Doggett collates every tremor within the hippie and yippie movements and their every counterpoint with the great voices of the age: Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Mick Jagger (ad nauseam), plus less celebrated greats such as Phil Ochs, Nina Simone, Steppenwolf and Country Joe MacDonald. Doggett is equally dogged in chronicling the black American revolutionary movement and the fault lines between black and white student insurrection. He is as intolerant of the revolutionaries&apos; expectation that musicians be at the service of the cause as he is of the superstars&apos; dabbling with revolution, singing its anthems then trooping off to the bank. His book&apos;s soundest achievement is to prepare us for the world in which, with few laudable exceptions, popular music has now abrogated any social responsibility beyond bulimic posturing in Hyde Park. This account is an early demonstration of capitalism&apos;s genius at absorbing its critics as lucrative commodities. &apos;The revolution will not be televised,&apos; sang Gil Scott-Heron, recalls Doggett. No, it will be downloaded on to an iPod while television shows Celebrity Big Brother In this tumultuous narrative, I plead guilty to being someone who went to Chicago aged 16, convinced that the revolution was imminent (we all make mistakes). The place was teeming and turbulent, frightening and electrifying. So it is gratifying to find Chicago at the kernel of this book, as it was of the Sixties&apos; rebellion in America: the convergence and riots of August 1968 (after all that dancing about in parks during the 1967 Summer of Love) and the Chicago conspiracy trials the following year, meticulously reconstructed. But this book fails to capture what the rebellion felt like. It captures the self-indulgence of the players, but misses the squalor, pastiche, playfulness and feeling of subversive empowerment that I, for one, would want to impart to a generation raised on Blair, Berlusconi, Bush and Bill Gates. I don&apos;t recognise the Chicago I remember in a book that contains few adjectives, little passion and no laughs, not even when Country Joe and Judy Collins sing protest songs from the witness box in Chicago. More seriously, these omissions deny the book its claim to be about &apos;the rise and fall of Sixties counterculture&apos;. English may be the lingua franca of rock, but not of &apos;revolutionaries&apos; and Sixties counterculture - not by a long way - and Doggett&apos;s book is disastrously uninterested in Europe, where the most potent rebellions occurred. Even funky Amsterdam - San Francisco East and countercultural hub, with its Dam Square and white bikes - hardly gets a look-in. France was brought to the brink of revolution in 1968 by one of two instances of unison between students and workers (the other being Czechoslovakia). One poster in my possession features the greatest image to come out of 1968 anywhere: un mec in a hard hat clutching a red flag with one arm and a girl in the other, whom he passionately kisses behind a barricade, under a slogan reading: &apos;Plus je fais la revolution, plus je veux faire l&apos;amour. Plus je fais l&apos;amour, plus je veux faire la revolution.&apos; We all wanted to be him, for sure. Yet Doggett&apos;s book deals with these extraordinary evenements as a flash-in-the-pan in fewer paragraphs than he lavishes on the tiniest tiff within the Black Panthers or Jagger&apos;s affairs, mentioning neither Jean-Paul Sartre, Cohn-Bendit, nor any other architect of a very close shave for the Fifth Republic. In Germany, 1968 was serious because a younger generation was having to ask: &apos;What did you do in the war, Daddy?&apos; Out of the ensuing uprisings guided by Rudi Dutschke and &apos;Kommune Einz&apos; came the Baader-Meinhof group and its shocking armed campaign against the post-Nazi state, but, long-term, the generation of Joschka Fischer had to reckon with Nazism to create modern German democracy. But there is not a single acknowledgement of any of this in Doggett&apos;s book. The situation was similar in Italy, where insurgencies of 1968 morphed into a war of attrition between revolutionary and neo-fascist violence and thence the Red Brigades. It was a Cold War made flesh in western Europe and a compelling situation in which, as in France, a strong Communist party found itself caught at odds with a teeming counterculture. Doggett omits Italy. As he does Greece, Spain and Portugal, where the counterculture of 1968 lined up face to face with fascist military dictatorships. And yet this narrative, potentially interesting to readers now heading off to what they might think of as the Costa del Vodkapop (Spain - a fascist dictatorship? When?) is again missing. Above all, there is the one revolution in 1968 that did actually achieve something epic, lasting and irrevocable. There are still a few on the political left who prefer to forget that there was a classic revolution in their lifetime, whether via the street battlefield of Bucharest, the &apos;Velvet&apos; transition in Czechoslovakia or the Solidarity strikes in Katowice and Gdansk. The revolutions that swept the Warsaw Pact countries between 1989 and 1991 happened for a mosaic of reasons, but all had their roots in the Prague Spring of 1968. Prague 1968 was a remarkable mix of counterculture and official government policy, whereby the Czech underground supported Alexander Dubcek and his reforms in defiance of Moscow. Perhaps Doggett ignores Berlin, Rome and Athens (and gallops through Paris) because, as he says, these revolts did not have a &apos;rock culture&apos;. But in the case of Prague, once the Soviet tanks rolled in and Dubcek&apos;s &apos;Spring&apos; was crushed, the entire counterculture formed around, and was led by, a rock ensemble after they were banned from performing publicly in 1970. Indeed, the story of Vaclav Havel and the Plastic People of the Universe would seem to be exactly what Doggett&apos;s book craves: a rock band that came out of a revolution and all but maintained it underground until fruition 19 years later. One has to see Tom Stoppard&apos;s Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll to savour that story. Before getting too harsh, I would urge anyone under 30 to read this book, if only to know how ridiculous 1968 may seem sometimes but how important it was. And, above all, with Iraq in mind, to know that although Colonel Oliver North was a liar and a crook, he was in part right when he said that the Vietnam war was lost at home, on the US campuses. Besides, Doggett is such a tireless trainspotter on platform 1968 that he comes up with gems such as the fact that on the day Charles Manson was ordering the murders of Sharon Tate et al, the Rolling Stones were making a business plan with a Bavarian prince, part of which was a tour comprising the Altamont festival which everyone agrees to be the violent expulsion from the garden of Sixties counterculture. &apos;Street Fighting Man&apos;, indeed. Best of all, though, is a line from Dylan. Pressed to side with the 1968 rebellion, he delivered instead a thought on what many of its figureheads and footsoldiers might be up to in time: &apos;Well, I&apos;m with the students, of course; they&apos;re going to take over the world ... they don&apos;t have to fight, they can sit back and wait.&apos;", "sentences": ["Even funky Amsterdam - San Francisco East and countercultural hub, with its Dam Square and white bikes - hardly gets a look-in."], "title": "Review: There's a Riot Going On by Peter Doggett", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/30/historybooks.features", "tags": ["History", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-01T12:10:32Z", "article": "The Fifa 08 football computer game - which features a digitised version of Wayne Rooney - has drafted in the real life footballer as part of a pan-European advertising campaign.

Rooney does so by getting fellow golfers to try to dispossess him of the ball. A second advert shows Ronaldinho similarly challenged while he presides over a barbecue, while a third sees Miloslav Klose and Bayern Munich player Franck Ribery goaded into proving themselves when the pair are spotted at a tailors. The ad campaign, which runs with the strapline &quot;Can you Fifa 08?&quot;, aims to get across the fact that this version of the game is the most realistic incarnation of the title yet.

Anyone who happened to look up at the university&apos;s ambitious chief executive would see the same. Australians don&apos;t have a history of quitting while they&apos;re ahead. So why has an institution that once modelled itself on Oxford, and was for many years required by law to duplicate that university&apos;s course offerings, decided to escape the British academic shadow under which it has successfully operated for more than a century? &quot;If you are going to make a significant change, it&apos;s best to do it when you are at the top of the game and not have it forced on you,&quot; the soft-spoken Melbourne chief explains. &quot;This is not a decision we took lightly, but having taken it we are determined to do it well.&quot; Certainly, the curriculum reform now in process is no light touch for this Oxford of the South Seas, which is braced for a radical American makeover as part of the biggest change in its 154-year history. Under Davis&apos;s plan, the university has overturned the traditional Australian emphasis on undergraduate degrees. Its student roll is set to fall by as much as 10% as it rolls out a brace of new professional schools, which are scheduled to be fully up and running by 2011. Starting in April, Melbourne will become the first locally established university to adopt the familiar American graduate model, an emphasis likely to prove popular among full-fee-paying international students from Asia, upon whom the university relies for a steeply growing share of its annual A$1.3bn (pounds 560m) operating revenue. This year, for the first time, Melbourne took more Chinese students at the graduate level than undergraduate. At the same time, with the blessing of the Australian federal government, the proportion of its 45,000-strong student body who pay full fees is expected to climb significantly higher than the 35% that has been permitted until now. This is partly because there will be fewer under- graduate students, who receive the bulk of state subsidies. But Melbourne will also enjoy greater latitude than the 38 other Australian universities to set tuition fees for both graduate and undergraduate courses, and these fees are expected to rise. A newly launched Melbourne scholarships programme will invest \u00a343m over the next three years to provide financial and tuition support to 8,000 students expected to be affected by the higher costs. Melbourne model The &quot;Melbourne model&quot; mirrors the recent conversion of some European universities to a similar model: a general undergraduate programme followed by professional graduate courses. In the antipodean case, the period of undergraduate study will remain pegged at three years, although the number of degrees at that level is to shrink from its earlier tally of 96 to just six broader choices: the arts, biomedicine, commerce, environment, music or science. Elsewhere, other newfound American touches are growing like ivy across the downtown campus. The university has just appointed the country&apos;s first provost, Peter McPhee. Departmental heads will report to him rather than directly to the vice-chancellor. Many of its new professional degrees look like American imports. Among the recently established offerings are a Master of Teaching, a first for the country and one inspired by the &quot;teachers for a new era&quot; initiative currently being implemented across a number of American universities, and the Juris Doctor, the familiar US professional law degree. &quot;Instead of just resting on his laurels, as I expect a lot of vice chancellors might do in his happy position, Glyn Davis has spent the capital of being the top university in Australia doing what he thinks is right in principle,&quot; says James Hathaway, the head of Melbourne&apos;s new Graduate School of Law and one of several North American scholars who have been named to lead the recently constituted graduate departments. The Melbourne chief &quot;is not someone who has been happy just to affirm the status quo&quot;, continues the law dean, &quot;but instead has said: &apos;You know, we&apos;re powerful enough and strong enough and confident enough to take a chance on doing what&apos;s right.&apos; That&apos;s just gutsy and that&apos;s the kind of person I want to work with, even if that sounds overly sycophantic.&quot; Davis, whose own stateside exposure dates back to his experience in the United States as a Harkness Fellow at Harvard and Berkeley in the 1980s, argues that such moves are needed if any non-American institution is to seriously rival its better-financed counterparts. Melbourne&apos;s current endowment stands at around \u00a3610m, handily above its top regional rivals and on a par with many leading British institutions; Harvard&apos;s institutional bounty, by contrast, stands at \u00a317bn, much of it attracted by the institution&apos;s flourishing graduate schools. &quot;To remain internationally competitive we simply had to move to this model,&quot; the Australian chief insists. But playing American colleges at their own economic game is only part of the rationale. Since taking his current position, in 2004, the vice-chancellor has been doubtful, he says, whether any academic institution has the capacity to impart the depth of knowledge students require over the fleeting course of a three-year degree. He is also sceptical about whether most teenagers have the wherewithal to make their best career choices during their last two years of school. Dwindling school leavers And student demographics are also changing. Like Britain and most other western countries, the average Australian age has been steadily creeping higher while the country&apos;s cohort of school-leavers is dwindling. At the same time, older people are increasingly opting for further professional training. To date, internal criticisms of the moves afoot at Melbourne have remained relatively muted, with some staff unions fretting over &quot;unintended consequences&quot; of the experiment, along with concerns among current students, particularly those in a recently axed creative arts programme, worrying that their options may become more limited. Outside the institution, the university has been charged with refashioning itself as a more &quot;elite&quot; institution, says Davis. &quot;And there have been some small gatherings of people waving placards saying Melbourne is just doing this to make money. &quot;It&apos;s not a terribly coherent thing to respond to because it doesn&apos;t lend itself to any characterisation, but just this general sense that Melbourne is doing it because it can and other universities wouldn&apos;t get away with it.&quot; For their part, other universities, including the universities of Aberdeen and Amsterdam, and University College, Dublin, have dispatched delegations to Melbourne over the past year in order to learn more. Australian institutions, meanwhile, are &quot;watching nervously&quot;, he says. And how nervous is Australia&apos;s most visible transatlantic vice-chancellor? &quot;Only a fool makes changes and doesn&apos;t worry about them - and I worry about them a great deal,&quot; says Davis. &quot;But I&apos;m confident there will be strong demand for what we do and that students who come here will have a great experience.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s not a terribly coherent thing to respond to because it doesn&apos;t lend itself to any characterisation, but just this general sense that Melbourne is doing it because it can and other universities wouldn&apos;t get away with it.&quot; For their part, other universities, including the universities of Aberdeen and Amsterdam, and University College, Dublin, have dispatched delegations to Melbourne over the past year in order to learn more."], "title": "University of Melbourne adopts American graduate model", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/oct/02/internationaleducationnews.highereducation", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-03T14:10:19Z", "article": "Another week, another scandal involving Zdravko Mamic, the executive vice-president of Dinamo Zagreb. It began, as incidents involving Mamic so often do, with a press conference. The particular flashpoint this time came when he was asked about newspaper reports suggesting the club were poised to appoint the Italian Nevio Scala to replace Branko Ivankovic. Now any logic other than football logic would suggest the stories are nonsensical. Ivankovic replaced Josip Kuze as coach in September 2006, and led them to the double without losing a game. This season, although the unbeaten record has gone, Dinamo are seven points clear at the top of the Croatian league having taken 27 points from 10 games. Ivankovic is hugely popular with the fans. Then again, Kuze had just won a title and was also popular, and he was jettisoned for his failings in Europe, a defeat to Arsenal in the third qualifying round of the Champions League was followed by a defeat to Auxerre in the Uefa Cup. This season Dinamo lost an epic to Werder Bremen in the third qualifying round of the Champions League and were unfortunate to draw Ajax in the first round of the Uefa Cup. They lost the first leg at the Maksimir 1-0, so unless something remarkable happens in Amsterdam on Thursday, Dinamo will be in exactly the same position they were last season when Ivankovic was appointed. And when investment from Milan Bandic, the mayor of Zagreb, has made the league all but a walkover, Europe becomes the only measure of success. Mamic could simply have denied the rumours about Scala. He could simply have said that Ivankovic&apos;s position is safe and that this season&apos;s European failure is down to an unfortunate draw. Initially, that is what he did, albeit in his characteristically aggressive way, attacking the newspaper that had printed the story. He then listed Ivankovic&apos;s successes, before lapsing into a foul-mouthed rant against journalists, the media in general, and finally YouTube, ending with the words &quot;I&apos;m going to stick YouTube on my dick&quot;. By Mamic&apos;s standards, this latest indiscretion is small beer. His rise has been both remarkable and remarkably turbulent. Born in Bjelovar near Zagreb in 1959, he was initially a youth player at Dinamo and then, when it turned out he wasn&apos;t good enough, a fan. When he was 15, he started in business, selling Styrofoam cushions outside the Maksimir. His great leap forwards, though, came amid the gangster capitalism of the war years as he made lucrative investments in a forestry company and a drinks manufacturer, before selling his shares to an arms dealer. He has since become an agent, and worked on the transfers that took Bosko Balaban to Aston Villa, Eduardo da Silva to Arsenal and Vedran Corluka to Manchester City. He claims that he and his brother Zoran, who is sporting director at the club, have a combined fortune of around \u00a330m. His career has been swaddled in controversy. He has admitted match-fixing on numerous occasions, was censured by Uefa last season after celebrating Dinamo&apos;s victory over the Lithuanian side Ekranes in the second qualifying round of the Champions League with a Nazi salute, and created a stir earlier this year for an inappropriate advance to a belly-dancer in Azerbaijan. He was suspended from football for life 15 years ago after assaulting a director of the Croatian FA; the ban was swiftly forgotten, and the physical violence has continued. After missing out on the position of sports director, Mamic attacked the former Dinamo director Josip Soic, who only escaped by scaling a fence. He struck the NK Zagreb player Niko Ceka in 1995, and that same year almost knocked down a traffic policeman as the authorities attempted to tow away his illegally parked Jaguar. It took nine years for that case to come to court, by which time the policeman in question had conveniently forgotten the exact details of the incident. In 2003, on crutches after a knee operation, he went to a meeting at the office of Vlasta Pavic, the then-mayor of Zagreb, and was told by Miljenko Mesic, the director of the city planning authority, that his plans for a city-centre skyscraper had been rejected. He set about Mesic with his crutches, and received in return a blow to the head so hard it broke a bone in Mesic&apos;s hand. Mysteriously, no charges were pressed, and planning permission was later granted. Mamic&apos;s favourite target, though, has been the press. The journalist Kristijan Toplaja was forced to flee and hide in some nearby bushes as Mamic took exception to his line of questioning. He hit a journalist from 24 Sata with a salt-cellar, and issued death treats to journalists from Jutarnji List. So why the recent rant against YouTube? The problem with citizen journalism is that citizens tend to say what they think, and much of what has been posted on YouTube about Mamic has not been positive. There have been countless clips of fans calling for his resignation (the presidency, held by Mirko Barisic, is largely an honorific role), some simply abusive, others listing in some details his supposed crimes. For all Dinamo&apos;s recent success, Mamic is widely distrusted. The Bad Blue Boys, the hard-core of the Dinamo fans, have made clear that they feel his frequent outbursts are beginning to undermine the club, and questions are being asked about just how much of the money recouped in transfer fees is being reinvested. In the summer, the Croatian public ombudsman Jurica Malcic sent a letter to the minister of science, education and sport, Dragan Primorac, asking whether Mamic&apos;s position as both an agent and the vice-president of what is, after all, a body still in part publicly funded didn&apos;t represent a conflict of interest. No action has, as yet, been taken, and Mamic has come through worse crises before, but you do wonder how hostile the atmosphere around Dinamo could become if they are, as expected, knocked out of the Uefa Cup on Thursday.", "sentences": ["They lost the first leg at the Maksimir 1-0, so unless something remarkable happens in Amsterdam on Thursday, Dinamo will be in exactly the same position they were last season when Ivankovic was appointed."], "title": "Jonathan Wilson on the life and charms of Zdravko Mamic", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/03/europeanfootball.sport", "tags": ["Football", "European club football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-04T11:36:06Z", "article": "Preamble Morning. England&apos;s NatWest Series win over India was a false dawn, a mirage and a chimera all rolled into one. Discuss. For what it&apos;s worth, I don&apos;t think it was, although I fully expect England to lose again today. Dambulla is just not their kind of pitch: slow, low and requiring batsmen to work the ball around against the spinners in the middle overs. Still, let&apos;s look on the bright side. They keep getting better at this venue. Four years ago, they were all out for 88 in a match forever known as the Bungle in the Jungle. On Monday they made 150. Expect 212 today. Fred update The tabloids are saying that Andrew Flintoff will now miss the Test series in Sri Lanka, which starts on December 1 at Kandy, because of his chronic ankle situation. They have quoted a &quot;team insider&quot; as saying &quot;we are looking anywhere on the planet for help,&quot; which doesn&apos;t sound too promising. Toss and teams But let&apos;s keep spirits up, eh? Because Paul Collingwood has won the toss and England will bat. Both sides are unchanged from Monday&apos;s game (still no Monty, in other words), while Sanath Jayasuriya will make his 400th one-day international appearance. Which is quite staggering. The teams in full England AN Cook, P Mustard, IR Bell, KP Pietersen, PD Collingwood, OA Shah, RS Bopara, GP Swann, SCJ Broad, RJ Sidebottom, JM Anderson  Sri Lanka WU Tharanga, ST Jayasuriya, KC Sangakkara, DPMD Jayawardene, LPC Silva, TM Dilshan, J Mubarak, MF Maharoof, WPUJC Vaas, SL Malinga, CRD Fernando So what now? The average first-innings score here/there is around 200, which puts Sri Lanka&apos;s score of 269 on Monday into rather harsh perspective. Jayasuriya has just told Nick Knight that 230-240 is a winning score, so how will England approach it? I can&apos;t really see Phil Mustard nurdling it around. It could be a day for Ian Bell. In other news, the Sun are reporting that Paul Collingwood after coming across a &quot;deadly cobra snake while returning from training&quot;. Handily, the paper has managed to get hold of an &quot;eyewitness&quot;, who revealed: &quot;Colly said he would like to see a snake and then he saw one right near him! It was massive. It gave them a big shock.&quot; You&apos;ve got to love it. Peter Moores is telling David Lloyd about Fred, but as usual he&apos;s saying nothing more than &quot;we don&apos;t want to make the situation worse&quot;. I wonder how it can get better. There is no guarantee that Flintoff will be fit for the tour of New Zealand in February and March. Even beyond that, who can say whether he will ever play Test cricket again. People keep saying he needs to rest, but if the ankle flares up every time he bowls, a break might simply be postponing the torture. Poor old Fred. An email, and it&apos;s not from Gary Naylor &quot;The one thing I really hope about the Freddie situ is that when (or if) he comes back he doesn&apos;t come straight into the team,&quot; says Ben Hendy. &quot;His performances over the last year have been patchy at best, especially with the bat, added to which he will be a long way short of match fitness. Fingers crossed we&apos;ll have someone who&apos;s made a real impact and can only be dropped if Fred&apos;s truly on top of his game. I have, essentially, lost nearly all faith in the man over the past 12 months, and while some people will say he has nothing to prove, I feel that if he wants his place in the squad back he has everything to prove...&quot; Anyway the game will get under way in five minutes, so enough tittle-tattle. Eyes down. Concentrate. 1st over: England 1-0 (Cook 1, Mustard 0) Chaminda Vaas gets things going against Alastair Cook and there are shades of Zaheer Khan about the way he cuts Cook in two with his third delivery. That could have bowled him; it could have taken the inside edge. It did neither and Cook survives. I must say, this 50-over lark is very relaxing after the madness of Twenty20. Why, I&apos;ve even got time to tell you that Cook got off the mark with a single to midwicket. &quot;Two surprises,&quot; exclaims John Starbuck. &quot;They&apos;ve not dropped Cook yet, and why not two spinners on this pitch? How is Monty ever going to develop variety except by playing in optimum conditions? On second thoughts, it&apos;s not really surprising, is it? Given recent selection policies, what would be a surprise?&quot; Don&apos;t agree with you about Cook. It wasn&apos;t long ago he was hitting a hundred against India, and he did top-score on Monday, even if that wasn&apos;t much of a feat in a total of 150. Agree on Monty. No one, including Monty himself, seems sure what his one-day role is: container or wicket-taker? 2nd over: England 1-0 (Cook 1, Mustard 0) It&apos;s Lasith Malinga at the other end, which is usually the cue for commentators to wonder how on earth he is so accurate with a slingy action like that. I wonder how he is so accurate etc etc. Cook is just feeling his way into the match right now, and with another 48 overs to go, who can blame him? A maiden. &quot;Am I opening myself up to being sectioned by admitting optimism about England&apos;s chances today?&quot; wonders...Gary Naylor! &quot;With acclimatisation periods ridiculously brief, it&apos;s very hard for any touring team to hit the ground running, so I almost write off the first match of an away series. Surely England will play better this time around and use their deepest batting line-up in living memory more effectively? And surely a journeyman like Maharoof has had his day with the ball? England to get 250 and squeeze a win.&quot; WICKET! Cook c Jayawardene b Vaas 1 (2-1) Cook&apos;s torment against Asian left-armers continues as he nibbles at one that didn&apos;t come back into him as he expected and is very well caught at first slip by Mahela Jayawardene, diving to his right. Ah. 3rd over: England 4-1 (Mustard 1, Bell 2) This is a big innings for Bell. He was England&apos;s player of the series against India and said he felt he had turned a corner. And for once it did not feel like the sportsman&apos;s hyperbole. But he made a nine-ball duck on Monday and could do with some runs here to underline the progress he made over the summer. He uses his feet to his second ball, from Vaas, and collects two past backward point, which at least shows intent. A slow, painful start, this. 4th over: England 9-1 (Mustard 2, Bell 6) Phil Mustard finally gets a mention courtesy of a slash to third man for a single off Malinga, and then Bell plays the first classy shot of the day, easing a near-half-volley through extra-cover for four. Glorious. &quot;I&apos;m not sure what Ben Hendy is banaging on about but over the last 12 months the boy Fred has been our most consistent and effective bowler, even with the use of only one leg,&quot; seethes Adrian Bell. &quot;We simply don&apos;t have anyone else who can bring Fred&apos;s level of control to our bowling attack, but I guess since he doesn&apos;t meet with Mr Hendy&apos;s approval we should keep him out of the team. Anyway I&apos;m sure Monty could take over Fred&apos;s place when bowling at the death.&quot; Sarcasm is the lowest form of etc. 5th over: England 10-1 (Mustard 3, Bell 6) Mustard is yet to explode and picks up another gentle single, this time into the covers off Vaas. But England have got off to the diametric opposite of a flyer here and now Bell is dropped at slip by Jayawardene. It was low but very catchable and the captain is furious. Lucky Belly. &quot;Whilst bumbling around Holborn yesterday morning, I bumped into the gargantuan man-mountain that is Darrell Hair,&quot; says Luke Dealtry. &quot;He is vast (yes, italics vast) - vast in the sort of way that made me remember what adults looked like when I was but a four-year-old midget. So vast is he, in fact, that I stopped and gawped at him in a way I would normally reserve for motorway pile-ups and people being sick on the street. He didn&apos;t look very happy. That is all.&quot; 6th over: England 19-1 (Mustard 4, Bell 14) Another single for Mustard, who daren&apos;t go over the top. Which makes you wonder why he&apos;s opening the innings. And then Bell plays another shot of true class, hanging back in his crease and crashing Malinga through cover off the back foot for four. He&apos;s looking good, and even picks - just about - Malinga&apos;s slower ball. And then, four more: this time through extra off the back foot. &quot;Over the past week I have been indulging in a little nostalgia by watching my 2005 Ashes DVD,&quot; says Oliver Gardner. &quot;I&apos;m still amazed by just how good Fred (and Harmless, for that matter) was then and I can therefore see why England persist with him. The unfortunate thing that we&apos;re all going to have to take is that Fred is almost certainly never going to play international cricket again, let alone at that sort of level. The sooner we can all accept that, the sooner we can pin all our hopes on Adil Rashid, ruining his career in the process.&quot; 7th over: England 25-1 (Mustard 6, Bell 18) Technical problems preclude me from waxing too lyrical about that over, the highlight of which was a neat clip off his pads for three by Bell off Vaas. &quot;Surely if Maharoof has had his day (Gary Naylor over 2), then England have no hope given a team built around Swann, Sidebottom and Shah and led by the journeyman&apos;s journeyman, Paul Collingwood,&quot; snorts John Dalby. WICKET! Bell lbw b Maharoof 18 (25-2) Farveez Maharoof does not take long to rediscover the form that brought him four wickets on Monday, nipping his second ball back into Bell&apos;s pads and striking him plumb in front. That would have hit middle. 8th over: England 26-2 (Mustard 6, Pietersen 0) This game already has a horrible feel to it from a blinkered English perspective. 9th over: England 26-2 (Mustard 6, Pietersen 0) Another wicket now and England might not make as many as they did on Monday. Kumar Sangakkara keeps up the pressure by standing up to Vaas, although that might have as much to do with getting inside the head of Kevin Pietersen as any lack of pace in the pitch. Smart thinking. Poor old Mustard has barely got into the game yet: he&apos;s faced 12 of the first 54 balls of the innings. Meanwhile, my colleague David Hopps writes in from the Dambulla press box. &quot;interesting that if we surveyed everyone who has been to sri lanka with red dot in 5 years we would find that maybe 100 people had seen a harmless rat snake and one at most had heard about someone seeing a cobra. yet send an england cricket team and a few journos to sri lanka and within five minutes the country is suppisedly awash with cobras. since when did paul collingwood become an expert on snakes of sri lanka?&quot; 10th over: England 29-2 (Mustard 7, Pietersen 2) Mustard nudges Maharoof off his hip for a comfortable single to long leg, but this innings - with the exception of a couple of cover-drives from Bell - has been anything but fluent, and Pietersen confirms as much by opening his account with a thick inside-edge for two to backward square. The luck immediately evens itself out: a straight-drive that was destined for the boundary crashes straight into the stumps at the non-striker&apos;s end. &quot;In response to Adrian Bell,&quot; retorts Ben Hendy, &quot;the point I was making was that he shouldn&apos;t walk (hobble?) straight back into the team but have to prove himself. I agree that he has put in some decent performances with the ball, but if he&apos;s playing in the allrounder slot that&apos;s not enough, and his batting form has been pretty much terrible. Anyone know his batting averages for the last 12 months? The last thing we need is for the cricket team to go the way of the football team and have a band of untouchables regardless of form or fitness...&quot; 11th over: England 36-2 (Mustard 13, Pietersen 3) Mustard finally breaks the shackles with a punchy cover-drive for four off Vaas, then tucks his next ball in the general direction of shirt fine-leg for a single. That&apos;s more like it. Pietersen scampers a quick single, and Mustard pulls for one more. That was a better over from England, but 230-240 is still a long way away. &quot;Can I just say I&apos;ve seen Michael Howard in the street?&quot; wonders Alex Netherton. &quot;He&apos;s much bigger than you expect in real life as well. However, he looks just as much of a smug [snip!] as you&apos;d expect.&quot; 12th over: England 39-2 (Mustard 16, Pietersen 3) Maharoof strays and Mustard picks him off through square-leg for three as a security guard chases another dog off the pitch (one of these creatures can now be seen in the picture at the top of this article, resplendent with a great joke from Barry &quot;I used to be a stand-up&quot; Glendenning). Maharoof then defeats Pietersen with a slow leg-break. &quot;A bit sad, a bit ironic that an exultant Fred is still your desktop scoreboard icon, or are you just letting him down gently?&quot; wonders Kathy Stodart. &quot;I think it&apos;s time to bring Vaughan back into the one-day side - he whacked 95 in his last limited overs match!&quot; Ahem. 13th over: England 42-2 (Mustard 18, Pietersen 4) Dilhara Fernando enters the attack but Mustard can do no more than pinch a quick off-side single off his third delivery. Then the system crashes. Three overs disappear forever due to technical problems 16th over: England 52-2 (Mustard 26, Pietersen 6) Not much has happened since I was last able to bring you an update. Pietersen is struggling to time the ball, especially against Maharoof, and has now faced almost as many balls as Mustard for 20 runs fewer. Mustard did hit a four in that over, mowing Maharoof through wide mid-on to bring up England&apos;s 50, but it&apos;s stodgy stuff out there. &quot;I suspect that the closest Collingwood got to a Cobra yesterday was in the bar last night,&quot; says Martin Myers. &quot;If he put cider in it The Sun would probably have the headline England Captain in Cobra Snakebite Shock&quot; 17th over: England 56-2 (Mustard 28, Pietersen 8) Pietersen is having to resort to scratchy pushes down the ground for a single to get the scoreboard ticking - if ticking isn&apos;t going overboard. Mustard repeats the dose and has now faced roughly a third of England&apos;s deliveries. So credit to him for staying patient, although as I write that he is almost run out backing up too far. Pietersen pulls Fernando for one to move to eight off 34 balls before Mustard pinches the strike. &quot;Well Mr. Harper,&quot; says Adrian Bell, referring to Ben Hendy, &quot;we should leave out our best bowler because he isn&apos;t batting very well? Or we should make him prove himself (which may further aggravate his injury), even though when he&apos;s well below 100% he&apos;s still our only real world class seamer? Aye, I can see the sense in all that. Any more of this nonsense and we&apos;ll have to sort it out with a bit of jumper pulling behind the bikesheds.&quot; WICKET! Mustard c Mubarak b Maharoof 28 (56-3) That&apos;s a real disappointment. After all the hard work, Mustard has a rush of blood. Walking across his stumps he tries to lift Maharoof to fine leg, but gets a big leading edge to short extra, where Jehan Mubarak could have caught that with his eyes shut. Oh. Dear. 18th over: England 60-3 (Pietersen 12, Collingwood 0) This is going to take some serious fire-fighting, but at least Pietersen finally plays an authoritative stroke, hammering Maharoof&apos;s first ball after the Mustard dismissal through extra-cover for four. And then he reverts to the form that brought him not very many runs off lots of balls earlier in his innings. He now has 12 off 39 balls. &quot;Flintoff, when (if ever) fit, is almost without exception our best bowler,&quot; says Even hobbling in on one leg during the World Twenty20 he was our best bowler. To be honest, if we can stick him in a wheelchair and roll him towards the stumps he&apos;d probably be in our top two. If he is able to play cricket then he HAS to play, as he never lets us down as a bowler. His batting has been poor, so why not just stick him down the order to 9 or 10 and play him as a specialist bowler? It&apos;s better than most of the other options. WICKET! Pietersen c Jayawardene b Fernando 12 (61-4) Pietersen brings to an end one of the worst innings of his international career by pulling Fernando straight to midwicket. It took him 41 balls to make 12 and his innings will not be turned into a DVD entitled &quot;How to bat on slow Sri Lankan wickets&quot;. 19th over: England 63-4 (Collingwood 1, Shah 2) Owais Shah hustles for two first ball as he tucks Fernando to backward square, but England are in the mire. Matthew Franklin ate something very odd for breakfast. &quot;We do love it though eh Lawry? Being England&apos;s great fun. Nah, we wouldn&apos;t want to be those stroppy Aussies. Yeah, sure, they win everything they ever compete in, but it&apos;s all too tense. It&apos;s too life or death. Nah. Give me England anyday. Ing-ger-luuund, Ing-ger-luuund, Ing-GER-luuund! Ooo! Bell gone. Ouch! Pietersen cut in half. Snap. Crack. Pop. Wicket, wicket, wicket. 153 all out. Delicious. Jayasuriya. 400th ODI. Yay! Applause. Smash. Bang. Wallop. 155-1 off 19.4. It would actually be funny if I hadn&apos;t seen it a million times before.&quot; 20th over: England 63-4 (Collingwood 1, Shah 2) Maharoof almost bowls Collingwood as the ball sneaks past the inside edge and all the evidence suggests England still have no idea whatsoever about constructing a one-day innings on a slow pitch. It&apos;s all very depressing really. That&apos;s the powerplays over and already the target is simply to bat out all 50. 21st over: England 64-4 (Collingwood 1, Shah 3) England&apos;s timing has been as hopeless as the Northern Line (apologies to non-London residents: I won&apos;t do it again). They just can&apos;t get the ball off the square, and when they do they are generally hitting it in the air to fielders. Fernando beats Shah with another slower one, but a maiden is averted when Shah spanks the last ball to deep cover for all of one run. 22nd over: England 70-4 (Collingwood 2, Shah 8) To say that England are living off scraps would be an insult to scraps. They are living off the scraps of scraps, and the scraps of those scraps. Maharoof has been outstanding again (he began this over with figures of 7-2-17-2), but even so, the lack of adventure and originality has been crippling. Shah edges one, but it was a slower ball - surprise, surprise - and drops short of Sangakkara. But the next ball brings a more deliberate edge: four runs - I kid you not - to fine third man. 23rd over: England 76-4 (Collingwood 6, Shah 10) Back comes Malinga, who is chipped through midwicket for two by Collingwood. England&apos;s captain then works a single behind square and that&apos;s six off the over. And 12 off the last two. Sri Lanka are in tatters. 24th over: England 81-4 (Collingwood 8, Shah 13) Collingwood gets away with one against Vaas as he tries to work him to leg and gets a big leading edge. But the ball drops five yards to the right of wide mid-on and England breathe again. 25th over: England 83-4 (Collingwood 9, Shah 14) What can England hope for here? Two-hundred would be a major achievement, but it would give them a glimmer of hope. Two singles off Malinga&apos;s over and we&apos;ve reached the halfway stage. &quot;Re Mr Dalby&apos;s remarks (7th over) re journeymen, Maharoof is a handy ODI performer, but his Test bowling average is 53, unlike Sidebottom&apos;s 28,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Colly bats 44 in Tests - not Tendulkaresque, but no journeyman either. All of which begs the question of why England cannot play consistent ODI cricket. As England collapse, my early optimism looks more delusional with each over!&quot; 26th over: England 85-4 (Collingwood 10, Shah 14) Tillekeratne Dilshan gets the chance to prove that England still can&apos;t play average off-spin on tired pitches, but gifts them a leg-side wide. Collingwood collects an easy single, before Shah plays out the over. Don&apos;t want to take any risks now, do we? &quot;Half awake in bed this morning, listening to 5Live, I heard (or dreamed) a sports bulletin that said &apos;Freddie Flintoff has been sent to Amsterdam to see a joint specialist&apos;,&quot; says Ian Spencer. &quot;Did I imagine it?&quot; 27th over: England 90-4 (Collingwood 12, Shah 16) Collingwood moves to 1000 one-day runs in 2007 (only four players have made more), but this is still a grind. 28th over: England 94-4 (Collingwood 13, Shah 19) Apologies for the continued technical problems, which mean my entries are all too short and I am unable to convey the sheer electricity of this England performance. Suffice to say, you are missing nothing. 29th over: England 102-4 (Collingwood 15, Shah 25) On comes Jayasuriya, playing the small matter of his 400th ODI. I shouldn&apos;t wonder he&apos;s picked up a few tricks in that time! But these two milk expertly in that over and Shah brings up the 100 with an unorthodox paddle from outside off-stump to midwicket for two. 30th over: England 105-4 (Collingwood 16, Shah 27) Three off the over. Apparently. 31st over: England 109-4 (Collingwood 18, Shah 27) England have given up on trying to find the fence now: it&apos;s ones and twos only against Dilshan and, in this over, Jayasuriya. I&apos;m tempted to call this 50-over cricket at its most mind-numbing, but I won&apos;t. Got to keep spirits up somehow. Just keep going. Not long now. 32nd over: England 117-4 (Collingwood 24, Shah 30) The system crashes again, but it&apos;s certainly not under the weight of English runs. Six runs in that Dilshan over and the only wonder is that the Dambulla band continues to play. 33rd over: England 128-4 (Collingwood 33, Shah 33) A boundary! Collingwood uses his feet to Jayasuriya and lifts him towards cow corner. And then he celebrates with four more - a delicate late-cut. Why did I ever write them off? 34th over: England 130-4 (Collingwood 34, Shah 34) These two are in serious danger of ekeing England towards 200, which would give them a shout, if not much more. They have been forced to play sensibly by the circumstances, but then Collingwood bats like that anyway. I suspect it&apos;s been more of a struggle for Shah. Two off that over from Dilshan. &quot;Just seen that Kallis has scored a century in both innings against Pakistan, in Pakistan,&quot; says Andy Taylor. &quot;I, like all other non-South Africans it seems, can&apos;t stand the bloke, but it does raise the question, are we just jealous? If he was doing that for England no-one would call him Mr Protect My Average.&quot; 35th over: England 139-4 (Collingwood 42, Shah 34) The ball is changed, as per ICC regulations, and back comes Fernando, who is proving tough to get away. And just as I write that Collingwood goes and spoils everything by pulling him for six. Disappointing. He then pulls him for two to pour further scorn on my musings. And then Fernando is wided for a bouncer. I&apos;ll shut up now. And then, wouldn&apos;t you know it...WICKET! Collingwood lbw b Fernando 42 (139-5) The ball cut back, Collingwood stayed in his crease and that was absolutely plumb. Good innings, though. &quot;Listening to TMS, every now and then a female voice picks up the commentary, unannounced,&quot; writes David Buckingham. &quot;None of the camaraderie and back chat that surrounds handovers between the blokes. Took ages to find out who she is. Alison Mitchell is a crisp commentator who is clearly knows what she is talking about, but she is rarely taken up on her observations. Obviously the strategy is to pretend that she does not exist. Sad, really.&quot; WICKET! Bopara b Dilshan 1 (142-6) Oh dear. Ravi Bopara moves across his stumps and misses a regulation off-break. To his horror it cannons into the stumps - behind his legs! 36th over: England 144-6 (Shah 36, Swann 2) Graeme Swann works his first ball, from Dilshan, into a leg-side gap for two, but England have to rebuild now after that aberration from Bopara. 37th over: England 147-6 (Shah 38, Swann 3) Shah needs to make at least 80 from here if England are to build a potentially match-winning total. He cuts Fernando into the ground and through the hands of point for a single. Swann digs out a yorker, then pulls for a single. Three off the over. Sri Lanka will fancy their chances of going 2-0 up. 38th over: England 153-6 (Shah 40, Swann 7) All I can say is England must be thankful for the absence of Murali. Six off Dilshan&apos;s seventh over. &quot;I was futilely raging in my own inimitable, sarcastic way, of the filth I am perpetually served up by my pitiful sporting representatives,&quot; explains Matthew Franklin about his earlier rant. &quot;Better?&quot; 39th over: England 157-6 (Shah 43, Swann 8) Swann is hitting the ball quite sweetly so far, but England have barely played a shot in anger all innings - Collingwood&apos;s pull for six moments before he got out was the closest we&apos;ve had. Shah times Fernando to deep extra for two, then pinches a single to mid-off. 40th over: England 163-6 (Shah 46, Swann 11) Six singles off Dilshan, which is a bit more like it. If England don&apos;t get 200, they can consider it game over. 41st over: England 168-6 (Shah 48, Swann 13) Vaas returns to the attack and immediately finds Swann&apos;s outside edge. But Sangakkara is standing up to the stumps and there&apos;s no way he can catch that. The ball ricochets to third man for a single. This is how to bowl on these pitches: accuracy over pace, with plenty of variation. Still, Shah does manage a scoop shot to fine-leg for two to move to 48, then misses an attempted hoick: the result is a leg-bye. 42nd over: England 173-6 (Shah 49, Swann 16) Dilshan continues, and Swann rocks back to ease him to deep extra cover for two. He has so far resisted the yahoo that sometimes characterises his batting in county cricket. Dilshan sends down a wide and England inch towards respectability. &quot;I&apos;d be much happier with the idea of Freddie playing as a No9 or 10, but I still want to know that his ankle is going to stand up to the intensity of a full match, particularly for a test match return,&quot; says Ben Hendy. &quot;We can&apos;t afford to drop to 10 men early in a match. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m being unreasonable in asking for proof of form or fitness, and I think that placing all this expectation on Fred is asking for trouble. 1. He believes the hype and 2. There&apos;s pretty much no way he can live up to it. Let&apos;s face it, he hardly had a talismanic influence on the World Cup in the spring did he?&quot; 43rd over: England 181-6 (Shah 56, Swann 17) Incidentally, Andy Bull will be holding your hand during the Sri Lankan reply, so if you were planning to send me any witticisms at the end of the innings, don&apos;t. Send them to Andy instead: andy.bull@theguardian.com. There&apos;s Shah&apos;s 50, thanks to a dab to backward point for two. It&apos;s been hard-fought (72 balls, one four), but it could prove priceless. And then he lofts Malinga over mid-off for four: shot! Earlier in the over he asked umpire Tyron Wijewardene to remove his white sunhat because of Malinga&apos;s low arm. Nice touch. 44th over: England 189-6 (Shah 62, Swann 19) This has been a crucial little stand: 39 at a run a ball at the start of this over, and Shah adds four with an on-drive off Dilshan that beats Fernando&apos;s stiff dive on the boundary. England must aim for 225 now. 45th over: England 195-6 (Shah 65, Swann 21) Shah gets away with a wild heave outside off against Malinga that sums up the sluggishness of this pitch. It lands 10 yards behind the retreating mid-off and Shah collects two. Malinga&apos;s leg-side wide next ball brings up the 50 stand and then play is held up as some numpty policeman walks behind the bowler&apos;s arm. Shah then escapes the strike, but Swann can&apos;t get it away until he tucks the final ball of the over to backward square leg for two. 46th over: England 201-6 (Shah 68, Swann 24) Jayasuriya said before the start that &quot;230-240&quot; could be a match-winner, so all is not lost as Shah and Swann trade singles off the first balls of Fernando&apos;s over. Fernando is mixing up his length more than anything in that over as England&apos;s batsmen move around the crease in search of an advantage. They still manage six singles off the over. Time to press the accelerator? 47th over: England 208-6 (Shah 69, Swann 30) Malinga keeps Swann quiet with a first-ball bouncer, but is then driven to deepish extra for two off the next ball. It&apos;s been another good innings from Swann, the Man On His Second Chance. We&apos;ve only had 11 fours and that pull for six by Collingwood in this innings, although you suspect Sri Lanka will not be similarly shackled. Swann bottom-hands a lofted three to deep midwicket, but seven off the over isn&apos;t quite enough for England. WICKET! Swann run out 34 (212-7) I was just about to say how well these two were running between the wickets when Shah runs out Swann with an easy third to deep extra going begging. Ah well - that was a great stand: 70 in 12 overs. 48th over: England 217-7 (Shah 74, Broad 0) Shah moves across his stumps to flick Fernando fine for four - this has been one of his best innings for England in conditions that are as unEnglish as they come. This, from Simon Detheridge. &quot;This England innings just hasn&apos;t cut the Mustard. I&apos;d take any suggestion of a score over 200 with a pinch of salt. Even HP couldn&apos;t score many runs, and if Sri Lanka can pepper the boundary then they&apos;ll ketchup easily.&quot; Never send me another email again. 49th over: England 227-7 (Shah 82, Broad 2) It&apos;s all Shah! He repeats the walk-and-shovel from the last over and collects four more, this time off Malinga, then short-arm pulls for two thanks to an Upul Tharanga misfield at deep square-leg. And then he pinches a quick single to extra-cover and might have been run out had umpire Wijewardene not got his not-unample body in the way. Stuart Broad gives the strike straight back to Shah with an upright push to long-on for a single, and England are not out of this game. A total of 240 would be a real bonus after the potential carnage of 61 for 4 and 142 for 6. WICKET! Shah c Silva b Maharoof 82 (230-8) What a catch by Chamara Silva! Shah looks as if he has lifted Maharoof over extra cover, but Silva leaps at the last minute high to his left to end a superb innings off 92 balls. Two balls to go and Maharoof can still get a five-for. 50th over: England 234-8 (Broad 8, Sidebottom 1) I reckon England have a 1 in 5 chance of winning this, but they will need to hold all their catches and bowl like demons. I don&apos;t ask for much. Andy Bull will be with you in about 20 minutes&apos; time.

I feel that it was all somehow arranged this way.&quot; She is now associate conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and has a continuing relationship with the London Symphony Orchestra and English National Opera. This December, she will become the first woman to conduct the Dresden Staatskapelle in Germany, one of the world&apos;s oldest and greatest orchestras, in their main hall. It reveals just how patriarchal conducting is as a profession, especially in the US and Germany, that it&apos;s still unusual to see a woman on the podium. Zhang, who comes from a female conducting lineage in China - both her teacher and her teacher&apos;s teacher were women - is defiant. &quot;I don&apos;t think my sex should matter, but the more I work with different orchestras, the more I realise that people do see the difference. But it&apos;s only a visual thing. If you listen to a CD - would you hear it&apos;s a woman conducting? I think it&apos;s a quantity thing: once they see more women on the podium, it won&apos;t be a problem.&quot; In Britain, thanks to Jane Glover, Sian Edwards, and Marin Alsop, we&apos;re used to the idea of women running orchestras. Yet even when she started studying conducting intensively in China, there were doubts in her mind that she could turn it into a career. Her first experience of the limelight came when her teacher allowed her to conduct a performance of Mozart&apos;s The Marriage of Figaro. &quot;I had prepared the singers from the piano, but I wasn&apos;t supposed to be conducting the performances, my teacher was. But she said she shouldn&apos;t because I had done all the work. I had only been studying for three years, and I didn&apos;t have much experience in front of an orchestra.&quot; And in front of her, Zhang was faced not with the friends and peers of the conservatory orchestra, but the hard-bitten professionals of one of China&apos;s few full-time ensembles, the China National Opera Orchestra. &quot;When they first saw me, they were literally laughing at me. I was just this very skinny 19-year-old girl. And I was really nervous. I had butterflies in my stomach and everything. But when we got into the first number, and they saw I could do it and that I knew the music, they stopped laughing.&quot; However, that wasn&apos;t the moment when Zhang decided to make a career of conducting. It was only after a couple of years on a doctoral programme for conductors at the University of Michigan in the US that she really started to think that a life on the podium was a possibility. &quot;I was working very hard in those two years. Firstly I had to overcome the language barrier,&quot; - today, her English is an almost accentless generic American - &quot;and then I had to catch up with serious music courses. In China, I had no experience of music written before Mozart. All that was cut from the curriculum over there, because much of it was religious, sacred music that was censored by the government. And then I had to get used to rehearsing in English, to know new music and new repertoire. There was really an explosive amount of information to take in. I probably didn&apos;t enjoy it very much.&quot; But it was the Maazel conducting competition in 2002 that became the big deciding moment for her. &quot;After I was named winner, I thought it was probably a little too late not to make it a career. After that I started to conduct different orchestras in different countries and started to enjoy myself. It&apos;s taken that long, but it&apos;s been worth it.&quot; The programme she conducted in her debut with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra last week is a typical Zhang lineup: a mixture of the contemporary (a piece by Chinese composer Chen Yi), a 20th-century classic (Bartok&apos;s Second Violin Concerto) and core repertoire (Beethoven&apos;s Eighth Symphony). &quot;I try not to define my speciality. I think it&apos;s too early, so I do a wide range of music. As a good musician, you always challenge yourself, and you should never be satisfied with yourself. If you are good human being, and modest and humble about what you&apos;re doing, you always feel that the pressure gets more and more. Within myself, the standard gets higher and higher.&quot; The singer Philippe Jaroussky How do you become a countertenor? If you&apos;re a male singer, it&apos;s still the most exotic and rarefied of careers you can choose. In the pop world, falsetto is part of what every singer does from time to time, or even all the time - think of the Bee Gees - but countertenors in classical music take it to another level of brilliance and artistry. These are the male singers who ascend to the stratospheric regions usually inhabited by coloratura sopranos or castrati, those neutered singing sensations of the 17th and 18th centuries. It might seem a strange ambition for any aspiring singer, but recent years have seen a new wave of starry countertenors, such as Andreas Scholl and David Daniels. The 29-year-old French singer Philippe Jaroussky is the latest countertenor to make headlines, whether singing with his group, Ensemble Artaserse, or as an operatic soloist in Monteverdi operas. The Guardian&apos;s Tim Ashley reviewed his Purcell Room concert in June, enraptured by his &quot;gauche, boyish charm&quot; as well as his &quot;formidable vocal technique&quot;. It&apos;s fair to say he&apos;s easy on the eye, something his record company, Virgin Classics, is quick to capitalise on. So how did it all start for Jaroussky, before he became the pin-up of the countertenor world? &quot;I played violin and piano, but I was quite old when I started, about 11 years old, and to be a big virtuoso of the violin it was too late, I think. And I wanted to compose or to conduct, but finally, it was a pleasure and a game for me to sing with this head voice [falsetto]. One time I heard a concert by a sopraniste, a high countertenor, and I was amazed.&quot; Yet, Jaroussky recalls feeling ambivalent on his first encounter with the countertenor sound. &quot;I had two ideas in my mind. I thought it was absolutely marvellous and absolutely strange at the same time. But I thought maybe I could do it too.&quot; He didn&apos;t have far to move from his home near Versailles to the Conservatoire R\u00e9gionale in Paris, where there is an important course in baroque music. Most of the countertenor repertoire, whether oratorio or opera, comes from the baroque, bookended by Monteverdi and Handel. But Jaroussky says that &quot;at the beginning of my studies I was absolutely not a specialist of baroque music. When I was a violinist I was more used to Brahms or Shostakovich and I liked that music very much. And when I started singing, I worked with m\u00e9lodies [French art songs], only coming to the main baroque pieces later.&quot; But his career singing the great roles of the countertenor world has been nothing short of stellar. &quot;The French conductor Jean-Claude Malgoire engaged me for the Monteverdi trilogy,&quot; he says, &quot;and it was a very good opportunity for me. It was quite crazy to interpret the part of Nerone [one of the protagonists in Poppea] at the age of 21. That was such a big experience for me.&quot; For the moment, he is focusing on the Italian side of the baroque, but plans to turn his attention to English and German soon. But his latest disc, out in a month, celebrates the career of one of the 18th century&apos;s great castrati, Carestini. &quot;He was one of the biggest rivals of Farinelli, and he created such a lot of marvellous operas. I heard this incredible aria, Scherza Infida from Ariodante by Handel, written for him. So I worked for five years going round libraries to find music to represent all Carestini&apos;s career. The range of his voice changed a lot over his career; he started as a soprano and finished an alto. I&apos;m very proud of this album, there are eight arias on it which are completely unknown.&quot; Jaroussky&apos;s current project is also one of the weirdest: with William Christie and Les Arts Florissants, he&apos;s singing in Sant&apos;Alessio, an Italian opera by Stefano Landi, which he&apos;ll bring to the Barbican later this month. Written in Rome in 1631, at a time when women weren&apos;t allowed to take part in the opera, Christie&apos;s interpretation is also an all-male performance, with the roles that would have been taken by castrati in the 17th century sung by no fewer than nine countertenors. &quot;It&apos;s quite a magical libretto and music,&quot; says Jaroussky, &quot;and with all these countertenors, it&apos;s a very strange ambience in rehearsals, with no women. In the performances, it will be possible to imagine what the atmosphere was like at the premiere. Even if we&apos;re not castrati!&quot; The soloist Lisa Batiashvili Violinist Lisa Batiashvili, 28, is in the middle of domestic trauma in New York when I talk to her. The dishwasher in her flat is on the brink of breaking down, her three-year-old daughter Anna-Victoria is running around her feet, and she is recovering from a high-pressure week of concerts with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, playing the Beethoven Violin Concerto with conductor Lorin Maazel. &quot;It was wonderful to work with him,&quot; she says. &quot;He just knows where each phrase goes, and he&apos;s so deeply into the music.&quot; Batiashvili&apos;s ascent to the musical heights is textbook child-prodigy stuff. She was born in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi; her father is a violinist who has played with the Georgia String Quartet for more than 40 years, and her mother is a professional pianist. &quot;At the age of two,&quot; she says, &quot;I was already playing a small violin.&quot; The family moved to Germany 15 years ago, &quot;mainly because my father wanted me to have a better education. So I studied in Hamburg and then Munich, working with my teacher, Ana Chumachenco.&quot; She met her oboist husband in Munich, and set up home. Her big break came in 1995, when she came second in the Sibelius competition in Finland. &quot;Suddenly I had my management, and I started playing a lot with all the Finnish conductors, then in Britain and America.&quot; Her career hasn&apos;t stopped since, notching up gigs with the Berlin Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Amsterdam&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw. Which all looks like the life of the glamorous soloist, gallivanting around the world, playing a handful of great violin concertos - Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Sibelius - over and over again, without any real sense of connection with audiences or the music. But what&apos;s unusual about Batiashvili is that she has maintained control over her concert life and, through her family, keeps her feet firmly on the ground. &quot;I didn&apos;t have a kind of pressure to be a wunderkind when I was growing up. As a child, the violin was something serious, not just for fun, but my parents always tried to support me, as a person and as a musician. The pressure is a negative thing, to be pushed into the business at a young age, because everyone has a big crisis at some stage. I&apos;ve always limited the amount of concerts I play. And I still say that it&apos;s so important to have a normal life besides music and travelling. That&apos;s why I have never questioned that I want a family as well as a career. If I have to compromise, I will do so by having fewer engagements, fewer concerts.&quot; She is also concerned to expand the violin repertoire. She gave the premiere of Finnish composer Magnus Lindberg&apos;s Violin Concerto last year, a piece described in these pages as &quot;thrillingly direct&quot; when she gave the piece its British premiere in July. Batiashvili loves playing the concerto, &quot;especially with people who understand it. With the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra and conductor Sakari Oramo: it&apos;s amazing how they feel Lindberg&apos;s music, they&apos;re like fish in the water, and it has a simple and clear sound. And that&apos;s how it should come across.&quot; She plans to add the Ligeti and Britten concertos to her repertoire soon, but she&apos;s also adamant that playing the classics is just as important as performing new music: &quot;There is always so much to learn, even if you&apos;re playing the Beethoven for the 50th time, there is always something new to discover.&quot; Her advice for would-be soloists is simple. &quot;Everybody has to find their own way. For me, it&apos;s important to have a family life next to the music, but there will be other people who are more obsessed by music, and you can&apos;t tell them to do less. They have to listen to their own heart. But a musician&apos;s life is not a sportsman&apos;s life, it doesn&apos;t finish when you&apos;re 30. It can go on for a long time, and if you think long-term, you will never agree to do everything possible today. It will burn you.&quot; Does she dream of a musical future for her daughter? &quot;Well, she wants to play. And unfortunately she wants to try the violin. But it&apos;s such hard work, and I want to save her from that.&quot; She can try, but the violin seems to be in the Batiashvili genes. The composer Luke Bedford He may be only his late 20s, but composer Luke Bedford is already becoming one of Britain&apos;s most distinctive musical voices. His piece for the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, On Voit Tout en Aventure, which premiered last year, and which I heard at the Aldeburgh festival in June, is one of the most outstanding pieces by any young composer I&apos;ve ever experienced - music of brooding expressive intensity and charged with that indefinable quality that makes a piece sound as if it was written out of sheer necessity. He has just finished a big new piece for the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, Wreathe, which will be premiered in December, and has works in the pipeline for Europe&apos;s best-known new music outfits, including Germany&apos;s Ensemble Modern. It all looks like the very model of a young composer&apos;s career, after his studies at the Royal College and then the Academy, where he found key patrons in the British musical establishment in composers Oliver Knussen, Julian Anderson and Simon Bainbridge. But Bedford&apos;s background could not have been more different from the echelons of musical life that he now works in. He grew up in Wokingham, Berkshire, and didn&apos;t come from a musical family, &quot;but something about music just clicked with me from a fairly early age&quot;, he says. &quot;As a child, I persuaded my parents to buy me a 50p guitar from a jumble sale. And I wanted to hit things. I just wanted to learn to play.&quot; But the world of classical music was something that he only discovered later on. &quot;It was about the age of 11,&quot; he says, &quot;and it was the Ken Russell film about Mahler that inspired me, of all things. That was the first time I&apos;d ever heard any Mahler, so I persuaded my gran to buy me Mahler symphonies.&quot; He is clearly an expert in coercing his family to back his musical instincts with cash and, as a teenager, he describes himself as &quot;very lucky to have a teacher at a comprehensive school who was very supportive. So by the age of 14, I was trying to write things for orchestra. Which is probably a little unusual.&quot; But it&apos;s a long way from Mahler and Mozart to the 20th-century avant garde. What attracted him to contemporary music? &quot;I remember my teacher giving me a tape of Stravinsky&apos;s Rite of Spring. I can still remember listening to it for the first time and being knocked out by it. So I went very much into the 20th century trying to find the most demented music I could. Quirkiness very much appealed to me.&quot; His own teenage music ranged from the demented to the simple, influenced by everyone from Stockhausen to Satie. &quot;It&apos;s very important at that age to hear as much as you can and see where you end up, what you do with it,&quot; he says. Despite his success as a student in London, Bedford feels uneasy about the aesthetic effect the Royal College and Academy had on his work. &quot;When I left the academy a few years ago, I felt I was writing the music I was expected to write rather than the music I wanted to write.&quot; The institutional modernism students are expected to produce in London - what Bedford describes as a &quot;modernist, angular kind of writing, with a rather grey harmonic language&quot; - is difficult for many young composers to break out of. &quot;Five years ago, I would have been surprised at the music I&apos;m writing now. It isn&apos;t so obviously modern sounding as maybe it was when I was a student, but I hope it&apos;s more interesting, more personal, and more unique.&quot; It&apos;s the result of what Bedford feels is the most important lesson for any young composer to learn: &quot;To try to find out what you want to do, and to ignore what everyone else expects. You have to try to stick to your guns.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;Suddenly I had my management, and I started playing a lot with all the Finnish conductors, then in Britain and America.&quot; Her career hasn&apos;t stopped since, notching up gigs with the Berlin Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Amsterdam&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw."], "title": "Four young classical music stars you need to hear", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/05/classicalmusicandopera3", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-05T08:39:48Z", "article": "The premiere of Benjamin Britten&apos;s Peter Grimes at Sadler&apos;s Wells Theatre in June 1945 is often seen as the moment when British opera came of age. It was the work that reinvented the native tradition, reflecting what had been going on in the rest of Europe over the previous half-century. Over the next few years, more new stage works appeared here, not only by Britten himself but also by a number of his contemporaries, further encouraged by the commissions offered as part of the Festival of Britain in 1951. It seemed for a while that, operatically speaking, Britain was no longer the poor relation of its European counterparts. More than half a century on, it&apos;s impossible to take the same sanguine view of contemporary opera. Operatic life has slipped back into being a museum culture, far more concerned with recycling the classics of the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries than with finding and presenting new works to refresh those museum exhibits. In contrast to the efforts of some of our European neighbours - in particular, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands - the amount of new opera staged by the major companies here is small. This season, however, promises to be an improvement. Each of the major opera companies has at least one new or nearly new work in its programme: Welsh National Opera has already opened its season with the premiere of James MacMillan&apos;s The Sacrifice, Opera North will unveil Jonathan Dove&apos;s Pinocchio in its winter season, the Royal Opera has Harrison Birtwistle&apos;s The Minotaur (another world premiere) in the spring, while English National Opera is launching a new venture across the Thames at the Young Vic, with a season of Olga Neuwirth&apos;s Lost Highway and a staging of Birtwistle&apos;s Punch and Judy. Even the financially stretched Scottish Opera, whose whole programme is a shadow of what it used to be, has found the resources to put on a new production of Judith Weir&apos;s brilliantly successful A Night at the Chinese Opera. In some cases these are exceptional: the Dove, for instance, is Opera North&apos;s first full-scale new work since Simon Holt&apos;s The Nightingale&apos;s to Blame nine years ago, while the previous premiere at WNO before The Sacrifice was Maxwell Davies&apos;s The Doctor of Myddfai in 1996. But at least the Royal Opera now has a policy of premiering a new work every two years (works by Turnage, Weir and Ad\u00e8s are among those in the pipeline), and presenting a contemporary revival in the intervening season. And following the ENO&apos;s success with Philip Glass&apos;s Satyagraha last season, the Young Vic is attempting to match the theatre to some parts of the contemporary repertory. But these efforts, however well- intentioned, only scratch the surface of a far more deep-seated problem. When companies do invest in a contemporary work, they want the added kudos of a world premiere - a work they can say they have instigated, nurtured and seen all the way through to performance. As a result, there is a stratum of tried and tested European operas composed in the past 30 or more years that have never been seen in Britain. It includes works by many of the major composers in European music since the second world war, from commanding figures such as Olivier Messiaen, Luciano Berio, Hans Werner Henze, Helmut Lachenmann and Louis Andriessen, to those now in their 30s, 40s and 50s, such as Salvatore Sciarrino, Wolfgang Rihm, Detlev Glanert, Matthias Pintscher, Pascal Dusapin and Michel Van der Aa. These composers are constantly extending the boundaries of opera in many unexpected directions, and getting supportive opera houses and enthusiastic audiences for the results. Glanert&apos;s Caligula, for instance, was given its first performance in Frankfurt a year ago, and was staged again in Cologne just a few months later. That kind of concerted support is unknown over here. Even significant British composers whose pieces have been first performed elsewhere are habitually overlooked - there are no plans, for instance, for Jonathan Harvey&apos;s impressive Wagner Dream (staged last year in Luxembourg and Amsterdam) to be seen in this country, or for James Dillon&apos;s Philomela (premiered in Porto three years ago) to come here either. It is not entirely the fault of the British companies; their (admittedly substantial) funding from the Arts Council offers little encouragement to innovate. Putting on any kind of opera is an expensive operation, and contemporary work can require significantly higher outlay - the difficulty of the music may demand extra rehearsal time, while even the most optimistic champion of new music would not claim that a work by Birtwistle or Berio is going to attract audiences in the number that flock to La Boh\u00e8me or The Marriage of Figaro. But, according to Elaine Padmore, director of opera at Covent Garden, there is &quot;no special fund we can apply to, unfortunately, for the extra costs of commissioning, or the likely box-office outcome. We do it because it&apos;s really exciting to create new work and we really hope to expand the existing repertoire by doing so.&quot; Given the limited resources available for putting on such work, it&apos;s inevitable, Padmore says, that the Royal Opera should give priority to British works. But if she had money to spare, she would like to put on operas such as Henze&apos;s L&apos;Upupa and Kaija Saariaho&apos;s L&apos;Amour de Loin. &quot;But I think the ease of opera tourism that goes on today means that many people who would enjoy these works get on Eurostar or easyJet and see them anyway.&quot; At ENO this season, the focus for new opera is on its collaboration with the Young Vic. Buoyed by the success of Satyagraha, which attracted the biggest audience for a contemporary work in the history of ENO, artistic director John Berry says that in the future, &quot;it would be ambitious, but not out of the question, to say we wanted to present two contemporary works on the main stage plus something at the Young Vic each season.&quot; Berry emphasises the importance of including the director in the genesis of a new work. Many fail, he says, &quot;because they are smothered by poor productions&quot; and &quot;there are some existing pieces which deserve and would benefit from a new directorial interpretation.&quot; He admits that it will take time to build a body of work from scratch, and that existing works will be brought into the ENO repertory alongside new commissions. But this still means it is going to take a long time to establish anything like a representative selection of contemporary opera. Overall, the picture is not quite so bleak. Some smaller opera companies regularly achieve minor miracles. It&apos;s thanks to Music Theatre Wales, for instance, that we have finally had the chance to see any of the work of the Belgian Philippe Boesmans (whose operas have been widely performed across Europe). MTW is currently touring their production of his Julie, and in the spring they are premiering Michael Berkeley&apos;s new opera. Glyndebourne, without a penny of public funding for its summer season, does its bit, too - the premiere of Peter Eotvos&apos;s Marquez-based Of Love and Other Demons is due there next August - while Almeida Opera soldiers on each July, though now a shadow of its former self. But, with the exception of Glyndebourne, all these are confined to smaller-scale works. For contemporary grand opera (if that&apos;s not a contradiction in terms) to succeed, the big five companies need to show their commitment to renewing and enriching the repertory.", "sentences": ["Even significant British composers whose pieces have been first performed elsewhere are habitually overlooked - there are no plans, for instance, for Jonathan Harvey&apos;s impressive Wagner Dream (staged last year in Luxembourg and Amsterdam) to be seen in this country, or for James Dillon&apos;s Philomela (premiered in Porto three years ago) to come here either."], "title": "Why the UK doesn't get to hear European operas", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/05/classicalmusicandopera2", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-05T14:45:19Z", "article": "The Ajax coach Henk ten Cate insists he has no imminent plans to quit the Amsterdam side and take a coaching job at Chelsea, despite reports linking him with a role at Stamford Bridge as assistant to Avram Grant.

Regular chants of &quot;Henkie, get lost and take Jaakke and Colin with you&quot; rang around the away end as Ajax struggled to gain a point in the league game. The Ajax supporters&apos; frustration, however, does not mean that Chelsea are making a mistake. At Barcelona, under Frank Rijkaard, he was an ideal No2, improving players in training and fine-tuning their attacking instincts. He also allowed Rijkaard to keep his &quot;good guy&quot; image with the players. It was often Ten Cate who had to tell players that they were dropped or that they were not being offered a new contract. At half-time it was Ten Cate who ranted or raved if Bar\u00e7a were behind. The 52-year-old has also had success as a first-team coach in what can only be described as a remarkable and nomadic career. He rarely rose above the average during a playing CV which saw him represent Vitesse, Go Ahead Eagles, Edmonton Drillers, Telstar and Heracles, but he has a reputation as a coach who drastically improves players and works miracles with smaller teams. After gaining experience with Go Ahead Eagles, SC Heracles and the amateur club Rheden, he led Sparta Rotterdam to sixth place in the Eredivisie and also took them to the Dutch cup final, where they lost 5-2 to PSV Eindhoven. Later, at Vitesse, he surprised everyone by finishing third in the league - their highest ever position. He has coached in Hungary and Germany as well, and managed to win the Hungarian Cup with MTK Hungaria despite living in a small flat without his family and the fact that he was often racially abused (he was born in Amsterdam to a Surinamese mother). More success followed back in the Netherlands with NAC Breda - whom he qualified for the Uefa Cup for the first time ever and then, of course, at Barcelona as Rijkaard&apos;s assistant. There is, however, always the danger that his temper will boil over. He had to leave Vitesse after television cameras caught him completely losing the plot following a Uefa Cup game against Sporting Braga. He had to be calmed down by the president, Karel Aalbers, and the technical director, Leo Beenhakker, and that high-profile incident contributed to his departure for KFC Uerdingen in Germany. He is not afraid to make unpopular decisions and Jan Luijkx, a backroom staff member at NAC Breda, said after being fired by Ten Cate: &quot;Ten Cate manages to kick up a row every day, and not only with me. He treats people with contempt and always blames someone else.&quot; At Barcelona, however, he prospered. Ten Cate and Rijkaard both have Surinam roots and knew each other from growing up in Amsterdam. Rijkaard was always going to be the club&apos;s face towards the outside world because of his past as a player but Ten Cate has often been credited as the architect of the successful team that won the Champions League in 2006. The lure of coaching Ajax back in Amsterdam, however, proved too difficult to resist after that Champions League triumph in Paris against Arsenal but his tenure there has been disappointing, especially in Europe. He has failed to reach the Champions League group stages in two consecutive seasons, falling to FC Copenhagen and Slavia Prague in the third qualifying round, and his misery was completed last week when Ajax were also eliminated from the Uefa Cup against Dynamo Zagreb. The coach was not helped by Ajax&apos;s decision to sell Wesley Sneijder to Real Madrid and Ryan Babel to Liverpool in the summer but the problems at the club have reinforced the view that he is an extremely good No2 but perhaps not suited to lead a big club. In London he will arrive in an ideal position: he can work with the players on the training pitch and improve the team&apos;s attacking play, instilling a pattern which will see Chelsea score far more goals than they have so far this season. In the Netherlands he is not seen as a genius such as Guus Hiddink or Johan Cruyff, partly because he did not have a good playing career. He is an emotional character who seems to be better suited away from the limelight than in it. \u00b7 Daan Schippers is deputy editor at the Dutch football magazine Elf Road to the Bridge February 1990 Given his first coaching job at Go Ahead Eagles, where he also played May 1995 Reaches Dutch Cup final with Sparta Rotterdam but loses 5-2 to PSV May 1998 Finishes third in Dutch league with Vitesse, their highest position ever May 2000 Wins his first trophy by leading MTK Hungaria to the Hungarian Cup May 2003 Takes NAC Breda into the Uefa Cup for the first time in the club&apos;s history May 2006 Wins the Spanish league title and the Champions League as Barcelona assistant coach with Ronaldinho and co beating Arsenal 2-1 in the final in Paris", "sentences": ["He has coached in Hungary and Germany as well, and managed to win the Hungarian Cup with MTK Hungaria despite living in a small flat without his family and the fact that he was often racially abused (he was born in Amsterdam to a Surinamese mother).", "Ten Cate and Rijkaard both have Surinam roots and knew each other from growing up in Amsterdam.", "The lure of coaching Ajax back in Amsterdam, however, proved too difficult to resist after that Champions League triumph in Paris against Arsenal but his tenure there has been disappointing, especially in Europe."], "title": "Football: Ten Cate arrives to put a bit of Bar\u00e7a into Chelsea", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/09/chelsea.premierleague", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Chelsea"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-08T23:39:15Z", "article": "Martin Jol officially became a target for Ajax last night after their coach, Henk ten Cate, walked out on the club to join Avram Grant&apos;s coaching team at Chelsea. The Amsterdam club will appoint a caretaker manager after admitting that their targets are working for another club, or for a national team. An approach from Ajax to the Dutch Football Federation to consider the release of the Holland manager Marco van Basten was quickly rebuffed. &quot;We will find a solution for the next few months because our first choices are working at clubs or for a national team at the moment,&quot; said Ajax&apos;s technical director Martin van Geel. Jol has been courted by Ajax before, during his time at White Hart Lane. Holland&apos;s biggest club came calling in February, 2005 only for Jol to rebuff their advances, saying that he owed a debt to Frank Arnesen, who was then Tottenham&apos;s sporting director. Ironically, Arnesen agreed to join Chelsea that summer, as their head of youth development. Tottenham have endured an horrendous start to the season, with results and the board of directors conspiring against Jol. Daniel Levy, the chairman, led a delegation to Spain to visit Juande Ramos, the Sevilla coach, with a view to installing him as Jol&apos;s successor. The move foundered and Jol has remained, rather uncomfortably, in the position since. Tottenham also made overtures to Jose Mourinho, following his departure from Chelsea three weeks ago. Jol could yet be offered the opportunity to leave on his terms, although his club said last night that they had heard nothing from Ajax. &quot;Tottenham have not received any approach from Ajax with regard to the manager Martin Jol,&quot; said a spokesman. The Dutch Football Federation refuse to consider the release of Van Basten, ahead of next summer&apos;s European Championships, where Holland will be well fancied, and they dismissed the notion of Van Basten combining both jobs for the remainder of the season. Van Basten&apos;s contract expires after the finals in Austria and Switzerland. &quot;Even for \u20ac100m, we will not accept it [that van Basten coaches Ajax],&quot; said Henk Kesler, the federation&apos;s president. &quot;The coach cannot do two things at once.&quot; Ten Cate, who flew into London last night to finalise his move, has had a difficult season. His Ajax team fell short of the lucrative Champions League group stages, losing in the final qualifying round to Slavia Prague and, last Thursday, they went out of the Uefa Cup, on away goals to Dinamo Zagreb. Prior to that, Ten Cate, who had nine months of contract remaining, held talks with Chelsea, to the dismay of Ajax, and they felt that they had no option but to sanction his release. During Sunday&apos;s 2-2 draw at Sparta Rotterdam, Ajax supporters aimed abuse at Ten Cate, the club chairman John Jaakke and the defender Jurgen Colin. Regular chants of &quot;Henkie, get lost and take Jaakke and Colin with you&quot; rang around the away end as Ajax struggled to gain a point. &quot;Henk wanted to go to Chelsea, he was very clear about that,&quot; said Van Geel. &quot;So we didn&apos;t really have a choice about it. He put it to us as a fact and we didn&apos;t want to work with a coach who was at Chelsea in his mind. It should have been done differently but we cannot change it any more. It was not perfect timing.&quot; Ten Cate served as assistant coach to his compatriot Frank Rijkaard at the Spanish club Barcelona before electing to strike out on his own at Ajax last season. He won the Dutch Cup and the Dutch Super Cup but has found the lure of Chelsea and working in the Premier League impossible to resist. He will work under the manager Avram Grant, Mourinho&apos;s successor, and, it is intended, alongside Steve Clarke on the training field. Grant has always worked with two assistants and confirmed last Friday that he wanted a European coach to work with Clarke. Clarke was upset at the manner of Mourinho&apos;s departure and has considered his position but John Terry, the captain, hopes that he can stay. &quot;It is very important to have someone like Clarkey around,&quot; said Terry. &quot;He knows the club inside out, he is passionate for the club and when he speaks, it is from the heart. That is very important not only for the English boys but for the foreign lads who have not been here too long.

Indra Setiawan is accused, along with a senior Garuda staff member, Rohainil Aini, of aiding the main suspect in the murder of Munir Thalib, who died after being poisoned with arsenic on an international flight. Mr Thalib, 38, a human rights lawyer who was an outspoken critic of the military&apos;s tactics in quelling dissent in East Timor, Aceh and Papua, died on board a Garuda flight bound for Amsterdam in 2004. A Garuda pilot, Polycarpus Priyanto, was convicted of the murder in 2005 and jailed for 14 years, but the sentence was quashed by the supreme court last year because of a lack of witnesses and evidence. Prosecutors, who are also fighting to overturn the supreme court decision, accuse Mr Setiawan of helping to assign Mr Priyanto, who was off duty at the time, to the Jakarta-Amsterdam service on which the lawyer died. During the original case Mr Setiawan told how he received a letter from Indonesia&apos;s intelligence agency asking him to name Mr Priyanto as flight security officer, an authorisation that Mr Aini signed. But Mr Setiawan later said he lost the letter, which was signed by the intelligence agency&apos;s deputy head. A state prosecutor, Noor Rachmad, accused Mr Setiawan of being an accessory to the &quot;intentional and premeditated murder&quot; after fresh evidence emerged that Mr Priyanto poisoned the activist while he was in transit at Singapore&apos;s Changi airport.

It does not call for a referendum. It makes clear that thanks to the negotiations over the new treaty Britain will have a new relationship with Europe. It does not enter into the percentage game. The new treaty is 44,000 words long. The dead constitution was 157,000 words long. Unless there is a new EU mathematic directive abolishing the laws of percentages 44,000 cannot be 90, or 95 or even 50% of 157,000. Key elements of the old constitution remain. There will be a standing president of the EU Council. The commission and the parliament opposed this idea when it was first put forward because it strengthens the inter-governmental nature of the EU. The new treaty says there should be EU foreign policy voice under control of 27 national foreign ministers. Last week, William Hague was calling for tough European action on Burma. I agree. Yet the same William Hague wants to kill the treaty that might make this possible. He also wants referendums on any new treaty. This is what Turkeyphobes argue for. They want national referendums to stop Turkey joining the EU. It is sad to see the Conservatives now joining those who argue for referendums on future Turkish membership. Is the new treaty the old constitution? It is difficult to see how this can be intellectually defended. The new treaty leaves all the old treaties in place. The constitution abolished all the old treaties and rolled them into one giant EU document. The new treaty gives more powers to Parliaments to stop EU directive than was on offer in the constitution. The scrutiny committee wants more powers for parliament. So do I. But if every EU national parliament wants a veto right on any EU directive then we might as well as all go home. British rights under EU treaties to travel, live, trade, and work freely will always fall foul of national protectionist instincts. Some like Bill Cash will argue that is a price worth paying. Reading the full report of the committee, it is Mr Cash who is the driving Tory spirit on it. Treaty opponents never tell us exactly what they don&apos;t like. The Tory-UKIP position is just to say no to Europe. The scrutiny committee rightly complains that in Britain we do not, whether in parliament or in the wider political context, debate and discuss Europe with adequate time. I agree. We have tried. In the last parliament we set up a special standing committee of parliament to discuss the negotiations on the constitution. Not once did a Tory front bencher attend. The Tories are disingenuous on Europe. Hague is calling for endless referendums because he wants to undermine Gordon Brown&apos;s principled decision that parliament, not the press or a plebiscite should decide our international treaty obligations. The scrutiny committee report is an important contribution to parliamentary debate. It should be read carefully. I do not agree with all its conclusions. Its main one is that there is not enough information on Europe. MPs can decide today to have an EU debate once a week. The scrutiny committee argues that the timetable on the current treaty negotiations is too compressed. In essence this debate has been going on since 2002. Whether members of the scrutiny committee can persuade fellow MPs to give the parliamentary time remains an open question. I have attended nearly every Commons debate on Europe. I have helped take two treaty bills - on Amsterdam and Nice - onto the statute books. William Hague in common with John Redwood who said the Amsterdam treaty would mean &quot;the abolition of Britain&quot; is great at getting anti-EU quotes into the Daily Mail. But turn up for lengthy, technical EU debates? No, that would mean confronting counter arguments. There is one odd argument in the scrutiny committee report. The new treaty calls for parliaments to take an active part in revising treaties and to so help make Europe work better. I read this as meaning more resources and possibilities for MPs to act politically in European matters. So as an MP I welcome this. The committee thinks it is a power grab by Brussels over national parliaments. It is a genuine matter of debate. Making Europe more political, more parliamentary, and more democratic remains a top priority. The scrutiny committee has done a good job even if its conclusions do not flow from its arguments. The new reform treaty should be finalised quickly and brought back to parliament for debate and ratification. And William Hague should fly to Turkey to explain why he is reversing Tory support for Turkey to join the EU by joining every anti-Muslim, racist Turkophobe rightwing in Europe who is passionate for referendums to say no to European enlargement.", "sentences": ["I have helped take two treaty bills - on Amsterdam and Nice - onto the statute books.", "William Hague in common with John Redwood who said the Amsterdam treaty would mean &quot;the abolition of Britain&quot; is great at getting anti-EU quotes into the Daily Mail."], "title": "A new relationship with Europe", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/10/anewrelationshipwitheurope", "tags": ["World news", "European Union", "Turkey", "Conservatives", "William Hague", "Politics", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-10T23:09:11Z", "article": "Chelsea have confirmed that Ajax&apos;s manager, Henk ten Cate, will join the club as an assistant first-team coach. The Premier League side agreed a deal with the Dutch club yesterday and the 52-year-old&apos;s contract will be finalised and signed today. Ten Cate, who is expected to work alongside the first-team coach Steve Clarke at Stamford Bridge, had nine months left on his contract in Amsterdam but the fans were unhappy with him after the club were eliminated from first the Champions League and then the Uefa Cup. Chelsea&apos;s injured midfielder Michael Ballack has given the manager, Avram Grant, a boost by confirming he has no intention of quitting the club. The former Bayern Munich midfielder, struggling to regain full fitness after two ankle operations, wants to remain at the club for the rest of his career. &quot;I feel very happy here and would like to end my career here,&quot; he told the German TV station ARD. &quot;Although I want to end my career at Chelsea, if I am still fit when my contract runs out, why should I not play on for another two years?&quot; Ballack&apos;s desire to stay at Stamford Bridge is matched by the striker Didier Drogba, who felt Jose Mourinho&apos;s departure more than most. &quot;Chelsea is my destiny today.

It has always been like this. But down by the railway station the 21st century is rudely intruding and the villagers of Wangen are upset. &quot;It&apos;s the noise, and all the cars. You should see it on a Friday night,&quot; complains Roland Kissling, a perfume buyer for a local cosmetics company. &quot;I&apos;ve got nothing against mosques, or even against minarets. But in the city. Not in this village. It&apos;s just not right. There&apos;s going to be trouble.&quot; The target of Mr Kissling&apos;s ire is a nondescript house belonging to the region&apos;s Turkish immigrant community. The basement is a prayer room where hundreds of Muslims gather every week for Friday rites. And in a case that has gone all the way to Switzerland&apos;s supreme court, setting a keenly watched precedent, the Turks of Wangen have just won the right to erect a six-metre-high minaret. &quot;We&apos;ll build it by next year. We&apos;re still deciding what colour and what material,&quot; says Mustafa Karahan, the sole person authorised to speak for Wangen&apos;s Turkish Cultural Association. &quot;We don&apos;t have any problems. It&apos;s the other side that has the problems. We&apos;re not saying anything else until the minaret is built.&quot; If Ulrich Schl\u00fcer has his way the Wangen minaret will be toppled. An MP from the rightwing Swiss People&apos;s party (SVP), the country&apos;s strongest, Mr Schl\u00fcer has launched a crusade to keep his country culturally Christian. &quot;Unlike other religions,&quot; he argues, &quot;Islam is not only a religion. It&apos;s an ideology aiming to create a different legal system. That&apos;s sharia. That&apos;s a big problem and in a proper democracy it has to be tackled. If the politicians don&apos;t, the people will.&quot; Switzerland&apos;s direct democracy rules require referendums if there is enough public support. Mr Schl\u00fcer has launched a petition demanding a new clause in the Swiss constitution stating: &quot;The building of minarets in Switzerland is forbidden.&quot; He already has 40,000 signatures. If, as expected, he reaches 100,000 by this time next year a referendum is automatically triggered. &quot;We&apos;ve got nothing against prayer rooms or mosques for the Muslims,&quot; he insists. &quot;But a minaret is different. It&apos;s got nothing to do with religion. It&apos;s a symbol of political power.&quot; In a country with more than 300,000 Muslims, mainly immigrants from the Balkans, there are only three minarets in Switzerland. Wangen would be the fourth and the first outside the cities. Backlash The native backlash has begun. And not just in Switzerland. &quot;It seems our experience here is resonating across Europe,&quot; says a Swiss official in Berne. &quot;Culture clashes&quot; over Muslim religious buildings have erupted in Italy, Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. &quot;Christian fundamentalists are behind this,&quot; says Reinhard Schulze, professor of Islamic studies at Berne University. &quot;And there&apos;s also a lot of money coming in from the Gulf states.&quot; From London&apos;s docklands to the rolling hills of Tuscany, from southern Austria to Amsterdam and Cologne, the issue of Islamic architecture and its impact on citadels of &quot;western civilisation&quot; is increasingly contentious. The far right is making capital from Islamophobia by focusing on the visible symbols of Islam in Europe. In Switzerland it is the far-right SVP that is setting the terms of the debate. &quot;This is mainly about Swiss politics,&quot; says Prof Schulze, &quot;a conflict between the right and the left to decide who runs the country ... Islam [is] a pretext.&quot; Next door in Austria the far right leader J\u00f6rg Haider is also calling for a ban in his province of Carinthia, even though there are few Muslims and no known plans for mosques. &quot;Carinthia,&quot; he said, &quot;will be a pioneer in the battle against radical Islam for the protection of our dominant western culture.&quot; In Italy the mayors of Bologna and Genoa last month cancelled or delayed planning permission for mosques after a vociferous campaign by the far-right Northern League, one of whose leaders, Roberto Calderoli, threatened to stage a &quot;day of pork&quot; to offend Muslims and to take pigs to &quot;defile&quot; the site of the proposed mosque in Bologna. While the far right makes the running, their noisy campaign is being supported more quietly by mainstream politicians and some Christian leaders. And on the left pro-secularist and anti-clericalist sentiment is also frequently ambivalent about Islamic building projects. Cardinal Joachim Meisner of Cologne has voiced his unease over a large new mosque being built for the city&apos;s 120,000 Muslims in the Rhineland Roman Catholic stronghold. A similar scheme in Munich has also faced local protests. The Bishop of Graz in Austria has been more emphatic. &quot;Muslims should not build mosques which dominate town&apos;s skylines in countries like ours,&quot; said Bishop Egon Kapellari. This opposition is on a collision course with an Islam that is now the fastest-growing religion in Europe and which is clamouring for its places of worship to be given what it sees as a rightful and visible place in west European societies. &quot;Islam is coming out of the backyards. It&apos;s a trend you see everywhere in Europe,&quot; says Thomas Schmitt, a Bonn University geographer studying conflicts over mosques in Germany. Estimated at about 18 million and growing, the Muslims of western Europe have long worshipped in prayer rooms located in homes, disused factories, warehouses or car parks, hidden away from public view. Their growing self-confidence, though, is reflected in plans for the Abbey Mills mosque, Britain&apos;s biggest, in east London, which is intended to have a capacity of 40,000. Last month there were scuffles at the site of the Westermoskee in west Amsterdam. A Dutch government minister broke ground for building one of the Netherlands&apos; biggest mosques last year. But the project is mired in controversy and may not be completed. Confidence &quot;The whole idea of having these huge mosques is about being part of Europe while having your religion,&quot; says Thijl Sunier, a Dutch anthropologist. &quot;You have young Muslims showing their confidence, stating we are part of this society and we want our share. And you have growing anxiety among many native Europeans.&quot; In Berne, the Swiss capital, the city authorities have just denied building permission for turning a disused abattoir into Europe&apos;s biggest Islamic cultural centre, a \u00a340m complex with a mosque, a museum on Islam, a hotel, offices and conference halls. Organisers are looking for an alternative site. Dr Schmitt says that by hiring leading architects to build impressive mosques that alter the appearance of European cities Muslims are making a commitment to the societies in which they live. &quot;They are no longer guests. They are established. This is a sign of normalisation, of integration,&quot; he says. But in Wangen, that message falls on deaf ears. &quot;First it was a cultural centre, then a prayer room, and now a minaret,&quot; says Mr Kissling. &quot;It&apos;s salami tactics. The next thing it will be loudspeakers and the calls to prayer will be echoing up and down the valley.

And next month that destiny will finally be realised, when the Queen launches the terminus into the world of 21st-century high-speed European rail travel. From November 14, Eurostar trains will writhe out from under the station&apos;s unforgettable train shed roof through new tunnels and \u00a35.8bn-worth of newly forged engineering works to reach Paris Gare du Nord in just two-and-a-quarter hours. Europe was embedded in the station&apos;s architectural DNA from the very beginning. Just look at the washed-and-brushed facade of the Midland Grand Hotel fronting the magnificently restored and remodelled terminus. Scott&apos;s ambitious design for the hotel and station clearly plundered the architectural treasuries of medieval Europe. From the dust and soot of the Euston Road rose a Railway Age cathedral, cloth hall and castle, all hammered and crafted into a convincing and enthralling whole, borrowing spires, arches, corbels and crockets from Amiens, Brussels, Ypres and all cardinal gothic points south through the Alps to Verona and Venice. Scott&apos;s rich palette of building materials, meanwhile, was drawn as much from the salmon-pink bricks specially baked for the job by Mr Gripper of Nottingham as it was from the hues of churches that this intensely hard-working architect had once admired in northern Italy. St Pancras himself, of whom precious little is known, is buried in Rome, a long way from the charred and soiled remains of the 19th-century slums of Agar Town that were demolished to make way for the Midland Railway&apos;s steamy entrance into London. As for the connections with Paris, the Scott family was only too aware of these. George Gilbert Scott Jr, Sir Gilbert&apos;s son and another brilliant architect, ended his days, after a drunken and licentious reverie in Paris, divorced and quite mad in one of the bedrooms of the Midland Grand - in the architectural clutches, as it were, of his famous father. Along the corridor leading from Scott Jr&apos;s room, great Gothic vaults designed by Sir Gilbert had only recently been adorned with paintings of Temperance and Chastity, virtues associated at the time with neither Paris nor Sir Gilbert&apos;s wayward son. Behind Scott&apos;s gothic phantasmagoria - a building &quot;too good for its purpose&quot;, said the architect - passengers found themselves beneath the roof of what remains one of the wonders of the railway world. This soaring, single-span iron-and-glass train shed was engineered by William Henry Barlow (1812-1902) and Rowland Mason Ordish (1824-1886), both of whom had worked with Joseph Paxton on the design of the Crystal Palace, home in 1851 to the first of the great world &quot;expos&quot;. Their achievement was only overshadowed when Gustave Eiffel completed his famous tower in time for the 1889 Paris Expo. Barlow&apos;s international career had begun in distant Istanbul, while, after St Pancras, Ordish went on to work in Bombay, St Petersburg and Singapore, shaping the roof of Amsterdam&apos;s Central station along the way. St Pancras, then, was an international station of sorts long before the completion of the new 68-mile high-speed link that will see Eurostar trains racing under the Thames flood plains and through Kent to Ashford and so on via the Channel tunnel, when they will join Europe&apos;s ever-growing network of 300kph (185mph) electric railways. It is hard to believe that all this might not have existed, as you walk into St Pancras today through brand new gothic doors and enter the station&apos;s previously unseen undercroft, the former storage basement with its 800 Victorian iron pillars, where the Eurostar ticket-machines, check-in points and security controls are today, before riding long, silent escalators up to the trains basking beneath Barlow and Ordish&apos;s glorious roof. This, the most adventurous and biggest roof of its kind for decades after it was built, now painted a fetching sky blue and flooded with daylight? This station, with its quarter-mile, 300kph trains, a huge cocktail bar, a branch of Foyles stocked with 20,000 titles, a smart Searcy&apos;s restaurant and brasserie, independent coffee bars, floors covered in timber and stone rather than sticky British airport-style carpet, new gothic carvings, newly cast gothic door handles, and a nine-metre-high sculpture of lovers meeting under the station clock? How could anyone ever have thought of denying us this engineering aria, this architectural hymn? And yet, 40-plus years ago, when the idea of a Channel tunnel railway was little more than a half-forgotten Victorian fantasy, St Pancras station was very nearly a martyr to the fundamentalist creeds of &quot;rationalisation&quot; (for which read cost-cutting), &quot;change&quot; (for change&apos;s sake) and &quot;modernisation&quot;. While, today, none of us would take seriously politicians who bandy such weasel words about, these were quite the thing in the 60s. Especially when it came to railways. When St Pancras was threatened with destruction in 1966, eminent architectural historians - including Nikolaus Pevsner and tireless conservationists, notably John Betjeman - fought a vigorous campaign to shame British Railways and Harold Wilson&apos;s government. Only a few years earlier, London had lost the world-famous Euston Arch. This time, the conservation lobby had developed the teeth of a great white shark and the grip of a bulldog. St Pancras was listed Grade 1, the same status as those other great gothic national monuments, Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster. Even then, such eminent historians as Sir John Summerson, curator of Sir John Soane&apos;s Museum, refused to support the cause. St Pancras was seen as vulgar, even by such critical eyes as Summerson&apos;s; here was a Victorian parvenu, a mongrel of a design in which Scott&apos;s faux-medieval spires failed to meet Barlow and Ordish&apos;s Victorian &quot;hi-tech&quot; train shed with any degree of architectural conviction. This seems odd to me, as it might to you. The Victorian engineers&apos; roof at St Pancras forms a pointed arch and has always seemed the very model of a modern gothic vault, all iron and glass rather than medieval stone and marble. Hotel and station seem comfortably married. What Summerson, contemporary British Railways executives and so many politicians in the mid-60s disliked about St Pancras seems to have been that it reminded them of their essentially Victorian upbringing, all starch and nannies, ice-cold bedrooms, chivalrous tales by Walter Scott and morning doses of cod liver oil. This generation wanted to be staunchly modern. Today, a fully restored, boldly extended and slightly reworked St Pancras proves that we can have our boiled beef and our oil-drizzled fettuccine and eat it. Here, if anywhere, the worlds of High Victoriana and that of &quot;brands&quot;, digitalia and non-stop shopping come together in a most delightful way. As anyone would who has loved St Pancras station since earliest childhood, I came here again a few days ago with a degree of trepidation. This is where I had been taken to even before I went to school to see such trains as The Robin Hood, the Thames-Clyde Express, The Palatine and the improbably glamorous Midland Pullman pulling out past Victorian gas-holders and old goods yards. I had also been taken on a tour of St Pancras Chambers, as the hotel was known after 1935, when the guests were kicked out and replaced by British Rail executives. Scott&apos;s demeaned masterpiece was potted about with obscure railway offices lit by naked fluorescent tubes and separated by hastily knocked-up partition walls. I was happily haunted for many years afterwards by the spooky gothic stairs, halls, corridors and windows I had witnessed vanishing into a kind of architectural gloaming even in the middle of a bright June day. Years later, when I came to read Gormenghast, my mind&apos;s eye model of Mervyn Peake&apos;s frightening fictional castle was St Pancras. I&apos;m not sure, but I think it might have been his, too. I have to say that the business and design team put in charge of reshaping St Pancras for the high-speed railway renaissance, completing its task when so many of us are fed up with being treated like criminals and cattle in British airports, has performed little short of a miracle here. Although the whole caboodle - station, five-star hotel, costly flats inside the former Midland Grand - will not be complete for a few years yet, this fact will have little effect on passengers using Eurostar services. Passengers using regional rail services, however, might well complain that because the great train shed at St Pancras is given over, lock, stock and corbel, to Eurostar services, they have been demoted to platforms under a new, flat concrete, steel and glass roof, described as a &quot;magic carpet&quot; by its architects, set at the very far end of the station and seemingly closer to Manchester than Euston Road. But, then, this \u00a3800m, decade-long project has always been an almighty juggling act, and it would take the most curmudgeonly strap-hanger on the 08:16 from St Albans to St Pancras to deny the brilliance of what has been achieved. Alastair Lansley, a director of Arup, one of the four engineering companies that form Rail Link Engineering, the consortium charged with building the high-speed railway, has been the architect in charge of St Pancras for the past 11 years. One of the last of British Railway&apos;s in-house architects, Lansley, together with his former colleague Nick Derbyshire, was responsible for the 1990s redesign of Liverpool Street, another fine Victorian gothic terminus saved from demolition with more than a little help from Betjeman. Lansley excels in matching traditional buildings with contemporary design. Recently, he built a house for himself and his wife in Twickenham, Middlesex. From the outside you would never guess that this was anything other than a singularly handsome and immaculately restored Regency villa. It happens to be brand new. Indoors, the house is impeccably modern, with bathroom fittings designed by none less than Norman Foster, the architect who initiated the design for the extension of the train shed at St Pancras that was then handed over to Lansley to execute. &quot;It&apos;s all been a bit of an architectural and engineering roller coaster ride,&quot; says Lansley. &quot;Some of the engineers have been involved with the high-speed link for 18 and 19 years. This is one of those all-embracing projects demanding considerable planning and concentrated skill. It really has been finished, as they say, on time and on budget, and to a very high quality indeed. I think this is something to celebrate, and we&apos;ll certainly have lots of champagne on ice when the Queen comes here on November 6. &quot;The great thing is that all the different parties involved came to work with each other remark- ably smoothly. When we wanted to get rid of the original platforms and install a new concrete platform for Eurostar trains under the Barlow-Ordish roof, English Heritage couldn&apos;t have been more gracious or helpful. They&apos;ve drawn us up short here and there, and for the good of the project, but when I look back and think of what we&apos;ve dared to do here, I think the conservationists have been very generous.&quot; It was Lansley who had the audacious idea of opening up the station&apos;s undercroft - once used to store barrels of beer that were brought down in their hundreds of thousands by goods trains from Burton-on-Trent - to create a visual connection and passenger link between this vast basement and the newly restored iron-and-glass arched roof so very high above it. This move has been the making of the new station. Now, Eurostar passengers walk into the former beer cellar to check in to their Paris and Brussels-bound trains. This thrilling space supports the station and trains above it on a forest of iron columns. Daylight stream down from the great incisions Lansley&apos;s team have made in the platform floor. Quality abounds in this extraordinary public space. Rich, scratch-proof timber floors here. Stone flagstones there. No carpets. No McDonald&apos;s. The very latest in easy-to-use information technology. All this in Britain, the land of tat, executive homes, chainstore mania and shopping malls. &quot;I remember meetings,&quot; says Lansley, &quot;in which we said that the retailing element of the design ought to be based more along the lines of [Piccadilly&apos;s upmarket] Burlington Arcade than those of Oxford Street. So, we&apos;ve got the upper end of the chains here, mixed in with independent shops and bars, and all of these tamed by the architectural framework, which takes visual precedence over purely commercial considerations. We&apos;ve built new lime-mortared gothic brickwork from a purpose-made kiln in Nottingham; we&apos;ve cast new gothic door handles and we&apos;ve made new gothic doors for the shop fronts. So, although there&apos;s lots of brand-new engineering details, railway equipment, information displays and so on, the station looks all of a piece.&quot; This is all the more remarkable given the extremely complex nature of the project. Eurostar platforms and undercroft aside, works include a new concrete station beneath St Pancras for the Bedford to Brighton services, connecting the terminus with Luton and Gatwick airports; a modernised and vastly extended London Underground station at King&apos;s Cross St Pancras; new regional train platforms for the Midland main line and future services, aboard Japanese-built &quot;bullet trains&quot;, to Stratford and Kent; the restoration and extension of Scott&apos;s hotel into a five-star Marriott Renaissance; the construction of a new gothic wing by Richard Griffiths and RHWL architects as an extension to the hotel; and flats in the upper floors of the old Midland Grand converted by the Manhattan Loft Corporation. &quot;One thing we&apos;re really proud of,&quot; says Lansley, &quot;is that we kept the Midland main line running pretty much every day, so commuters were as little inconvenienced as possible. The other thing I&apos;m particularly pleased with is the fact that passengers&apos; progress through the station, from check-in to seats on the trains, is seamless. Unlike Gare du Nord, you don&apos;t have to go upstairs to then get down to the trains. The Victorian station will be very easy to use as well, I hope, as inspiring and a lot of fun.&quot; In its new guise, and despite the security measures necessary to keep Eurostar services safe, St Pancras will remain very much a public building. A common walkway passes through the Eurostar undercroft. Anyone will be able to come here to drink at the champagne bar set alongside arriving and departing trains, to meet beneath the station&apos;s new statues of reunited lovers and of Sir John Betjeman. The station will even boast a farmers&apos; market. &quot;We wanted to make this something special, something that the rest of the railway network in Britain might aspire to,&quot; says Rob Holden, chief executive of London and Continental Railways, the company that built and runs the British end of the Channel tunnel rail link. &quot;It&apos;s taken an enormous amount of long-term planning, but I think we&apos;ve got a station every bit as glamorous as New York&apos;s Grand Central, with the bonus that here you can see the trains. Now it&apos;s time to think about a high-speed railway from St Pancras to Birmingham, Manchester and Scotland. Given the lack of engineers in Britain, the complexity of the structure of the modern railway business and the ups and downs of long-term investment, that&apos;ll best be built in stages. But this is a pretty good start.&quot; It is - and I think Scott, Barlow, Ordish, Pevsner and Betjeman might all agree. Whether you have business in Brussels, a lunch date in Paris or are simply keen to avoid airport hell, whether you are a railway buff, an engineer, curious shopper, architectural historian or a Friday-evening champagne Charlie, the new-look St Pancras is very likely to suit you.

Even near the end of his life this former pillar of the 1960s underground press, and then critic, youth worker and inspirational figure in the charity world, was still jotting down ideas for what he called the Great Willesden Novel. The north-west London suburb would be peopled with families quarrelling in Yiddish, communists, Zionists and bright-eyed boys who read Dante, Marx and Heidegger in the sixth form of Kilburn grammar school. This is the kind of place Robins grew up in, not genteel or proletarian, but gritty. His father, a barber, had been an amateur boxer. His mother was a communist with a soft spot for Stalin, at least until Soviet anti-semitism became too apparent to ignore. This background gave her son an encyclopaedic knowledge of political ideology and boxing lore. Inspired by an extraordinary history teacher, Dr Walter Isaacson, he was also steeped in literature and philosophy as a schoolboy. Robins received a grant to study English at University College London in 1964. It was a liberation, from family and Willesden. He soon became entangled in a very different world. After a chance meeting at the Indica bookshop in Mayfair with Barry Miles, a legendary 1960s figure, he became an editor at the underground paper IT. Never a Beatles fan, let alone a hippy, he had a style more akin to that of a 1950s beatnik: jazz, poetry and radical politics were more his line than incense or flower power. He exuded a thrillingly working-class air to his mostly bourgeois peers in the world of underground papers, and sometimes played this up to his advantage. He took part in the 1968 student rebellion in Paris, returning to London full of enthusiasm for the situationists, whose ideas about transforming life through spectacle and art appealed to him. Later, he was involved with the squatters&apos; movement in Amsterdam. Spectacle was as important to Robins as poetry and politics. After a two-year break among the hippies, Black Panthers and anarchists in the US, and a stint of university teaching in Canada, he returned to London, where he contributed articles about Brecht and political theatre to various journals, including Plays and Players. In the late 1970s, he wrote history dramas for the BBC. But this was after a time of drifting that could have turned him into another burnt-out 1960s casualty. As he observed: &quot;The libertarian loony left scene of the early 70s was very strong on rogering and leg-over: it was a leg-over based scene. The centrality of leg-over.&quot; Robins did his share of leg-over, dope, not bothering to get out of bed, and so forth. But unlike most libertarian dreamers, he developed a serious interest in working-class youth, and was concerned that they were developing movements of their own, to his mind often in the wrong directions: the National Front and the like. This is where Robins really came into his own. His interest in sociology, politics and literature came together with a tough-minded compassion for troubled young people, whose sense of deprivation was often expressed in violence. He wrote several important books on disaffected youth: Knuckle Sandwich: Growing Up in the Working Class City (with Philip Cohen, 1978); We Hate Humans (1984); and Tarnished Vision: Crime and Conflict in the Inner City (1993). With Dick Pountain, he wrote the widely acclaimed Cool Rules (2000). He also actively tried to help, by working for some unexpected institutions. In the 1980s, he joined the Prince&apos;s Trust to design training projects for unemployed youth. In 1993, he became director of grants at John Lyon&apos;s Charity, where he dispensed money from Harrow school to youth organisations in London. An early death is always cruel, but especially so in the case of a good and brilliant man, who still had so much left to do. He is survived by his wife, the art historian Anna Gruetzner Robins, and his children, Daniel and Sophie. Dick Pountain writes: David Robins and I met during the most turbulent days of the 1960s counterculture - around the Paris May events of 1968 and the London Street Commune at 144 Piccadilly of autumn 1969. In 1970, we worked together on the underground paper Ink during its chaotic, cooperatively edited libertarian period. When that ferment fizzled out, we followed different paths, he into youth sociology research, I into computer journalism. Later, with families and proper jobs, we stayed in touch. Then in 1998, over a pint and a Grouse, we remarked that our children seemed to be reviving - unprompted, if not actively discouraged - many of the attitudes of the 1960s. In particular they had started to call things &quot;cool&quot; again, and we wondered how their criterion differed from ours. Such ponderings turned into our collaborative book, Cool Rules. Our tastes in music and literature meshed smoothly enough, but it was entirely thanks to David that Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan received their due. David never lost his urge to understand the way society works and to make a difference in it. \u00b7 David Nathan Robins, writer and sociologist, born November 17 1944; died October 6 2007", "sentences": ["Later, he was involved with the squatters&apos; movement in Amsterdam."], "title": "Obituary: David Robins", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/oct/12/guardianobituaries.pressandpublishing", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Voluntary sector", "Society", "Media", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-12T11:58:01Z", "article": "As air travel becomes increasingly tiresome and pressure to &quot;go green&quot; increases, a key concern is the perceived cost of switching from short-haul flights to rail. Can you really travel to Scotland, Ireland, Italy, Spain or Amsterdam as cheaply by train or ferry as by budget airline? The answer is that yes, you pretty much can, if you know where to look. First of course, it pays to be realistic about the cost of flying. The advertised prices look tempting, but the actual fare is often higher. Add airport tax and Air Passenger Duty (APD), and remember that Heathrow, Stansted and Luton can cost around \u00a326 return from London by train. The airport at the other end of the flight may be \u00a35-10 return by bus or train from the city it serves. Have you a baby or small child? Infants go free on trains and ferries, but may attract both a fare and APD by air. Have you any large bags? These now cost around \u00a37 each way per bag on some budget airlines, but there&apos;s no such problem with trains or ships. UK Within the UK, saver fares for the train are often no more expensive than flying once you consider these added costs. London to Edinburgh or Glasgow costs \u00a398 by train, city centre to city centre. That&apos;s not a limited-availability special offer, that&apos;s the regular saver return price. The saver has unlimited availability, so no need to book in advance, you can turn up and buy it on the day of travel. It&apos;s refundable if you choose not to use it, and flexible as you can hop on any train outside the Monday-Friday business peaks. Compare this with a non-refundable, fixed-itinerary airfare that might be billed as \u00a325 each way, but once you add \u00a320 APD, a \u00a326 return train ticket from London to the airport, \u00a35 for the bus at the other end and \u00a37 each way for you bag, you&apos;re talking over \u00a3100. In fact, if you book in advance and choose your moment you can pick up a London-Edinburgh &quot;advance&quot; train ticket for as little as \u00a315, or put another way, \u00a32 more than the train ride to Heathrow.

Amsterdam For Amsterdam, how about \u00a369 return from London by Eurostar? Alternatively, combined train-and-ferry tickets from central London (or Norwich, Ipswich, Ely or Cambridge) to Amsterdam (or any other Dutch station) start at \u00a329 each way on the daytime ferry, or \u00a359 each way on the time-effective overnight ferry with a private en suite cabin and breakfast included in the fare.

Photograph: Olaf Kraak/Getty It&apos;s not often that gallery visitors get the full red carpet treatment, but at last night&apos;s opening of the Andy Warhol retrospective in Amsterdam everyone got their 15 minutes of fame. Literally: we stepped onto a crimson stairway before being papped by a sensory blast of images and media installations. It wasn&apos;t just the art that was drawing the crowds. For one night only the Stedelijk became a performance space for Lou Reed, who was in Amsterdam for the opening of an exhibition of his photographs of New York. At the Warhol retrospective, Reed recited poems and lyrics, and dryly responded to an audience Q and A: &quot;Do you like Amsterdam?&quot; &quot;I love Amsterdam&quot;. (Reed has a sound fanbase here.) His opener, fittingly projected onto screens, proved a great example of how artist convergence can enhance an already great themed show. The memories of Warhol were precisely chosen, many drawn from Reed&apos;s 1990 collaboration with John Cale, Songs for Drella. The nuggets included a riff on Warhol&apos;s yearnings to leave his small town, for better skin, and musings on those &quot;images worth repeating&quot;. This was a finely pitched and relevant performance which enhanced, but did not overshadow, the Warhol show. Reed spoke about Warhol as an artist who quit the traditional art form: &quot;It is fascinating to me that someone who could really draw did not use that talent&quot;. It was performance biography and an improv piece between two collaborators: one very much alive, the other much remembered and reproduced. Recalling their first meeting, Reed talked of how Warhol emerged into his life at a time when he was &quot;very, very, very poor&quot; in New York. &quot;Amazing that of all the people to walk through the door there he was,&quot; he said. Warhol&apos;s relevance was emphasised by the show&apos;s design. Screens and mirrors were everywhere. Reed recalled how Warhol asked him during the recording of I&apos;ll Be Your Mirror why the song had to end, before deciding to loop the end of the track... &quot;I&apos;ll be your mi... I&apos;ll be your mi...&quot; &quot;Andy Warhol made the first loop&quot;, Reed told the audience.

Having recently had indie band the Futureheads guesting in the DJ box, Dust recently issued an open invitation to local aspiring DJs to spin a few tunes themselves - a slightly risky strategy, but, under Kenny&apos;s watchful eye, things should hopefully run fairly smoothly without too many instrumental B-sides getting an accidental airing. Patric Baird  \u00b7  Thompson&apos;s, Patterson Place, Tue 16 The Wombats Proudly Present... My 1st Boat Party Liverpool A ferry cross the Mersey may not be as wistful a journey as promised by Gerry and the Pacemakers if taken in the middle of October, but joyous Liverpudlian punk pop trio the Wombats are uplifting the commuter route. The band hold two boat parties to celebrate the launch of their debut album, A Guide To Love, Loss And Desperation, an album filled with their trademark harmonies and daft, catchy pop hooks. The band will be joined by several supports both nights - fancy dress and open to all aged 16 and over - and an afterparty follows Friday&apos;s trip at Korova with Jo Jo de Freq, Brendan Long and the Evol DJs. Marc Rowlands  \u00b7  Pierhead, Thu 18; Pierhead &amp; Korova, Fri 19 Buttoned Down Disco London With five years and a whopping 27 venues under their shimmering belts, Buttoned Down Disco has every right to have one hell of a blowout birthday party to celebrate. Making indie discos a nicer place since its inception, there are normally so many smiling faces on the various dancefloors BDD has graced that you half think you&apos;re about to be inducted into some kind of cult. And, in a way, you have been; all parties are invite-only and attended just by those who are in the know. If you fancy being one of the chosen few, all you need to do is sign up at the club&apos;s website. Oh, and buy the promoter a few BMWs. No strangers to the world of camp, expect glitter cannons, bubble machines, giant balloons and free cake among the grin-inducing indie, laugh-a-minute party punk and non-threatening electro.

The ban will go into effect within months and does not need parliamentary approval, Wim van der Weegen, a ministry spokesman, said. Shops that continued to sell magic mushrooms would be closed. Under the country&apos;s tolerance policy cannabis is technically illegal but police do not prosecute people for possession of small amounts, and it is sold openly in designated cafes. Possession of hard drugs such as cocaine, LSD and ecstasy is illegal. Mushrooms will fall somewhere in the middle. &quot;We&apos;re not talking about a non-prosecution policy, but we&apos;ll be targeting sellers,&quot; Mr Van der Weegen said. Psilocybin, the main active chemical in the mushrooms, has been illegal under international law since 1971. However, fresh, unprocessed mushrooms continued to be sold legally in the Netherlands on the basis that it was impossible to determine how much of the naturally occurring substance any mushroom contained. Mr Van der Weegen said that was also why the system proved unworkable. &quot;The problem with mushrooms is that their effect is unpredictable. It&apos;s impossible to estimate what amount will have what effect.&quot; Calls for a re-evaluation arose after Gaelle Caroff, 17, from France, was killed by jumping from a building after eating psychedelic mushrooms while on a school visit to Amsterdam in March. Her parents blamed her death on hallucinations brought on by the mushrooms, though she had had psychiatric problems. Since Ms Caroff&apos;s death other cases have been reported in the Dutch press. A British tourist, 22, ran amok in a hotel, breaking a window and slicing his hand badly; an Icelandic tourist, 19, thought he was being chased and jumped from a balcony, breaking both legs; and a Danish tourist, 29, drove his car wildly through a campsite, narrowly missing people sleeping in tents. Most mushrooms sold in Amsterdam are sold to tourists. After the health ministry launched a study, mushroom vendors suggested stricter ID controls for buyers, and strong warnings against mixing mushrooms with other drugs. But this week the health minister, Ab Klink, said that merely tightening controls did not go far enough. Murat Kucuksen, whose farm Procare supplies about half the mushrooms on the Dutch market, said he stood to lose several million euros invested in setting up his legal growing facilities. He predicted the trade would move underground, prices would rise, and dealers would sell dried mushrooms or LSD as a substitute, with no guidance for tourists. &quot;So you&apos;ll have a rise in incidents but they won&apos;t be recorded as mushroom-related, and the politicians can declare victory,&quot; he said.", "sentences": ["It&apos;s impossible to estimate what amount will have what effect.&quot; Calls for a re-evaluation arose after Gaelle Caroff, 17, from France, was killed by jumping from a building after eating psychedelic mushrooms while on a school visit to Amsterdam in March.", "Most mushrooms sold in Amsterdam are sold to tourists."], "title": "Ban on magic mushroom sales curbs Dutch drug policy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/13/drugsandalcohol.uk", "tags": ["World news", "UK news", "Drugs"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-13T22:58:28Z", "article": "Forget the bank and seek social guidance I recently re-married, acquiring a 21-year-old step-daughter who took a HSBC \u00a34,000 loan in 2004. HSBC sold her loan insurance for \u00a31,005, added to the loan. She was working as a care assistant, paying the \u00a3116.27 most months but when her payment bounced she suffered a \u00a330 penalty. She had a baby in February 2006 and left work. She then split up from her boyfriend and went on benefits which are not enough to pay for the loan and so she gets more &quot;\u00a330 fines&quot;. The total loan, with interest, was \u00a36,975 and she has paid back \u00a32,441. I have been speaking to HSBC on her behalf but the best it will do is a &quot;consolidation loan&quot; at \u00a340 a month over 12 years. The bank rejects my argument that the insurance was unnecessarily sold. Please help. LM, Suffolk  She needs social guidance more than a bank. She lied on her loan form. Although it was affordable, it was not for a car, but to pay off her then boyfriend&apos;s debts. But should HSBC have sold loan insurance to someone who did so because she thought it was a prerequisite to get the loan? In addition, pregnancy is a statistically likely work-stopping condition for someone of her age - but not covered by payment protection. HSBC says it had been willing to write-off the loan insurance but the file was mislaid. Now, after Capital Letters intervened, it was found. This will reduce her debt by \u00a31,123 to \u00a33,411. There is a further \u00a3700 or so in penalty charges - a decision which will have to wait until the Office of Fair Trading case against the banks is resolved. But in the meantime, HSBC has passed her case to a debt collector who will come to a new monthly repayment schedule - likely to be no more than \u00a310 a month. She could do with some further help, however. Her current \u00a3140-a-month on cigarettes out of \u00a3440 a month benefits is simply not sustainable - or healthy.  Abbey refused to pay the funeral bill I have been looking after an elderly friend, moving him to sheltered care and dealing with his doctors and social workers. He died in mid-August without a will or any known relatives. It fell upon me to organise his funeral - a firm of green undertakers took security from the fact his Abbey account had \u00a320,000 in it. The funeral cost \u00a32,140. But despite showing Abbey the death certificate, it has not paid the bill. Now the undertaker is chasing me for the money.  What should I do?  BE, London  Banks will generally release funds for funeral expenses even though probate has not been completed - this can take months in any case. There is no reason why Abbey should not have done this - you produced a death certificate, invoice and identification. But Abbey&apos;s bereavement office, which has had administrative problems, refused to release the funds unless you signed a declaration that you were the executor or beneficiary. You are neither - your only interest was to give a lonely person a decent funeral. Abbey relented but could not issue a cheque due to an unexplained &quot;systems malfunction&quot;. It suggested asking the local council for help with funeral costs. This was not helpful idea as it would be means-tested - it really is for &quot;paupers&quot; - not those with \u00a320,000. There is no reason why you should pay, even if you could afford it, as there would be no guarantee of getting your money back. It&apos;s another example of Abbey service that needs improving. Eventually, thanks to this column&apos;s intervention, Abbey paid out the \u00a32,140. It will apologise and send you \u00a350 - so you will be able to plant something on his grave. This is no scam - do reply to Faraday I received an unsolicited letter from Faraday Tracing Services asking me to confirm my identity for a &quot;pension scheme arrangement.&quot; Is this a scam? DS, Hertfordshire  No. Faraday, which has been around since 1973, is a specialist pensions tracing company which covers &quot;mortality screening&quot; and finding missing beneficiaries. You are on the voting list and share the most common surname in England which is why Faraday approached you - almost certainly to eliminate you from further enquiries. You are not legally obliged to reply but if you do, it will either prevent wrong payments to a dead person or help find an intended beneficiary. Pouring trouble on our festival plans In July four of us bought tickets for the Glade Festival in Newbury. We had booked a tipi to stay in with Hearthworks paying \u00a3532. When we were half way there, one of its employees called to warn us it could not guarantee the state of the tipi due to heavy rain. So we went home - we wanted a guarantee of shelter.  We know we have lost what we paid for our Glade tickets, but can we get our \u00a3532 back. FI, Birmingham  There was obviously confusion over the initial call. The Glade festival of &quot;cutting edge electronic music&quot; went ahead and most tipis were problem free despite appalling rainfall - the worst in a generation. Hearthworks should have made your options clearer - and had easier-to-understand terms. Hearthworks itself is a small, young company which had never faced a serious weather challenge before. It was not geared to dealing with complaints. While it says it has acted within contractual rights in refusing a refund, following our intervention it will send 20% of your cash back and offer a half-price tipi at a festival next summer. Why Mercury Glass was a real pane In 1997, I had windows installed by Mercury Glazing, based in Slough. The work came with a 10-year guarantee. This summer, with the guarantee period due to expire in weeks, I noticed a fault. I tried to find Mercury but could not obtain any response. So I turned to Cardif Pinnacle, the insurer which backed the warranty, for help. It rejected my claim because it said Mercury was still trading. The work will only cost \u00a3182 but why should I have to pay for it when presumably the cost of the guarantee was built into the cost of the windows? RG, Surrey  Pinnacle looked at Companies House which shows Mercury is a &quot;live&quot; company. So, the insurer argues, you do not have a claim as the insurance kicks in only when home improvements companies go bust. It may well be that Mercury is well and trading, but Capital Letters pointed out attempts to write to them at their registered address had produced no reply, while the phone number Mercury gave now belongs to a householder whose answer phone says &quot;this is not Mercury&quot;. As a result the insurer will now look again at your claim. On your bike to Paris and Amsterdam In May you took up my case after Eurolines banned my folding bike from its Amsterdam coach.

In the case of Tory politicians, think fishnets and maybe an orange, with TV presenters, it&apos;s class-A drugs and illegal loft extensions and with us, the ordinary folk, it&apos;s usually confined to two subjects: how much you earn and where exactly it is that you go on holiday.

If it&apos;s good, they don&apos;t want it to get too popular, and if it&apos;s bad, they lie: who wants to admit to having had a duff holiday? It&apos;s like telling people you have had bad sex. Which is where we come in. Below, some of the greatest travel experts in Britain tell us their best travel secrets. William Dalrymple on a hidden temple in Cambodia, Jan Morris on the pleasure of travelling alone, Nick Crane on the best view in Britain (it&apos;s on the Isle of Skye), Stelios Haji-Ioannou on Sifnos in Greece, Herbert Ypma - Mr Hip Hotels himself - on Sri Lanka, and the founder of Lonely Planet, Tony Wheeler, on the unlikely delights of Albania. 1 Ta ProhmHidden deep in a jungle overrun by parrots, cicadas and banyan trees is a magical 12th-century temple. Writer William Dalrymple journeys into the heart of medieval Cambodia I know nowhere more secretive, more lost-in-the-forest, or more mysteriously, darkly lovely than the Khmer temple complex of Ta Prohm, a few miles&apos; hike into the jungle from Angkor Wat. Angkor itself is one of the great ruins of the world; but surrounded as it is now by grass and parkland and a moated lake, it feels magnificently grand, like a Cambodian Blenheim or a Khmer Castle Howard; and by necessity, given its fame, it is attended by ticket offices and little cabins selling postcards and guidebooks and fizzy drinks. Ta Prohm, by contrast, is hidden deep in the jungle, and is still wildly, magnificently, hopelessly overgrown - a Sleeping Beauty of a temple complex, tangled in a thick lattice of aerial roots and creepers. I visited with my family last autumn during the kids&apos; half-term, and we stayed in the King of Cambodia&apos;s old guest house there, now the understatedly stylish Amansara Hotel. Things got off to a good start when we were met at Siem Reap airfield by King Sihanouk&apos;s old pre-war Mercedes limousine which Amansara had sent to meet us. So unusually gentle, peaceful and friendly were the Cambodians we met - the smiling schoolchildren and the beautiful village women on their way to market - that my children simply refused to believe the stories I tried to tell them of the old days of the Khmer Rouge and the Killing Fields. Only when we visited the Siem Reap crocodile farm did they really begin to understand the horrors that this country so recently underwent. The Khmer Rouge had used the farm as an execution ground, throwing their bound prisoners to the crocs, and the old ones - evil looking things - still retain their taste for human flesh. When my small children crossed the bridge over the pens from which captives were once thrown, they were greeted by a ricochet of hopefully snapping jaws. Ta Prohm was a world away from these dark associations. To get there we trekked through thick monsoon-green jungle for an hour, as the children saw huge centipedes, squawking parrots, cicadas as loud as car alarms, hooting geckos and, best of all, a green poisonous snake hunting a lizard, one of the highlights of the trip for them. But it was the temple which made the biggest impact on me. It was late evening by the time we finally got there, and the sun was setting. Suddenly, out of the trees, a mountain of masonry rose in successive ranges from the jungle - a great tumbling scree of plinths and capitals, octagonal pillars and lotus jambs. Trees spiralled out of the barrel vaults of the shingled temple roofs like the flying buttresses of a Gothic cathedral; branches knotted over Sanskrit inscriptions, before curving around the bas reliefs of lions and elephants, gods and goldlings, sprites and tree spirits. Snake-like tendrils of pepper vines fingered their way through window frames and up door jambs. Cracked lintels covered in mosses and bright lichens were supported by the roots of 1,000-year-old banyan trees, which wrapped their way over broken arcades, coiling in spirals like the tail of some slumbering guardian dragon. Roots like fused spiders&apos; webs gripped fallen finials and crumbling friezes of bare-breasted dancing girls in girdles and anklets, spear-holding warriors in war chariots, and long-haired, cross-legged meditating sages. As the shadows lengthened, we wandered through terraces and overgrown galleries, narrow corridors and dark staircases, courtyard after courtyard, the sculptures gradually losing their definition, crumbling into shadows of dusk. Darkness fell, and it was by the light of a torch that we saw the eeriest sight of all: the 40ft-high face of the temple&apos;s 12th-century founder, Jayavarman VII, impressed into the monsoon-stained ashlar of one of the temple spires. He looked out into the night, with his full lips and firm chin, broad nose and prominent forehead, his eyes closed in meditation, expression impassive but powerful, pensive and philosophical, both monk and ruler, enlightened incarnation and megalomaniac monarch. The fireflies danced around us, the nightbirds screeched from the ruins, and the frogs croaked. A long walk back lay ahead; but we all knew we would never, ever forget this place. \u00b7 William Dalrymple&apos;s most recent book, The Last Mughal: the Fall of a Dynasty, Delhi, 1857, recently won the Duff Cooper Prize.

The pagan valleys of the Kalash, in Pakistan&apos;s Northwest Frontier province, are such a place. Cut off from the rest of the country by high mountain passes - and by snow for six months of the year - the Kalash people inhabit three narrow and picturesque valleys that border the Afghan frontier. They claim to be descended from the armies of Alexander the Great and still worship a plethora of ancestral gods. They hold colourful religious festivals, sacrifice animals and place effigies over the graves of their dead. I first stumbled across the Kalash in 1996. Much relieved to be leaving eastern Afghanistan&apos;s wild border regions, I watched as the valleys of the Kalash emerged over an icy, snow-clad pass. Lush and green, with laden fruit trees and well-fed animals, there was a sense of freedom and calm, of a people at one with themselves and nature. Most of all there was a sense of safety. I put down my bags and stayed three months. It was Saifullah Jan, the chief spokesperson for the Kalash, who suggested I bring tourists to visit the valleys. Later, in October 2001, I was given land by the Kalash to build my own traditional home on a stunning ridge high above the valley. Over the years I have seen many political situations come and go, and yet the lands of the Kalash remain unchanged, seemingly impervious to the geopolitical shenanigans that surround them. wildfrontiers.co.uk 3 Leptis MagnaIt makes the Roman ruins of Syria look like sandcastles...but where&apos;s the bar? Travel writer Geoff Dyer feels a few mod cons could be the making of Leptis Magna in Libya I often find myself wishing I was back in Libya, specifically on the coast, east of Tripoli, in the Roman ruins at Leptis Magna. I stayed in a filthy hotel, the food was vile, but the ruins were amazing. Since then I&apos;ve visited Palmyra in Syria and Baalbek in Lebanon which, though undoubtedly impressive, are rather limited and disappointing by comparison. Leptis Magna is huge. You can spend ages roaming through the various parts of the site. The fact that it&apos;s not very tourist-friendly (or at least it wasn&apos;t on my last visit, a few years ago) means that you can have the place more or less to yourself and can zone out in antiquity. Having said that, a little tasteful development would not go amiss, just so a fellow has something to do of an evening. By development I mean a touch of Ibiza: occasional parties in the Severan Forum or the amphitheatre, with DJs, strobes and four or five sound systems. Maybe just twice a year. Or on the night of the full moon. Or just Saturdays. And, ideally, a lovely boutique hotel not far away, with crisp clean sheets and a special dispensation - from Libya&apos;s total ban on alcohol - permitting the sale of a range of refreshing, imported lagers. \u00b7 Geoff Dyer&apos;s Yoga for People Who Can&apos;t Be Bothered to Do It is published by Abacus 4 MawddachWhere the sea meets the sky... The editor of Cool Camping, Jonathan Knight, pitches up in an awe-inspiring corner of Snowdonia An expanse of pasture and woodland in the slice of solitude that is Snowdonia&apos;s Mawddach estuary, Graig-Wen Campsite is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful spots in Britain. Being tidal, the waterscape is constantly changing: marshy, grassy flats become lethargic, meandering rivulets which are then lost to the swell of high tide - when a full reach of shimmering waters reflect the rich, green woodlands all around. As a Site of Scientific Interest, the area is delightfully undeveloped, which leads to a magical stillness, a calm and tranquillity that&apos;s hard to find anywhere in these busy Isles - least of all just two hours&apos; drive from Birmingham. The absence of man and the blend of woodland and wetland allows the wildlife to flourish, and this is a popular spot for twitchers on the lookout for buzzards, woodpeckers or Peregrine Falcons. The real beauty of the campsite, though, is the freedom to pitch wherever you fancy on its 45 acres - down near the water&apos;s edge, inland among the shelter and privacy of the trees, or on the higher ground where the estuary views are at their finest. With all this ground to explore, plus the freedom to light campfires, it doesn&apos;t feel like a campsite at all, just a beautiful slice of countryside with a few tents scattered around. It&apos;s so hidden away that on our last visit there was no sign to indicate the presence of a campsite. Just keep this place to yourself. The owners seem to. \u00b7 Graig-Wen Campsite, Arthog, Mawddach Estuary, near Dolgellau, Gwynedd (01341 250 482; graigwen.co.uk) 5 Toros ExpressA first-class trip to Syria on the Toros Express is just the ticket for Mark Smith, founder of railway website The Man in Seat Sixty-One You won&apos;t find Syria in the average package holiday brochure, perhaps because it&apos;s not an average sort of place. It&apos;s an undiscovered gem. The souks of Damascus and Aleppo come straight out of One Thousand and One Nights; perched on a hilltop, Krak des Chevaliers is the best-preserved crusader castle you&apos;ll ever see, and the ruined Roman city of Palmyra in the centre of the desert is a world-class attraction. Getting there is half the fun, and there&apos;s no better way to reach Syria than aboard the Toros Express, which winds its way from Istanbul to Aleppo once a week. This epic journey won&apos;t break the bank, as \u00a329 will buy you a bed in a two-berth sleeper for the 868-mile, two-day and one-night journey from Istanbul&apos;s Haydarpasa station on the shores of the Bosphorus right across Turkey, descending a spectacular escarpment next morning out of the Taurus Mountains. Once across the Syrian border, the train struggles to maintain a break-neck 30mph, but breakdowns permitting, you&apos;ll reach Aleppo in time for dinner. Once in Aleppo, head straight for the faded grandeur of the Baron&apos;s Hotel. Opened in 1909 and in its day one of the most famous hotels in the Middle East - \u00a327 gets you a room where TE Lawrence, Agatha Christie or Franklin D Roosevelt may well have slept. And be sure to celebrate your arrival with a drink in the bar. The tiles are cracked, and the stuffing emerging from holes in the well-worn leather armchairs, but I can&apos;t think of a hotel bar where I feel more at home. Barman! Another beer. seat61.com 6 South GeorgiaStanding in a sea of black and white, Lyn Hughes, editor of Wanderlust, finds herself enjoying the company of kings This was complete sensory overload. With a glacier at one end of the beach, the huge expanse of Salisbury Plain would be an impressive spot even without the 100,000 or more penguins dotted along its length and up the hillside behind. Second largest of all the penguins, the kings seemed oblivious to us as they went about their daily business. Some were just chilling out, while others were in small groups, sometimes moving in formation, like ballerinas performing the pas de trois from Swan Lake. I was visiting South Georgia on an expedition cruise ship, the Akademik Sergey Vavilov. Situated more than 1,250 miles from South America and 950 miles from Antarctica, this crescent-shaped island is spectacularly beautiful and incredibly remote, with a population of just four people plus scientists, but a staggering amount of wildlife. The island is so far away from anywhere that it can&apos;t help but remain a travel secret. We&apos;d been told to keep a distance of 15ft from the wildlife, but the penguins clearly hadn&apos;t been at the same briefings as us and would waddle past at just a bird&apos;s-length away. Sit down, and you just became one of the melee, a blob of Goretex in a sea of black and white. It&apos;s impossible to visit South Georgia without immersing yourself in the Shackleton story. Having been trapped in the Antarctic pack ice for 10 months in 1915, Anglo-Irish explorer Ernest Shackleton&apos;s ship, The Endurance, was finally crushed and had to be abandoned. Shackleton and his men camped on the ice for several months until it broke up and they could take to sea in open boats. After several days they landed on Elephant Island, and the bulk of the men stayed there while Shackleton and five others carried on to South Georgia for help, an epic journey in itself, only to land on the southern or &apos;wrong&apos; side of the island, since all the settlements were on the north. Only Shackleton and two others were fit enough to cross the mountains that lay in their way. Walking through the night, they knew they were saved when they heard the welcome sound of the steam whistle used to wake up the workers at the whaling station at Stromness. Shackleton returned to South Georgia in late 1921 en route to Antarctica again. However, he died of a heart attack in Grytviken, another former whaling station, and was later buried in its little cemetery. We toasted Shackleton, knocking back rum as we gathered around the tribute-strewn grave. From here it is a short walk to South Georgia&apos;s museum, which is crammed full of exhibits on the island&apos;s history and wildlife, as well as hosting South Georgia&apos;s only retail outlet - quite possibly the remotest gift shop in the world. wanderlust.co.uk 7 Train travelTake the night train to Spain for a taste of real travel, says Rough Guides&apos; Mark Ellingham My travel secret - although it&apos;s hardly a secret since I&apos;m only too happy to share it - is that it&apos;s a lot more fun if your journey doesn&apos;t involve a flight. It&apos;s a hell of a lot better in terms of emissions if you can take a train instead of a plane, and it&apos;s a whole lot less stress. And it is not necessarily more expensive, once you have dispensed with the taxi to the airport, the taxi from the airport, and the rest of it. But where can you go? The answer is pretty much everywhere, if you check out The Man in Seat Sixty-One website (seat61.com) - and increasingly fast. Eurostar switches to St Pancras on 14 November, lopping 20 minutes off the ride to the Channel Tunnel, while all across Europe high-speed routes are opening by the month. If you live in London, flights to Paris and Brussels have been redundant for years, but now you can add cities such as Amsterdam (less than four hours from London, from December) and Avignon (just three hours on from Paris) to the mix. And there are a whole range of new rail passes for pottering about, exploring France, Germany, Italy, Spain in style, speed and sans stress. And sleepers, too - which always make a journey seem like real travelling. We took the overnight to Barcelona a while back, which was a great little trip: Eurostar to Paris, amble about for a while, then on to the night train to hang out in the bar (which is rather stylish) and have a late dinner. You give your passports to the steward and then wake up at dawn as you cross the Pyrenees. I think I might try it by day next time, though, since there&apos;s a new fast route. You travel direct from Paris and it is startlingly fast: once you reach Perpignan it is an amazing 20-minute commute into Barcelona. It all seems a far cry from my student InterRailing days, which I remember featuring endless stops at tiny intersections, for carriages to be detached and re-attached. What&apos;s not to like? 8 BadrallachDeserted beaches and cool mountain lochs offer the perfect Highland hideaway for travel writer Edward Marriott My favourite place is Badrallach, a hamlet on the northwest coast of Scotland, and a place where - come drizzle, sunshine or fog - I spent every summer holiday during my childhood. It&apos;s also, mystifyingly, deserted. Even in August, the mountainous soft-purple coast is one of the most beautiful and unpopulated places I&apos;ve ever visited, and even the most exquisite white-sand beaches, on flawless summer days, are seldom shared by more than a couple of families. Four years ago, my wife and I invited friends to stay with us there for a week. For us, there could be no better holiday destination. Yet we were nervous. Our friends were coming direct from the Mediterranean, where they&apos;d stayed in a private villa, guests of one of Britain&apos;s most celebrated entrepreneurs. Not surprisingly, we were concerned that a week spent in a tiny, electricity-free cottage could easily pale in comparison. Certainly their breathless stories of their week of luxury did little to calm our nerves. We heard how, every morning, they&apos;d wake to find the previous day&apos;s clothes laundered and ironed; how luxurious their rooms; and how flawless the view from the horizon pool. Not to be outdone, I set about demonstrating the charms of Scotland. We took boat trips through schools of porpoises to Gruinard Bay. We played cricket on the sand, football in the dunes and collected shells that litter the top of the beach. On other days, we climbed mountains and swam in peaty lochs. The weather got hotter and hotter. The last day of the holiday dawned clear and hot, with not a midge or cloud in sight. We crossed the loch by boat and climbed up the Ardessie River to the waterfall. The sun had warmed the water and we all jumped in. After a few minutes, my friend turned to me, with a grin. He indicated the view: the mirror-smooth pool we were swimming in, the mountains opposite, the cobalt ocean. &apos;See what I see?&apos; he said. Suddenly, I did. We were treading water in the most perfect infinity pool. And it&apos;s still there, and quiet as ever. Just don&apos;t tell anyone, OK? \u00b7 Badrallach campsite: badrallach.com 9 Albania The sun is rising on Europe&apos;s final frontier discovers Tony Wheeler, founder of Lonely Planet guidebooks Whatever happened to Albania? For decades it was the most extreme outpost of Communism. Then it was the final falling domino in the collapse of the old European order. Overloaded boats dripping refugees from every handhold sailed across our TV screens. Crazy capitalism was the next stage as three-quarters of the population gambled their life-savings on a nationwide pyramid banking scheme which almost degenerated into civil war. Then Albania simply disappeared from the radar screen. Whatever happened to it, I found myself wondering? Remarkably, it has bounced back. For a country that faced serious hunger in the Eighties after it disowned its Chinese benefactors when they turned soft on Communism, Albania today has an overload of bars, cafes and restaurants. The growing number of tourists is already leading to claims that this is Europe&apos;s final frontier. It has, after all, the Mediterranean&apos;s last stretch of undiscovered coastline, some fine Greek ruins (Apollonia) and Roman ones (Butrinti), a brooding mountain town of heavy stone houses recently listed as a Unesco World Heritage site (Gjirokastra). And, unbelievably, Tirana has become a bit of a party town, with Blokku - the district where the Communist dictator Enver Hoxha lived, once totally closed off to ordinary Albanians - at the centre of the action. Throw in an international airport named after the world&apos;s most famous nun and it&apos;s hardly surprising the Croatian coastal tourist boom is moving further south. When British Airways started regular London-Tirana flights last year, it was seen as a seal of approval for the country. There are even decent places to stay: Hotel Tomi Mangalem in Berati (2,000 leke, \u00a311) is a funky guest house and gets a rave in our Western Balkans book; ditto the Hotel Kalemi (4,000 leke, \u00a322) in Gjirokastra. And you can&apos;t complain about the prices. In Berati I picked up the tab for me and my Albanian companions. We&apos;d had soup, bread, salad, side plates of almonds and cheese, lasagne, cherries and slices of honeyed cake. The bill for the six came to 1,000 leke. Let&apos;s call it \u00a36 with a tip. 10 Sri Lanka A safari in the pearl of the Indian Ocean is spot on for Hip Hotels founder Herbert Ypma With everybody going to India and to the Maldives, Sri Lanka is the one in between that seems to have been left out of the equation. And yet in a way it&apos;s a combination of the two. You get the beaches that make the Maldives such a magnet, and you get the culture that makes India so attractive. But there are other things about Sri Lanka that are unique and, as yet, largely unsung. A six- to seven-hour drive south of Colombo is Tangalle, which apart from its spectacular beach, big surf and swaying palms is the gateway to Sri Lanka&apos;s wilderness and wildlife. One of the biggest leopard populations in the world is a couple of hours away, and so is an elephant park with more Elephas maximus (Asian elephants) than you&apos;re likely to come across in India. Then there are the mountains and the tea plantations, and the intact colonial charm of Galle Fort, all of which make a Sri Lankan safari a sexy alternative to a Maldivian suntan. Two of Asia&apos;s most beautiful and original hotels, Amanwella in Tangalle and Amangalla in Galle Fort, ensure that it&apos;s a Sri Lankan safari with style. hiphotels.com \u00b7 To read the second part of this article, please click here", "sentences": ["If you live in London, flights to Paris and Brussels have been redundant for years, but now you can add cities such as Amsterdam (less than four hours from London, from December) and Avignon (just three hours on from Paris) to the mix."], "title": "Twenty of the British travel elite reveal their best-kept secrets (part one)", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2007/oct/14/features.magazine47", "tags": ["Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-14T22:39:24Z", "article": "One of the world&apos;s first successful prosecutions against internet &apos;spammers&apos; has seen two men sentenced to five years in jail in Arizona.

The first of its author&apos;s eight novels to have been published in the UK, Mister Pip has had rave reviews in the US, won the Commonwealth Prize and been scooped up by publishers all over the world. &apos;Latvia fell last night,&apos; Lloyd Jones says when I meet him in Berlin, where he is spending a year on a New Zealand writers&apos; residency. &apos;Last week, it was Serbia, Croatia, Turkey, Greece and Iceland. I jokingly said to my Australian publisher, &quot;What the hell&apos;s happened to Korea?&quot; and he said, &quot;Oh, we sold it last week. I forgot to mention it.&quot; So looks like only the Inuit are holding out.&apos; The novel that has affected people all over the world is the story of Matilda, a 13-year-old girl from the island of Bougainville in the South Pacific. It is the early 1990s, civil war is nearing her village and most of the men and older boys have gone. Only one white person remains on the island, the down-at-heel, risible Mr Watts, who takes charge of the village school and, in the absence of any other teaching material, begins to read Great Expectations Dickens&apos;s novel was the first adult book that Lloyd Jones read and, like Matilda, he experienced it first as an enchantment, an adventure story, and only later came to understand its wider resonance. &apos;If you&apos;re from a migrant society, it&apos;s easy to see the orphan and the migrant as interchangeable. For both, the past is at best a fading photograph.&apos; As Great Expectations opens out its meanings to Matilda, so Mister Pip broadens into a consideration of post-colonial culture, a meditation on what is kept and what rejected, what remembered and what forgotten and the extent to which individuals can choose (to use a phrase Jones uses more than once during our interview) how to be in the world. Jones is a shaven-headed, burly and genial 52-year-old, the separated and re-partnered father of three grown-up children. As well as novels, he has written two volumes of short stories, a children&apos;s book and non-fiction, so international fame hasn&apos;t come in an early rush. This may be partly the fault of provincialism (ours, not his); as he says, &apos;being called a New Zealand writer is a bit like being called a Maltese writer or Falkland Islands writer. Straight away, you&apos;re diminished by where you come from.&apos; If it&apos;s true that anything he does tends to be seen as peripheral, then Mister Pip&apos;s success is all the more impressive. He is at a loss to explain what it is about this book that has touched such a nerve. &apos;I am not the right person to answer that. I&apos;m the guy with his head under the hood, tinkering with the engine, not the person who sees the car and thinks, &quot;I wouldn&apos;t mind a trip in that.&quot;&apos; This is an interesting admission, particularly given that at one point he describes as the centrepiece of the book the scene in which Mr Watts and his wife Grace, a scholarship girl from Bougainville, decorate their spare room in Australia. Each writes on the walls things that are important to them - place names, family histories, observations and myths - in the hope that eventually their daughter will be able to pick and choose from their separate cultures. This is the one scene that seems to me not quite to work. When I query the idea of the overly symbolic spare room scene&apos;s being the centrepiece, he backtracks a little: &apos;It&apos;s the centrepiece in the sense that it&apos;s in the middle of the book. And it was the centrepiece of earlier drafts. &apos;When I started out, I thought the novel might never leave that room. I saw it as a fresco about the future of the Pacific, where the dominant settler culture has pretty much been disbanded. It turned out that that idea was incredibly interesting to a writer and boring as hell to a reader.&apos; He realised the writing was on the wall, so to speak, when &apos;I read out some to a friend over the phone. I could tell from the silence at the other end of the line.&apos; Almost immediately afterwards, he says, the voice of Matilda came to him and &apos;after that, the book pretty much wrote itself&apos;. He had, however, written hundreds of thousands of words to get to that point. &apos;I had nine drafts and the last one had the working title &quot;Inventing the Pacific: Last Chance&quot;.&apos; I suspect Jones&apos;s novel resonates far beyond the Pacific for three principal reasons. First, because so many people in the world now have experience, either as host population or as immigrants, of geographical and cultural displacement. Second, because the novel is a passionate defence of the importance of reading as &apos;a deeply humanising activity&apos;. But the chief reason must surely be the contrast between the idyllic setting of Bougainville, a South Sea island where food drops off the sunlit trees - a kind of iconic image of natural bounty - with the savage butchery of the war. Both island and war are quietly conveyed through the engaging, intelligent, often understated narrative voice. The politics of Bougainville are complex and, even after Jones has explained them, I&apos;m not sure I fully grasp them. What is clear is that for much of the Nineties, the so-called developed world looked the other way while the island was subjected to a campaign of genocide. Jones tried to get there on a journalistic assignment after Papua New Guinea imposed its blockade in 1991 - &apos;I didn&apos;t try very hard. If I&apos;d succeeded, I&apos;d be dead now.&apos; He did spend a night in the wheelhouse of a ship with a soldier in the PNG army and the atrocities he heard about then are one seed of Mister Pip Ahead, he has the Booker and a meeting with the Queen, who always sees the winner of the Commonwealth Writers&apos; Prize. &apos;I feel I haven&apos;t touched the ground since I arrived.&apos; One of the best things about his success, he says, is that his backlist will now become available here. His UK publisher , John Murray, is bringing out three of his novels early next year. I wonder if the success of Mister Pip has raised the stakes for his next book, if he feels pressure to produce another novel to which readers will react as strongly? His answer, if it is truthful, suggests that writing books is a livelihood like no other. &apos;No,&apos; he says impassively, &apos;it has no impact whatsoever. I might write a book no one wants to read.

He and Arata Isozaki, a fellow pupil of the legendary Kenzo Tange at the Tokyo University school of architecture in the late 1950s, were the two most important Japanese architects of their generation. Kurokawa was liked and admired around the world for his effusive character, intelligence, generosity to colleagues and intriguing buildings. Author, philosopher, teacher, print-maker, speed-boat enthusiast and translator of architectural books, notably those of Jane Jacobs and Charles Jencks, Kurokawa was an intellectual who got to build in a big way. When he first visited Humboldt University, Berlin, and saw the famous quote by Karl Marx in the entrance hall - &quot;Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it&quot; - he is said to have shouted: &quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;ve been doing my whole life.&quot; With buildings as much as ideas. The ambitious terminal for Kuala Lumpur international airport in 1998, the curvaceous new wing of the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in 1998, the newly completed National Art Centre, Rappongi, Tokyo, in 2006, with its enormous undulating glass walls, and the exquisite, up-and-coming Maggie&apos;s Centre, Swansea, based on the concept of a cosmic whirlpool, are some of the compelling projects Kurokawa has been known for in recent years. His architectural practice blossomed, with offices in Tokyo, Osaka, St Petersburg, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and Irvine, California. Kurokawa made his name first and foremost with fresh new ideas about cities, technology, society and buildings. Shocked by the breakup in 1959 of Ciam (Congr\u00e8s International d&apos;Architecture Moderne), the Modern movement think tank founded by, among others, Le Corbusier, in 1928, Kurokawa and his peers created their Metabolist group. For metabolists, new buildings and new cities would be like organisms, although making full and expressive use of new structural and communications technology and modern materials. Buildings would be open-ended and able to grow, and asymmetrical, because symmetry implies completion; they would be receptive to change and even impermanent. Kurokawa made exciting Metabolist designs for a Helix City in 1961 based on the structure of DNA, and a Floating City, based on the same theme, to be built on a lake with connections to the new Tokyo international airport at Narita. By the end of the 60s, he got to build real life Metabolist buildings even as the idealistic group dissolved. These included pavilions at Expo &apos;70 in Osaka, and, more remarkably, the Nakagin Capsule Tower in Ginza, Tokyo. This took the form of a 13-storey concrete service core on to which were attached, with just four high-tension bolts apiece, 140 prefabricated studio apartments, complete with built-in furniture, telephones and audio-systems. In Britain, the young architects who formed Archigram, an architectural pop group of sorts, were trying to evoke similar ideas and buildings, although their enchanting designs for &quot;walking&quot; and &quot;plug-in&quot; cities and hi-tech living-pod homes never got beyond galleries of arresting pop art drawings. Most of Japan&apos;s cities, with the notable exceptions of Kyoto and Nara, had been either razed to the ground or shattered by allied bombing towards the end of the second world war. With the military regime and its penchant for stiff, European-style neo classical buildings vanquished, a new generation of Japanese architects had the opportunity to build anew. Kurokawa, himself the son of an architect, never forgot the day in 1945 his father, Miki Kurokawa, took him and his two younger brothers, Masayuki and Kiyohiko, who were also to become architects, to see what remained of his home city, Nagoya. There was nothing much, and he decided there and then that he, too, would be an architect. Noriaki &quot;Kisho&quot; Kurokawa was born in Nagoya. At primary school he was well known for making model aircraft and buildings. Educated by Buddhist monks at Tokai middle school, he beganto develop his philosophy of symbiosis that, in later life, saw him develop an architecture that was both eastern and western, sophisticated in terms of technology and yet, very often, in tune with nature. He learned much about architectural history and art at Kyoto University before making his way to the Tokyo University school of architecture, where he took a doctorate in 1964. Meanwhile, he had founded Kisho Kurokawa and Associates in Tokyo in 1962. Along with designing something like 100 buildings, Kurokawa wrote several seminal books, including Philosophy of Symbiosis (1987; revised 1991), which won the Japan grand prize for literature in 1993. Although most of his designs were shot through with a knowing cleverness, Kurokawa could design emotionally charged buildings, among them the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art in 1989. The heart of this many-gabled building is a void: this is where the atomic bomb struck the city on August 6 1945, killing at least 100,000 people. The cone-shaped, darkly lit Memorial Hall in Akita (1988), commemorating the expeditions to the South Pole by the explorer Nobu Shirase (1861-1946), is another moving design from a big-spirited and highly cultured architect. Kurokawa is survived by a daughter from his first marriage and by his second wife, Wakao. \u00b7 Noriaki &apos;Kisho&apos; Kurokawa, architect, born April 8 1934; died October 12 2007", "sentences": ["The ambitious terminal for Kuala Lumpur international airport in 1998, the curvaceous new wing of the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in 1998, the newly completed National Art Centre, Rappongi, Tokyo, in 2006, with its enormous undulating glass walls, and the exquisite, up-and-coming Maggie&apos;s Centre, Swansea, based on the concept of a cosmic whirlpool, are some of the compelling projects Kurokawa has been known for in recent years."], "title": "Obituary: Kisho Kurokawa", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/oct/16/guardianobituaries.japan", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-20T09:10:46Z", "article": "Richard Branson Entrepreneur Thursday, September 27 Arrive 5.30am from Necker Island to launch our new television channel, Virgin One, to find our house in Oxford decked out with fairground rides to entertain 300 journalists for the day. Sadly I have to leave for New York halfway through a set by the Cuban Brothers. Friday Arrive New York 3am. Do a shoot for National Geographic&apos;s explorers edition. Brief visit to Clinton Global Initiative to support Brad Pitt&apos;s campaign to get sustainable houses built for the homeless in New Orleans. Spend the afternoon with the other founders of the Elders [a group of former world leaders], planning our trip to Darfur. Saturday Arrive in Amsterdam at 5.30am, to hand out environment prizes, then leave for England and dinner with Gordon Brown. Joan and I must be getting old: we&apos;ve dined with six prime ministers at Chequers: Harold Wilson, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair and now Brown. Sunday 8am. Meet four of the Elders - Archbishop Tutu, President Carter, former UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and Nelson Mandela&apos;s wife, Graca Machel - at Brize Norton for flight to Sudan. Spend six hours on the flight mapping out what we hope to achieve there. The key challenge is to try to make sure the upcoming elections are fair and seen to be fair, or else war could again break out between north and south. The schedule is gruelling, with the first meeting 10 minutes after arriving at the hotel with the UN-AU delegation, then on to another meeting with Sudanese activists before seeing President Bashir at 9.30pm. Monday Up at 6.30am to meet opposition parties. Archbishop Tutu, as chair of the Elders, always opens the meetings with, &quot;I hope we can facilitate/expedite the peace process. The Elders have to listen particularly to those who are marginalised, the women, the youth... We are sitting at your feet to learn. You are the ones who know where the shoes pinch.&quot; Then further meetings with NGOs and ambassadors. People are critical of the way the upcoming peace talks have been arranged, saying the only people invited are those with a gun (the rebels). Tuesday Fly to southern Sudan to meet the new president. For 40 years the Christians of the south had been at war with their Muslim brothers of the north. Graca Machel opens by praising President Kiir and his people for the role they have played as peacemakers. Visit the only children&apos;s hospital in southern Sudan. No running water. No electricity. Flies everywhere. No mosquito nets. No kitchen. Peace must hold so basic infrastructure can be put in place. On to Darfur, where last night 12 of the UN monitoring force were killed in a rebel attack. Move through the town with armoured personnel carriers. Meet a government delegation. Archbishop Tutu tells the assembled company that the Elders are there to support them in their aim to escape the oppression of war and live in a free democratic Sudan. The Elders then sit down with General Agwai, who heads the peacekeeping forces. He explains he has been given no equipment by the international community to protect people properly. They are &quot;outgunned, outnumbered and could be overrun very quickly&quot;. Jimmy Carter wanted to know why the UN themselves don&apos;t own equipment for such an emergency. &quot;The African Union is being screwed,&quot; he says. &quot;They&apos;re being nickled and dimed. They are willing to put their own men and women at risk, but are being given no technical support from the international community.&quot; The Elders pledge to follow up with heads of state to secure support. Have dinner with young aid workers from all over the world. All of them incredibly brave. Sleep on a mattress crawling with bugs in a room with rats the size of cats. On top of my room are two men with machine guns. To our horror, the aid workers tell us that Sudanese security forces have found out who we are to meet in the El Fasher camp tomorrow and are interrogating them. Wednesday In El Fasher only three of 20 people we are due to see turn up. And these three are government officials. The other 17 from the refugee camps have been frightened off. Jimmy Carter and Graca Machel decide to find them. &quot;You can&apos;t go - it&apos;s not on your programme,&quot; a Sudanese security man yells at Carter. &quot;You don&apos;t have the power to stop me,&quot; Carter retorts. The UN official beside me says, &quot;Let&apos;s go or someone will get shot.&quot; In the end we reach a compromise for the tribal representatives to be brought to us, but the refugee delegation never shows up. They are too frightened to talk. As I walk, people shove letters in my pockets addressed to the Elders. &quot;The government is threatening and ordering us not to meet any visiting Elders from or assisted by the UN,&quot; they read, &quot;and in case we do talk of the suffering of our people, we will be arrested and tortured by government agencies.&quot; They go on to say &quot;our girls are being raped on a daily basis&quot; and set out a list of their needs. On the Elders&apos; return to Khartoum, they meet Bashir at 11pm. After a long debate, he agrees (as does Kiir) to allow monitors to oversee the elections. Thursday On my return I speak with Gordon Brown on behalf of the Elders and ask if the UK could urgently support the African Union peacekeeping force with technical support. He promises a quick response. The Elders have worked 18 hours a day for four days. They combine the energy of teenagers with the wisdom of elders. Noel CowardPlaywright This extract has been removed as the copyright has expired.  Lily ColeModel Sunday, September 16 Party at my big old loft in NYC. Clear up the debris, then fly to London. Economy (I&apos;m paying). I sleep awkwardly most of the way and read The Hunchback Of Notre Dame. Curled up in the corner seat, I feel more Quasimodo than Esmeralda. Monday Straight to Conran show, make-up, hair up, and me down the catwalk. Do a fitting, fall asleep in the bath. Have a drink with a friend and crawl home at 8.30pm. Get into bed fully dressed for a nap only to be woken by my mum 13 hours later (thank God for mums!) to run to Paul Smith show. Tuesday Wear my Potter glasses and walk that walk. Head to Isabella Blow&apos;s memorial - a beautiful, poignant service. Another fitting and a massage. Aaah. Run home for a cup of tea with my family, then to V&amp;A launch for Golden Age Of Couture exhibition. Wednesday Holistic Lily day. Osteopathy. Mortgage broker meeting (not so holistic). Acupuncture. Thursday Brekkie with Mum. Wander Islington with an Irish man playing with accents. Pick up Indian visa and pack my bags. Off to Naomi&apos;s charity show. Mayhem backstage. Faye Dunaway, Rio Ferdinand, David Furnish and Christian Slater amble with the models... Designer dresses and jewels pull the randomness and chaos together somehow. Quiet dinner, then we join the party circus; arrive late at Stella McCartney&apos;s, everyone has left, but it means we get to run around, dance and play crazy golf. Swing by Cipriani, then to Sadie&apos;s (Frost French) party. Last stop is Bungalow 8: too much for me, I&apos;ve a plane in the morning, so homeward bound. Friday Arrive into the hot, sticky air of Delhi. Absorbed in my crackberry, I hardly notice I am in India. At the hotel I balance my laptop on the toilet and watch Jean-Luc Godard&apos;s Breathless from the bath. Dream of cutting my hair off. Saturday Order breakfast in bed and listen to Bj\u00f6rk: heaven. At lunchtime I fly to Jodhpur. There&apos;s a big fashion show. Jodhpur palace as it&apos;s never been seen before: 30 girls march across the steps in a mixture of European and Indian designers. Juergen Teller and I escape for a walk and discover an abandoned palace garage. I climb the wall and Juergen takes a couple of shots. I don&apos;t notice the bruises until next morning. Sunday Have a swim. An Indian boy wanders by and cheekily asks me my name. I smile and pretend not to hear. Final moments filled with stress: hotel fucks up booking, airport queues are crazy long, and a dose of hardcore reality as poverty taps at my window... a hunchback; has the week gone full circle? Nicola BarkerWriter Friday, August 31 My mood of fractious anticipation over the Big Brother final (I have a \u00a310 bet at 10/1 on Brian to win, put on over two months ago) has been intensified by listening to a maddening discussion on Radio Five Live hosted by Richard Bacon. The standard, kneejerk argument that reality TV represents a - yawn - &quot;dumbing down&quot; of broadcasting standards is utterly predictable, and what it cheerfully ignores are four basic, obvious truths: 1) Reality TV is never just plain reality. It doesn&apos;t unfold randomly. It is always closely managed and controlled by a mischievous &quot;Super-Ego&quot; (the show&apos;s directors and producers). This higher echelon selects the characters, constructs narratives, provokes situations, then edits down the results. This is not a stupid or unimaginative process. It is complex and challenging and identical, structurally/creatively/intellectually, to the production of all quality fictions (be they literary, theatrical or cinematic). 2) Reality TV does not actually represent real life, it is a heightened version of real life. And what&apos;s so awful about reality, anyway? Aren&apos;t we all living it? Isn&apos;t it all around us? Reality is what inspires artists and musicians and writers to be creative. Are normal people - &quot;real&quot; people - not to be allowed to construct their own kind of art and magic by carefully harnessing that most complex and fascinating of all human resources: their extraordinary personalities? 3) Reality TV is, by and large, intensely moral. Immoral things happen, but they are generally worked out within the fabric of the show. When people do something unacceptable on reality TV, they are generally dealt with - very successfully and maturely - within the context of the programme. The problems with this format really develop only when people who are not properly familiar with the rules and cultures of these shows tune in randomly (encouraged by agenda-driven media high-horsing), experience things out of context and become confused. 4) Big Brother is watched by, on average, 3.5 million people a night. That&apos;s more people than buy all of the broadsheet papers combined, so why do these papers still persist in telling us that the medium is now bankrupt? It patently isn&apos;t. These same partial individuals probably think Brian is stupid because he doesn&apos;t know who Shakespeare is. What they are too blinkered to see is that Brian is a fabulous cartoon character, a joy, a modern-day Falstaff, and Shakespeare would doubtless have found his high jinks, genuine nature and malapropisms hilarious and addictive. Saturday I am buying some broccoli in my local Tesco&apos;s. A woman next to me bends over to grab herself a floret. She is shopping with her boyfriend, and as I step back to allow her some room, he reaches out his hand and - maintaining eye contact with me - openly caresses her breast. I look away, blankly (the woman doesn&apos;t react, either). Initially - as I continue shopping - I am a little shocked by what has just happened, then rather amused, then irritated. By the time I get back to my car, I am incandescent with rage. I am also perplexed by the incoherence of my reaction. My partner, Ben, is sitting in the car reading the papers. I describe what has just happened - and my complex reaction to it - and he listens, without comment. Then, when I have finally finished my lengthy diatribe, he sighs, feels for the keys in the ignition, glances in the rear-view mirror and murmurs, &quot;Well, I suppose he was just showing off.&quot; Sunday The Queen has been on TV and I have finally watched it and now feel monumentally depressed. Helen Mirren is great - effortlessly sexy, as always - but the film itself is a real turn-off. It&apos;s puny. It lacks the courage of its convictions. It&apos;s wishy-washy. This - highly lauded - enterprise promises to engage with one of the most important British cultural moments of the past 20 years. It should be heroic and screwed-up and vicious and ridiculous and angry - but it isn&apos;t. It&apos;s complacent and hollow and self-satisfied. Why grasp a nettle, I can&apos;t help wondering, if you&apos;re going to persist in wearing gloves? Tuesday Ben is being unbelievably smug after betting on the Klaxons to win the Mercury. I had a fiver on Fionn Reagan and think his tight, intense little performance stole the show. The next morning I am amused to hear the Klaxons&apos; bass player interviewed on the radio. He is funny, charming, modest and - after a long night on the tiles - thoroughly engaged. Then the DJ suddenly interrupts him, mid-flow, and asks if he &quot;feels bad that he won over poor Amy&quot;. Ye Gads. Is this what we&apos;ve come to? Thursday I am watching an especially bad episode of Ricki Lake when my editor, Clare, rings up to tell me that my book, Darkmans, is on the Man Booker prize shortlist. Seconds later, my agent, David, rings. In the background, as he speaks, I hear cheers resounding around the office as two other writers from the agency&apos;s stable are also shortlisted. &quot;Well done,&quot; David says, &quot;I&apos;m really proud of you.&quot; &quot;Thank you...&quot; I say (suddenly feeling all embarrassed and inadequate and English), &quot;although I haven&apos;t really done anything...&quot; &quot;True,&quot; he promptly agrees (with exactly the kind of unabashed candour that makes me cherish him). &quot;You just wrote a book a while ago.&quot; Louise BourgeoisArtist Monday, September 17 Xavier Tricot visits me at 4pm.

Wednesday Marie-Laure Bernadac [from the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre] visits at 3pm to discuss the installation of Maman [a 30ft 5in spider sculpture] in the Tuileries next March, during my retrospective at the Pompidou. Made new drawings for Paris show. Alain and Claire [son and granddaughter] visit and show me photos Alain took of an abandoned knitting factory in Queens; all that equipment going into the dumpster - sad. Thursday More red drawings... Felix Harlan comes, and we work on The Mother And Child print project. Friday Alan Yentob shoots footage for an upcoming film on me. The BBC also interviews Linda Nochlin and Helmut Lang. Michael GovePolitician Monday, September 24 I miss most of Gordon Brown&apos;s speech because I am myself speaking - at a lunch for the Community Security Trust, which helps protect Britain&apos;s Jewish citizens from anti-semitic violence. After working in my office, I head home for the joys of brushing infant teeth and reading A Squash And A Squeeze. Then I settle in front of the telly to watch The Tudors; I&apos;m assessing it for Newsnight Review. Myself, wife and mother-in-law sit in uncomfortable silence during a scene in which a young lady administers oral pleasure to Jonathan Rhys Myers&apos; Henry VIII. Memo to self: never watch saucy medieval dramas in presence of mother-in-law. Tuesday I speak to 100 people at Surrey Heath borough council business breakfast. I try to answer questions from local employers. The most difficult? &quot;When will the election be?&quot; I forecast November: Gordon will want to go to the country before things get worse. Train to London for a meeting at Conservative campaign headquarters, attend a briefing for our conference, join a meeting analysing the causes of Islamic radicalism, then head to Park Lane for the Carlton Political Dinner. David Cameron is speaking. He is brilliant: fluent, noteless, authoritative. Wednesday Up early for a pre-conference shadow cabinet meeting. My colleagues seem almost universally upbeat. But a 40-minute tube journey from Liverpool Street to Westminster takes the edge off our good humour. The afternoon is taken up meeting colleagues who&apos;re helping develop our policy ideas. I get the train back to Surrey, where I lend my support to a public meeting called to raise awareness of the UN Day for the Eradication of Poverty. Thursday I&apos;m interviewed by Nick Watt of the Observer. Ninety minutes of questioning later, I hope I haven&apos;t committed too many gaffes, then head for a meeting with Oliver Letwin. Oliver has a brain more powerful than any human&apos;s - his reasoning ability is faster than a Google search on broadband. Go to the Tate to record a segment for Newsnight Review. Kirsty Wark, Tony Parsons, Sarah Churchwell and I are there to discuss the Millais exhibition. I gibber enthusiastically. When I see the result, I&apos;m surprised how camp I look. I tell my wife. She roars with laughter. &quot;Did you expect you&apos;d come across as macho enthusing over delicate brushstrokes while standing next to a leather-jacketed Tony Parsons?&quot; Friday Drive to London for Newsnight and turn down a kind invitation to be interviewed in connection with my latest gaffe.

Up on a roof a British volunteer soldier, gun to hand, waited for what looked like an inevitable battle in the street below between the communists and his own leftist group, the Poum militia. At least George Orwell had a great view of Barcelona. He could see &quot;vista after vista of tall, slender buildings, glass domes and fantastic curly roofs with brilliant green and copper tiles; over to eastward the glittering pale blue sea.&quot; Orwell was not in Barcelona as a tourist, and this is the one lyrical description of the city in Homage To Catalonia, his memoir of fighting in the Spanish civil war. He had more urgent things on his mind than identifying the architect of those &quot;fantastic curly roofs&quot;. And in fact even today, when the fame of Antoni Gaud\u00ed is probably unmatched by any other architect, you can still encounter in the streets of Barcelona a Gaud\u00ed building you hadn&apos;t known about. It happened to me recently. I came out of the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia station on to a dusty, traffic-roaring city street and there, among the dense facades, was a house that bulged and warped, reaching up to a turquoise, green and violet elfish cap, like a fairyland roof in a children&apos;s book. The entire front was dappled with shards of technicolour tiles, bent into balconies, supported by massive stone limbs. At the summit was a tower topped by a bulbous cross. Was it a Gaud\u00ed? For a moment I wasn&apos;t sure, but one thing I knew - I was uplifted by this building as by almost no other I have seen. In his book about the architecture of another great seaside city, The Stones Of Venice, the Victorian critic John Ruskin makes some claims about architecture that can seem pretty romantic - until you encounter Casa Batll\u00f3. Human beings, Ruskin insists, by nature want to do good, not bad - and that is why we respond to the sight of true goodness when it is fixed in stone. Can architecture be morally as well as aesthetically beautiful? I can only say that on my first view of Casa Batll\u00f3, I felt the same sense of goodness and virtue that moved Ruskin in the religious architecture of the middle ages. And I realised it had to be a Gaud\u00ed. I&apos;m sure it was Casa Batll\u00f3 that caught Orwell&apos;s eye as he stood at his sentry post in May 1937. He was stationed near Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, where anarchists had seized the telephone exchange, and the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, on which stands Gaud\u00ed&apos;s unreal house, runs from there. What I noticed first was how magically it enriches the Barcelona of now. Cars rush past, pedestrians rush past, it&apos;s a fast city, not some toytown, yet here is this building that seems worthy of heaven itself, right on the street. When you look closer, it is not such an ordinary street. Gaud\u00ed&apos;s masterpiece is flanked by other extravagant fin-de-si\u00e8cle creations. One is a quixotic blend of Moorish fantasy and Venetian gothic, another has a stepped roof covered in tiles, like a Dutch merchant&apos;s house intoxicated by fiesta. These are the houses of rich businessmen determined to flaunt their wealth. They were built in explicit rivalry and in the glare of publicity in the early 1900s - the row of rivals was dubbed &quot;the apple of discord&quot; and the houses, too, had nicknames: Gaud\u00ed&apos;s was La Casa dels Ossos (House of Bones) because its columns look a bit like femurs. Critics and cartoonists mocked the intense ambition of the architects Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, Puig i Cadafalch - and Antoni Gaud\u00ed. A stylistic explosion was convulsing Barcelona 100 years ago. Gaud\u00ed is the genius of modernisme - not &quot;modernism&quot; as we now understand the word but a very different aesthetic, a distinctive Catalan version of art nouveau&apos;s florid response to the challenge of turn-of-the-century life. As is shown by Barcelona 1900, a major exhibition of this modernisme before modernism now on at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, it didn&apos;t spring from nowhere. Hundreds of years earlier, Barcelona had been the great sea port of the medieval land of Aragon, with its own language and a Catalan cultural identity that spilled over into France. Castile and Aragon were unified in the Renaissance, with the new state dominated by Castile. By the 19th century, Spain was a sad, ruinous place where Catholicism was violently enforced in an impoverished society left behind by the Industrial Revolution. Barcelona was different - it was dynamic, locked into European markets, and saw itself as a cultural leader of a Catalonia that had more in common with Paris than Madrid. Artists such as the young Picasso - who first made his name as part of a group of modernista dandies who hung out at the &quot;artistic&quot; cafe Els Quatre Gats - moved easily between Gaud\u00ed&apos;s Barcelona and the Montmartre of Toulouse-Lautrec. The &quot;modern&quot; style was deeply romantic, a smoky dream of city life. Perhaps the closest thing to Gaud\u00ed&apos;s flowing architecture outside Barcelona are the sinuous art nouveau bronze tendrils of Paris metro station entrances - one of which can be seen now in the Salvador Dal\u00ed museum in his birthplace, Figueras, near Barcelona. Dal\u00ed, proudly Catalan, claimed Gaud\u00ed as his true inspiration, and adored the &quot;terrifying and edible&quot; modernista style. So Barcelona modern was about finding a poetry for the new, turbulent world of the 20th-century city - and none was more turbulent than this. On the one hand, it was home to the nouveaux riches in palaces comparable to those of the Medici and Strozzi in Renaissance Italy, yet it was also a place of extreme working-class poverty. In 1909 the city was torn apart by riots - a foretaste of the civil war that would come in 1936 when Franco&apos;s army rebelled against a democratic republic in the name of Catholic Spain. This was what brought to Barcelona, centre of the people&apos;s resistance, volunteers such as Orwell. Looking at the buildings on Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, it is all too easy to see how the modernista style fits into this city&apos;s story. In the end the great palaces of Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner and Puig i Cadafalch are no more moving than any overt display of money. Yet that is not what Gaud\u00ed&apos;s Casa Batll\u00f3 feels like at all. It, too, was commissioned by a rich bourgeoisie, but it projects this extraordinary communal ethos. Some sense of inner coherence tells you even from the street that there are wonders within the Casa Batll\u00f3. In the hall, every wall and fitting curves, in spiralling, sea-like movements: you feel as if you are inside a deep cave. Books are filled with his technicolour ornament, yet the invisible is what matters most in Gaud\u00ed&apos;s architecture - the oceanic and subterranean sense of space it generates. He embraces you in an inner world whose contours are defined by construction so softly yielding that, walking up the broadly circling staircase, you feel as if you&apos;re being carried into the house on a gentle updraught. In an upstairs alcove, a tiled fireplace with fitted seats is sunk into a wall, a homely architectural fitting, emanating kindness and love. Gaud\u00ed, you might conclude, must have been a settled family man. In fact, he never married (though he had a couple of unrequited passions) and his life was one of fervent Catholic asceticism. He was born in 1852, the son of a coppersmith. His parents made big sacrifices so he could study architecture at the University of Barcelona. In a city obsessed with building, it wasn&apos;t hard to get work as an architect and he soon secured a network of rich, religious patrons, above all the industrialist Don Eusebi G\u00fcell. Catholic piety bound his little social world: once during Lent, Gaud\u00ed fasted so extremely it endangered his health. In other words, Gaud\u00ed is one of those whose biography tells you almost nothing about his work. That he was intense and disciplined is obvious from his achievement, and on top of the Casa Batll\u00f3 a white flower-like cross proclaims the architect&apos;s faith. But where do the dreamlike freedom and grave hedonism of this house come from? To enter its great front room is to be amazed that anyone actually lived in this heavenly salon. The ceiling is liquid, the swirling vortex sculpted into it making it seem to be revolving and billowing. The windows look out not simply on the city but on the city transfigured by massive stonework. The solid dissolves and space is given form. There&apos;s not a sightline that does not afford some new surprise, some subtle or bold pleasure. You pass through rooms that curve and wobble, up the blue-tiled stairwell of tenants&apos; flats, to a white, ethereal attic and finally on to that fairyland roof. Architecture is the art we all encounter most often, most intimately, yet precisely because it is functional and necessary to life, it&apos;s hard to be clear about where the &quot;art&quot; in a building begins. Architectural genius is not about conforming to a certain set of rules. The architect&apos;s greatest achievement is to make a building contain a thought. For me, there is something incomparably mysterious about entering a building that is the self-expression of a passionate mind. I&apos;ve lingered in the Casa Batll\u00f3 because for me it is Gaud\u00ed&apos;s masterpiece, where he perfectly achieves this sense of expression and poetry, yet it is a functioning house and apartment block. A poet doesn&apos;t have to include light fittings or doors. A painter doesn&apos;t have to put in a toilet. But an architect has to. The house has to work. To achieve that and to transform everything about the place into a unified work of art... how do you do it? You have to have an exceptionally strong vision, an almost mystical sense of purpose. This is why so many of the greatest architects - Michelangelo, Bernini and Borromini, Gaud\u00ed - have been deeply religious. You could say architecture is the best reply to militant atheists such as Richard Dawkins because almost all the world&apos;s finest buildings are religious. But Gaud\u00ed was not working in a straightforward Christian tradition. Far from it. Casa Batll\u00f3 is a place to live in, yet it tantalises the mind with the idea of paradise. Has anyone ever built anything as dreamlike? The answer is yes. The first time I visited Barcelona, I&apos;d just got off a train from Andaluc\u00eda and my head was full of Moorish mosques and palaces. I remember wandering in the Alhambra in the evening light, under its stalactite-like stucco ceilings, with the view of Granada and the blue sky seeming to float in the windows, and actually raving loudly, &quot;I&apos;m in heaven!&quot; I haven&apos;t been back in years, but I had exactly that sensation in Casa Batll\u00f3 - and not accidentally. Spain&apos;s heritage of Islamic architecture, unique in Europe, includes some of Islam&apos;s highest artistic achievements. Gaud\u00ed&apos;s architecture is inspired by Al-Andalus not just in its flashes of orientalism - his first major house, Casa Vicens in Barcelona, is a Moorish pastiche - and his use of coloured tiles, but above all in his shaping of space. You do not look at the Alhambra as you would, say, at the dome of St Peter&apos;s - you move through it, inhabit it. Gaud\u00ed&apos;s walls and ceilings are as oscillating and unreal as the walls of Islam and create the same rich sense of a reality on the verge of vanishing into pure spirit. Yet he&apos;s undeniably a Christian architect. The crowds spill out of the metro and press against the railings to look up at the cascading waterfalls and stalactites, the angels, boats, caves and trumpets that spill down from above, all sculpted in stone, much of it nearly a century ago, some of it more recently. Some English blokes sit on the steps talking about a boozy night. You don&apos;t have to care about the place to come here - the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is the necessary destination for every visitor to Barcelona. Inside people are queueing to go up the tapering towers and the shop is full of model Sagrada Fam\u00edlias, plastic forests of cones. But stand in the cavernous interior, where men are patiently piecing together massive white stone vaulting to Gaud\u00ed&apos;s design, and it is as if you were in one of the great and enigmatic cathedrals of 13th- and 14th-century Europe when they were still being built. In the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, he created not a building, but an experience of building. He started a process that has gone on ever since and will go on much longer yet - and it is a sort of ethical and imaginative education. I&apos;ve never been at a building site like this before, where the laying of every stone, the carving of every detail by modern artisans following Gaud\u00ed&apos;s plans, is a sacred, reverent act. Gaud\u00ed took on the commission in 1883, when he was just starting his career. In his lifetime he saw much of the facade finished and began the towers. It&apos;s a slow build, but not yet as slow as the gothic cathedrals of Cologne and Milan, each of which took centuries. When Gaud\u00ed started work on his sacred building, it was not necessarily the act of a mystic: religious architecture was very much in the mainstream of 19th-century culture. The wonder of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is that it does more than echo gothic style; it goes to the heart of medieval building, shared by the Moors in Andaluc\u00eda and the master masons of Salisbury or Notre Dame: that mystical belief in the nobility and grace of reverently assembled stone, that desire to build a temple worthy of the divine, to give the earthbound a glimpse of heaven&apos;s majesty. The Sagrada Fam\u00edlia instantly won over the city - but not Orwell. After the May days in 1937 when the Poum was outlawed, he had to go underground. By night he slept in gutted churches - destroyed by workers who believed Catholicism colluded in oppressing the poor - and by day he pretended to be a tourist. &quot;For the first time since I had been in Barcelona, I went to have a look at the cathedral... one of the most hideous buildings in the world. It had four crenellated spires the same shape as hock bottles. Unlike most churches in Barcelona it was not damaged during the revolution - it was spared because of its &apos;artistic value&apos; people said.&quot; Gaud\u00ed died in 1926, 10 years before the civil war began. He was hit by a tram and looked so poor and dishevelled, people thought he was a homeless indigent. But his building was already more than a work of art in the city&apos;s imagination: it was seen, rightly, as being somehow on the side of the people, rather than flaunting the church&apos;s power and wealth. An 1898 painting by Joaquim Mir shows starving, ragged people sitting around the building site of the unfinished Sagrada Fam\u00edlia; the painting is called The Cathedral Of The Poor. It seems Orwell was being politically as well as aesthetically tone deaf. Mir&apos;s scene of urban poverty resembles the depiction of the marginalised in Picasso&apos;s Blue Period paintings - his homages to the poor of Barcelona. Like him, Gaud\u00ed captured the tragedy as well as the pride of this city. He is the greatest urban architect of modern times, not just giving Barcelona its look but actively reforming the life of the city. He didn&apos;t only design places to live and pray, but sought to influence the life of an entire community - and succeeded. The only place that offers more fantastic modernist thrills is New York - but you can&apos;t call the greatest American architects &quot;urban&quot; designers. Frank Lloyd Wright&apos;s Guggenheim Museum is a beautiful artefact that does nothing for the city around it. Even the most amazing skyscrapers stand alone. Here&apos;s an amazing fact: in 1908 Gaud\u00ed was asked to design a hotel in New York. His drawings imagine a conical skyscraper reminiscent of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia&apos;s towers, but twice as high. It was never to be - but what would Gaud\u00ed have done for Manhattan? Would it have compared to what he did for Barcelona? To see a Gaud\u00ed building elsewhere - the Casa de los Botines in Leon, say - is to see a fish out of water. His buildings grow out of Barcelona and back into it. But what makes them masterpieces of urbanity is their unshakable, magical sense of giving. They give to the city, to the people. This is why a Gaud\u00ed odyssey has to culminate among the mosaic lizards, skewed Doric columns, intestinal passages, strung-out stones and wide, kidney-like terraces of Park G\u00fcell, the landscaped park he created on a hill above the city. It was planned as a private park for residents of a posh development, and inspired by English aristocratic estates - but it&apos;s impossible to detect an elitist iota in this most admirable of shared spaces. People glory in this place. Walking under the terraces, hiding in a watery grotto or hanging out on the great belvedere, you feel a freedom. From the terrace you look over the city that stretches to the blue sea. As it says on the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia - Sanctus.

Instead of ear-piercing, throat-rasping cheers, it was the defiant, comforting, loyal verses of the gospel hymn that filled the night sky over Paris. In the Stade de France, beneath the big screens at the Eiffel Tower, in the bars and the pubs, it was meant to have been diff erent. It was meant to have been the final whistle and complete, ludicrous, hilarious, beery, joyful chaos. The England team had been writing their own script from the start of the tournament and everyone had penned the final scenes . But after 80 minutes of long, hard, gruelling battle, the wrong team had imposed their own ending and it was the small groups of green and gold shirts who were shouting and singing and hugging. The favourites had won - 15-6 - and the bookies and the critics and everyone who was not wearing red and white last night had been proved right. &apos;It&apos;s still going to be good - we never expected to get to where we got to,&apos; said Darren Snow, 33, from Dorset, at the Frog and Rosbif pub in Paris&apos; 10th arrondissement. &apos;We are still going to get pissed.&apos; But for the South Africans, fans and players alike, it was what they had known all going was going to happen. All through the day, as more than 60,000 supporters poured into Paris - on trains, in vans, on chartered jets, on National Express coaches; via Brussels or Amsterdam or on flights to provincial French airports - there had been little doubt which team were the underdogs. Though South Africans had refrained from mentioning too often the 36-0 trouncing of England by their team just over a month ago, for every quietly confident supporter in green and gold there had been 30 nervous Englishmen. It was not the fear of defeat that was behind the chain-smoking, the nail-biting, the stiff -lipped generosity to the formidable opponents, but hope - a hope that in the end proved vain. For days, at the Gare du Nord, in the chaotic aftermath of French industrial action, there had been a corner just in front of the Haagen-Dazs ice cream shop and behind the serried ranks of darksuited &apos;greeters&apos; waiting for corporate clients that was, if not forever England, then at least forever Commonwealth. It was here the fans congregated, bought tickets, swapped tips and goodnaturedly jeered each other. It is from here that today, no doubt with equal goodwill, the South African fans will watch the English filing back on to the same trains from which they disembarked earlier in the week full of optimism and hoping that the odds could be proved wrong - that the astonishing journey of the England team over the last five weeks would end in an impossibly unlikely victory. There was never any bad feeling between the camps. Mark Maloney and his girlfriend Petru van Zyl - one in an England cap, the other in a South Africa scarf, one from Kingston and the other from Johannesburg - walked straight off the Eurostar on Friday afternoon and headed for the nearest tout. Five minutes later, with their wallets \u00a31,000 lighter and two tickets in hand, they headed into Paris for what, they joked, could be the last hours of their two-and-a-half-year relationship. &apos;There&apos;s a lot of talk about split loyalties,&apos; van Zyl, 34, said. &apos;But there are none in this relationship. I love him to bits, but going out with a roinek [redneck], as we call [Englishmen] back home, means I will be very, very happy if we win.&apos; In retrospect, it now seems, there was never any question about who was to lift the trophy. But a question about what van Zyl&apos;s reaction might have been if, by some bizarre chance, the Springboks lost provoked surprise. &apos;Then I&apos;ll be very miserable and probably very drunk,&apos; the skincare consultant said. &apos;But it&apos;s not going to happen.&apos; Few South African fans had ever wavered in their belief in their team&apos;s capacity to break England&apos;s &apos;grumpy old men&apos;. &apos;There&apos;s been a lot of media hype about England,&apos; Corne Geldenhuys, a 34- year-old plumber staying in a camper van 300 metres from the Eiffel Tower , told The Observer a few hours before kick-off . &apos;Their success has papered over a lot of cracks.&apos; And though Geldenhuys said that beating England made no difference - &apos;it&apos;s just a game and rugby will be the winner&apos; - others felt differently. Michael Smith, an investment banker originally from Rondebosch near Cape Town, who has lived in Kent for 17 years, explained what victory would mean to his countrymen. &apos;It goes a long way back, back to the Boer War and beyond,&apos; he said. &apos;This is a predominately white, Afrikaner team. This is the Afrikaners&apos; last stand and they have turned out in force.&apos; And in force they were, through the day and through the night. Arriving fans had scattered across Paris, groups in gold and green outside the Irish bar on the Boulevard St Michel, in red-and-white outside the various &apos;Frog and Rosbif&apos; chain of English pubs, on the Champs Elysees, by the Eiffel Tower. Bemused locals had looked on in wonder at the pints of lager gleaming on cafe tables in the sun beside croissants, brioches and ham and eggs &apos;\u00e0 l&apos;anglaise&apos; at 10 o&apos;clock in the morning. &apos;I never knew they drank so much,&apos; said Delphine Bouvier, a 29-year-old waitress on the Place de la Republique. &apos;In this country, only alcoholics drink beer with breakfast. I&apos;ve never had anyone order a pression and a ham sandwich at this time of day before.&apos; Daniel Gunn, 17, from Scunthorpe, had brought 62 cans of beer with him and had already worked his way through 35. &apos;I&apos;m not so confi dent about winning, but it doesn&apos;t matter,&apos; he told The Observer, wrapped in an England flag beneath the Eiffel Tower. &apos;Win or lose, we never expected to get this far. You&apos;ve got to just grasp the moment.&apos; By mid-afternoon, the scattered groups had begun to move, gradually at first . The groups coalesced, the red-and-white and green-and-gold shirts merging into packs, hordes, small armies, heading towards the trains, taxis and coaches that would take them, 60,000-strong, north across the choked Peripherique, through the tough banlieues and on to the Stade de France - and, they all hoped, a legendary win. For some, the occasion was much greater: the chance to witness the England side achieve the first successful defence of the Rugby Union World Cup. &apos;It is like being there for the end of the Second World War or the death of Diana or something,&apos; said Stephanie, 33, from Birmingham. Around her, hordes of Englishmen shuffled into the packed trains. The strains of &apos;Swing Low Sweet Chariot&apos;, were already sounding out, though the crush made the accompanying hand movements impossible. For many, the packed trains were just the latest stage of a journey that had started a long way away and a long time before - for some, with queues at the French embassy in South Africa, an eight-hour fl ight from Johannesburg or Cape Town and a long wander through a town they did not know. &apos;Everything&apos;s fine, except we got a bit stitched up on the accommodation,&apos; said Jan van de Meer, a 44-year-old manager from the Pretoria&apos;s northern suburbs, who was sporting a T-shirt dating from 1995, when South Africa beat the All Blacks to win the World Cup. &apos;But we found some compatriots who had got some hotel rooms from some Australians on their way home ... It&apos;s a bit cosy with us all in there, but we are fine.&apos; For others, the journey was easier, though the Eurostar trains were carrying a total of 25,000 passengers, the planes were booked solid and latecomers could only find places on cross-Channel ferries in the small hours of the morning. One group had fl own to the small airport of Dinard in Brittany before reaching Paris in a hired car. &apos;We just thought, &quot;Sod it, let&apos;s go and find a way to get here&quot;,&apos; said William Wright, 28. For Simon Davies, who had left Exeter at 6pm on Friday and driven through the night to be in Paris, it was the occasion that was important. &apos;Win or lose, we will have a party,&apos; he said. For the teams, if the journey to the ground was more comfortable, the wait for kick-off was interminable. After fi nal press conferences on Friday afternoon, the players had returned to their hotels. The Springboks spent the night at their luxury lodgings in Bercy in the east of Paris; the England team at a nondescript Marriott hotel on the outskirts of the city. By mid-afternoon, they had arrived at a stadium that was stunning in the clear light of a Parisian autumn afternoon. By the time the sun slipped away, all that remained for the players to do was to walk down the tunnel, mouth the national anthem and battle for 80 minutes to focus, fight and win. But though two teams played and fought, only one could win. And last night, as the 80,000 filed out of the Stade de France and another 20,000 settled down to drown their sorrows on the grass beneath the Eiffel Tower, it was the chants in Afrikaans that were filling the French capital&apos;s streets and pubs and bars, not &apos;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&apos; or &apos;God Save the Queen&apos;.", "sentences": ["All through the day, as more than 60,000 supporters poured into Paris - on trains, in vans, on chartered jets, on National Express coaches; via Brussels or Amsterdam or on flights to provincial French airports - there had been little doubt which team were the underdogs."], "title": "Field of broken dreams in the heart of Paris", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/21/sport.jasonburke", "tags": ["UK news", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-20T23:20:48Z", "article": "One in an England cap, the other in a South Africa scarf.

And there was little doubt which team was the underdog. Out of delicacy few South Africans referred to their 36-0 trouncing of England just over a month ago, but every one of them was quietly confident. &apos;There&apos;s been a lot of media hype about England,&apos; said Corne Geldenhuys, a 34-year-old plumber who had travelled from Oxford and was staying in a campervan 300 yards from the Eiffel Tower on the banks of the Seine. &apos;Their success has papered over a lot of cracks.&apos; And for every confident South African, there were 30 nervous England fans. It was not the fear of defeat that was behind the chain-smoking, the nail biting, the stiff-upper-lip generosity to formidable opponents. It was, in fact, hope. &apos;If we win then I will have been there. I will have witnessed sporting history,&apos; said Damien Treswick, a 28-year-old car salesman. &apos;If I get run over coming out of the ground, I&apos;ll die a happy man. It will be the best day of my life and that includes my marriage and the birth of my kids.&apos; For Simon Davies, who had left Exeter at 6pm on Friday and driven through the night to be in Paris, it was the occasion that was important. &apos;Win or lose, we will have a party,&apos; he said. Yet for some South African fans, matters were more complicated. Van Zyl and Maloney might have been remaining true to their flags but many who have arrived in Paris in recent days were definitely split in their allegiances. At the Gare du Nord, in the chaotic aftermath of French industrial action, there was a corner, just in front of the Haagen-Dazs ice cream shop and behind the serried ranks of dark-suited &apos;greeters&apos; waiting for corporate clients, where the conflict was clear. Michael Smith, an investment banker from Rondebosch near Cape Town who has lived in Sevenoaks in Kent for 17 years, said he was going to support South Africa - but &apos;it was a close thing&apos;. &apos;It goes a long way back - back to the Boer War and beyond. This is a predominately white, Afrikaner team. It is the Afrikaners&apos; last stand and they are turning out in force,&apos; he said. The 52-year-old&apos;s son, however, who has spent 10 of his 16 years in the UK, had both nations&apos; shirts in his baggage and was yet to decide which he was going to wear. Smith was proud to see his erstwhile countrymen on the streets of Paris. &apos;It&apos;s good to see the green and gold jerseys, to see these big, beefy guys, a few of whom have certainly indulged in a few boerewors [sausages] too many.&apos; For though the French have shown an icy indifference to the end of the tournament since the national side was knocked out by England last week - Le Figaro newspaper ran a total of four paragraphs on the coming final on its sports pages on Friday, and most of the coverage now concerns lurid claims about the business dealings of France&apos;s former coach - few locals could ignore the fans who had flooded the City of Light. They had started the day sprinkled across Paris, groups in gold and green outside the Irish bar on the Boulevard Saint Michel, in red and white outside the various outposts of the Frog and Rosbif chain of English pubs, on the Champs-Elysees, by the Eiffel Tower. Bemused locals looked on in wonder at the pints of lager gleaming on cafe tables beside croissants, brioche, and ham and eggs &apos;\u00e0 l&apos;anglaise&apos; at 10 in the morning. &apos;I never knew they drank so much,&apos; said Delphine Bouvier, a 29-year-old waitress on the Place de la R\u00e9publique. &apos;In this country only alcoholics drink beer with breakfast. I&apos;ve never had anyone order a pression [draught beer] and a ham sandwich at this time of day. And the women drink beer at breakfast too.&apos; At one bistro beneath the Eiffel Tower, a waiter explained with a patience rare among French waiters to a bemused group of Londoners that it was impossible to make a &apos;chips sandwich&apos; because the chef had not yet arrived. Daniel Gunn, 17, from Scunthorpe, had brought 62 cans of beer with him and had already worked his way through 35 on his trip. &apos;I&apos;m not so confident about winning but it doesn&apos;t matter,&apos; he said, wrapped in an England flag beneath the Eiffel Tower. &apos;Win or lose, we never expected to get this far. You&apos;ve got to just grasp the moment.&apos; By mid-afternoon, the scattered groups had begun to move, gradually at first, the groups coalescing, the red and white and the green and gold shirts merging into packs, hordes, small armies, growing into a solid mass heading towards the still strike-bound trains, the taxis and the coaches that would take them north, across the choked Parisian ring road, through the tough suburbs and on to the Stade de France and, they hoped, a famous victory. For some, the occasion was much greater than merely the chance to witness England achieve the first successful defence of the rugby World Cup. &apos;It&apos;s history in the making,&apos; said Stephanie, 33, from Birmingham. &apos;It is like being there for the end of the Second World War or the death of Diana. Or something.&apos; Around her, hordes of England fans shuffled into the packed trains, the strains of &apos;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&apos; already sounding out, though the crush made the accompanying hand movements impossible. For many, the packed trains were just the latest stage of a journey that had started a long way away and a long time before, for some with queues at the French embassy in South Africa, an 11-hour flight from Johannesburg or Cape Town and a long wander through a city that they did not know. &apos;We paid \u00a32,000 each and everything&apos;s fine, except we got a bit stitched up on the accommodation,&apos; said Jan Van De Meer, a 44-year-old manager from the South African capital&apos;s northern suburbs. She sported a T-shirt from 1995, when South Africa beat the All Blacks to win the World Cup. &apos;But we found some compatriots who had got hotel rooms from some Australians on their way home. Now it&apos;s a bit cosy with us all in there, but we are fine.&apos; David Elder, 31, from Johannesburg, said that he had no choice but to come: &apos;Rugby is a religion for us, so whatever sacrifice we would have made it.&apos; For others the journey was easier, though the Eurostar trains were carrying a total of 25,000 passengers, the planes were booked solid and late-comers could find places only on Channel ferries in the small hours. William Wright, 28, had driven from Manchester to East Midlands airport, from where he had taken a plane to the small airport at Dinard in Brittany before driving 300 miles to Paris in a hired van. &apos;We just thought, sod it, let&apos;s go, and found a way,&apos; he said. &apos;It&apos;s all so unexpected. It&apos;s just good to be here.&apos; For the teams, the wait was long. After final press conferences on Friday afternoon, they had returned to their hotels. The Springboks spent the night at their luxury lodgings in Bercy in the east of Paris; the &apos;grumpy old men&apos; of the England team at a nondescript Marriott hotel on the outskirts of the city. And then, by mid-afternoon, they went on to the ground. All that remained for England was to listen to the Queen&apos;s personal message of encouragement, to sing the national anthem with gusto, to focus, to fight and to win. Hopefully.

Here he is (1 min 02 secs) cushioning a deep cross with his chest in a crowded area, then nonchalantly swinging his right leg in an attempt to curl the ball back into the safety of his own keeper&apos;s arms. Sadly, his in-built attacking genius appears to have momentarily taken over, as the ball serenely sails into the top-left corner of the net. There&apos;s a better-than-evens chance Cruyff has always been secretly pleased with himself for the sick beauty of this. 2) Jamie Pollock (MANCHESTER CITY v Queens Park Rangers, 1998) If that own goal was typical Cruyff, then this one is typical City. Which other club would effectively be condemned to third-tier football for the first time in their history by their own player? A player who would normally struggle to trap a bag of cement, but suddenly found himself insouciantly flicking the ball over an opponent a la Pele in the 1958 World Cup final? Step forward - no, sashay forward - Jamie Pollock, who Edson Arantes do Nascimento&apos;d the ball over a confused QPR attacker and beat the advancing Martyn Margetson with a perfect looping header. The goal put City 2-1 down in a must-win game, and though Lee &apos;Superfluous Rs&apos; Bradbury equalised, a draw meant their relegation fate was no longer in their own hands - and sure enough, despite a 5-2 win at Stoke a week later, results elsewhere meant they were down. 3) Tepi Moilanen (FINLAND v Hungary 1997) It&apos;s unlikely the timing of any other comedy cut has been quite as disastrous than this. Deep into injury time, Finland were holding onto a 1-0 lead which would have seen them make the 1998 World Cup qualification play-offs ahead of opponents Hungary. Cue a massive scramble in the box (from 1 min 26 secs here) which ends with the ball being toe-poked past stranded Finnish keeper Tepi Moilanen and towards the line. Luckily for Finland, they&apos;d stationed a defender on the back post; unluckily for Finland, that defender belaboured his clearance straight into Moilanen to send the ball haplessly bouncing back into the net. One minute and 13 seconds later, Finland&apos;s dreams were in ruins, and Jari Litmanen joined the list of greats who would never play in a World Cup finals. Whether Hungarians still consider this a stroke of luck is a moot point, however: they were walloped in the play-offs 12-1 on aggregate by Yugoslavia, including a 7-1 home reverse. 4) Franck Queudrue (Bastia v LENS, 2001) Franck Queudrue suffers from judgment-impairing surges of piping-hot blood to the head more than most, though they usually result in the sort of ludicrous lunges that would shame Dirk Kuyt. But this time he chose to take his ire out on the ball; 40 yards out and facing the far touchline, the Lens defender swings his left leg and balloons a clearance miles into the sky, only to snap-hook the ball and send it arcing over the keeper and into the net. Luckily Lens were three up at the time and would concede no more, but in terms of cocking things up ridiculously under no imminent threat whatsoever - and in a position an attacker would require superhuman powers to score from - only Lee Dixon&apos;s famous slapstick blunder against Coventry in 1991 comes anywhere near. Though nowhere near enough. 5) Chris Brass (Darlington v BURY, 2006) A question for the gods of football: does a man not suffer enough when he hacks a ball up into his own face, sending it pinging back past his startled goalkeeper and into the net for this dark travesty? Does every last remaining sliver of dignity really need to be stripped from him, as he breaks his own nose in the process? Bury turning around a one-goal deficit with two in the last five minutes offers Brass no kind of consolation at all. 6. Janusz Jojko (RUCH CHORZ\u00d3W v Lechia Gda\u0144sk, 1987) Fair enough, it can be hard to control a ball when it&apos;s rolling at your feet, but when the thing&apos;s stationary and in your hands, there&apos;s no excuse whatsoever for dispatching it into your own net. Which is why goalkeepers who have done so have become bywords for hopelessness. Gary Sprake&apos;s otherwise solid career at Leeds is nevertheless defined by his Careless Hands incident in front of the Kop in 1967, while Troms\u00f8&apos;s Bjarte Flem is synonymous in Norway with shambolic goalkeeping after this infamous farce. But neither incident can hold a candle to the antics of Ruch Chorz\u00f3w keeper Janusz Jojko - because at least Sprake and Flem were attempting to throw the thing AWAY from their own net. What makes this even worse is that Ruch Chorz\u00f3w were contesting a relegation decider - one they would lose to suffer demotion for the first time in their history. Jojko never played for the side again. Flem continued his club career, though, as did Sprake, much to Peter Houseman&apos;s glee.", "sentences": ["1) Johan Cruyff (AJAX v FC Amsterdam 1972) It&apos;s typical of Johan Cruyff that the one and only own goal he ever scored is the most elegant in the history of football: a Total Own Goal."], "title": "The Joy of Six: own goals", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/23/sport.comment1", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-23T22:49:03Z", "article": "EADS yesterday quelled a revolt by small shareholders over mushrooming insider trading allegations and secured investor backing for its new international board designed to break with a past bedevilled by Franco-German rivalry.

For some reason, the BBC headlines its web story Huge pirate music site shut down, which is odd. I thought it was just a Torrent site like Pirate Bay, and only offered links, not files. Anyway, the BBC reports that &quot;A flat on Teesside and several properties in Amsterdam were raided as part of an Interpol investigation into the members-only website OiNK.&quot;  A 24-year-old man from Middlesbrough was arrested on Tuesday morning.   The IT worker was led from his home in the town&apos;s Grange Road and is being questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and infringement of copyright law. At the same time his employer -- a large multi-national company -- and his father&apos;s home were also raided.    Perhaps the police had a bit of free time between raids on a militant extremist bomb factory and busting a gang of crack cocaine distributors. Or perhaps they&apos;ve just been watching too much television. The fact that they billed this as &quot;Operation Ark Royal&quot; suggests the Cleveland Police have a perception problem. According to a more reliable source, Torrent Freak:  Following a 2 year investigation (or 3 month investigation, depending on the source) which involved Interpol, Police are insisting that OiNK was a pay site. Members were given the option to donate but this insistence that OiNK was some sort of criminal network where people paid to be a member is clearly untrue but it&apos;s likely that this is the reason the real police (as opposed to the &apos;copyright police&apos;) and FIOD-ECD are involved.   Jeremy Banks of the IFPI said: &quot;This was not a case of friends sharing music for pleasure.&quot; Yes it was Jeremy.    Indeed, the Cleveland Police&apos;s press release claims: &quot;This is big business, with hundreds of thousands of pounds being made.&quot; It will be interesting to see the evidence, because it must be true, mustn&apos;t it?

Photograph: Royal Academy of Arts/PA Who is the rightful owner of the Henri Matisse masterpiece The Dance?  The 1910 painting is Russian state property. Presumably the French would like it as a national treasure, even though they did not seem to think much of it when it was created. And then what about the claims of the ancestors of Russian textile merchant Sergei Shchukin - Matisse&apos;s great patron and the man who commissioned The Dance to hang in the stairwell of his Moscow mansion? On Monday it was announced that works from Shchukin&apos;s incredible collection of French and Russian masterpieces - confiscated by Lenin in 1917 after the revolution - will be the backbone of a spectacular Royal Academy show opening on January 26. There will be some 120 French and Russian masterpieces from the period 1870 to 1925 which will be loaned from the State Hermitage and other top Russian museums. Several of the reports about the show&apos;s launch zeroed in on assurances that the Russians are seeking from the British that the works will not be seized if lawsuits fly. The UK does not yet have an &apos;immunity from seizure&apos; law, though one is in the works and Russia wants a &quot;letter of comfort&quot; from the UK. Various unsuccessful claims have been made on the works by the Shchuckin ancestors in the past; there were claims by his daughter Irina in the 1950s and again in the the early 1990s. More recently his grandson Andre-Marc Delocque-Fourcard has made various claims for various works. Potential lawsuits like this and the risk of art being seized in lieu of Russian debts have made galleries cautious about what they loan. For next year&apos;s big RA show the Hermitage is loaning many of the works and I met its director, Mikhail Piotrovsky a few weeks ago on a trip to St Petersburg as part of a group with Ann Dumas, co-curator of From Russia, who says it will be a great celebration of the &quot;incredible dialogue&quot; in that period between French and Russian artists and Russian collectors. Sitting in Dr Piotrovsky&apos;s office, he told us that the &quot;world was becoming more and more difficult to organise exhibitions ... there are so many law suits from [for example] the second world war, the Greeks and Romans [ie the] Elgin Marbles. We need guarantee that things will be returned in time&quot;. It is possible that Russian art chiefs may be getting more anxious following the British press reports about the show yesterday. A few weeks ago however, Piotrovsky seemed pretty relaxed about any legal threat and pointed to the Hermitage&apos;s branches abroad, in Las Vega, Amsterdam and, for the time being, in London, as examples of how the museum was reaching outwards. He said it was a balancing act as the works with the biggest box office can&apos;t be loaned out too long without the Hermitage&apos;s visitors being upset, though he added that visitors who encounter Hermitage satellites often then decide to visit the vast St Petersburg gallery. Dr Piotrovsky was very enthusiastic about the upcoming From Russia show which comes to London after its current stint in Dusseldorf under the slightly less cerebral title Bonjour Russia. &quot;It is tailored to be a blockbuster and is also for people who think,&quot; he said. &quot;The Matisses and Cezannes bring the public in and then the hope is that they discover other artists that they did not know. I think this will be a very popular. It is a good political moment. Once again there is a hysterical relation between Britain and Russia moment.&quot; Vladimir Putin is one of the show&apos;s patrons, though my guess is that he probably won&apos;t be going to the Royal Academy in Piccadilly to see it. The show is quite a journey beginning with the realism of the so-called Wanderers movement of Russian painters that included Ilya Repin and Isaak Levitan. Then it moves to the great Russian collections of French Impressionist and Post Impressionist works, which were such an inspiration for the Russian avant-garde. By the time the show ends Russian art has become much more confident in itself and arguably less influenced by outside inspirations. The climax is the abstraction experiments of Malevich and a triptych that includes one of his celebrated black squares. So who should own the Dance? At least the Russians are being generous with loaning it (though Dr Piotrovsky said the accompanying work, Music, which is so still in contrast to the movement of The Dance, would never be loaned out). Some may find it ironic however at how nervous the Russians are at protecting the works given that Shcuckin&apos;s collection was derided by the Soviets and sent to cellars in Siberia before slowly emerging into prominence in the 1960s. Matisse biographer Hilary Spurling has written of Shchukin: &quot;He showed his collection personally, stammering in his eagerness, running ahead through the rooms, flinging open doors, making his bewildered visitors screw up their eyes to squint at Matisse&apos;s colours, urging them to imagine the whirling curves of the toile de Jouy reaching out beyond the edges of the canvas into infinite space.&quot;", "sentences": ["A few weeks ago however, Piotrovsky seemed pretty relaxed about any legal threat and pointed to the Hermitage&apos;s branches abroad, in Las Vega, Amsterdam and, for the time being, in London, as examples of how the museum was reaching outwards."], "title": "Art from Russia with love (as long as they get it back)", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/oct/24/artfromrussiawithlove", "tags": ["Art and design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-25T11:26:03Z", "article": "Sometimes you have to wonder about these &quot;insiders&quot;. They are the well-intentioned local councillors without which the In The News showbiz recycling scheme would fall apart. But who exactly are they? Industry whistleblowers, fearful of exposure followed by a sudden end to their high-flying careers? Or, and bear with us on this one, are they simply a bunch of PRs indirectly flogging a product and hoping to lend their spin a sheen of glamour by hiding behind anonymity? Take a moment to ponder that one. Come to a conclusion? No? Oh dear. Well, apropos of nothing at all, let us observe that 3am lead their column this morning with the sensational tale of how Duran Duran&apos;s video for their new single, Falling Down, has been deemed, in time-honored tradition, too hot for TV. It&apos;s a story which not only provides 3am&apos;s inspired sub-editors the opportunity to craft the headline &quot;Duran Duban&quot;, but gives the girls themselves the chance to allow an &quot;insider&quot; to write most of their story for them. Here, as Paulie Walnuts likes to say to Tony Soprano, is a little taste: &quot;The band are really disappointed that the video won&apos;t be seen because they believed it to be one of their finest yet. &quot;It&apos;s a shame because the film is stunning. It&apos;s very arty, dark and deals with the whole celebrity culture of rehab.&quot; Again, you wonder quite who this person is that s/he can a) be so knowledgeable about the project and b) be so passionate about it, but c) remain so determined not to say who they are. One thing is for certain, it&apos;s not the Duran&apos;s official spokesman, because he is also quoted in the article, saying: &quot;Unfortunately the first video has been banned, so the tamer one will be aired instead.&quot; Oh, did we mention, it turns out the band made two different versions of their scabrous and thought-provoking (not to mention thoroughly creepy, if our video dissector Anna Pickard is to be believed) video? Almost as if they anticipated such a palaver of publicity ahead of a potentially tricky comeback for a group of 80s pop stars? Oh, we didn&apos;t? Sorry, we meant to. It is with some excitement that we turn to top pop goth Vicky Newton this morning. As you well know, Vicky is almost as obsessed with Amy Winehouse as her lovestruck hubbie Blake Field-of-Dreams. Barely a day goes by without some Amy exclusive, be it about the clothes she&apos;s wearing, takeaway food she&apos;s ordering, or drugs she&apos;s battling. Today is no different, with the story of how Amy has pledged to give up the booze - for a few hours each day. Again the information is relayed by an insider, who seems keen to imply that Amy&apos;s problems are on the wane, while reminding us that the singer is still a troubled genius. &quot;This tour [Amy&apos;s currently singing her way around Europe] started pretty much as the last one ended. Berlin was a difficult time for everyone and we thought it was going to turn into another tour full of drunken and missed shows. &quot;But she&apos;s now said that she will not drink before her gigs for the rest of the tour. &quot;She stuck to it in Amsterdam, amazingly, and gave her best show of the tour yet. Everyone just hopes she keeps it up.&quot; It is quite a sizable commitment, especially for someone now as renowned for going on benders as Mr P Doherty, and everyone surely hopes she sticks to it. (In truth, it ought not to be that difficult to observe, as if she really wanted she could just keep drinking for 14 hours straight and classify the binge as belonging to the previous day.) But what distinguishes Vicky from her competition is the breadth of voices in her stories, substantiating the tale which, in other hands, might come across as so much flim-flam. Cue the first appearance in the British popular of Dutch concert promoter Jan Willem Luyken. Jan reveals that Amy&apos;s performance in Amsterdam was exactly as the insider suggested. &quot;She wasn&apos;t drunk when she came in and she did not drink backstage. &quot;I don&apos;t think she was stoned either. People were joking about her sober performance. They said, &apos;Has the wine bar been closed today?&apos;&quot; Oh Jan! It&apos;s been lovely meeting you. Here&apos;s looking forward to the next time a controversial UK pop star makes it to your part of the world! In other news, Keith Richards was drunk. That&apos;s the story that emerged from the Scream Awards in LA last Friday (and obviously did so very slowly as it&apos;s only appeared in the Star today). He was to pick up an award on behalf of Pirates of the Caribbean&apos;s Johnny Depp at the sci-fi-ish gong bash, but not only did he only send a video message, he slurred his way through it. &quot;No one was sure whether he was drunk or acting - but he livened things up,&quot; revealed an awards &quot;insider&quot; who probably thinks he was acting.

Born in Batu Gajah, Malaysia, Ivan attended school in Suffolk, then moved to London at the age of 21 to help run a cousin&apos;s business providing hot towels for Chinese restaurants, before moving into fashion buying, events planning and interior design. I first became aware of Ivan in 1997 when I was chair of Out to Swim. He took charge of our inaugural swim and made it a great success through his vision, energy and ability. He built on this experience by obtaining commercial sponsorship which provided team kit for 80 of us at the 1998 Amsterdam Gay Games. Ivan realised we had much to learn from teams from other European cities in encouraging lesbian and gay participation in sport. He then founded Out for Sport, an umbrella organisation representing gay sports clubs in London, and promoted its first multi-sport competition. He served on the board of the International Gay &amp; Lesbian Aquatics (IGLA) and represented London at the Federation of Gay Games. Before his illness he was forging links with the 2012 Olympics and the Mayor of London&apos;s office to ensure lesbian and gay inclusion. He persuaded the Out to Swim committee to sponsor a women-only session to encourage more participation, and saw the establishment via a lottery grant of a water polo team in 2000. One of his most remarkable contributions, though, came at the IGLA championship in San Diego this month, where he staged a Princess of Wales memorial event. This involved our team forming a two-foot wide black Aids ribbon in the pool, to the soundtrack of Tavener&apos;s Song for Athene and a voiceover from Ivan.

You can see how it might have looked from Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Scottish &amp; Newcastle was trading at 530p in the spring, before the bid chatter started, so yesterday&apos;s approach at 720p represents a 36% premium to old valuations. So, the pair might have thought, surely the offer has to be taken seriously; it&apos;s not as if S&amp;N&apos;s management has a large fan club. Sorry, chaps, but S&amp;N&apos;s swift rejection was not only correct but will be supported by its shareholders. A few critics think S&amp;N&apos;s hostility towards the would-be bidders smacks of Scottish pride, rather than a care for shareholder value, but the charge doesn&apos;t stack up. S&amp;N is doing what any company would in the face of a break-up bid: it wants to see if greater value can be achieved by managing the break-up itself. There&apos;s a fair argument that it could be. The half-share in BBH, the Russian brewer, is S&amp;N&apos;s prize asset and will presumably interest SABMiller and Anheuser Busch. The prospect of either getting involved may terrify Carlsberg, the joint venture partner. The Danes may be tempted to overpay to prevent this outcome; no wonder their own share price is so weak. There is a point where S&amp;N could be accused of pushing its luck too far. It can&apos;t frighten away bidders entirely because it knows that, when the dust settles, it has to deliver some form of corporate restructuring, whether by its own hand or others&apos;. But, at 720p, S&amp;N is on safe ground in rejecting advances. Carlsberg and Heineken are perfectly entitled to try to manage down price expectations, which seemed to be yesterday&apos;s main aim. But the killing ground, as corporate financiers like to say, is at least 800p, and probably a little more. Irresolute The deadline for bids for Resolution was 5pm yesterday. Standard Life had made an approach by lunchtime, but not a formal offer. Resolution asked the Takeover Panel for a 24-hour extension, but the City&apos;s takeover policeman couldn&apos;t reach a decision by 5pm. What were they doing? Presumably they were being lobbied from all sides, especially by Pearl Assurance, the rival bidder. But, come on, the Panel has to be prepared for some argy-bargy. Its reputation is built on its ability to make common sense rulings - and do so quickly. The extension came eventually, but what a mess. Standard Life gets a big slice of the blame. It&apos;s had months to think about this move and was obliged to arrive with all its documentation in order. Still, at least, the Scots got one thing right: by pitching their offer at 714p - a lowball price given that Resolution seemed to want 750p - Standard Life limited the damage to its own share price. Even so, this deal, if it happens, will require world-class salesmanship on the part of chief executive Sandy Crombie. He would be expanding his share capital by 22% at a moment when the share price is already less than healthy. At 276p, last year&apos;s float price of 230p is uncomfortably close. The time for Standard Life to strike was when its shares were well above 300p. Think of the synergies and cost-savings, will be Crombie&apos;s pitch. They&apos;d better be huge: for a life insurer to justify issuing capital at embedded value, the target needs to be screamingly cheap. Resolution is not obviously so. Clearing the decks Grovel, grovel, grovel. Rarely has a big British company issued such a humiliating statement as BP did yesterday. &quot;Our operations failed to meet ... the requirements of the law,&quot; it said about the Texas City explosion, the Alaskan pipeline leak and the manipulation of the propane market. It&apos;s quite a list of misdemeanours, so was the grovel worth it? Of course, BP had little choice, but the size of the fines represent very good business from its point of view. Some $50m for Texas City, with a guarantee of no further criminal charges, is light punishment, even when you consider the $1.6bn spent compensating victims. Some $20m for Alaska is a pittance. About $300m for the propane violations is not much either given the size of the market. For Tony Hayward, BP&apos;s new chief executive, this is a triumph. At a stroke, he has removed all the big legal uncertainties. Restoring BP&apos;s reputation as a responsible company will take years, but a clean start was a good way to begin.  nils.pratley@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["You can see how it might have looked from Copenhagen and Amsterdam."], "title": "S&N will have backing of investors", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/26/viewpointcolumn", "tags": ["Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-10-25T23:04:01Z", "article": "For a few fleeting moments in Interview, the new film starring Sienna Miller and Steve Buscemi, the camera rests on a vase of tulips, and a black-and-white photograph of a double-chinned Dutch man chewing on a cigarette. Though hardly anyone will know it, this is a picture of the late film-maker Theo van Gogh. It&apos;s also a quick signal from Buscemi, who happens to be the director here, to the audience that the movie is a remake of Van Gogh&apos;s 2003 film of the same name. No one involved in the project - the first of three American Van Gogh remakes - denies that it feels a little like an exercise in ghost-raising. Everyone has a story of how Theo, who had always wanted to work in New York, made his presence felt during filming. One evening, while producer Bruce Weiss was driving Buscemi home over Brooklyn bridge, the wind whipped up a copy of the New York Post, which opened on a picture of Van Gogh. Another time, the crew stumbled across a lorry bearing the logo of Van Gogh Movers - which was, of course, incorporated into one of the scenes. &quot;These were all good omens,&quot; says Gijs van de Westelaken, a Dutch producer who worked on both versions of Interview and an old friend of Van Gogh&apos;s. &quot;Theo was present all the time, in all kinds of ways. It wasn&apos;t so much comforting as very funny.&quot; Like most people outside the Netherlands, Buscemi had never even heard of the director or his films until the provocative troublemaker was shot and stabbed to death by an Islamist on an Amsterdam street three years ago. Death gave Van Gogh the international exposure he did not have in life; the outrage sparked by the incident catapulted him into the ranks of the most famous film-makers in the world. Van Gogh is best known for his controversial short film Submission, which he made with the Somalian-Dutch feminist and writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who went into hiding in the US following the director&apos;s murder. The film depicted semi-naked women speaking to Allah about the Koranic verses that are unfavourable to women. After it was shown on Dutch television in August 2004, Van Gogh and Hirsi Ali received death threats, to which he responded: &quot;Who would want to kill the village idiot?&quot; No one took the threats seriously. Two months later, Van Gogh was murdered by 26-year-old Mohammed Bouyeri while he was cycling to work. (Interview&apos;s UK release is timed to coincide with the third anniversary of his death.) You would expect all his works to be similarly controversial. But apart from his 1981 film L\u00fcger, in which a pistol is shoved into a woman&apos;s vagina and two kittens are spun in a washing machine, Van Gogh&apos;s films are best described as two-hander domestic dramas, reminiscent in their intensity of Pinter, Ibsen or Mamet. They typically centre on what he called the &quot;battle of the trenches&quot; between men and women, and are best summed up by the characters themselves, who make declarations such as: &quot;We don&apos;t believe in relationships&quot; or &quot;There is always a winner and a loser&quot; or &quot;We couldn&apos;t live with or without each other&quot;. Theodor Holman was the scriptwriter who worked most closely with Van Gogh. &quot;Because of his provocative nature,&quot; he says, &quot;people find it hard to believe that he was actually a champion of harmony. And actors loved him because he brought them into another gear.&quot; Buscemi says: &quot;I would have liked to have met him. I would like to have done this film with him directing me.&quot; But the irony is by no means lost on Van Gogh&apos;s friends and colleagues that it is only because of his death that his films are being remade in America. (A new version of his 1996 film Blind Date is being directed by Stanley Tucci, and his fictionalisation of the assassination of Pim Fortuyn, called 06/05, is being remade by John Turturro with the title 1-900.) &quot;It&apos;s a wry fact that Theo got famous as a film-maker after his death, while during his life he didn&apos;t succeed in doing so,&quot; says Emile Fallaux, the former head of the Rotterdam film festival and now editor-in-chief of the leading leftwing weekly Vrij Nederland. &quot;Now his friends are making the rounds, drinking champagne and meeting interesting people and producing one film of his after another - films that he had tried long and hard to get made in the US.&quot; The journey of the remakes began at the Toronto film festival in 2003, where Van de Westelaken and Van Gogh were approached by several producers interested in making US versions of Interview, which had been shot over five nights and cost a mere \u20ac150,000 (\u00a3104,000). &quot;It was always Theo&apos;s dream to come to America and make films in New York, which he was determined to direct himself,&quot; says van de Westelaken. &quot;But only because he died did it become possible to sell a Dutch project to them - otherwise it would have been impossible.&quot; Though the location has been switched from Amsterdam to New York and some plot details have been tweaked or updated, Interview carries the Van Gogh hallmark, thanks to Buscemi&apos;s enthusiastic adoption of his triple-camera shooting system. It was out of pure necessity - in other words, lack of money - that Van Gogh developed the method of running three handheld cameras simultaneously. Official bodies were reluctant to fund his often-controversial projects, and the Van Gogh family fortune - their collection of paintings by his great-great-uncle, Vincent - had been given to the state, much to Theo&apos;s fury. With his three-camera set-up, in which one focused on each actor and another provided a master shot, Van Gogh could shoot single takes that lasted as long as 20 minutes. These became a vital vehicle for the fast-paced verbal battles that are central to almost all of his films. &quot;The technique was more a political statement against those who didn&apos;t want to fund him,&quot; says Emile Fallaux. &quot;But then it became his doctrine.&quot; Now, of course, it goes down well in money-conscious film-making circles. Buscemi&apos;s version of Interview was made for a mere $2m (\u00a3970,000). Sienna Miller, for one, was won over by the relatively seamless, filming-in-sequence method, which made the whole project feel more like a stage production, not least because the actors had to know all their lines from the start. &quot;We&apos;re shooting 20 pages of dialogue a day,&quot; she said during filming. &quot;And we know the whole thing like a play - we&apos;re just running it and running it.&quot; For Buscemi, this style of filming was completely new. &quot;I had to teach him how it worked,&quot; says Doesjka van Hoogdalem, the creative consultant who started working with Van Gogh in 2000. &quot;It also kept the acting fresh and lively. Because we were shooting with three cameras, the actors could improvise and move about as they liked. So, for instance, Sienna would spontaneously decide to dive on to the couch, much to everyone&apos;s delight.&quot; However, maintaining the authenticity of the Van Gogh style was only possible because producers Weiss and Van de Westelaken were able to bring Van Gogh&apos;s Dutch crew to the US. &quot;We had a good lawyer who managed to persuade the US authorities that only the Dutch team could make this film,&quot; says Van Hoogdalem. They had a stiff battle with the unions, who refused to accept the Dutch side&apos;s insistence that only a few people were needed - or desired - on set. Van Hoogdalem herself acted as both director&apos;s assistant and script adviser until the unions protested that she was doing someone out of a job, at which point the role of &quot;creative consultant&quot; was invented for her. &quot;We had to fight with them constantly about everything, from taking lunch breaks at a specific time, even when we were in the middle of a scene, to the number of people we had on set at any one time,&quot; she says. There were rows over everything from gaffer tape - with the Americans wanting to hire a gaffer-tape lorry when a single piece of tape was required - to the suggestion that a &quot;loop group&quot; from the Screen Actors Guild be hired at a cost of $5,000 a day to produce the background muttering sounds of a restaurant crowd. When Van de Westelaken suggested sticking a microphone in a real restaurant and recording the sound, the Americans on the crew &quot;were amazed, and didn&apos;t believe it could be done,&quot; he says. &quot;We said, &apos;We do it like this all the time.&apos; In the end, they came to love our way of working.&quot; The result is the 10-point Sarajevo Manifesto on the Theo Van Gogh filming technique, which was drawn up by Buscemi and the Dutch crew when they met in that city last month. It includes the clauses &quot;We will never be dependent on subsidy boards&quot; and &quot;We will make as many films as possible&quot;. Van Hoogdalem, who was also a close friend of Van Gogh&apos;s, is convinced that though the director had a childlike love of America, which he idolised for its democratic principles and freedom of expression (a point of view many of his compatriots found hard to share), the experience of filming there would have driven him to despair. &quot;I don&apos;t know whether he would have survived,&quot; she says. &quot;As someone who was so spontaneous and flexible, and spent his life trying to escape the rules, he would have found it hugely restricting. Being told there was a penalty if you didn&apos;t stop for lunch might well have caused him to explode.&quot; Van Gogh was famous for speaking his mind. So it was surely quite convenient that cautious Hollywood types didn&apos;t have to deal with him in person. This, after all, was the man who had called hardline Islamists &quot;goat fuckers&quot;. He had worked on a screenplay entitled Anne Frank in the Hamptons, about the &quot;Holocaust industry&quot;, and had further insulted Jews with his comments about diabetics going to the gas chamber. He called a TV network chief a &quot;cokehead who specialised in throwing secretaries over the balcony&quot;. On top of that, he was a heavy drinker, a chain-smoker and an erstwhile drug user. &quot;I think he would have had an extremely difficult, if not impossible, time in a country that is so staunchly PC and has no sense of irony,&quot; says Fallaux, the magazine editor and a long-time Van Gogh friend. &quot;I for one would have been waiting to see what happened.&quot; \u00b7 Interview is released on November 2.

Symphony Hall may have the greater profile now, but when the Town Hall opened in 1834, Birmingham gained one of the first and finest symphonic halls in Europe. The Town Hall was built by the 27-year-old architect Joseph Hansom (inventor of the Hansom cab) and was designed to replicate the Roman temple of Castor and Pollux. It predates other famous European halls, including the Musikverein in Vienna (1870) and the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam (1888), which adopted the layout of the Town Hall&apos;s acoustically brilliant interior. And its crowning glory, the 6,000-pipe William Hill organ, was the largest and most technologically advanced in the world. But fashions change, and after the opening of Symphony Hall in 1991, the old venue became redundant. For more than a decade it has been empty, hidden by advertisement hoardings and remembered only as the place the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra used to play. Now, following a \u00a335m restoration programme, the Town Hall has been returned to its former glory. The massive columns have regained their pristine whiteness; acoustically detrimental balconies added in the 1920s have been removed and the interior returned to the way it looked when it hosted what was then one of the world&apos;s most significant and long-running music festivals. The Birmingham Triennial music festival - which ran between 1784 and 1912 - was a major international event which attracted many of the leading composers and performers of the day. Mendelssohn came to Birmingham to conduct the first performance of his oratorio, Elijah. Grieg, Sibelius, Gounod and Saint-Sa\u00ebns unveiled new works, and Elgar&apos;s Dream of Gerontius was a festival commission. The clamour for new music in the city was extraordinary - in 1891 Dvorak wrote back to his family: &quot;I am here in this immense industrial city, where they make excellent knives, scissors, springs, files and goodness knows what else - and besides these, music too! And how well! It&apos;s terrifying how much the people here manage to achieve.&quot; The Triennial packed an exhaustive mix of ancient and modern works into three day-long programmes. The leather-bound programme book for 1891 advertises a complete performance of Bach&apos;s St Matthew Passion followed by extracts from Wagner&apos;s Parsifal and the premiere of Dvorak&apos;s Requiem. There were also details of special train arrangements in the event of concerts over-running, and the promise of upholstered seating for future festivals &quot;greatly enhancing the comfort of patrons&quot;. For certain critics, including George Bernard Shaw, the new seats couldn&apos;t arrive quickly enough. Shaw wrote in his review of the 1891 festival: &quot;I am not unmixedly grateful to the Birmingham festival people. On Passion day I shared a knifeboard [seat] at the back of the gallery with a steward who kept Bach off by reading the Birmingham Daily Post.&quot; He noted that Dvorak&apos;s new Requiem &quot;bored Birmingham so desperately that it was unanimously voted a work of extraordinary depth and expressiveness.&quot; But the musician who made the biggest impact on Birmingham Town Hall was Felix Mendelssohn. The 26-year-old was the most famous living composer in Europe when he arrived to direct the 1837 festival, and he immediately noted that the organ was in the wrong place. The committee obliged by knocking a hole in the wall to create an alcove for the instrument. They were rewarded when the composer came back in 1846 to conduct the first performance of Elijah, a work that prompted one commentator to claim: &quot;Mendelssohn was the foster-child of Birmingham.&quot; The Triennial festival also developed homegrown talent. In 1882 a young Worcester violinist named Edward Elgar was recruited to the orchestra, and encouraged in his early attempts at composition. By the turn of the century Elgar had become the pre-eminent figure in British music, and the Birmingham Triennial commissioned the Dream of Gerontius in 1900. The premiere was under-rehearsed and chaotic, though the oratorio&apos;s subsequent success in Europe secured Elgar&apos;s reputation; and he went on to write three further choral pieces for Birmingham: The Apostles, The Kingdom and The Music Makers, which premiered at the final Triennial festival in 1912. As part of Town Hall&apos;s reopening festival, Richard Hickox is to conduct a special concert with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment which recreates the glory years of the Triennial festival. The running order is more extensive and varied than the average modern-day concert programme, yet the evening promises to deliver a historically informed experience at authentically Victorian length. &quot;The average Triennial concert was at least four hours long,&quot; Hickox says. &quot;The challenge was to compile a programme which gives a flavour of 200 years of history while still getting the audience home before midnight.&quot; Highlights of the concert include excerpts from Elijah and Mendelssohn&apos;s Second Piano Concerto performed by Melvyn Tan. There are also vocal works by Mozart, Gounod and Grieg and a rare performance of Arthur Sullivan&apos;s Di Ballo Overture, the popular hit of the 1870 festival. Not only is it one of the longest and most eccentric programmes Hickox has prepared, it marks uncharted territory for the orchestra. &quot;The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment has never played Elgar before, or Gounod and certainly never Sullivan,&quot; Hickox says, &quot;so some of these pieces will require quite a bit of work adjusting the unfamiliar balance.&quot; The historical range of the programme also makes it difficult for a period instrument ensemble to decide on an appropriate pitch. &quot;In the end we took an average of all the pieces,&quot; Hickox explains. &quot;So for this concert the pitch of A will be 438Hz.&quot; For Thomas Trotter, who performs Bach&apos;s organ Prelude and Fugue in E Flat, the reopening of the Town Hall marks a sentimental return. As Birmingham city organist, it was among Trotter&apos;s duties to keep the Town Hall&apos;s instrument in working order by periodically playing it in the abandoned building. &quot;It was rather eerie and surreal,&quot; Trotter says. &quot;I had to sit in the organ loft in a hard hat and take care which stops to pull for fear of dislodging any plaster.&quot; Now the organ has been fully restored to its 1834 condition, including the return of the celebrated &quot;musical bells&quot;, which a local brass founder bestowed as a gift. Although audiences of over 2,000 packed into the Town Hall for the Triennial concerts, the capacity has now been reduced to 1,100 - exactly half that of Symphony Hall, which enables both venues to be run on a complementary basis by a shared administration. The reopening of the smaller hall enables the scheduling of recitals, chamber concerts and intimate events which would be difficult to accommodate in a larger venue. And it restores the city with a much-loved, iconic building which forms a significant part of the musical fabric of the country. &quot;So much history was made within these walls,&quot; Thomas Trotter says. &quot;It will be nice playing to people rather than pigeons again.&quot;  \u00b7 The Spirit of the Triennial concert is at Birmingham Town Hall on Thursday.

Photograph taken by the author Can art can really scare us, or is it impossible to be really scared because we know an artist has &quot;made&quot; a piece and that process is recognisable? Earlier this year I was invited to my first paranormal investigation in the unlikely venue of a council office in Dover. Going with an open mind I got very scared indeed by what was, with hindsight, an art installation which even has a presence in the ether . So, take an old building with a history of sightings and odd happenings. Add a mixed bag of believers and sceptics, some serious technical kit, and a certain expectation from standing in a circle holding hands with the lights out. The reading of health and safety regulations made for a surreal moment (walking through walls is probably forbidden by some little-known directive). But the a frightening atmosphere was created by sleep deprivation, mounting cold, and stumbling from attic to cellar in small, unseen, teams. There was definitely a touch of Cornelia Parker about the Victorian nightdress and china dolls dotted around the place. And oddly enough Parker has a Bronte seance in her retrospective at the Ikon. But I was there to report, so when torches shone on apparently spirit-moved marbles and ghostly finger traces I took some discreet pictures. It was when I put my camera away and allowed myself to be part of the action that I started to feel genuinely scared. By 4am, down in a dank cellar, I&apos;d had enough. But I am intrigued as to what I was responding to. An overload of given sensation? An imagination working overtime? If I had called it &quot;art&quot; in the first place what would that have done to the experience? (A week later I showed the images in the unlikely venue of a conference at the university of Reading. By now the possible ghostly presence had transformed from evidence to illustration.) Is is scary art all about being in the dark? Can something truly make us afraid in a well-lit gallery space? A few years ago, at the South London Gallery, I saw Brian Catling and Tony Grisoni&apos;s collaboration Vanished: a Video S\u00e9ance - and that certainly raised the hairs on the back of my neck. Are we more likely to be scared of a sound piece, which leaves gaps for the imagination? Does the visual give us too much information to make us truly afraid? Over in Amsterdam, I just saw an installation by Melvin Moti called ESP. A film of a bubble bursting against audio of JW Dunne&apos;s First World War dream diaries in which he recounted paranormal experiences. Not scary (to me at least) but its strangeness created a haunting unease. As part of an Andy Warhol retrospective, the brilliant Dutch magazine Blend commissioned an ingenious interview with the late artist - conducted through a medium. See and hear it here. Scary - or just a bit weird? What about shock, much loved by horror film-makers? And what is the distinction between horror film and horror installation? Think about the choreographed fear factor of The Blair Witch Project against the real horror highlighted in Mark Vallen&apos;s commentary of &quot;anonymous installation, 2003&quot;. Art with the fear factor, as I am thinking about it here, is not about phobias - though those with a fear of spiders will probably avoid the Louise Bourgeois exhibition. It is about something which scares on first viewing, and still elicits a fear in recall. My first scary art? A childhood memory of going around a ghost house at a funfair. I can still remember being scared out of my wits by falling-away floors and sudden draughts. Haunted house as art installation.

A few hours later, a little painting on copper of a laughing young man, valued at up to \u00a31,500 as in the style of Rembrandt, had been snapped up by an agent for an unidentified bidder for \u00a32.2m - \u00a32,580,750 if you include the 15% premium which goes to the euphoric staff of Moore, Allen and Innocent auctioneers in Cirencester. The buyer - and the rivals who converged on the sale, as word spread in the art world - is convinced the painting is a genuine masterpiece which had been hanging unrecognised on the drawing room wall of a country house. Head auctioneer Philip Allwood, who has worked at the firm for 22 years, described the atmosphere at the sale as electric: &quot;Once the price went above \u00a31m the whole place fell silent. When it topped \u00a32m you could hear a pin drop. Once the hammer went down, the whole place erupted into applause.&quot; The picture came from the UK house of an anonymous overseas collector, who had not believed it was a genuine Rembrandt. The auctioneers sent detailed images of it to collectors and museums around the world, but most, including the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which has one of the greatest Rembrandt collections in the world, concluded that The Young Rembrandt as Democrates the Laughing Philosopher was an accomplished contemporary work in the artist&apos;s style. Mr Allwood said: &quot;I said immediately that it looked like a Rembrandt&apos;s own work; but the owner assured me that someone had checked it out years gone by, and it was not. &quot;I looked at it long and hard over the next few months and in the end we got on to the Rijksmuseum, which is a leading authority on Rembrandt. They looked at the images we sent over and said they were fairly happy that it was not by Rembrandt, but it was almost certainly 17th century and by a contemporary of Rembrandt. &quot;There was an indistinct monogram in the top left corner, but it didn&apos;t look like Rembrandt&apos;s. On the basis that it was not a Rembrandt, we made a very cagey estimate in the catalogue of \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,500. How wrong could we be?&quot; Yesterday&apos;s sale showed several people believe that the work is genuine. It is not impossible that this is so: a Cimabue, much rarer than a Rembrandt, was found in a dark corridor of an East Anglian house a few years ago, while two ravishing Fra Angelico saints turned up in a spare bedroom last year. Rembrandt authentication has been a growth industry for decades. The artist was so often in dire financial straits that he had to churn out pictures. Distinguishing between what are outright fakes, studio works with a few brushstrokes by the master, and contemporary pieces by worshipful contemporaries, has never been easy.

Syria has excellent luxury coaches you can book when you get there (reserve seats the day before to guarantee a place).

Meanwhile, your friend can relax; wine and spirits are freely available, while Syrian beer, by all accounts, is particularly tasty. In September, we flew to Cork and hired a car from Europcar. As we were travelling with our three-year-old, we had asked for a car seat. The staff said we had to install it ourselves but there was no manual or instructions so we had to guess how to do it. When we asked the staff, they didn&apos;t know either. The seat felt quite loose, so we weren&apos;t sure how safe it was, but luckily we had no accidents.  Angela Merritt, Newcastle-upon-Tyne It&apos;s understandable that car-hire companies can&apos;t predict exactly which model they are going to give customers, but what&apos;s less helpful is their policy on fitting of child seats - basically, it&apos;s down to the customer. A Europcar spokesman said: &apos;Employees are not permitted to fit or advise on the fitting of child seats for insurance purposes.&apos; I checked this with several other companies, which all confirmed that staff won&apos;t fit child seats. As you may suspect, this is to avoid the risk of staff being liable in the event of injuries caused by wrongly-fitted seats. It&apos;s a crazy situation - surely the employees are far more likely to get the fitting correct than parents who&apos;ve never seen that model before. Basically, it boils down to today&apos;s litigation-happy culture.  However, Europcar said that all child seats it supplies should have complete instructions on the back detailing how to fit them correctly. The Europcar desk at Cork was deficient in not providing you with these.  Some hire companies can tell you in advance which type of seat you&apos;ll get, enabling you to download instructions from the web - Alamo, for example, only uses the Britax Freeway child seat.  After I returned from visiting my daughter in the US, I noticed that the US immigration people had not removed the green visa waiver form that notifies them that I have left the country. Will this cause me problems the next time I go? Do I need to send it to the US embassy in London?Miriam Williamson, by email This is a question I&apos;m asked all the time. Remarkably for a country with such stringent border procedures, this form is left in a surprisingly large number of passports, so it&apos;s worth reiterating what travellers should do if that happens. In theory, its removal shows you have left America and your departure is registered with the Customs &amp; Border Protection services. If you try to re-enter the country with an old form you may be suspected of having left illegally. This can cause problems and lead to delays or denied entry.  However, you can act on this yourself. Do not send the form to the US Embassy in London.

Buses link pretty much everywhere in South America and for longer distance semi-cama or cama services (the bus equivalent of business class) are an excellent option.

Outlawing the trade is one thing, abolishing slavery is quite another, and this collaboration between husband-and-wife team John Godber and Jane Thornton suggests that Wilberforce&apos;s mission is far from finished business. Estimates indicate that between 4,000 and 8,000 women are sold into the sex trade in Britain every year. The figures are hard to verify and hard to comprehend, so Godber and Thornton sensibly opt to concentrate on the story of just one: 21-year-old Anja, whose escape from the poverty of a Moldovan village leads only to a basement brothel near Paddington station. Most of her clients demand degrading and humiliating acts, but Ray, a journalist from Hull, pays good money just to talk. Gradually, Anja begins to open up and reveal the details of how she was sold by her own cousin to an Italian gang of human traffickers who &quot;break&quot; new prostitutes by subjecting them to repeated rape and beatings. Godber recently skirted this subject with Going Dutch, which showed a party of East Yorkshire businessmen window-shopping in Amsterdam&apos;s red-light district. But if that was an ebullient comedy about the supposedly regulated side of the sex industry, Sold is a bleak indictment of a far more troubling phenomenon. If Godber&apos;s formative subject was the expenditure of youthful aggression, his principal theme now is the powerlessness of middle age. Ray is a failed novelist and a flawed investigative journalist who fails to make a distinction between reporting a problem and attempting to solve it. His muddled sense of compassion is admirable but ultimately futile, and his attempt to &quot;rescue&quot; Anja by installing her as his housekeeper merely exchanges one form of exploitation for another. Godber&apos;s production features an outstanding performance from Kasia Halpin, whose unsparing account of Anja&apos;s brutalisation is painfully raw, and Joshua Richards adeptly conveys the misguided romanticism of Ray&apos;s attempt to play the knight in a shiny raincoat. It must be frustrating for the writers that this bold, uncompromising work should draw a thin crowd when the house full signs are already in place for the 30th anniversary revival of Bouncers. But it is a testament to Godber&apos;s determination to break new ground that Sold is such a difficult concept to sell. \u00b7 Until November 17.

Petter Nylander spent two days in a Dutch detention centre, after being apprehended as he prepared to board a flight back to his home in London, over alleged breaches of arcane French laws designed to protect the country&apos;s state-controlled betting monopolies. Speaking in London, after catching the earliest available Eurostar out of France, a clearly relieved Mr Nylander said: &quot;It feels wonderful to be in London, I feel safe here in a country and a city that really protects individuals.&quot; Of his ordeal, he admitted: &quot;It was very surreal, but I&apos;m probably going to remember it as long as I can breathe.&quot; Unibet, based in London but listed in Stockholm, has become embroiled in the French authorities&apos; attempt to protect two betting monopolies created in the 19th century - lottery organiser Francaise des Jeux (FDJ) and horse-racing body the PMU - from competition. The two organisations, created under legislation dating back to 1836 and 1891, account for about half the estimated \u20ac20bn (\u00a313.9bn) annually made from betting in France. The country&apos;s state-regulated casinos account for the rest of the takings from betting. Unibet has no office in France but accepts bets from French citizens and has raised its profile in the country by sponsoring poker tournaments and a cycling team. Founded in 1997, Unibet has nearly 2 million clients and a licence in the UK which it claims means that under EU law it can operate legally in France. Of Unibet&apos;s 300 employees Mr Nylander said: &quot;We are proud to have 32 different nationalities working... all over Europe. We are living the European dream, the spirit of the treaty.&quot; He said his arrest was &quot;totally out of bounds with European law&quot;. Mr Nylander, who has not travelled to France for a year, was detained in Holland under a French warrant issued after he failed, in April, to appear before magistrates investigating complaints made by the FDJ and PMU. The complaints centre on the activities of Mr Bookmaker, an online betting operation that specifically targeted the French market and which Unibet acquired in 2005. His lawyer, Ewout Keuleers, said Mr Nylander had been willing to help the French authorities with their investigations but had wanted reassurance that he would not be arrested. He expects to be called back to France to give further evidence. He has been put under investigation - which under French law is one step short of being charged - and if full proceedings are instigated he faces a maximum jail sentence of three years. He was arrested on the night of October 22 at Amsterdam airport and thrown into a detention centre for two nights. He was then moved into a hotel and taken to Paris on Wednesday morning, where he was put before a judge who released him on bail. Mr Nylander was in no doubt yesterday about the motives behind his arrest: &quot;I sincerely hope and think that in a couple of years we will laugh about my situation, that actually in 2007 people were thrown into jail for opening up competition against monopolies in Europe. We will laugh about it, but for me it was not a laughing matter this last week.&quot;", "sentences": ["He was arrested on the night of October 22 at Amsterdam airport and thrown into a detention centre for two nights."], "title": "Unibet chief released on bail", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/02/davidgowoneurope.europe", "tags": ["Business", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-04T10:30:31Z", "article": "There are sterling reasons for getting excited about 14 November. It&apos;s the day Eurostar moves to its new St Pancras home, but the 20 minutes it shaves off journey times to Paris and Brussels is only the tip of the iceberg. The launch last year of the TGV Est high-speed link brought Alsace and the Champagne region within easy reach of Paris, which means that in the time it would take you to get from Paddington to Penzance you can be sipping a speciality beer in a Belgian cafe or shopping in a French fleamarket.  Mark Smith of seat61.com, the essential website for people planning a rail trip in Europe, says: &apos;More and more people seem to be trying out train travel to Europe as a low-carbon, low-stress alternative to the hassle of flying.&apos;  From mid-November, people living in central and northern England and Scotland will find crossing the Channel significantly quicker. Timetables are simple, and through tickets are easy to buy. Next month, ski trains will start, including one from Gare du Nord that has couchettes and a disco carriage. No baggage reclaim and short check-in times are other great reasons to celebrate train travel this winter. Here is our pick of weekend breaks, all of which require only one change of train. Journey times include transfer times. 1 ANTWERP, BELGIUM Time: 2hrs 58minutes  Thanks to the diamond trade and a large art school, Antwerp is particularly good at jewellery. You&apos;ll also find fabulous fashion designers (the Antwerp Six, which include Dries Van Noten, all have their bases there). It&apos;s easy to walk around, and the clubs are very good, thanks to the art school population - don&apos;t miss the Cafe d&apos;Anvers. With a charming cathedral and gorgeous medieval architecture, it&apos;s also the place to indulge in some Rubens - the cathedral houses four of his early works, and he makes a strong showing in the Rockoxhuis museum and his former home, the Rubenshuis. Wonderful artisanal chocolate (easily as good as the stuff sold in Brussels) and superb mussels make it a great weekend choice. Where to stay: The Hotel &apos;t Sandt (00 32 3 232 9390; www.hotel-sandt.be), fashioned from a rococo building that used to be a soap factory, is suitably stylish and has doubles from \u20ac160, including breakfast.  Departure board: on Friday, take the 4.05pm Eurostar from St Pancras, arriving after one hour and 51 minutes in Brussels. You have 29 minutes to change platforms and board the Thalys 9353 service at 7.25pm arriving at Antwerp&apos;s Berchem station at 8.03pm.  Cost: from \u00a359 return. 2 REIMS, FRANCE  Time: 3 hours 42 minutes  Self-drive holidays make little sense when alcohol is involved. Reims is a classic French city with churches, chateaux and great restaurants as well as a good choice of markets and food shops. And then there are the city&apos;s champagne houses, including Taittinger and Mumm (both of which offer tours that end in tastings).  Where to stay: Les Crayeres (00 33 3 2682 8080; www.lescrayeres.com) offers high-end hedonism with a three Michelin-starred restaurant just down the (predictably grand) staircase. Despite its setting in a 17-acre park of verdant loveliness, it is walking distance from the main Champagne houses; doubles start at \u20ac290 a night, not including breakfast. Alternatively, there are a number of more reasonably priced hotels, including Hotel de la Paix (00 33 3 2640 0408; www.bestwestern-lapaix-reims.com), on rue Buirette, which has doubles from \u20ac115, room only.  Departure board: Take the 7.30am Friday Eurostar to Paris, arriving 10.56am. You then need to walk from the Gare du Nord to the Gare de l&apos;Est, but it&apos;s clearly signposted and will only take five minutes. There, board the 11.27am TGV 2723, arriving Reims 45 minutes later. You can also get to Reims by changing at Lille, but connection times are far longer.  Cost: from \u00a379 return. 3 AACHEN, GERMANY Time: from 3 hours 53 minutes The city known to Francophones as Aix-la-Chapelle is a blend of thermal waters and gingerbread&apos;n&apos;mulled wine-style Christmas markets (we&apos;re in Germany, if only just). There&apos;s a large amount of history to mull, as well as admirable beer (it&apos;s very close to Belgium). Aachen&apos;s cathedral, built on Roman foundations, is a Unesco World Heritage site. You&apos;ll also find the thermal waters that persuaded Charlemagne to make Aachen his capital in 794. The water at Carolus Thermen (www.carolus-thermen.de) comes in a variety of temperatures and pools, plus restaurants and massages. Prices start from \u20ac10 for two-and-a-half hours.  Where to stay: The Sofitel Aachen Quellenhof (00 49 241 91320; www.accorhotels.com) is in a mansion built for the Kaiser in the First World War. It features its own thermal spa, with ice grotto, Turkish bath and sauna. Doubles from \u20ac120.  Departure board: Take the 4.05pm Eurostar from St Pancras, arriving in Brussels at 6.56pm. Change platforms and take the Thalys 9453 service departing 7.22pm, arriving at Aachen at 8.58pm.  Cost: from \u00a369 return. 4 TOURS, FRANCE Time: 4 hours 17 minutes On the banks of the Loire, Tours has a medieval heart of half-timbered houses, a grand gothic cathedral and an abundance of chateaux. Trawl the 30 markets for everything from food to antiques, see the cedar planted by Napoleon in the garden of the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, then head to Place Plumereau for an alfresco lunch. A short bus ride to the east is Vouvray, where you can walk among the vines, and visit the cellars where the grapes are turned into the famous wine.  Where to stay: Fifteen minutes by taxi from the station, in a village right on the river half-way between Tours and Vouvray, is the Hotel Les Hautes Roches (00 33 247 528 888; www.leshautesroches.com). It&apos;s quite unique, an 18th-century former monastery built from the limestone cliff. Departure board: Take the 12.30pm Friday Eurostar to Paris, arriving 3.50pm. You then need to take Metro line 4 south to Gare Montparnasse, where you pick up the 4.45pm TGV 8347, arriving in Tours at 5.47pm. This connection is recommended on Eurostar&apos;s website, but 55 minutes to change stations (14 Metro stops) may be a little stressful. However the five other daily Eurostar-TGV connections from London to Tours all allow slightly longer, between 75 and 94 minutes.  Cost: from \u00a379 return. 5 THE HAGUE, THE NETHERLANDS Time:4 hours 21 minutes  The Netherlands will really shine as a rail destination in about a year&apos;s time, when a new high-speed train line opens across the country. In the meantime, the Hague, a city usually overshadowed by Amsterdam, is a two-hour trip from Brussels and a delight to visit (you&apos;ll find none of your stoner hen&apos;n&apos;stags here). As well as a growing reputation for trying international war criminals, it has art galleries (including one devoted to the phantasmagoric art of Maurits Escher), excellent restaurants, bracing beach walks and boutique hotels.  Where to stay: The Paleis Hotel (00 31 70 362 4621; www.paleishotel.nl) is opposite the Royal Palace. A 17th-century building, complete with underground passages linking it with a nearby convent, it has 20 rooms, all in a style that could be described as Marie Antoinette with added comfort (good beds and wifi); double rooms from \u20ac139 a night.  Departure board: Take the 8.05am Eurostar to Brussels, arriving at 10.56. The 11.25am Thalys 9321 then takes two hours to reach the Hague.  Cost: from \u00a359 return. 6 LYON, FRANCE Time:4 hours 56 minutes In the heart of the Rhone valley, Lyon is one of France&apos;s great gastronomic cities. It has an art scene that rivals Paris in reputation, a network of medieval and 19th-century underground passages, genuinely engrossing museums and an endless selection of restaurants. A general vibrancy includes some fine markets: at Les Halles, chefs, residents and tourists come to stock up at Mere Richard&apos;s cheese shop and Colette Sibilia&apos;s charcuterie.  The bo-bo (bohemian bourgeois) area of Croix Rousse has an organic market on Saturday mornings while the quaysides have a craft and flea market on Sunday mornings. Antique-hunting is an especially serious business here - the Cite des Antiquaires by the Tete d&apos;Or park is vast. Of all the museums, the most unmissable is the Institut Lumiere (00 33 4 7878 1895; www.institut-lumiere.org), which charts the Lumiere brothers&apos; influential forays into film-making in the 1890s and is housed in the family mansion.  Where to stay: The College Hotel (00 33 4 7210 0505; www.college-hotel.com), housed in a converted school, has taken an educational theme and runs with it: all-white rooms have lockers that act as wardrobes; it also make copious use of blackboards and vintage text books, all with a disciplined sense of humour; doubles from \u20ac105.  Departure board: Take the Friday 9.25am Eurostar, arriving Paris at 12.47. You have 43 minutes to take the RER line D to Gare de Lyon, from where TGV 6625 departs at 1.30pm, arriving at Lyon&apos;s Part-Dieu station at 3.21pm. Cost: from \u00a399 return. 7 STRASBOURG, FRANCE  Time: 5 hours 11 minutes The extension of the high-speed TGV Est line has brought this city closer and it&apos;s far more interesting than its status as home of the European Parliament would suggest. Alsace is strong on foie gras: in addition there are canals to cycle around, a lively student population and the ridiculously pretty Petite France area to explore. Jean Arp, founder of the Dadaist movement, came from Strasbourg and the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art fetes him and his contemporaries.  Where to stay: The Hotel du Dragon (00 33 3 8835 7980; www.dragon.fr) is cool without being cold; and this 32-room hotel is well placed for La Petite France. Doubles from \u20ac79, room only.  Departure board: Take the 8.32am Friday Eurostar to Paris, arriving 11.47. It is a short walk from Gare du Nord to Gare de l&apos;Est, where you catch the TGV 2055, departing 12.24, arriving in Strasbourg 2 hours 19 minutes later. Again, it&apos;s possible to change at Lille, but Gare de l&apos;Est has more and faster trains.  Cost: from \u00a389 return. OVERNIGHT DELIVERY  On longer journeys, travelling on a sleeper service makes often makes more sense. Book yourself into a private berth and wake up in your chosen city. 8 BERLIN, GERMANY Time: 11 hours 36 minutes Berlin is currently the most exciting European city for pretty much everything from fashion to music and art. You could, theoretically, do away with the need for a hotel room on the Saturday night by clubbing till dawn, returning on the sleeper on Sunday night. Realistically, however, booking a hotel room is a good idea. Where to stay: Ku&apos;damm 101 (00 49 520 0550; www.kudamm101.com) does the crossover between club and hotel far better than hotels in New York or Miami. In the desirable Wilmersdorf area, it has large loft-style rooms with colour schemes varying by floor according to Le Corbusier&apos;s colour series. Doubles from \u20ac119. Departure board: Take the 7.35pm Eurostar (any weekday) to Brussels, arriving at 10.32pm. From Brussels, the DB NachtZug 243 leaves at 11.41pm, arriving at Berlin Hauptbahnhof at 8.11am. Cost: from \u00a3134pp return in a six-berth couchette through Rail Europe. 9 VENICE, ITALY Time: 18 hours 23 minutes From the UK, take an afternoon Eurostar to Paris, stop for a couple of aperitifs (the Terminus Nord is a classic French bistro) followed by an overnight train from Gare de Bercy (a minuscule station close to Gare de Lyon), waking up in Venice&apos;s Santa Lucia station next morning. Where to stay: The Hotel Al Ponte Antico (00 39 041 241 1944; www.alponteantico.com) is a three-star hotel on the Grand Canal close to the Rialto, with a terrace overlooking the canal. Doubles start at \u20ac190. Departure board: Take the 2.05pm Eurostar to Paris, arriving 5.26pm. To reach Gare de Bercy from Gare du Nord, take the RER line B or D then Metro line 14 to Bercy, from where the station is a few minutes&apos; walk. Or a taxi from Gare du Nord should cost less than \u20ac20. The Stendhal sleeper leaves at 8.28pm, arriving at Verona at 7.25am and Venice at 9.28am. Cost: \u00a3111pp return in a six-berth couchette through Rail Europe, as before. 10 BARCELONA, SPAIN Time: 15 hours 54 minutes One of Europe&apos;s best overnight trains, the Trenhotel Joan Miro travels from Paris to Barcelona. There are a variety of accommodation options on board, including Gran Classe sleepers - pure train luxury where cabins have their own showers, and the price includes dinner and breakfast. Where to stay: Just down the road from Franca tation, the Market Hotel in Passatge Sant Antoni Abat (00 34 93 325 1205, www.markethotel.com.es) has double rooms (with typically pared-down Barcelona decor of black, white and red) from \u20ac88, including breakfast. Departure board: Take the 3.30pm Eurostar, arriving at 6.56pm. The sleeper leaves Gare d&apos;Austerlitz (Metro line 5) at 8.32pm, arriving in Barcelona at 8.24am. Cost: from \u00a3162pp return in a four-berth couchette through Rail Europe, as before. \u00b7 All tickets featured are available from Rail Europe (0844 848 4070; raileurope.co.uk); you can also book many of them with Eurostar (0870 518 6186; eurostar.com). European Rail (erail.co.uk) can tailormake luxury short breaks for individuals to destinations as diverse as Chantilly in France and the seaside resort of Sitges in Spain.

It was late August, and the German director had travelled to northwest Thailand, a few miles from the border of Burma, to shoot Rescue Dawn amid virgin rainforest. It was his first Hollywood-funded feature, and he was determined to stop what he called &apos;the Apparatus&apos; - a squadron of make-up artists, special-effects engineers and walkie-talkie-carrying professionals who had been deployed to work with him - from trampling on yet another pristine thicket. Herzog, who typically works with a small crew and a minuscule budget, was pleased to have millions of dollars at his disposal, but he was not so pleased to have been saddled with more than a hundred collaborators. &apos;I do not need all these assistants,&apos; he complained. &apos;I have to work around them.&apos; The enclave he had sequestered was filled with overgrown vines and rotting palm trees, and was partially hidden by a moss-slicked boulder. Herzog, who spent his childhood clambering across the Alpine slopes of southern Bavaria, says that he has an uncanny talent for &apos;reading a landscape&apos; and could immediately spot the danger: his primeval nook was an ideal place for a bathroom break. A dozen Thai crew members began setting up equipment at the base of a sharply sloped mountain covered in ancient, absurdly distended trees. The mountain was garlanded with picturesque wisps of mist, but Herzog, who has filmed three documentaries and three features in deep jungle, did not want the terrain in his film to have the groomed, glistening-dewdrop look of so many movies set in frond-filled places. &apos;The moment anything on this film becomes purely aesthetic, I will stop it,&apos; he had promised. Herzog, now 65, no longer has the virile brown moustache of his youth, but his face has compensated by acquiring a patina of menace. Gravity has given his mouth a permanent frown. His blue eyes are partially obscured by thick, drooping brows, and they are perpetually rheumy, as if he were harbouring a deadly tropical disease. &apos;I am always being stopped at airports by drug-interdiction officials,&apos; he said, with satisfaction. &apos;There is something about my face that is sinister.&apos; The aura is heightened by his sonorous voice, which, in his heavily accented English, suggests a Teutonic Vincent Price. Herzog likes to say that he is &apos;clinically sane and completely professional&apos;, but he is aware that his reputation is otherwise - &apos;One of the most persistent rumours plaguing me is that I&apos;m a crazy director doing crazy things.&apos; Herzog has spent his career rushing headlong into new projects - in 2005 he released three documentaries, including Grizzly Man, and each was filmed on a different continent - but with Rescue Dawn he is revisiting familiar ground. The movie, his 52nd, will be his first twice-told tale: a feature-film version of Little Dieter Needs to Fly, his 1997 documentary about Dieter Dengler, a German-American pilot who was shot down during a bombing mission over Laos in the early days of the Vietnam War. After being tortured for six months in a Pathet Lao prison camp - his head was repeatedly covered with an ants&apos; nest during interrogations - Dengler escaped, taking with him another PoW, Duane Martin. Dengler helped Martin, who was sick with dysentery, to trek across the monsoon-swamped jungle. He built a makeshift raft, camouflaged him with branches and guided him westward along muddy tributaries, toward the Mekong River. One afternoon they were attacked by some Lao villagers and Martin was beheaded. Dengler evaded capture and survived for weeks in the forest, on a diet of beetles and snakes, before being rescued by a US Army helicopter. Herzog became close friends with Dengler, who died in 2001. He said of him, &apos;All that I like about America was somehow embodied in Dieter: self-reliance and courage and loyalty and optimism, a strange kind of directness and joy in life.&apos; In the documentary, Dengler recounts his escape in a transfixing monologue, vividly conjuring the horror of being lost in the jungle: sudden mud slides sent him and Martin careering down jagged mountains, and he woke up each morning covered with leeches. For him, wild nature was even more brutal and confining than the Pathet Lao prison. To convey the feeling that Dengler&apos;s liberation from prison was no liberation at all, Herzog wanted the new film&apos;s star, Christian Bale, to spend time forcing his way through forest so tangled that it appeared &apos;almost unmanageable for human beings&apos;. The camera, Herzog explained, would trail Bale closely, heightening the oppressive mood. &apos;We are really with him the whole time, trapped in this forest prison,&apos; he said. &apos;There is no width of perspective.&apos; A fast-moving cloud unleashed a short burst of rain, and Thai production assistants collected beneath a pomelo tree. Herzog, still drying off from an earlier shower, allowed his T-shirt and khakis to be resoaked as he set up that afternoon&apos;s scene, which depicted the frenzied moment of Martin&apos;s decapitation. Speaking in German, the director discussed how to choreograph the sequence with his longtime cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger, a burly Czech who appeared on location each day wearing flowing white linen. As they talked, Herzog stood in front of Zeitlinger&apos;s camera and mimed a series of rapid actions: kneeling, twisting around, raising an imaginary blade, then running to the area hidden by the boulder. &apos;Don&apos;t you want a stand-in?&apos; Julian White, the chief lighting designer, asked. Like most of the crew, White, a commonsensical Englishman, had not worked with the director before. &apos;No, no, no,&apos; Herzog said. &apos;I&apos;m always the best stand-in.&apos; These days, film directors typically cocoon themselves, setting up shots by watching a monitor that displays a live feed from the cinematographer&apos;s lens; this tells them exactly how a scene will appear onscreen. But Herzog refuses to separate himself from the action: he wants to feel what he&apos;s filming. His participatory method struck many crew members as bizarre. &apos;How can you see the way a shot looks if you&apos;re the stand-in?&apos; White later muttered to himself. &apos;You can&apos;t see yourself.&apos; The fact that Herzog has been making films for more than 40 years didn&apos;t shake the collective judgment that he was doing it all wrong. The mood on the set was toxic. Josef Lieck, the first assistant director, said, &apos;For a man of his age, it&apos;s a very... raw talent. It&apos;s more like an 18-year-old running into the forest.&apos; A costume designer complained, &apos;He doesn&apos;t know basic things about filmmaking, things that simply make it easier to tell a story. He thinks that these things will undermine his vision, but they won&apos;t.&apos; Harry Knapp, an assistant director, said, &apos;There is a silent war on the set. We&apos;re all in a state of shock.&apos; Herzog, for his part, politely ignored the crew&apos;s complaints. Zeitlinger explained, &apos;When making a film, Werner tries to pretend nobody is around but him and the actors.&apos; Bale and Steve Zahn, who plays Martin, arrived at the mountainside - doing so required crossing a rushing river on a bridge consisting of a few wobbly bamboo poles - along with several actors from the local hill tribes. Herzog gave them succinct instructions; whenever he speaks, his hands make fluid, precise gestures, like those of a maestro. First, he said, Zahn&apos;s leg would be slashed by a Lao assailant. The beheading would occur offscreen. &apos;I do not want to show any gory detail,&apos; Herzog said. Zahn would then be replaced by a headless dummy, which would collapse at Bale&apos;s feet. Herzog had exercised a similar kind of restraint in Grizzly Man, which tells of an environmental activist, Timothy Treadwell, who became so enchanted by Alaskan bears that he attempted a trans-species version of going native - living in the animals&apos; habitat for months, and getting close to them, often with a video camera in hand. The sweetly deluded Treadwell could not see the dark truth of nature, Herzog explains in a typically doomy voiceover (&apos;I believe the common character of the universe is not harmony but hostility, chaos and murder&apos;), and Treadwell&apos;s experiment ended in dismemberment. The killing was caught on tape - Treadwell&apos;s lens cap was on, so the recording is audio only. Any other director would have used it. But in Grizzly Man the viewer sees only the back of Herzog&apos;s head as he listens through headphones; facing Herzog, and the camera, is Treadwell&apos;s former girlfriend, Jewel Palovak. As she silently gauges his horrified response, her face becomes a cracked mirror of the director&apos;s, telling viewers all they need to know. Zeitlinger suggested a way to combine the dummy&apos;s fall with an image of Bale rising up in the background, in order to give the scene a more &apos;balletic&apos; feel. No, Herzog said. &apos;If it&apos;s too perfect, then I&apos;ll hate it,&apos; he explained. The sequence had to be blunt and brutal. He turned to Bale, and said, &apos;First you&apos;re kneeling, then scream, then look behind you, see the Lao guys, and scream - this way, then this way. An intimidating scream, Christian.&apos; Bale asked various questions as Herzog showed him how to position his body, but he was deferential. The actor, who had just starred in the summer blockbuster Batman Begins, had long wanted to work with Herzog, and he was willing to submit to onerous demands; he had lost 55lb in about four months for the role, becoming cadaverous. Comfort with discomfort is widely seen as a prerequisite for making a Werner Herzog film. Perhaps unfairly, he is less renowned for his oddly brilliant movies than for the arduous, and sometimes savage, circumstances under which they were made. On the set of his 1972 masterpiece, Aguirre, The Wrath of God, a vertiginous portrait of a Spanish conquistador who unravels during a search for El Dorado, Herzog struggled to control his gifted but mercurial star, Klaus Kinski; at one point, when Kinski abruptly announced that he was quitting the production and leaving by canoe, Herzog threatened to shoot him. (&apos;I said, &quot;You may reach the next river bend, but you&apos;ll do so with all the bullets in this gun in your head - except the one for me,&quot; &apos; he recalled. &apos;He did not get in the boat. I believe that it was the right thing to do. Otherwise, there would be no Aguirre.&apos;) Fitzcarraldo, released in 1982, is a beguiling folly about an eccentric music lover in turn-of-the-century Peru, who is determined to raise money for a tropical opera house. Herzog&apos;s hero decides to become rich by harvesting rubber trees, and, one day, when looking at a map of the Amazon, he impulsively concludes that the fastest way to transport his cargo is to push his steamboat over a mountain, allowing it to jump from one river system to another. Fitzcarraldo&apos;s quixotic fantasy comes to fruition in one of the most lyrical sequences ever put on film. The episode, unfortunately, is now widely recalled not as a coup de cinema but as a leaden metaphor for the megalomania of film directors - because Herzog insisted on shooting the scene without special effects, a decision that nearly capsized the production. Bale, whose diet had left him severely enervated, looked wearily at the curtain of foliage into which he would soon run. To buoy his star, Herzog spoke to him about some footage that they had shot a few days earlier. In that scene, Dengler and Martin become ensnared in reeds along a river&apos;s edge. Herzog told Bale, &apos;You have never seen anything like this on film before, Christian. I am so happy. The wrangling with the vines, it&apos;s all physical. It&apos;s physical what you are doing and what the camera is doing. So you don&apos;t sense the camera. It&apos;s like another escapee. It really feels like the jungle is swallowing everything, even the camera.&apos; The river sequence, as filmed, was awkwardly long, but might well appear uncut in Herzog&apos;s edit. He believes in the occasional squirm-inducing shot. As he told me, &apos;Sometimes the beauty or the horror of an image only settles in the mind when it is shown for an extended period.&apos; His previous feature, The Wild Blue Yonder, a wily experiment with science fiction, is anchored by 21 minutes of unyieldingly slow underwater footage in which a scuba diver floats beneath the Antarctic ice shelf. (The hauntingly alien landscape - in which even coral is spined with ice - is meant to represent the interior of a distant planet.) The rain stopped, and the equipment was ready. &apos;OK, OK, let&apos;s do it now,&apos; Herzog said. Preparing the scene had taken, at most, 10 minutes. &apos;Action,&apos; he said. Now it was Zahn&apos;s turn to release a terrible, valley-shaking scream. Herzog yelled &apos;Cut!&apos; and immediately began preparing the shot of the falling dummy. On the ground was a drip-covered canister marked &apos;sugar-free fake blood&apos;. &apos;We won&apos;t use too much,&apos; he said. (The sight of blood makes him faint: &apos;It is my Achilles heel.&apos;) He walked over to the container, and seized an opportunity to jab back at the crew. Staring into the crowd hunched along the boulder, he asked, &apos;OK, may I have some blood from the Blood Department?&apos; One morning that week, Herzog stood amid the charred ruins of a small straw-hut settlement. It was only eight o&apos;clock, but the sun was already bullying; in an adjoining rice paddy, black butterflies hugged the shade. At dusk on the previous day, Herzog had filmed a scene in which Dengler, after making a bed of banana leaves for the delirious Martin, sets a thatched dwelling ablaze in a failed effort to attract attention from American rescue pilots. Herzog had been planning to film a few additional moments at the abandoned village - a genuine ruin, which he had discovered earlier in the summer - and he was not happy to learn that it had been aggressively incinerated by his crew, after he had left. The effects team had apparently deemed Herzog&apos;s rendition of the scene insufficiently pyrotechnic and had unleashed their full firepower, filming the village from the point of view of a helicopter, even though Herzog had made clear that he did not want aerial shots in the film. &apos;The site looks like what you&apos;d see after Gaiseric laid siege to Rome,&apos; Herzog joked bitterly. He is a connoisseur of ancient battles; whenever he makes a film, he takes along Livy&apos;s history of the Second Punic War. &apos;I read it for consolation when times get dire,&apos; he said. Herzog was having other battles with the production company, Gibraltar Entertainment. Bale&apos;s involvement had helped Herzog secure financing, but, compared with the average Hollywood movie, Rescue Dawn had a modest budget - around $10m - and Gibraltar had struggled to raise even this amount. Two weeks into the shoot, many crew members were grumbling that they had not been paid; the producers, they said, had shrugged off their complaints. Worse, Gibraltar had fired Walter Saxer, Herzog&apos;s longtime production manager and close friend. In protest, a dozen Thai crew members quit the production. The producers then dismissed Ulrich Bergfelder, a set designer who has worked with Herzog for 30 years, after a dispute over where to build the Pathet Lao prison. One of Gibraltar&apos;s principals, Steve Marlton, who was supervising the Rescue Dawn shoot, wanted the set constructed in southern Thailand, near the velvety beaches of Krabi. Bergfelder had argued that it would be cheaper and more authentic to build the prison nearby, in the hill country. But Marlton, a heavy man in his late thirties, was uncomfortable in the heat; crew members said that he visited the set rarely, remaining in an air-conditioned hotel, and speculated that he was desperate to leave the rainforest. Marlton, who made his fortune in the trucking industry, is new to the movie business. He is best known in Los Angeles for a popular night club that he co-owns, Pearl, which features erotic dancers performing inside translucent &apos;shadowboxes&apos;. Marlton&apos;s other film projects include Bottoms Up, a comedy starring Paris Hilton. Rescue Dawn is a canonical Herzogian tale, in that it portrays a man immersed in a situation of almost surreal extremity. Of course, you could say that of Die Hard. The Gibraltar website characterises Rescue Dawn as an &apos;action thriller, starring Christian Bale&apos;. Since shooting began, it had become clear that two rival visions had fatefully intersected in the Thai jungle. One group had come to make a Werner Herzog film; another group wanted to make an inexpensive war flick starring Batman. Herzog&apos;s inspection of the burnt village had left the soles of his bare feet black. He raised his hands and told the crew that he had an announcement. After a meeting with Marlton at the hotel, Josef Lieck, the first assistant director, and Edward McGurn, the second assistant director, had emerged convinced that they would never be properly paid. &apos;This is a very bitter moment for me,&apos; Herzog began. He wore a frayed rugby shirt and mirrored sunglasses; his sunburnt face had developed a magenta tinge. &apos;Josef and Edward do not have a contract, and they have hung in out of pure loyalty to the film and, to some degree, maybe to me. Today, they have decided that they leave the production.&apos; His voice broke off. &apos;OK, back to work,&apos; he said, adding a Lutherian vow: &apos;Here I stand. I have no choice. So help me God.&apos; The crew dispersed silently. Standing next to Herzog, and squeezing his hands with her own, was Lena, his wife of seven years. (His first marriage, to Martje Grohmann, a homeopath, ended in divorce.) Lena, a photographer, wore a celadon safari suit and had a heavy Leica camera around her neck; her lustrous blonde hair was tied in a ponytail. She has published several coffee-table books - one documents the culture of Spanish bullfighting - and she regularly takes stills for Herzog&apos;s productions. &apos;It&apos;s not an exciting assignment for me, but if I didn&apos;t do it, I&apos;d never see the man,&apos; she told me. Lena, who is 37, grew up in Siberia, and, in 1990, went to Stanford to do research in archeology; with her husband, she has travelled to places even more inhospitable than the Russian tundra. ..&apos;I remember the time we visited this tribal area, five days by boat from Guayaramerin, Bolivia, which we were told was cannibalistic,&apos; she recalled. &apos;We spent the night outside, in two hammocks. That night, when I heard a noise near us, I woke up, gasping, &quot;Werner, it&apos;s them!&quot; He sleepily replied, &quot;When they come, we won&apos;t hear them.&quot; He went straight back to sleep. I didn&apos;t.&apos; Spending time with Werner Herzog can make you feel as if you were trapped inside one of those postmodern novels of paranoia, in which a series of ominous-seeming events appear to be linked by more than chance. Why has Herzog&apos;s career been so consistently plagued by intrigue, peril, and disaster? Is there no overarching explanation for the pattern of catastrophe? &apos;My character has nothing to do with it - it&apos;s just statistics, abnormal statistics, even though nobody will believe me,&apos; he said during a visit to his home in Los Angeles, a comfortable bungalow in Laurel Canyon. It was hidden from the street by bushes so overgrown that they had knocked over the front fence. &apos;People who do not know me think that I like filmmaking to be difficult,&apos; he continued. &apos;I do not. And I do not take unnecessary risks.&apos; He added, &apos;I have avoided the undoable things.&apos; In the Nineties, he decided not to pursue a project in Sudan, after enough people told him that he&apos;d get killed in the midst of the ongoing civil war. He also abandoned plans to make a feature film on K2, the Himalayan mountain. The German mountaineer Reinhold Messner - the subject of a 1984 Herzog documentary - assured him that such a shoot would result in many deaths. &apos;There are just too many avalanches,&apos; Herzog explained, with a wistful shrug. &apos;Now, I admit, I do not have a perfectly clean record,&apos; he said. &apos;I did climb La Soufriere when it was in danger of erupting.&apos; In 1977, he shot documentary footage from the lip of the volcano, which is on Guadeloupe, while it was regularly spewing toxic fumes. He emphasised, however, that he wasn&apos;t driven by a desire to tempt fate: &apos;What I had heard was that there was one man who had refused to evacuate. That is what fascinated me - to explore a human being whose view of death is so different, who does something inexplicable.&apos; In the end, La Soufriere never blew up, baffling geologists. &apos;I loved that,&apos; he recalled, laughing. &apos;It made my whole project wonderfully embarrassing.&apos; The documentary ends in wry voiceover: he pronounces his film &apos;pathetic&apos;, a &apos;report on an inevitable catastrophe that did not take place&apos;. (For all his moments of self-seriousness, Herzog enjoys poking fun at his manly escapades; a memoir about the making of Fitzcarraldo, which was recently published in German, is titled Conquest of the Useless. Herzog was sitting in his living room, a skylit space lined with books. On one shelf, near a copy of Martin Luther&apos;s Bible, is a framed photograph of his youngest child, Simon, standing next to a very large boa constrictor in the Amazon. (Simon, then nine, is now 16; Herzog&apos;s older son, Rudolph, a magician and filmmaker, is 34; his daughter, Hanna, an art student in Amsterdam, is 25.) Herzog took the picture himself, during the filming of a 2000 documentary, Wings of Hope, about Juliane Koepcke, a female counterpart to Dieter Dengler; in 1971, as a teenager, she survived a jetliner crash in Peru and made it out of the jungle alone. Simon was his &apos;co-combatant&apos; in the jungle, Herzog recalled fondly. &apos;He found some airplane parts that had been completely covered up by the forest.&apos; At one point, he said, Simon got very sick - &apos;from food poisoning or something, it was never clear&apos; - but he &apos;had a great time&apos;.

Is it possible to fly from Miami to Havana?Patrick Reynolds, Kent The US embargo on trade prevents Americans from spending money in Cuba and, therefore, going there at all. As a result, the only direct flights are charters available to US Nationals - usually Cuban-born Americans - who have appropriate licences. US authorities, however, have no jurisdiction to prevent foreign nationals visiting Cuba as a side-trip via a third country, through Mexico or the Caribbean for example. Havanatour (01707 646463; havanatour.co.uk) can book a return from Nassau in the Bahamas to Havana for \u00a3189 per person and a flight from Miami to Nassau, booked when in the US, should be available for under \u00a3100.

On the way out we were booked straight through. On the way back our luggage was booked through but we were told to go to the transfer desk at Schipol to get our boarding cards for the last leg to Newcastle. We arrived at the transfer desk almost three hours before our flight but were told that economy class had been overbooked. We were given boarding cards but not allocated seats. We were told to go to the appropriate gate an hour before the flight to see if we had a seat and were given a leaflet about compensation and assistance in case we were refused boarding. In the end we did get seats but only after two hours of stressful waiting.  We had booked and paid for our flights in May and we checked in at Florence at 5.15am, seven hours before our flight from Schipol.  The whole episode seems extraordinary. Is this policy of deliberate overbooking widespread and legal? It certainly smacks of the unethical.Tony Webster, by email In short, yes. Airlines can legally overbook a flight, and it is widespread. This dastardly practice came into being due to the airlines desperate desire to avoid running anything other than completely full planes. Many airlines, but usually not the budget carriers (whose planes are full anyway), do it. It helps to know your rights in this situation. The airline is obliged to seek volunteers to be rerouted or reassigned tickets on to a later flight, in exchange for compensation. If the airline does not get sufficient volunteers and has to prevent you boarding against your will, you would be entitled to compensation calculated on how far you&apos;re going and how long the delay is. In this case, it would be \u20ac125 per passenger for a delay of up to two hours, rising to \u20ac250 if the delay was over two hours. The airline would also have to put you on another flight to your destination (or offer a full refund if you prefer), and pay your incidental expenses - two telephone calls, meals and if needed, hotel accommodation. KLM say that they would have offered you an upgrade in the end if economy had been full, but this wasn&apos;t necessary. They accept that it was a stressful experience. The Air Transport Users Council (020 7240 6061; caa.co.uk) has full details of compensation and how to go about getting it.  I am described as a British subject in my passport. Last month I was turned back at the Air Canada check-in desk at Heathrow Airport because I did not have a visa for Canada. I have been to Canada four times previously on the same passport, twice in 2006, all without a visa. When I asked how long ago the regulations had changed, however, I was told that they had been in place for years. This was confirmed at the Canadian High Commission.  Since my return, I have written twice to the High Commission for an explanation as to why I was turned back. Visa application forms have been sent in reply. My travel agent was shocked by what happened. Can you provide an explanation? Maggie Thomson, Isleworth I&apos;m afraid I can only offer sympathy. Holders of a British Subject passport need a visa for Canada, so the airline staff were right to turn you away. These passports are mainly issued to people born in the Republic of Ireland before 1949. Canada, in line with the US, does not include these passports as part of its visa-free travel programme.  The rules haven&apos;t changed, but in today&apos;s more security-obsessed climate, the implementation of them certainly has. This explains why you&apos;ve got through in the past but didn&apos;t on your most recent trip.

The author of the lyrics was the actor, scriptwriter and playwright Myles Rudge, who has died aged 81. Rudge was born into a middle-class family in Bristol, and attended Bristol grammar school. In 1944 he was called up to serve in the Royal Navy. After tours of duty in Greece and Malta, Rudge was demobbed in 1947. At school he had been an enthusiastic actor (one of his classmates was the future playwright Peter Nichols), and he went on to study at Rada in London. The early 1950s found Rudge acting in repertory in various parts of England and Scotland, where he starred in a Dundee production of Great Expectations with Virginia McKenna. The peak of his stage career was probably Julian Slade&apos;s musical Salad Days, in which Rudge was called upon to ask the immortal, and often derided, question: &quot;Anyone for tennis?&quot; By this time, he had begun to write comedy scripts, some of which were accepted by radio producers or by performers such as Robert Morley and Hermione Gingold. The turning point in Rudge&apos;s career came when he teamed up in the late 1950s with a young composer called Ted Dicks. Rudge and Dicks submitted material for the then thriving revue genre, shows that mixed witty sketches with comic songs. In 1960, they created And Another Thing, a revue featuring Anna Quayle, Lionel and Joyce Blair, and Cribbins. Martin, whose Parlophone label already featured the Goons and Peter Sellers, saw the show and decided to record Cribbins&apos;s satirical number Folk Song. Released as a single, it enjoyed enough success for Dicks and Rudge to be asked to provide new material for Cribbins&apos;s next discs. Their first effort was Hole in the Ground, which became a Top Ten hit early in 1962. It introduced the persona of the chirpy workman, irked by the bowler-hatted bureaucrat who supervised his excavations, to the extent that, by the end of the song, the hole had been filled in and &quot;beneath it is the bloke in the bowler hat - and that&apos;s that!&quot; Later in 1962, Cribbins was back in the Top Ten with Right Said Fred, the tale of an impossible task for a trio of removal men. Rudge&apos;s lyrics left the nature of the object to be moved unclear, although the song was inspired by the delivery of a piano to Dicks. It captured the cadences of vernacular speech, in such asides as the phlegmatic narrator&apos;s &quot;but it did no good - well I never thought it would&quot;. Both songs have had an enduring popularity, partly though children&apos;s radio shows, while a 1990s pop group led by Fred Fairbrass chose Right Said Fred as its name. In 2004, the playwright and journalist Philip Glassborow narrated a BBC radio documentary that brought together Cribbins, Martin, Dicks and Rudge. Martin praised the songs for their &quot;very clever lyrics and quirky melodies, which hung together so neatly, leaving plenty of space for us to create a sound picture. All we had to do was add the right sound effects and musical arrangements.&quot; Dicks and Rudge were now in demand as pop songwriters. Their only subsequent hit was A Windmill in Old Amsterdam, about a mouse wearing clogs, in 1965 for Ronnie Hilton, but their songs were recorded by the actors Topol, Jim Dale and Joan Sims, and by Petula Clark. In 1967, the duo also created an album of songs for Kenneth Williams, On Pleasure Bent, although Rudge&apos;s lyrics were less camp than that title suggests. In later years, he wrote book and lyrics for pantomimes and Christmas shows directed by Giles Havergal at Glasgow Citizens Theatre. He was also a volunteer for the Samaritans. \u00b7 Myles Peter Carpenter Rudge, actor, playwright and songwriter, born July 8 1926; died October 10 2007", "sentences": ["Their only subsequent hit was A Windmill in Old Amsterdam, about a mouse wearing clogs, in 1965 for Ronnie Hilton, but their songs were recorded by the actors Topol, Jim Dale and Joan Sims, and by Petula Clark."], "title": "Obituary: Myles Rudge", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/nov/05/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries", "tags": []}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-05T13:46:50Z", "article": "The tour group files into my room as I&apos;m unpacking. Halfway through her speech on the design of my bedside table the guide does a double take. We size each other up. Me \u2013 neatly folded underwear in hand \u2013 and her, shocked out of her routine. There&apos;s an awkward pause before she hastily ushers her charges out of the room. This sort of thing must happen from time to time at the Lloyd, a maze-like 116-room hotel stretched along the bank of Amsterdam&apos;s trendy east docklands area.  Opened in 1921 by the shipping company De Koninklijke Hollandsche Lloyd, the Lloyd building has at various times provided budget accommodation for eastern European emigrants, held resistance fighters captured by the occupying German forces during the second world war and been used as studio space by Amsterdam&apos;s art set.  This rich history, plus the public interest in the Lloyd&apos;s current incarnation as a hotel-cum-showcase for contemporary design might explain the tour group&apos;s wayward presence.  It&apos;s not hard to see why they&apos;re queuing up to take a look around. The interior design of the Lloyd \u2013 a collaborative effort featuring work by big-name Dutch designers like Marcel Wanders and Jurgen Bey \u2013 is a riot of creativity.  Most of the fixtures from the building&apos;s troubled past have been re-used or re-imagined. So the floors are plasticised, the bar is housed in the old shower room (it&apos;s still got the original pipes, tiles and an odd echo to prove it) and the reception desk is separated from the entrance hall by a thick sheet of security glass.  Beyond the entrance hall lies Snel, the hotel&apos;s huge in-house restaurant. Dutch, French and Italian dishes are cooked using locally-sourced ingredients. Prices are reasonable. A generous portion of grilled mackerel with a side salad and chips came to \u20ac16.50 (\u00a311). But it&apos;s hard to concentrate on your food when you&apos;re being watched by yet more sightseers \u2014 this time perched on a gallery 100m above your head.  Up in the bedrooms what&apos;s left of the rulebook is torn to shreds. The Lloyd has no set star rating. Instead each room is graded individually, based on surface area. Opt for a one-star room (from \u20ac95 to \u20ac105 (\u00a366 to \u00a373) and you&apos;ll receive the same privileges as a five-star guest (satellite TV, 24-hour room service and free internet access) but you&apos;ll be squeezed into a space that will have you empathising with the inmates of the Lloyd&apos;s previous incarnation.  You&apos;ll also miss out on some truly bizarre interior design. In one five-star suite (\u20ac295 to \u20ac350 (\u00a3205 to \u00a3244)) a gigantic bright-red mirror featuring a plastic boar&apos;s head looms over a grand piano illuminated by designer Rodi Grauman&apos;s &quot;85 lamps chandelier&quot;: a bunch of 85 light bulbs suspended from a long length of electrical cord.  A fibreglass stairway lurches up to a mezzanine, where a bed made up for eight stretches from wall to wall. The bathroom is a pine-panelled pod separated from the rest of the room and plonked merrily halfway up the entrance hall. It&apos;s Dali-esque to the point that I&apos;m disappointed when the clock above the bed doesn&apos;t start dripping down the wall. Like Dali&apos;s work, the Lloyd is terribly clever, yet somewhat soulless and it feels at times that in their efforts to escape the building&apos;s past the designers have chosen to escape reality altogether. My unwalled toilet was five metres from the door to the landing \u2013 a bold move. It was an even bolder one to feel comfortable using it.  No doubt the Lloyd is an exciting and vital part of Amsterdam&apos;s rich cultural scene, but those who don&apos;t want to be constantly challenged and provoked by their accommodation might be advised to avoid checking in and just take the tour instead.

This year, however, the coals-to-Newcastle cliche is moving from the exception to the rule. For decades, British food has been scorned by the superior gourmands of the world. But the reality is that food and drink exports from the UK are thriving, with a record \u00a311bn-worth of goods set to be sold abroad this year according to Food From Britain, an export marketing consultancy funded by the government and the food industry. British manufacturers, it turns out, have stumbled upon a new recipe to titillate foreign palates: mixing the historic appeal of classic products, such as whisky, with rebranded, upmarket versions of things that other countries should, by rights, make far more successfully. Posh chocolate We Brits may believe that Belgians are the ultimate purveyors of fine chocolate but increasingly, it seems, the Belgians believe that we are: exports of British chocolate to the country rose by 16% in the first half of this year. According to Chris Brockman of Food from Britain, there is a clear &quot;premium indulgence&quot; trend in the international food industry, and Britain is reaping the benefit chocolate-wise. The taste for upmarket and organic dark chocolate has been smartly exploited by nimble, fast-growing companies; Green &amp; Black&apos;s, for example, is now doing a roaring trade in North America. The biggest market for our chocolate is actually Ireland, but after that come France, Holland and Belgium - all nations who like to think they can teach us a thing or two about fine confectionery. Booze Beef may once have been the archetypal British food export but, appropriately enough for a nation of binge-drinkers, it is now very definitely booze. Astonishingly, whisky accounts for nearly a quarter of all our food and drink exports: the trade was worth \u00a31.1bn in the first six months of this year, a surge of 9% on the year before. Drinks manufacturers have been rubbing their hands with glee for a while now about the thirst for cheap British spirits in Asian markets such as Japan and South Korea. This thirst is most extraordinary in Singapore, where sales of whisky rose by 118% in the first half of this year. The Spanish also enjoy our gin, but the coals-to-Newcastle bit really comes in the burgeoning sales of ale to Ireland. Real ales from small breweries are doing particularly well (although the first-half-of-year sales of \u00a330m are still a drop in the ocean compared with the UK&apos;s consumption of Guinness). Tea Britain is no longer the greatest nation of tea drinkers (Ireland downs more, per head of population) but it still makes a cuppa of quid (sorry) selling classic brands such as Twinings and Tetley around the world. British Empire-era manufacturing thrived by taking the produce of one colony and selling it to another, and that is still the model for our tea industry today: while tentative tea-growing may be occurring in parts of Cornwall, almost all the tea we export is grown abroad and only blended, packaged and branded in this country. &quot;British&quot; tea is doing particularly well in Canada at the moment: it bought \u00a316.6m-worth of our dried leaves between January and June this year. Breakfast cereal Apart from a cup of black tea or a bowl of yoghurt and honey, the Greeks are not known for their breakfasts. But now, it seems, they have developed a hunger for a hearty British start to the day. Sales of UK cereals to Greece rose by 28% in the first half of this year, a statistic made only marginally less baffling when Brockman explains that it may in part be due to the number of British holidaymakers and expats demanding a bowl of milky cereal to scoff by the poolside every morning. Once again, our cleverly marketed premium brands seem to be slipping down foreigners&apos; throats particularly well - although just 27 years old, Dorset Cereals has sprung from nowhere to sell well in Europe in recent times. In China, Weetabix is popping up on the shelves of high-end &quot;western-style&quot; supermarkets, and is being bought by wealthy, westernised consumers. Cheese No word yet on the success of British clogs in Amsterdam, but cheddar cheese is certainly biting into those Dutch staples, gouda and edam. Sales of cheddar to Holland increased by 38% in the first half of this year. It is the &quot;extra mature&quot; cheddar market that is thriving and once again, the British appear to be masters of marketing it. &quot;The image and reputation of cheddar was destroyed a little bit because it could be made outside the UK and it has been seen as an &apos;ingredients cheese&apos;,&quot; says Brockman. &quot;Now producers are getting it back to being a quality farmhouse product - cheese you can put on your cheeseboard rather than just melting it on your toast.&quot; But it&apos;s not just cheddar that&apos;s doing well: stilton exports to France, for example, are up 37%. World foods The story of Patak&apos;s selling its pickles and sauces to the Indian subcontinent has already been told; but Patak&apos;s is just the tip of the iceberg: the UK&apos;s &quot;world food&quot; manufacturers are among the biggest and fastest growing exporters in the country. Traditionally the pattern is of immigrant communities first cooking their food for their own folk, then selling it to their host communities before exporting new hybrids (such as chicken tikka masala) to their countries of origin. But it has gone beyond that now. The Indian, Thai and Mexican food producer Noon, for example, has successfully introduced its chilled ready meals into Germany, while Geeta&apos;s sauces and pickles are also selling well there. &quot;Indian food in Germany is really going through quite a big boom,&quot; says Brockman - British Indian food, that is. Perhaps the most striking illustration of the weird world of Britain&apos;s global exports is the success of Britain&apos;s Discovery Foods, which sells Mexican sauces to Denmark and Sweden. (The Swedes, curiously enough, have the biggest appetite for Mexican food per head of population in Europe.) And the next big British food export success story? Probably Polish cuisine, according to Food From Britain. &quot;Polish food is quite big in UK supermarkets now but no one is seriously producing it in the UK yet,&quot; says Brockman. &quot;I can imagine in a few years time it could be being produced in the UK and in a decade&apos;s time we&apos;ll probably be exporting it as a British product.&quot; Word of Mouth More from Graham Holliday on our cereal exports on the food blog", "sentences": ["Cheese No word yet on the success of British clogs in Amsterdam, but cheddar cheese is certainly biting into those Dutch staples, gouda and edam."], "title": "Patrick Barkham on how Britain is selling food to the world", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/06/foodanddrink.japan", "tags": ["Business", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-06T21:51:56Z", "article": "Preamble: Excluding that of an English stag party in Amsterdam, Celtic&apos;s behaviour is the most predictable in Europe - they flop away and win at home. And that pattern will have to continue tonight if Gordon Strachan&apos;s troops are to have any chance of marching into the last 16 for the second year in succession. On the previous eight times that Celtic have played host to Portuguese opposition, they&apos;ve won seven and drawn one but that doesn&apos;t mean jock squat - in fact, it&apos;s precisely the sort of irrelevant bumf that media wafflers blurt out just to fill space: as if the outcome of tonight&apos;s match could in any way be influenced by the fact that Celtic beat Vitoria Setubal 68 years ago (actually that&apos;s not a fact, but the point, like wine stains on bed sheets no matter how many times you scrub &apos;em, remains). Much more pertinent is the fact that Celtic were absolute pap in Lisbon two weeks ago. Then again Lisbon, the keen geographers amongst you will know, is not Glasgow. And Chris Killen is not Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink. Actually, he is. Hold on, I was right the first time: he isn&apos;t.  Teams: Celtic: Boruc, Naylor, Caldwell, Kennedy, McManus, Scott Brown, Hartley, Jarosik, McGeady, Vennegoor of Hesselink, McDonald. Subs: Mark Brown, Zurawski, Riordan, Sno, Donati, Killen, O&apos;Dea.  Benfica: Quim, Luis Felipe, Edcarlos, Luisao, Leo, Katsouranis, Rui Costa, Pereira, Binya, Rodriguez, Cardozo. Subs: Butt, Zoro, Bergessio, Di Maria, Nuno Gomes, Nuno Assis, Adu.  Referee: Martin Hansson (Sweden) 7.33pm: URGENT! The official weather report from Uefa puts humidity at 75% and notes that it&apos;s &quot;a partly cloudy night&quot;, which is quite surprising, as I&apos;d always believed Uefa fat cats to be very glass half full (and plate never empty) kind of guys. Instead, then, it falls to me to tell you that the Glasgow sky tonight is partly not cloudy.  7.41pm: &quot;I hope Celtic win tonight because it&apos;s my birthday,&quot; splutters Rod Stewart - not the Rod Stewart presumably, as I&apos;ve just checked and he doesn&apos;t turn 103 until next January. Incidentally, Vennegoor of Hesselink will be 29 tomorrow. Altogether now: so what. 7.43 pm: Out trudge the teams to the tune of that most maudlin of football anthems.  1 min: Benfica get the ball rolling. &quot;Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink is a big-name player,&quot; reckons Sky&apos;s commentator, teeing up a gag far too obvious for me to inflict on you ....  4 mins: Benfica monopolise the early possession, stroking the ball around leisurely, but aimlessly. As soon as Celtic get the ball, they seek to ratchet up the tempo - but their haste is not complemented by any great precision. Result: it&apos;s scrappy stuff. 5 mins: Katsouranis skins Naylor and scorches to the by-line down the right ... but his cross flies straight into Boruc&apos;s arms. 7 mins: Benfica are thriving down the right. After a misplaced pass from Naylor, several Benfica players exchanged snappy passes before Cardozo spun past McManus and fired goalward from 18 yards. Boruc spread himself well to bat it out for a corner. 10 mins: Some respite for Celtic at last as McGeady intercepts a Benfica pass and starts to slalom towards goal. He&apos;s cruelly chopped down, winning a free that Hartley flights to the back post. Kennedy is totally unmarked and from just five yards heads the ball ... wide! Shocking miss. He holds his head in his hands, but should really hold them over his ears, because some caustic curses are being hurled at him, and that&apos;s just from GU Towers. 12 mins: Another fabulous save from Boruc after Boruc outsprinted McManus to latch on to a clever headed pass from Binya and rifle a powerful shot towards goal. From the resultant corner, Luisao nodded narrowly over. 15 mins: With their slick passing and movement, Benfica are tearing Celtic apart. The only solution Caldwell can come up with is to clatter in to Pereira. Rui Costa takes the free-kick quickly, sliding it out to the right, where Naylor appears to have completely abandoned his post. Fortunately for him, Pereira&apos;s cross was wayward.  18 mins: McDonald lays the ball off to Brown some 25 yards from goal and the midfielder hammers a swerving shot towards goal. Quim, despite being visibly confused by the trajectory, manages to palm it away for a corner. Encouraging for Celtic! The corner is delivered straight to a defender at the near post. Less encouraging for Celtic! 21 mins: Hartley drives in a corner. Jarosik soars to meet it but his header is blocked by a defender before Rui Costa boots the ball to safety. At this point, given the energetic if contrasting toing and froing from both sides, I&apos;ll venture to say this match will not end 0-0. 23 mins: After Quim saved well from McDonald, Benfica bounded up the other end and Boruc made a UN operation out of trying to collect a headed back pass from Kennedy. After fumbling it, he attemptedto swipe it clear with his left foot but wafted it straight to Cardozo - at that precise moment Naylor chose to make his first useful contribution to Celtic tonight and stole in to pinch the ball off the striker&apos;s foot.  24 mins: From an acute angle McDonald draws a decent save from Quim. The keeper flaps at the ensuing corner and is grateful to see a team-mate spank the ball clear. This is a wildly open game.  27 mins: Like an escaped fugitive, Jarosik goes to ground. Naylor sizes up the free-kick, works out that it&apos;s 28 yards from goal ... and curls it delicately over the bar.  30 mins: A lull in play. You don&apos;t know this, but I made a principled editorial decision before taking to the keypad tonight not to publish any correspondence making smutty reference to the name of the Benfica goalkeeper. On reflection, I wish I&apos;d made that clear at the start - because of the dozens of emails I&apos;ve received so far, none of them are about anything else. You filthy, filthy beggars. As my English teacher wrote on my report card way back when: pleez do betttttar. 33 mins: Rodriguez and Katsouranis waltz their way into the Celtic box before Naylor butts the ball clear at the near post. &quot;Gary Naylor can correspond with the Liverpool MBM reporter, get skinned by a Benfica player, and recover to correspond with the Chelsea MBM reporter? Extraordinary,&quot; quips Tracy Mohr, making no reference whatsoever to Quim, which is why she got published. See, it&apos;s really not that hard.   36 mins: Like a skunk in child birth, Naylor is having a stinker. Twice in quick succession he gave the ball away on the right, and the second occasion lay the platform for a rapid Benfica break, which was only ended by a crude foul on Rodriguez at the edge of the box. Six men tremble in the wall, thousands boo furiously in the stand ... and Rui Costa wellies the ball high into the stands! 40 mins: Only one side look like scoring now, and it&apos;s not the one in radioactive yellow (because they&apos;re playing in Gelsenkirchen): it&apos;s the one in red and black, who are to nimble of mind and deft of touch for the toiling hosts. 42 mins: After a sloppy Benfica corner, McGeady attempts to initiate a counter-attack but is tugged back by Pereira, who cops a deserved yellow card. 43 mins: Rodriguez carries the ball 50 yards forward to the brink of the Celtic box, then takes a tumble in the vicinity of Hartley. The ref awards a free-kick, giving Rui Costa the opportunity to drift the ball towards the penalty spot - but Harltey bangs it clear with his head. Luis Felipe lofts it back towards the box and Boruc comes to collect ... but again fumbles it! Much more of that sort of shoddiness and all those rumours about him being bought by Arsenal to replace Jens Lehmann will gain further momentum. 45 mins: GOAL!! Celtic 1-0 Benfica Against the run of play, but who cares? Certainly not the jubilant horde in Celtic Park. McGeady collected the ball wide on the right and sauntered forward. Naylor hurtled up on the outside to offer an overlap, but the Irishman cut inside on to his right foot and unleashes a drive from 25 yards. It took a nick off Luisao and flew past the keeper into the net!  Half-time:  46 mins: No changes to either side. 47 mins: Naylor lamps a long ball forward and McDonald sets off in chase. He gets there first but his touch is so heavy it should have a double chin. Edcarlos stifles the danger.  50 mins: Now that Celtic have something to cling on to, their dynamism and tackling has become even more ferocious. Benfica&apos;s passing (and finishing) is going to have to be even crisper than in the first period if they&apos;re to get back into this. 53 mins: Roll reversal: tidy interplay between Celtic, featuring a dainty turn by Jarosik and a canny pass from Brown. It all ended with a feisty - and fair - Leo challenge on the edge of the Benfica box. 55 mins: McGeady crosses towards the penalty area. Jarosik attempts to take it down but his touch betrays him ... but the ball squirts as far as McDonald, who turns past Binya and then appears to be bundled to the ground by the defender. The crowd demand a penalty but the referee awards a free out. Mr Referee, if you&apos;re reading this (and I&apos;m not ruling that out because you don&apos;t appear to be following what happens on the pitch very closely), that was a woeful decision.  57 mins: Celtic are gaining in confidence and, while retaining their high tempo, are starting to play some slick stuff. Benfica are struggling to cope, Binya in particular: he&apos;s just clattered into McGeady, and this time the ref does give Celtic the free. But Celtic waste it.  60 mins: McGeady twists inside and then slips a sly reverse pass out to Naylor, whose cross is overhit and easily cleared. 61 mins: After Jarosik is barged to the ground, Naylor arrows a free-kick towards the back post. Kennedy soars, but not, alas, high enough to connect with the ball. 62 mins: Benfica substitution: Pereira off, Angel Di Maria on. 64 mins: Benfica enjoy their first bout of sustained pressure of the second half - and Celtic need Hartley to make a heroic tackle to block a Cardozo shot. But then the home defence switches off, allowing Rodriguez to swing the ball back in. Cardozo, inexplicably unmarked, heads the ball wide from four yards, equally inexplicably.  66 mins: Celtic, wisely resolving that attack is the best form of defence, rollick forward, with McGeady again to the fore. After his cross three defenders had to converge on McDonald to prevent the little Australian getting a shot off. 67 mins: Celtic changes: Vennegoor of Hesslink and Jarosik replaced by Killen and Donati.  68 mins: Edcarlos meets a Benfica corner at the near post and Naylor has to react briskly to butt if off the line! 71 mins: Ohhhhh! McDonald barged his way through the centre and then spotted Brown&apos;s superb burst before dinking the ball into his path. Brown took one touch and unleashed a rocket. Quim beats it away well. &quot;This is all very well but with Celtic&apos;s atrocious away record and the fact they&apos;ll almost certainly need something in the San Siro in their last game, doesn&apos;t it all seem a bit futile?&quot; Well, Michael Gibbons, according to that logic Celtic shouldn&apos;t even bother entering the tournament - in fact, only a handful of teams should. But then again, Michael, Celtic did draw in the San Siro last season, albeit before going down in extra-time.  73 mins: McGeady loses possession to Felipe but then battles and wins it straight back and pumps a shot into Quim&apos;s chest. Then Benfica, showing that despite Celtic&apos;s dominance this match is not yet over, lurch down the other end and Cardozo forces a decent save from Boruc. 76 mins: &quot;Paul, what must we do to be saved?&quot; implores Alec McCaulay. &quot;I tried tempting providence for the Scotland-Ukraine match, that worked fine; but it was disastrous versus Georgia. Tonight I have been mostly watching the TV, with occasional dips into this MBM - should I persist with this, or switch to clenched fists and staring remorselessly at the scoreline at the top? What works for you?&quot; Well, mostly what works for me is bashing nonsense into a keypad and OH GOOD LORD, BENFICA NEARLY SCORED, RUI COSTA CLIPPING A FREE-KICK TOWARDS THE BACK POST AND MCMANUS NODDING IT BEHIND (so actually, it wasn&apos;t really that close to a goal at all). 78 mins: Benfica changes: Cardozo, whose general play has been lively but whose finishing has been abysmal, is replaced by Nuno Gomes; and Rui Costa toddles off to allow Bergessio to enter the fray. 81 mins: As Leo begins probing around the Celtic box, the home crowd begin pleading for the final whistle - now that&apos;s just ridiculous. &quot;That swearing you mentioned in GU Towers, did it come from one S Murray?&quot; wonders one G Templeton. No, it came from me. Oh yes, and S Murray. And all the others: we&apos;re a very united team here at GU, you see. And extremely foul-mouthed. 84 mins: Celtic are absorbing what Benfica can throw at them, but the tension remains palpable. &quot;So do you have a betty on Celtic tonight then?&quot; inquires Ivan Harvey. A betty? Is that some kind of urban argot or are you suggesting I&apos;d actually wager a woman on the outcome of a football match? You, sir, are a cad. 85 mins: The whole Celtic team charge towards Binya after he perpetrates a grotesque foul on Brown, driving his studs into the Scot&apos;s shin. He could easily have shattered Brown&apos;s leg, and the ref arrives quickly on the scene and immediately flashes the red card. 87 mins: Brown, who had got back to his feet after that assault, is now down, shaking his head forlornly. Play pauses, and it looks like Celtic will have to make a change - and Brown, one of the brightest young midfielders in Britain, may miss Scotland&apos;s upcoming joust with Italy ... 90 mins:Celtic are finishing on the attack, fizzing the ball around the Benfica box much to the pleasure of their delirious fans. Sno, on for Brown, nearly brought them to orgasm with a meaty shot, but it was diverted to safety by Luisao. 90+1 mins: McGeady receives the ball at the left-hand side of the box, jinks to create space for the shot, then hammers the ball towards goal, but Quim tips it over the bar. 90+4 mins: Celtic remain on the front foot, there seems no way they can lose this now. Similarly, there was no way McDonald was going to score with that 30-yard shot from an acute angle. Full-time: Celtic record yet another home victory, McGeady crowing a regal performance with a fine winner. Benfica looked far superior early on but, as ever at Celtic Park, the home side refused to buckle and eventually came belting back.

That will ensure that the treaty, the successor to the doomed constitution, will go into history as the Treaty of Lisbon in the manner of the 1957 Treaty of Rome, the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty and the 2001 Nice Treaty. Belgium, however, insists that the summit resume its business in its capital on the nights of December 13 and 14, in accordance with the 2001 treaty. Neither side will back down. The decision by EU leaders to cave in to the demands of Portugal and Belgium that they fly at least 48,000 person-miles to sign into being a &quot;reform&quot; treaty designed to bring Europe &quot;closer to its citizens&quot; is being denounced as a wasteful extra cost and an unnecessarily increased carbon footprint. A series of top-level meetings to resolve the diplomatic impasse has failed, with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who suggested staying in Lisbon for the whole summit, recanting, followed by the British, French and Italians. Experts calculate that the split summit will add between 10 and 15 extra tonnes of CO2 to the carbon footprint of an EU that sees itself as the global champion of the fight against global warming - on top of the 20,000 tonnes produced by the monthly journeys to Strasbourg of MEPs, commissioners, officials and aides.", "sentences": ["That will ensure that the treaty, the successor to the doomed constitution, will go into history as the Treaty of Lisbon in the manner of the 1957 Treaty of Rome, the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty and the 2001 Nice Treaty."], "title": "EU leaders will fly across Europe just to sign treaty", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/06/eu.politics", "tags": ["World news", "European Union", "Politics", "Environment", "Emissions trading"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-07T15:47:00Z", "article": "A few years ago, writes Caroline Foley, when researching for one of my books, I went to see a few of the organic allotments around Amsterdam. It was a revelation. As in the rest of Europe, some have chalets for use as a summer holiday homes along with running water, plumbing and electricity. And unlike here, where the law (widely ignored) states that we should grow &apos;mostly vegetables&apos;, there are no restrictions on what to grow. The plots are as full of flowers as they are of vegetables.  One of the things that impressed me most, was that in every site I visited, wildlife was given priority. The Dutch Allotment Association (the AVVN) offers training schemes and awards marks for wildlife conservation. Each allotment site has a Wildlife Committee. Apart from the familiar bat boxes, insect &apos;hotels&apos; and bird boxes, the planting of impenetrable hedges for nesting birds and hibernating insects - fairly common on allotments in the UK - quite often a couple of plots are turned over to make a small meadow.  Typically this would be sown with wheat and barley as well poppies, cornflowers, field buttercups, ox eye daisies and a great selection of wild flowers.  Does anyone know of an allotment cornfield over here? Being in Holland there was always water somewhere on the site for a wetland habitat. In one a mound of stones covered with leaves had been made to offer cover to grass snakes, slow worms and reptiles of all sorts. In south facing spots along the woodland edge the grasses would be left long to provide privacy and sunny cover for beetle, meadow butterflies and other insects. Old wood was piled on to the woodpile on an annual basis and left to rot down for yet more invertebrate life. These were all ideas that would be good to introduce here more widely - food for thought in the winter months. What to do this month? If you need to do any digging, get onto it when the ground is still workable before the frosts. Spread well-rotted manure and compost on top and dig it in as you go.  Heavy soils can be left roughly dug for the frosts to break them down further and to birds to feast on the exposed pests - underground slugs and larvae. Light soils are usually better left until spring and covered with polythene to prevent rains leaching out the nutrients. Onions and brassicas like firm soil so prepare the onion bed now to settle over the winter. Get ready for the cold. Lag down pipes from the shed to the water butt.  In chilly areas, insulate cold frames with polystyrene. Bubble wrap over the top will raise the temperature inside by a few degrees. Float a ball in the pond to prevent it freezing over. If your plot is in a cold blustery spot, put up windbreaks. The desiccating and tearing effect of wind combined with cold can be fatal to plants. The best windbreaks filter the wind and can cut its force down by as much as 50%. They work on a diminishing scale for a distance of up to ten times the height of the windbreak. You can&apos;t beat a good hedge, but good temporary low windbreaks, strategically placed, can be made from sacking or horticultural mesh stretched across stakes. Have a good clean out. Give trays, the cold frame, stakes and flowerpots a good scrub. Wash and sharpen tools and rub on oil (any oil to hand will do) before hanging them up for the winter.", "sentences": ["A few years ago, writes Caroline Foley, when researching for one of my books, I went to see a few of the organic allotments around Amsterdam."], "title": "Remember, remember...", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/allotment/2007/nov/07/rememberremember", "tags": ["Gardens", "Life and style", "Gardening advice"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-07T16:53:18Z", "article": "Paris Insider We&apos;ll start with a slinky little number recommended by our pals on the fashion desk. Chic Shopping Paris is a renowned tour company offering bespoke shopping tours \u2014 &quot;the ins-&amp;-outs that only a good Parisian friend would share with you&quot;. Handily, founder Rebecca Perry Magniant runs the company blog, full of valuable tidbits pruned, one assumes, from the tours themselves. The best bits are the tips for your shopping downtime, like Catherine Deneuve&apos;s recently redecorated caf\u00e9 and salon in the Cinema du Pantheon, and the Christian Lacroix-designed Hotel du Petit Moulin, in the up-and-coming Haute Marais district. Occasionally the little people are thought of too. This post is a keeper, where Rebecca shares her Paris sales strategy. Over at the similarly excellent La Coquette, this post  is a great rundown of her favourite places to shop in Paris, half of which are thrift, vintage, surplus stock or flea market. The New York sartorialist Scott Schuman is one of the online stars of the fashion world, a former director of men&apos;s fashion at Bergdorf Goodman in New York, now a prolific photo blogger at The Sartorialist. The blog itself is a series of snaps taken by Schuman, pretty much chronicling anything he sees and digs \u2014 his eye for a good look has him included in Time Magazine&apos;s Top 100 Design Influences. The SartoriaList section of the blog features the personal tips of a series of New York lookers (more cities coming soon, well, in April 2008 apparently), including the man himself. Elsewhere, the ever-excellent Gridskipper has maps of New York&apos;s best trainer stores, vinyl stores and flea markets. The face of fashion Photo blogs chronicling particular individual&apos;s fancies are prolific on the web, and they all seem to link to each other. Believe me, it&apos;s a rabbit hole. The links on the right hand side of the facehunter blog seem to flag up pretty much all of them \u2014 hundreds of &quot;street style&quot; blogs around the world, from Amsterdam to Zurich. For the most part this is a long, painfully moreish process of oohing and aahing at the really, really ridiculously good looking people of the world but there is certainly tipster gold in the billions of pics \u2014 most will namecheck specific stores and boutiques, if not only in the title, every now and then. This tag on Stil in Berlin, for example, picks out two of its favorite Kreuzberg stores. Cool store hunting The Cool Hunter&apos;s &quot;stores&quot; tag is always worth keeping an eye on, as is much of the site, for its hopelessly modish trendseeking and its fine array of pretty pictures. The stuff is generally high-end, but it&apos;s one of the most enjoyable online window shops you can have. Their descriptions would put even the most daring of wine critics to shame - the JC/DC Store in Paris has &quot;an air of theatre without being theatrical, drama without being dramatic and history without being historical. A retro, semi-aggressive undertone, propped up by whimsy and surprise.&quot; Which is nice. Boutique Beams in Tokyo is a great find \u2014 applying the idea of a sushi conveyor belt to T-shirts. Their profiling of Chicago&apos;s Boring Store shows that even the haughtiest of fashonistas have a sense of humour \u2014 the store deliberately sells nothing of any utility, specialising in comedic spy gadgets. Material world You may have noticed a theme by now - most of the blogosphere&apos;s fashion offerings have a distinct lack of editorial grace. But who needs syntax when you&apos;ve got style, eh? Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller&apos;s The Materialist is a shining exception, in particular the excellently penned adventures of shopping correspondent Nandita Khanna. The recent posts are a little America-centric, but a browse through the archives will find plenty of tales of her various sartorial field trips, filled with recommendations and links. This post on her trip to Jaipur highlights Hot Pink, a boutique owned by French jeweler Marie-Helene de Taillac, and the wares of Namarata Joshipura, &quot;Anna Sui meets Gaultier in Goa&quot;.

In their hoodies and tracksuit tops, they shift about in the cool early evening, killing time.  It is the sort of inner-city scene that might send a shudder through Middle England. But looks can be deceiving. One of the teenagers has just started university, all of them are in full-time education or work, and none is on the street looking for trouble. Instead, they are waiting to meet their youth worker. The teenagers are among the 4,000 young people aged between 11 and 25 who have become involved with the Camden Detached Project (CDP) in the last year. According to Camden council figures, of that number, 700 went on to take part in specific programmes, 150 attended organised workshops - which in some cases led to a job - and another 35 completed a recognised qualification. The project workers are different from other teams within Camden council&apos;s statutory youth services because the 10 full-time and part-time staff seek to meet young people on their own territory - on the streets, on housing estates or public open spaces and areas outside schools.  They are not attached to any youth centre, and are distinct from outreach colleagues, whose aim is to bring young people into established services. Instead, these detached youth workers focus on what project coordinator Sacha Kaufman describes as &quot;naturally forming groups&quot; of young people - like Jahed Miah, 19, who prefers to &quot;hang out&quot; on the street with his friends in Camden rather than meet at a youth club or centre.  The CDP was established 15 years ago and, unusually for detached youth work initiatives, has secured annual council core funding of \u00a3150,000. It receives another \u00a36,000 to meet office costs, and an additional \u00a360,000 from other sources.  The youth workers work with the young people to create projects that interest them. Kaufman says: &quot;It&apos;s about engaging them, finding out where they are at and what they want to do, and helping them achieve that. It could include help with education maintenance allowance, helping find them a job or helping them out of homelessness. Because we aren&apos;t attached to any youth centre, it means that we can be much more flexible in the way that we work, and can work with vulnerable groups of young people across a range of ages.  &quot;It&apos;s not a question of us saying to them: &apos;As the adults we know best.&apos; A lot of what we do is about listening to young people, and for a lot of young people that is a surprising experience.&quot;  Husam Ahmad, 19, says he wasn&apos;t surprised when he and his friends were approached by one of the project team - just excited. &quot;They seemed friendly and they didn&apos;t want anything in return,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody had ever just wanted to talk to us and say, &apos;Let&apos;s do something one day a week.&apos; My family think it&apos;s great.&quot; Ahmad and his friends, who have known each other since childhood, have gone bowling, helped to fund themselves on a three-month skills and safety course for driving a moped or 125cc motorbike, and are now thinking about &quot;going on a residential&quot;, with Amsterdam pencilled in as their favoured destination.  Husam accepts there are risks to being on the streets after dark. It is not uncommon to be stopped and questioned by police - as often as four times an evening. He says: &quot;Drug crime is quite high, especially in this area, and if they [the police] see a group of boys they tend to think we are involved in criminal activity.&quot; Miah explains why he and his friends have shied away from youth centres, choosing instead to meet up on a park bench in the evening: &quot;There are territory issues,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s packed with other people and it&apos;s not your youth club. It&apos;s also thought of as the place where you use the computers and do homework.&quot; Miah&apos;s views may disappoint prime minister Gordon Brown, who has trailed his intention of investing heavily in providing every community in the country with its own youth centre as part of his commitment to develop services for young people. Misguided While Kaufman welcomes the investment in youth services generally, she thinks Brown&apos;s vision of a national network of centres for young people is misguided. It fails to recognise that most youth centres close at 9pm, and that young people like hanging out on the streets. She says: &quot;Young people like to be on the streets. They see it as a pleasure. It&apos;s a nice activity for young people to have a bit of space.&quot; Kaufman suggests that if money is to be spent on youth centres, she would prefer that it went on developing them into places where young people can access all sorts of activities and services, such as attending a keep-fit class, seeking advice about mental health, or finding out about getting a job. &quot;There could be a real variety of services provided by different agencies,&quot; she says. Ask Miah how he thinks the millions should be spent, and he replies: &quot;I&apos;d rather he gave us some money for us, so that we can organise something ourselves.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;Nobody had ever just wanted to talk to us and say, &apos;Let&apos;s do something one day a week.&apos; My family think it&apos;s great.&quot; Ahmad and his friends, who have known each other since childhood, have gone bowling, helped to fund themselves on a three-month skills and safety course for driving a moped or 125cc motorbike, and are now thinking about &quot;going on a residential&quot;, with Amsterdam pencilled in as their favoured destination."], "title": "The word on the streets", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/nov/07/guardiansocietysupplement.youngpeople1", "tags": ["Young people", "Society"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-08T05:00:33Z", "article": "Video of the day: Common has a message for you.

The UK and the US still dominate - the universities of Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford and Yale retain the top four positions for the second year running, with UCL and Chicago joining the top 10 for the first time.

The UK&apos;s most important art charity, the Art Fund, is trying to persuade thousands of Britons to sign an online petition to convince Royal Mail to put the stamps into circulation, as a memorial to those who have died in the war. The stamps have been designed by artist Steve McQueen, who was commissioned by the Imperial War Museum in 2003 to respond to the conflict - tapping into a tradition of war art that goes back to the first world war and beyond, and includes such great artists as John Singer Sargent, Edward Bawden and Paul Nash. The proposal to put the stamps into circulation was put to Royal Mail by the Imperial War Museum in 2005, but appears to have stalled. The Art Fund and the museum hope that if enough public support is shown, the Post Office could be swayed. McQueen was embedded with troops in Basra as a war artist in 2003. &quot;It was a frustrating situation,&quot; he recalled today. &quot;I couldn&apos;t get a good perspective on events. It was very restricting.&quot; However, he was struck by the camaraderie between the soldiers. Later, when he was back home in Amsterdam, he was sticking a stamp (commemorating Van Gogh) on to a letter and the idea of stamps as a memorial came to him. &quot;I realised the idea of the postage stamp was the perfect frame for the images. The artwork would be dispersed around the country, and anyone who bought the stamps or received mail would in effect be participating in the work.&quot; McQueen regards the project as a collaboration with the families of the those who were killed. One hundred and fifty four families agreed to take part; just 19 refused. Each family chose the photographs for the stamps; some are seen in uniform, others are more informally dressed. Mrs Julie Maddison, whose son Christopher, a Marine, died aged 24 in 2003, told the Guardian: &quot;The stamps would be a modern-day version of the poppy. This would be an honour and a recognition for the soldiers; there hasn&apos;t been enough, really.&quot; Mr Roger Bacon, father of Major Matthew Bacon, killed in a roadside bomb in 2005, said: &quot;Getting involved in this was a very easy decision. We&apos;ve been behind it from the start and we felt this was something we must do.&quot; The designs for the stamps now exist as an installation which has been bought for the Imperial War Museum by the Art Fund. However, McQueen regards the work in its present state as incomplete - until real stamps are put into circulation. A spokesman for Royal Mail said today that its stamps &quot;celebrated symbols rather than individuals&quot;, adding: &quot;The sacrifice of servicemen and women plays a key role in our stamps programme.&quot; Privately they are understood to regard the scale of the McQueen project as impracticable; and feel that families may be upset by the sight of loved ones&apos; faces obliterated by postmarks. \u00b7 The petition is at artfund.org/queenandcountry", "sentences": ["Later, when he was back home in Amsterdam, he was sticking a stamp (commemorating Van Gogh) on to a letter and the idea of stamps as a memorial came to him."], "title": "Petition to honour Britain's soldiers on stamps launched", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/nov/08/art2", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Stamps"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-08T17:05:03Z", "article": "Hometown: Amsterdam. The lineup: Robin Van Der Kaa and Jasper Uhl. The background: They may have chosen the appellation as a joke, but these two playful but intense Dutch technocrats who once wrote a track called CrackHouseWarmingParty actually do sound like a dancey, trancey, Morodorised Pink Floyd. With, yes, Dave G on modal extrapolations. If you ever wondered what the Floyd circa Wish You Were Here might have sounded like remixed by everyone&apos;s favourite moustachioed electro pioneer, wonder no more. Trevor Horn had a go at this sort of epic pomp-disco on Frankie Goes To Hollywood&apos;s Welcome To The Pleasuredome album, and here that experiment is taken to its logical conclusion. Van der Kaa and Uhl have already laughed off accusations that they&apos;re purveyors of &quot;prog-disco&quot;, but as genre-names go, it does a decent job of capturing what they do: extended ravey bliss-outs with fiddly guitar improv or just plain Page-tastic bludgeoning riffs on top. Vultures, their debut album, is wall-to-wall psych-rock-house. Most of the tracks clock in at around the eight-minute mark, just long enough for you to inject some marijuana into your left ventricle, lie back and enjoy the afterglow, or whatever it is you young people do for fun these days. Apparently, there are quite a few of these hybridising progtronic types at the moment. You might even want to call it a scene, unless you happen to find that word obscene. In fact, if you cast your minds back to August this year, you might remember a New Band Of The Day called A Mountain Of One who were offering an electronicised, extemporised version of late-&apos;70s Fleetwood Mac. David Gilmour Girls are there or thereabouts. They&apos;re positively Balearic, baby. But they do other stuff on the side. They&apos;ve remixed the Gossip, Chromeo, Zombie Nation and Roxy Music among many others and in dance-underground circles their reputation is somewhere just below Jesus, although they haven&apos;t healed any sick for, like, weeks. They also run one of Amsterdam&apos;s best club nights, Last Night On Earth, which can get a bit Sodom &amp; Gomorrah, especially when the cola cubes and sherbet dib-dabs kick in. The buzz: &quot;Fluid and well-articulated sequences with an experimental appeal due to the unusual confluence of rock and electronica.&quot; The truth: Set the controls for the heart of the dance. Most likely to: Make you do air-keyboard. Least likely to: Make you fly Aer Lingus. Because there are, er, cheaper companies. File next to: Underworld, A Mountain Of One, Pink Floyd, Giorgio Moroder.

The 116-room, (fab) four star establishment will open in the centre of Liverpool in January, just in time for the start of the European City of Culture celebrations. Inspired, of course, by the Beatles and their eponymous 1964 song and film, Hard Days Night is practically next door to the Cavern Club and part of the city&apos;s burgeoning Beatles Quarter. The hotel, which started taking bookings this week, is set in a refurbished grand Victorian building and features a Sgt Pepper-style restaurant, as well as rooms decorated with artwork inspired by the band. Hard Days Night will undoubtedly prove attractive for many visitors to the city, but aficionados will probably prefer a hotel room with some real Beatles history. Room 702 of the Amsterdam Hilton, is the suite where John and Yoko held their Bed-in for Peace in 1969. Today, the room is an expensive executive retreat, although with a facsimile of the original peace slogans painted on the windows, the ghost of less corporate times still lingers. Rock&apos;n&apos;roll was fostered on the road and many hotels are woven into the fabric of its mythology. Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles entered rock&apos;n&apos;roll folklore the moment Led Zeppelin rode their Harley Davidson&apos;s through the lobby to the cheers of their fellow guests (although it was at the nearby Hyatt on Sunset Boulevard where they threw the TVs out the window). Although the hotel still hosts a recording studio, its wilder days are a rapidly fading memory \u2014 Britney Spears was recently banned for smearing food across her face and yelling. Very rock&apos;n&apos;roll. Nowadays, old rock stars rarely live as fast as Led Zep. Instead they normally just mature and end up buying hotels of their own. Jim Kerr, of Simple Minds, now spends his time running a salubrious Sicilian retreat rather than living a life of excess. The Villa Angela is a luxurious 22-room hotel high up in the hills above genteel Taormina with views of Mount Etna. Kerr works in the hotel when he is not on tour. Over in Sweden, on the rapidly gentrifying island of S\u00f6dermalm in southern Stockholm, the Hotel Rival is owned by Benny Anderson of Abba. It&apos;s situated on a smart square, not far from the boutiques and bars of Gotatan, the island&apos;s style-mile.  Meanwhile in Berlin Hotel Ellington has recently reopened. Famous to rock fans as the place where David Bowie lived while writing and recording his trio of dark and experimental albums (Low, Heroes and The Lodger) with Brian Eno in the mid-seventies, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed and Carlos Santana are also former residents. But to another generation of music fans, the Ellington will be forever associated with the sounds of the Duke, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald Count Basie, and Dizzie Gillespie, who all played in the cellar bar.  Rock hotels don&apos;t have to be in the centre of the city, of course. The Memory Motel in Montauk, Long Island, was once owned by Andy Warhol. The Rolling Stones stayed there during their 1975 US tour. Naturally, it is where they wrote the song Memory Motel, which featured on the album Black and Blue, released the following year. But rumour has it that it inspired a second rock classic. The Stones&apos; song refers to a certain Hannah Honey (Hannah honey/ was a peachy kind of girl/Her eyes were hazel/And her nose were slightly curved) who is widely thought to be Carly Simon, who had a brief affair with Jagger at the motel.  One of the most unlikely rock&apos;n&apos;roll locations in the world is the village of West Runton in Norfolk. For years bands used to use the village pub as a warm-up gig for national tours. A blue plaque on the wall commemorates legends such as Chuck Berry, T-Rex, Black Sabbath, Sex Pistols and the Clash. Sadly, you can no longer stay in the Inn, but there is plenty of decent accommodation in the vicinity, if you ever fancy making a pilgrimage to Britain&apos;s unlikeliest rock landmark. Memphis has its Heartbreak Hotel, themed to within an inch of its life with all things Elvis, but if you want a bit more than a roomful or memorabilia, where can you go to rock out? How about a hotel that&apos;s not just themed with the spirit of rock&apos;n&apos;roll, but one that encourages it as a lifestyle choice. Brighton&apos;s Pelirocco is a rock-themed boutique hotel infamous for its crazy, crazy nights. The 19-bedroom hotel features Jamie Reid paintings, a very late bar, kinky sex rooms and pole-dancing suites. There, at least, everybody has the chance to party like a rock star, even if it&apos;s only for the weekend.", "sentences": ["Room 702 of the Amsterdam Hilton, is the suite where John and Yoko held their Bed-in for Peace in 1969."], "title": "Sleeping giants of rock", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/nov/08/hotels.travel", "tags": ["Hotels", "Travel", "Music", "United States holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Amsterdam holidays", "Stockholm holidays"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-09T00:07:01Z", "article": "Morning Graeme. Now you got a fair amount of abuse from fellow players who said - untruthfully - that you were gay. Why is homophobia so prevalent in football? It&apos;s just a concept that is totally alien to most players. Look at what happened to me: I went to Amsterdam with Ken Monkou to do a football training course and all of a sudden everyone was making jokes about &quot;Camping with Ken&quot; and I stupidly reacted a bit more to it than I should have done.  And it didn&apos;t help that you read the Guardian. Which as everyone knows is only perused by dissolute, opium-smoking homosexuals. [Enthusiastically] Yes, I do read it! I started when I was doing my A-levels and it went from there. I didn&apos;t realise the trouble it would get me into later in life, [ruefully] if I&apos;d known then I would have read the Star or something. I think it&apos;s probably only me and Pat Nevin that read it. And you got a leader column praising you recently. Yeah, that was brilliant. Until the next day when the column was &quot;In praise of ... marmalade&quot;. I sat there and thought: is this what it comes to, I&apos;m on the same level as a breakfast condiment. That brought me down a peg or two. But I was genuinely pleased about the whole thing. Best player you ever played with? Gianfranco Zola. In terms of skill and he was just a great role model. He was one of the few players that both home and away fans would cheer at the same time. He brought out a certain chivalry out of football supporters, something you would have seen when my Dad watched the game. And he was great round the training ground too, [sighing with nostalgia] he drove a great big Range Rover and sat perched on a cushion because he couldn&apos;t see over the dashboard without it. Now Graeme, Small Talk is thinking of buying a house, but with all that sub-prime activity in America, it&apos;s having second thoughts. Advice please. [Soothingly] It&apos;s a big decision, Small Talk. The main thing to watch out for is stamp duty, which is a killer. But you can save a bit of money if you get a new build and try and sort out a deal for the developers to throw in the white goods for you. But what about all that Northern Rock business? Small Talk just doesn&apos;t think the economy is stable at the moment. Well, if interest rates get into double figures, you&apos;re in trouble [Small Talk whimpers in fear]. But I don&apos;t think that&apos;ll happen because there are so many people living on credit in this country that the government knows a big rise would crush people. [Reassured] Right, Small Talk&apos;s got it: watch out for stamp duty on my new build&apos;s white goods. And borrow huge amounts of money before interest rates go up. This business stuff is easy. Sell low! Buy high! Shall we talk about music? Small Talk understands you&apos;ve been to a few gigs in your time. Oh yes, Interpol are always brilliant. Yes, Int...But for atmosphere Oasis at Maine Road was electric, like a homecoming gig. I was at the side of the stage because I know [namedropping shamelessly] Alan McGee and just looking out at the crowd took your breath away. But, Oasi... Then there was the Stone Roses at Alexandra Palace back in the day. That might be my all-time favourite, musically. I saw Ian Brown a while back and I think I remembered more of it than he did! The thing about Ia... I haven&apos;t been to Glastonbury. I&apos;d love to go. Don&apos;t bother, Graeme, it&apos;s full of Guardian types these days with their BlackBerrys&apos; and social consciences and what not. What album does it for you? Ooh, anything by Radiohead. [Has a little think] The Bends probably, although Kid A is pretty good, Hail to the Thief was too experimental though. Well, it&apos;s a lot better than saying Snow Patrol, which is what 98.64% of sportsmen/sportswomen say... [Sadly] Yeah, their first album was good but then like a lot of bands that taste success they got more poppy and staid. True that, Graeme. Small Talk is beginning to realise you&apos;re an intelligent man. You&apos;ve even got a degree, haven&apos;t you? Not quite, I started one in environmental studies - I was ahead of my time with that - but once I got into the first team I didn&apos;t have time to carry on. Turn your pockets out now, Graeme. What&apos;s been unearthed? [Various jingling noises ensue] A car key ... some loose change and ... a used tissue. [Small Talk&apos;s innuendo-ometer goes through the roof] I&apos;ve got a cold before you suggest anything else [laughs]. Forget Hatton and Mayweather, who would win in the fight people really want to see: lion v tiger? It would be a close one. Which environment would it be fought in? Erm ... a boxing ring? Well in that case it would be a draw, but if it was in Asia it would be the tiger - [excited] it could use its stripes in the jungle undergrowth - whereas in Africa the lion would win because it&apos;s all sandy and it would blend in with the savannah. Stripes are so out in Africa, except for zebras and they&apos;re always getting killed anyway. Here&apos;s another couple of sexy beasts: Scarlett Johansson and Paris Hilton. Which one? Scarlett, she&apos;s better in every department really, isn&apos;t she? And she doesn&apos;t walk around with a tag on her either. And finally what&apos;s going in Room 101 The whole of BAA. Not the ground staff, but the management - the people who make the decisions. It just gives a bad impression of Britain. Welcome to Britain! [laughs with disbelief] I had to wait four hours for my bags at Heathrow the other day and the flight was only six-and-a-half hours. Well, I say it took four hours, but I had to go and see my daughter in a concert so I had to leave my mate to pick my bags up for me, the poor bloke. A top answer, Graeme. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks Small Talk, it&apos;s been a pleasure.

The competitive nature of the US TV market means that one in three new shows ends up cancelled. Some struggle through half a season, others like the much-mocked Viva Laughlin make it through only two episodes before the axe falls. With network bosses demanding one thing and programme makers and writers frequently striving for another, the supposedly simple act of creating a strong television show has become an absurdly complicated affair - and that&apos;s before you begin to factor in the demands of an increasingly sophisticated global audience. Now the writers&apos; strike has added a new element to the already highly pressurised process. Talk shows are currently running repeats, many sitcoms have already been pulled off the air and if the dispute continues then pre-filmed episodes of dramas will dry up in about six weeks. And while established hits such as Grey&apos;s Anatomy, Heroes and Desperate Housewives need only to wrap up existing plotlines as best they can and then sit out the blackout, newer programmes face a more testing time. With most network&apos;s contingency plans centring on midseason replacements and reality TV shows, much will depend on how those replacements perform. Fox held back time travel cop drama New Amsterdam, as well as Terminator spin-off The Sarah Connor Chronicles, both of which are scheduled to air in January. If they perform better than new cop series K-Ville then the New Orleans-set police drama will probably be axed. Even without eager replacements hovering in the wings things are likely to be tough. For no matter how well a new sitcom or drama has done it is still too early in the season for any lasting loyalty to have been established. This year in particular there have been a number of strongish shows but no single breakout hit. Sure, people might tune in to Michelle Ryan&apos;s bionic travails at the moment but by the time February rolls around will anyone remember who Jamie Sommers is, let alone care? Then there are the financial concerns. The last time that the writers went on strike in 1988 it lasted for five and a half months and is estimated to have cost the industry around $500m. This time around the cost could be double that and it&apos;s not only the US television industry which is set to lose out. ITV, which bought big from America for the second year running - snapping up Bionic Woman, the quirky Pushing Daisies and the campy family saga Cane - now faces the prospect of half-completed seasons of what they hoped would be next year&apos;s biggest dramas. And while Cane looks like the show most vulnerable to cancellation - a full season pick-up has yet to be confirmed - ITV are not alone in fearing the worst. Channel 4, which took a financial hit last year when big buy-ins such as Studio 60 were cancelled, desperately needs Dynasty-meets-Six Feet Under drama Dirty Sexy Money to be a success. Yet DSM is vulnerable to a period of time off the air. The odd missed episode of Dirty Sexy Money, although annoying, doesn&apos;t prevent you from following the action. However, too long an absence and a fickle heart could easily move on to something new. This is where some shows may actually benefit. While sitcoms such as Kelsey Grammar&apos;s Back to You and geekcom Big Bang Theory - both again Channel 4 buy-ins - have already been pulled from the air until the strike is resolved, dramas such as time travel show Journeyman - which made its UK debut on Sky One last night - have been granted a longer lease of life thanks to the dispute. In the past Journeyman and other slow-burners such as Damian Lewis&apos;s cop drama Life would have been lucky to have made it to a third episode, this year the threat of strike action has made network bosses understandably wary about pulling the plug. Whether such shows, which have a committed but small audience, survive a prolonged hiatus is anyone&apos;s guess. But at the moment they&apos;ll have at least 13 episodes, something that fans of last year&apos;s prematurely cancelled series such as Smith and Thief would have cried for.", "sentences": ["Fox held back time travel cop drama New Amsterdam, as well as Terminator spin-off The Sarah Connor Chronicles, both of which are scheduled to air in January."], "title": "Why the US TV writers' strike could make or break new shows", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2007/nov/09/thankstotheongoingwriters", "tags": ["Television industry", "Media", "US television industry"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-10T00:00:35Z", "article": "An old sugar basin lies on my mantelpiece a few feet from where I write. Its white metal needs a polish, but give it a rub and you can make out a small crest surrounded by the words Pullman Car Company Limited. I remember the day I got it, travelling back to London Victoria from Dover in the Pullman coaches of the Golden Arrow, en route from France. This was in the train&apos;s last days - quite possibly the French had already stopped calling its cross-Channel counterpart the Fleche d&apos;Or and mounting a diagonal arrow on the locomotive&apos;s front for the journey from Calais to the Gare du Nord, as pictured in my Boys&apos; Book of Trains.  I thought it would be nice to have a souvenir. &quot;Would you mind very much if I took this sugar basin as a memento?&quot; I asked the steward, who was clearing up the crumbs left by an afternoon tea of Dundee cake and tomato sandwiches.  &quot;Well, I suppose not,&quot; the steward said. &quot;We finish at the end of the week.&quot; He was an old steward and had been serving on the Golden Arrow since before the second world war. I suggested he must have interesting memories. He had. The Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII and later still the Duke of Windsor, used to take the Golden Arrow and he, the steward, used to serve him.  And? &quot;And I used to help him put on a fresh shirt in the lavatory, which he always did before we got to Victoria.&quot; I think the conversation occurred somewhere about Penge East: I somehow connect the station nameboard with the prince&apos;s shirt. It happened 35 years ago, which means that the steward&apos;s words occupy the same distance in my memory as the feel of the freshly laundered cotton (or would it be silk?) did in the steward&apos;s. Not long ago to him, part of a lifetime; an age ago to me, outside his lifetime.  A lot of things were ending in the 1970s and quite often I found myself writing about them: the Brighton Belle with Sir Laurence Olivier&apos;s kippers, the Night Ferry, the remnants of the real Orient Express. I took the last all the way to Istanbul with a colleague, the fashion editor (now memoirist) Brigid Keenan, and her husband. She was pregnant at the time and in her memoir recalls being sick all over my feet. But I remember nothing about that at all. What I remember is tea again on the train to Dover, a brief intervention of grey sea, and then coq au vin in a homely little dining car on the way to Paris, the dark fields of the Pas de Calais rushing past the window while, inside, glasses of red wine glowed against a white tablecloth. This was the last hot food we would have until we got to the Bosphorus. Our coaches were shunted round a little loop from the Gare du Nord to the Gare de Lyon, where we moved to the blue Wagon Lit that was our home for the next three nights and days. Whatever the Orient Express may have been like in 1907 or is like in 2007, it was not like in 1975. Sustenance was lukewarm coffee and brittle little biscuits. At Belgrade and Sofia nobody would take our sterling in exchange for the stale-looking buns on the platform stalls. At Dimitrovgrad, a Bulgarian junction a stop or two from the Turkish border, I heard whistles and pushed my face against the window to see shafts of red light from the fireboxes of steam engines.  There were better trains. Europe then had TEEs, Trans European Expresses, which had 1950s streamlining and pushed importantly across national borders: you could take the night boat from Harwich to the Hook, walk down the pier and board the Rheingold express, which had a bar, a dining saloon and glass-domed carriages providing views of the Rhine Gorge, Swiss Alps and the Italian lakes. But trans-European train travel, at least for the British, was mainly a business of remembering or imagining how things had once been: a nostalgia for the belle \u00e9poque and &quot;the grand days of railway travel&quot; that later produced the luxurious revival of the Orient Express, which went no further east than Venice but allowed its passengers to think of themselves as exiled grand dukes or Charters and Caldicott in Hitchcock&apos;s The Lady Vanishes, stuck in the Balkans and anxious for news of the cricket.  Two places in London caught the flavour of this previous Europe. The facade of the old Blackfriars station (demolished in the 1970s) had the names of distant cities etched in stone - Cannes, Brindisi, Baden-Baden - which the station&apos;s builders, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, advertised as destinations that could be reached using its boat trains and channel packets. (It was in the booking hall of this station, usually besieged by commuters to Pett&apos;s Wood, that Sir John Betjeman once mischievously asked for a return to St Petersburg, one of the cities mentioned on the facade outside. It now sits, totally out of context, on a wall inside the bland new station building.)  Meanwhile, a mile or two to the west, you could see, if you knew where to look, a duo of Wagon Lits taking their daily rest at the carriage sidings outside Victoria. These were the coaches of the Night Ferry, which went back and forth to Paris by crossing the Channel, Dover to Dunkirk, on ships equipped with railway lines. Until it ended in 1980, this was the only European train to reach Britain before the opening of the Channel tunnel. In hindsight, it seems an absurd operation: all that effort by locomotives and ships, the shunting at each port, the grinding down the ramp and on to the deck, the rolling in bad weather - all for the sake of at most 50 passengers, restless in their berths. But people liked the idea. After a piece I wrote about the journey was published, I got a letter from the late Labour politician and thinker, the Europhile Anthony Crosland, saying how wonderful it would be if we could walk into a London station and step into a train for Amsterdam, Bonne or Milan.      Gothic revival ... the Meeting Place at the new St Pancras International. Leon Neal/AFP    I thought about Crosland&apos;s dream when I was shown around the new St Pancras terminus, which was opened by the Queen this week as St Pancras International. The building, listed Grade 1, has been as wonderfully renewed and refurbished as all reports suggest - reglazed, reslated, repolished, the 1860s ironwork of the train shed by William Henry Barlow picked out in a delicate blue, the undercroft beneath the platforms, built for the storage of Burton beer, smartly converted into check-ins and shops. True, the PR seems a little too anxious to stress phrases such as &quot;customer experience&quot; and &quot;high-end retail outlets&quot; and everybody already knows about &quot;the longest champagne bar in Europe&quot; (92 metres, but which is the second longest, is there a contest in these things?), and my own suspicion is that the 30ft high bronze of couple embracing called The Meeting Place may soon become regarded as the biggest piece of kitsch since Robert Doisneau&apos;s picture of a couple kissing in a Paris street - posed for Life magazine, though nobody knew that when it became a poster image of romantic spontaneity and swept the world. But this is to cavil. Forty years ago, the gothic revival buildings of St Pancras nearly met the same fate as the classical doric arch of Euston just up the road. Thanks to the efforts of people such as Betjeman, who also, and rightly, has a new statue at St Pancras, it was saved and now has a brilliant new role as the gateway to what was once called Abroad. When the new timetable starts on December 9, trains will reach Paris in two hours 15 minutes and Brussels in under two hours. But, bearing Crosland in mind, what about the places beyond? With the help of Today&apos;s Railways magazine, Cook&apos;s European (previously Continental) Timetable and Rail Europe (a travel agent I can recommend), here are some thoughts. The longest journey that can be accomplished in a single day by the new service is London to Madrid. It means catching the 05.27 at St Pancras, reaching the Gare du Nord at 8.50, crossing Paris by Metro, and then taking the 10.10 from the Gare Montparnasse to Ir\u00fan, changing there and reaching Madrid Atocha at 22.34. That is a long day. Other journeys are easier. Milan is 10 hours and 45 minutes away (11.05 to 22.50, changing in Paris), Frankfurt takes five hours 56 minutes, changing in Brussels; Zurich seven hours 28 minutes, changing Paris; Marseilles six hours 47 minutes, changing Lille; Amsterdam five hours, changing Brussels. Some of these times will shorten when new high-speed lines open next year in Belgium and Holland. Another new line, from Perpignan into the Costa Brava, should mean that with an early start Barcelona is reachable in time for supper.  The odd thing is that all this connectedness, this enmeshing with Europe, should start from a station that points north, towards where the foundations of British wealth used to be. St Pancras is really a part of the English Midlands stranded on the Euston Road, built of Leicester slate and Nottingham brick and iron from a Derbyshire ironworks. Coal trains made most of the Midland Railway&apos;s profits - the Thameslink line that runs under the terminus south to Blackfriars was built to carry northern coal to the hearths of southern suburbs and not office workers from Luton. And now, even by the fastest direct train, Sheffield will take longer to reach than Paris and it will be quicker to get to Marseilles than to Aberdeen. Just outside St Pancras, an uncompleted spur from the high-speed line (known as HS1) points hopefully towards the north. Eventually, it might lead to HS2 and faster trains to Manchester, Leeds and Scotland. In the meantime, which could be very long, the metropolis reaches other metropolises more quickly than its hinterland. Rome, stubbornly, still needs a sleeper and nearly 19 hours. Rome, among other things, is the place where St Pancras was beheaded as a 14-year-old Christian martyr by the Emperor Diocletian. It would be fitting to take the train and see his original church, the basilica of San Pancrazio. In terms of what his name will come to mean to millions of people leaving and entering Britain, he will be worth the pilgrimage. You catch the Rome sleeper in Paris at the Gare Bercy, just beside the Gare de Lyon and its famous Le Train Bleu restaurant, whose painted ceilings celebrate the blue seas and skies of the destinations reached by the old Paris, Lyons and Mediterranean Railway. Sadly, like the Golden Arrow, the Blue Train itself has vanished from the timetables; the fast journeys of daytime TGVs have made many French sleeping cars redundant, and it is harder (though not quite impossible) to fall asleep in northern France and wake up to see the dawn mist rising from groves of olives and lemons. Today you can leave London late in the morning and see the same olives and lemons in the pink of the evening light. The price has been worth paying. Expert tip: Handy hotels for St Pancras, by Sally Shalam Amid the flashlights and fanfare at the unveiling of St Pancras on Wednesday, one vital component was absent. The railway hotel. While the station has been renovated and reopened, ready for the first Eurostar departure next week, travellers will have to wait until 2009 for the addition of somewhere to stay.  A five-star Marriott is to open in St Pancras Chambers, former railway offices which were originally built in 1873 by George Gilbert Scott to house the Midland Grand Hotel (which closed in the 1930s). With all its gothic turrets and towers and arched windows, I cannot think of a more magical and fitting place to begin a journey to Disneyland Paris. Meanwhile though, what are the options for those of us who want to start our weekend trip to the Continent from the comfort of a hotel?  Closest of all (but far enough away to be in a more salubrious part of town) is the Conran-designed myHotel Bloomsbury (myhotels.com, rooms from around \u00a3163 B&amp;B) which caused a bit of a stir when it opened back in 1999. Well placed for Covent Garden and the British Museum, those who travel light could walk the scenic route to St Pancras from here.      The Rookery (+44 (0)20-7336 0931, hazlittshotel.com, autumn special rate, doubles from around \u00a3200 room only, pictured) is just one tube stop from King&apos;s Cross St Pancras station. For reasons which I won&apos;t bore you with now, I once lived at this hotel for two months and have tried practically every room, including the fantastic Rook&apos;s Nest suite right at the top. It&apos;s a busy little place in the week but like many City hotels, emptier (and sometimes cheaper) at weekends. It&apos;s a stone&apos;s throw from Farringdon tube and from Fabric nightclub (so beware rooms at the front on Friday nights), and a host of fantastic places to eat, such as St John and Club Gascon. Also in this neck of the woods: Malmaison (malmaison.com, 020-7012 3700, doubles from \u00a3225 room only), which has an elegant location on Charterhouse Square close to the Barbican and a good basement bar and restaurant; and The Zetter (+44 (0)20-7324 4444, thezetter.com, from \u00a3182 room only), which won Best Small Hotel in the 2006 Visit London awards.  The newest - and cheapest - arrival, The Hoxton (hoxtonhotels.com; weekend from \u00a359 B&amp;B, midweek from \u00a319), flagged itself as the first &quot;luxury budget&quot; hotel in the Square Mile when it launched last year. A little further from St Pancras than the others, it is still a no-change tube ride from Liverpool Street or Old Street stations. You don&apos;t even have to spend the night, but can rent a room by the day if you just want to avail yourself of a desk, free wi-fi and a nice bathroom.", "sentences": ["After a piece I wrote about the journey was published, I got a letter from the late Labour politician and thinker, the Europhile Anthony Crosland, saying how wonderful it would be if we could walk into a London station and step into a train for Amsterdam, Bonne or Milan.", "Milan is 10 hours and 45 minutes away (11.05 to 22.50, changing in Paris), Frankfurt takes five hours 56 minutes, changing in Brussels; Zurich seven hours 28 minutes, changing Paris; Marseilles six hours 47 minutes, changing Lille; Amsterdam five hours, changing Brussels."], "title": "Eurostar tips: Europe just got closer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/nov/10/railtravel.transportintheuk", "tags": ["Rail travel", "Travel", "Transport", "Europe holidays", "London holidays", "Hotels", "Short breaks", "Eurostar"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-10T00:00:44Z", "article": "Expert tip: Winter events, Steve Korver, editor, Time Out Amsterdam  It&apos;s often said that filmic Amsterdam is as beautiful in colour as it is in black-and-white - and that the city was designed especially that way to compensate for its often rainy reality. But its rainy reality probably explains all the film festivals and art shows held here at this time of year, when everyone craves a warm comfy place. The world&apos;s largest documentary film festival IDFA (Nov 22-Dec 2, idfa.nl), attracts many foreign viewers as does its Shadow Festival (Nov 20-28, shadowfestival.nl). This winter will also see more focused film festivals: on surrealism (Nov 29-Dec 1, filmhuiscavia.nl), and on being gay (Dec 19-23, rozefilmdagen.nl). Most films are in English or subtitled. The highly acclaimed Andy Warhol exhibition, Other Voices, Other Rooms, runs until January 13 at the Stedelijk Museum of Modern Art (stedelijk.nl) temporarily housed in a former post office reframed as a cultural breeding ground filled with creative companies, galleries and club/restaurant 11 (ilove11.nl). You can even take your own Factory-like screen test. Around the canals are a number of photography museums. Foam (foam.nl) has a quality double bill with Celebrating Life by Ryan McGinley (until 6 January) which documents a freewheeling, and mostly nude, road trip across America, and a Weegee retrospective (14 Dec-Mar 5) of his iconic crime scenes (many of which he signed &quot;Weegee the famous&quot;).  Huis Marseille (huismarseille.nl) has a major survey of French photographer Valerie Belin (until Nov 25) who specialises in monumental portraits of body builders, Moroccan brides and Michael Jackson impersonators. This collection resonates nicely with Raimond Wouda&apos;s study of Dutch fame, Fans (December 8-February 24) which embraces Dutch pop icons, Dutch soap icons and, um, goths. For more intimate shows, head to Kunststad, where hundreds of artists now have their studios in the epically industrial surrounds of the former shipping yards of NDSM (ndsm.nl). And the Chiellerie Gallery (chiellerie.nl), where there&apos;s a new opening every Friday.  A new breed of clubs run intimate and quirky nights.

While he remains founder patron of the organisation (now known as Fair Trials International), he is not its spokesman.    The condoms are smeared in margarine or local vegetable oil, &apos;to help them slip down&apos;, says Kawko, holding out the white grains of pure cocaine in his scarred palm. Behind him, on the palm-tree fringed beach of Prampram village, dozens of colourfully painted longboats make land; the bulky wooden vessels heaved and roped out of the roaring West Atlantic by slender teenage boys. &apos;There are many other couriers here in Ghana; some have made a dozen journeys to London and Amsterdam. You can see the benefit it has brought to their families, even here in our village. Their mothers have stopped working; some have motorbikes and have bought fishing boats. Some have also died. A schoolfriend of mine swallowed over 50 condoms and died within an hour. He dipped the condoms in honey and they ruptured. He was foolish; the condoms were local, not imported.&apos; Kawko gestures to where his youngest son is playing in the sea with a yellow plastic oil drum. &apos;I wouldn&apos;t want this life for him.&apos; Over the past few years a concerted shift in trafficking routes has transformed West African countries like Ghana, Senegal and Guinea Bissau into volatile hubs for cocaine smuggled from South America to a booming European market. Using sophisticated transportation networks and the latest communication technology to elude woefully inept coastguards, Colombian traffickers are establishing transit areas along the Gulf of Guinea that can only worsen lawlessness in countries already overwhelmed by crime, poverty and instability. For locals the route opens up a risky but tempting way out of poverty. A single flight to Amsterdam from Ghana, via Morocco, earlier this year carried 32 West Africans, all of whom had swallowed cocaine packets or concealed them in their luggage. Impatient with the increasing arrest rates of mules, the South American cartels have recruited London-based Nigerians and Ghanaians to scour Britain&apos;s capital for gullible teenage drug couriers. Last week two teenagers were seized at Accra airport, en route for London Gatwick. The 16- and 19-year-olds, both Lithuanian boys living in south London, were arrested under the British-led Operation Westbridge, a joint project by HM Revenue &amp; Customs iand the Ghanaian authorities to catch drug smugglers using Accra as a gateway to the UK. The pair were allegedly caught with nearly four kilos of cocaine ingested in around 16 condoms. It came after July&apos;s seizure of 16-year-old London schoolgirls Yasemin Vatansever and Yutunde Diya, who were stopped leaving the country allegedly carrying \u00a3300,000 of cocaine hidden in laptop bags. A narcotics officer who interrogated the girls claimed the teenagers knew exactly what they were coming to do in Ghana. They were, he claimed, &apos;classic mules&apos; recruited in London to come to Ghana and pick up the bags for a fee of \u00a33,000. Up to 60 mules a week are estimated to arrive in Britain from the region. The rain falls heavily on the bumpy road to Kumasi, churning it to red slushy mud. Here, 50km from the Ghanaian capital, Accra, is Nswana Prison. For its two recent occupants, Vatansever and Diya, the international fight against South American drug cartels is of little concern. The girls, who had told their parents they were going on a school trip to France before flying to Ghana, fit the classic drug mule profile - young, poor and gullible. They have spent most of their time in isolation. In the past fortnight Vatansever is believed to have contracted malaria. Conditions inside the high-walled compound are grim. Each day the inmates are employed in hard labour, building an irrigation plant. The cramped cells often fit as many as a dozen prisoners, who share toilet facilities. Disease and violence are rampant. For the past few days, officials have been temporarily holding the teenagers at Ghana&apos;s Narcotics Control Board, on the top floor of the innocuous office block. After reaching the floor where the girls were held, The Observer was turned back by a machine-gun toting guard. The girls, he said, were well. We heard them shouting from their makeshift cells. The trial of the British schoolgirls will resume in Ghana this week and both are expected to be sentenced to up to five years in prison. They are being tried under Ghana&apos;s Juvenile Justice Act, meaning that their trial must be completed within six months and they can only be held on remand for three months. The girls &apos;vigorously deny&apos; the charges, according to Fair Trials Abroad, which helped to find lawyers for the pair and has been liaising with the families and the Foreign Office. Fair Trials Abroad lawyer Stephen Jakobi, says the case bears striking similarities to that of two Birmingham teenagers who were jailed in Thailand after being found with \u00a34m worth of heroin. Karyn Smith, 18, and 17-year-old Patricia Cahill spent three years in the infamous &apos;Bangkok Hilton&apos; prison before being pardoned in 1993. They claimed they were forced to confess by Thai police, who planted drugs on them to claim reward money. Jakobi said: &apos;You&apos;ve got two very young girls going through an airport where they were bound to get caught. There are lots of parallels, and it seems to me extremely probable that these girls were being used as decoys. As there were British officers involved in their arrest it would have made sense to allow them through to Britain and arrest them there, not leave them in Ghana.&apos; Almost all of the Ghana-based mules used by drugs gangs are poor and willing to risk not only their liberty but their lives for less than \u00a3500. The mules are all paid an initial fee, sometimes as low as \u00a350, with the rest payable upon a successful handover. If they are arrested, they will not get paid and the debts they left behind will be passed on to family members. According to Tony Walker, Revenue &amp; Customs head of operations, the region is of increasing concern to the British authorities. &apos;The air courier route from West Africa, either directly to the UK or in transit through other EU airports, is a specific threat,&apos; he said. &apos;The use of such young people in smuggling drugs demonstrates the ruthless nature of those criminal gangs involved in the illegal narcotics trade and the misery they cause.&apos; As well as providing a number of British undercover operatives on the ground Operation Westbridge has supplied technical and operational expertise to the Ghanaians. Since November 2006, Westbridge has made 122 interceptions, seizing 356kg of cocaine, 2,275kg of cannabis and 1.3kg of heroin. It follows the success of Operation Airbridge, a joint UK-Jamaican initiative to catch drugs couriers with internal concealments before they board planes from Jamaica. But there are fears that without the full-time aid of a British task force, local authorities will be unable to cope: &apos;The British have only left a small team behind,&apos; one Ghanaian Customs Office said: &apos;We have some equipment on loan but our surveillance experience is minimal. We don&apos;t have sniffer dogs, we don&apos;t have enough scanners; it is all about profiling and gathering intelligence and we need the British to attain that, not just temporary assistance.&apos;.&apos; Harvested in the foothills of the Andes in Colombia, Peru or Ecuador by cartels, the leaves of the coca plant are processed in laboratories using kerosene, methyl alcohol and sulphuric acid. The resulting powder is dried, cut into blocks and transferred to ports in Colombia and Venezuela, routinely these days, for shipment to West Africa. The cocaine is then cut into smaller amounts and sent on to Europe. The US is the world&apos;s top market for cocaine, but use there is declining. In Europe, demand is rising. A kilo of cocaine brings about \u00a325,000 in Europe, compared with about half that in the US. London has become the centre of Europe&apos;s market. Not surprisingly the smuggling routes are as complex as they are diverse. In April this year eight European nations, led by Britain, launched a military-law enforcement task force targeting cocaine traffic from Africa. The Maritime Analysis Operations Centre, based in Lisbon, teams police, navy and customs resources from across Europe, a model similar to Florida&apos;s Drug Enforcement Agency. Because of historic ties to Latin America, the Iberian Peninsula remains a key gateway, with around 30 per cent of Britain&apos;s cocaine coming in through Spanish corridors. The drugs are stockpiled in West Africa and then moved to clandestine landing zones on the coasts of Spain and Portugal, or commercial ports such as Barcelona and Antwerp before reaching London in fishing vessels and commercial ship containers. In September, the US DEA tipped off the Spanish coastguard to a ship from Venezuela hauling 15 tonnes of cocaine. The ship off-loaded four tonnes to a smaller vessel in the Atlantic. Spanish authorities intercepted the smaller load near Ibiza, where the cocaine had been transferred to fast boats operated by Bulgarians and Croatians. The Spaniards then caught up with the mother ship heading for Ghana. Of particular concern to the DEA are Ghana and Guinea-Bissau. In Ghana, top officials were accused last year of protecting a Venezuelan drug lord. Ghanaian police recorded the continent&apos;s biggest cocaine bust last year, arresting Ghanaian and Nigerian suspects in a Mercedes van containing two tons of the drug concealed in boxes of fish. Fronted by Colombian cartels, local gangsters in the region have even set up elaborate front companies which allegedly buy high-level protection for the business interests of their new South American partners. Most aren&apos;t difficult to spot. In Accra, Ghana&apos;s capital, BMWs, Mercedes and newly imported canary yellow Humvees stand out from the beaten and battered local taxis. As an example of how high up the lure of drugs money reaches you only need look at the recent case of the Ghanaian MP Eric Amoateng. While serving in parliament, Amoateng sent 70kg of heroin, hidden in boxes of pottery, to the US and was arrested in January 2006 when he arrived at New York&apos;s JFK airport to collect it. Narcotics seizures in West Africa jumped eightfold in 2006, according to the latest Europol statistics. But it said in a report last year that &apos;only a very small proportion of the cocaine passing through the continent is actually being seized&apos;. Experts worry that traffickers could eventually smuggle in precursor chemicals and set up labs, enabling them to ship coca base across the Atlantic instead of the more expensive finished product. At a recent major seminar on narcotics, attended by some of the world&apos;s leading law enforcement experts, the connection between West Africa and the scourge of drugs in Europe was spelled out. One of the speakers, Karen Tandy, head of the DEA, said: &apos;Latin American gangs are setting up shop in Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau in the West and Kenya in the East. Africa has emerged as a real hotspot in just the past couple of years. Africa will become, in terms of a drugs hot-bed, one of our worst nightmares if we do not get ahead of that curve now.&apos;", "sentences": ["&apos;There are many other couriers here in Ghana; some have made a dozen journeys to London and Amsterdam.", "A single flight to Amsterdam from Ghana, via Morocco, earlier this year carried 32 West Africans, all of whom had swallowed cocaine packets or concealed them in their luggage."], "title": "Ghana to UK: the new trail of misery", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/11/drugsandalcohol.internationalcrime", "tags": ["World news", "Society", "Drugs trade", "Drugs", "Ghana", "Organised crime", "Law", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-12T15:24:34Z", "article": "There are plenty of picturesque canal houses to choose from but finding somewhere special to stay in Amsterdam takes planning. Here is a taste of what the city has to offer. 1. Hostel: Stay OK Vondelpark  There was a time when hostelling in Amsterdam was synonymous with the cannabis counterculture - but the forthcoming smoking ban in July 2008 looks like putting paid to that. Instead, those on a budget might like to try this eclectic hostel housed in a former girls&apos; school. Most of the 110 rooms \u2014 from pristine doubles to a 20-bed mixed megadorm with vaulted ceiling \u2014 have ensuite facilities, and the Stay OK caters to all age groups (not just students). What&apos;s more, it&apos;s a stone&apos;s throw from Amsterdam&apos;s nightlife central, Leidseplein, so there&apos;s no need to abstain from the party scene. \u00b7 \u20ac22 to \u20ac45 (\u00a315.50 to \u00a332) per person, including breakfast. stayokay.com 2. Pension: Hotel Brouwer From the worn wooden tables, fading furniture and the original white-and-blue Delftware tiling along the staircase, you can tell this canal-side pension has been in the family for a century. As Dutch as it gets, the interior is infused with the respectable working-class ethos that built Amsterdam during the Golden Age. Canal-house hotels like this one (the building dates from 1642) tend to have very steep stairs, so it&apos;s worth knowing that the Brouwer has a small lift. There are only eight rooms though, so like everywhere else in Amsterdam, book well in advance. \u00b7 \u20ac55 (\u00a339) for a single, \u20ac90 (\u00a363) for a double. hotelbrouwer.nl   3. Family: Hotel Groenhof  There&apos;s a premium on space in Amsterdam and larger family rooms can be hard to find. The no-nonsense but entirely agreeable Groenhof, however, has some three-, four- and even five-bed rooms and is situated right next to the enormous Vondelpark - perfect if the little ones need to let off steam after being dragged around the nearby museum quarter. A limited modernisation was underway in late 2007, but it&apos;s business as usual and will be fully open from 2008. \u00b7 From \u20ac120 (\u00a384) for a double to \u20ac210 (\u00a3148) for a four-person room. hotelgroenhof.nl 4. Quirky: Hotel de Filosoof The brainchild of two sisters \u2013 one an hotelier and the other an intellectual and philosopher \u2013 the 38 philosophy-themed rooms at the Filosoof each have a life of their own. Designed with homely affection rather than serious artistic intentions, not every room is to everyone&apos;s taste. But if you&apos;re lucky (and book months ahead) you&apos;ll get a choice \u2013 from the monotone starkness of the Existentialist space to the cheesy cherubs of the Romantics&apos; chamber. Even the Nietzsche room is kind of cosy; and there are now additional new suites in the second site across the road. \u00b7 \u20ac100 (\u00a370) to \u20ac120 (\u00a384) for doubles, suites from \u20ac170 (\u00a3120). hoteldefilosoof.nl/ 5. Best for views: Seven Bridges Hotel Finding a room with a view in Amsterdam&apos;s fabled canal belt is like seeking a sunny beach in Barbados \u2013 it&apos;s par for the course. Nevertheless, this 18th-century merchant&apos;s house has a plum location along the city&apos;s most photographed waterway, the Reguliersgracht, with its line of seven charming little bridges. What&apos;s more, the hotel interiors are akin to stepping into the Antiques Roadshow; the owner is an avid collector and the eight double rooms and three studios are furnished with his treasured possessions, all for guests to use and enjoy. \u00b7 \u20ac150 (\u00a3105) to \u20ac260 (\u00a3183) for a double, no lift. sevenbridgeshotel.nl 6. Classic: College Hotel If you don&apos;t balk at the thought of being attended to by students \u2013 this is not just a college in name but a training establishment, too \u2013 come here for the most conscientious service you could hope to find. Guests are encouraged to comment on the wannabe hospitality staff who clamour to work here, and the College  prides itself on nailing every little detail \u2013 it once won an award for the best toilets in Europe. Combining a classical elegance with a younger feel and overall design, note also that the very clubbable bar and restaurant are some of the places to be seen in Amsterdam. \u00b7 \u20ac250 (\u00a3176) per double, \u20ac870 (\u00a3612) for a suite. collegehotelamsterdam.com 7. Hip: Lloyd Hotel and Cultural Embassy Forgive the pretentious &quot;cultural embassy&quot; moniker \u2013 this place is the default base for performance artists visiting Amsterdam, and part of the deal is that they lay on shows at the Lloyd for guests and the public alike. Contradicting the building&apos;s former function as a detention centre, each room \u2013 covering the full range of one to five stars \u2013 has been decked out by an individual designer. Among others, you could end up in the Swedish cabin with a swing and bathtub slap-bang in the middle of the floor, or even the hippy love-in suite with a grand piano and eight-person-bed\u2026 \u00b7 \u20ac80 to \u20ac350 (\u00a356 to \u00a3246). lloydhotel.com  8. Romantic: Lute Suites  At the pretty village of Ouderkerk, 15 minutes&apos; drive from the city centre or airport, the Lute Suites are for travellers looking for something a little out of the ordinary and out of the way. All are listed buildings (it&apos;s based around a former gunpowder factory) but each split-level suite has its own front door for the sake of privacy, not to mention kitchenettes, bespoke furnishings and various art installations. And despite the open, airy and light-filled texture downstairs, the loft bedrooms squeezed under the original beams of these former munitions workers&apos; houses are surprisingly snug and intimate. \u00b7 \u20ac300 to \u20ac395 (\u00a3211 to \u00a3278) per suite, \u20ac285 (\u00a3200) at weekends. lutesuites.com 9. Luxe: Hotel Seven One Seven &quot;Like staying at the home of a rich uncle,&quot; remarked one guest, and it&apos;s not hard to see why. More genteel country residence than city centre guesthouse, the discreetly attentive staff of this exclusive hotel seem more like a butler and housekeeper than just hotel employees; the eight luxuriantly-equipped rooms are like donnish sets rather than functional accommodation; and the classic ambience carries on into the living room and library, which are lined with exotic artefacts. Previously a sugar refinery, the hotel enjoys a prime location in the scenic centre.  \u00b7 \u20ac425-680 (\u00a3299 to \u00a3479) for a double. 717hotel.nl 10. Blow-out: Dylan Hotel From the slickly professional staff to the tasteful blend of modern design and olde worlde atmosphere, the Dylan is the premium choice for those with euros to blow and who are looking for an oasis in the old city centre. Originally a theatre, before becoming a hotel it burned down and was rebuilt as a poorhouse (the restaurant still has the original floors and baking ovens). The rooms are decked out in colour themes; dreamers will adore the candy-striped suite with its four-poster bed and leather sea chests. Transport is catered for too, since the Dylan will lend you anything from a boneshaker bicycle to a fully-fitted canal boat. \u00b7 From \u20ac295 (\u00a3208) for doubles to \u20ac1,500 (\u00a31,056) for a suite. dylanamsterdam.com/", "sentences": ["There are plenty of picturesque canal houses to choose from but finding somewhere special to stay in Amsterdam takes planning.", "Hostel: Stay OK Vondelpark  There was a time when hostelling in Amsterdam was synonymous with the cannabis counterculture - but the forthcoming smoking ban in July 2008 looks like putting paid to that.", "What&apos;s more, it&apos;s a stone&apos;s throw from Amsterdam&apos;s nightlife central, Leidseplein, so there&apos;s no need to abstain from the party scene.", "As Dutch as it gets, the interior is infused with the respectable working-class ethos that built Amsterdam during the Golden Age.", "There are only eight rooms though, so like everywhere else in Amsterdam, book well in advance.", "Family: Hotel Groenhof  There&apos;s a premium on space in Amsterdam and larger family rooms can be hard to find.", "Best for views: Seven Bridges Hotel Finding a room with a view in Amsterdam&apos;s fabled canal belt is like seeking a sunny beach in Barbados \u2013 it&apos;s par for the course.", "Combining a classical elegance with a younger feel and overall design, note also that the very clubbable bar and restaurant are some of the places to be seen in Amsterdam.", "Hip: Lloyd Hotel and Cultural Embassy Forgive the pretentious &quot;cultural embassy&quot; moniker \u2013 this place is the default base for performance artists visiting Amsterdam, and part of the deal is that they lay on shows at the Lloyd for guests and the public alike."], "title": "Top 10 Amsterdam hotels", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/nov/12/hotels.amsterdam", "tags": ["Hotels", "Travel", "Amsterdam holidays", "Top 10s", "Short breaks"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-14T09:34:20Z", "article": "Rebecca Gomperts, abortion doctor and activist, arrives straight from Heathrow, dressed in a smart suit, a big smile lighting up her girlish face. She is stopping off briefly en route to another engagement - a special screening of the film Vera Drake. She isn&apos;t keen. &quot;I&apos;ve seen it lots of times,&quot; she sighs, adding mischievously: &quot;I&apos;m going to try to get out of it.&quot; The event has been organised to tie in with the 40th anniversary of the 1967 abortion act, which is also the reason Gomperts, 41, is in Britain. She is the founder of Women on Waves (WoW), a radical Dutch organisation that sails an &quot;abortion ship&quot; to countries where the procedure is illegal, before taking women out to the safety of international waters to provide terminations. Gomperts&apos; reluctance to see the Mike Leigh film is not because she is uninterested in the subject matter then. Her passion is evident, but after eight years of being involved in the fray over the abortion debate, she is keen to focus solely on her next voyage. Her goal, she states firmly, is to &quot;get out of Europe&quot;. &quot;So far we have sailed to Ireland, Poland and Portugal, all when abortion was illegal, with varying degrees of success, but we are looking to visit either South America or Africa next summer,&quot; she says. &quot;Wherever we go there is a lot of press attention and opposition from anti-abortion groups but it is in developing countries that women really suffer because of unsafe and illegal abortions. That is why it is important for us to go there and raise awareness, however difficult it may be.&quot; An article published in the Lancet medical journal earlier this year backs up her view that the burden of unsafe abortion is borne disproportionately by the poor, the disadvantaged and the young. There are an estimated 210m pregnancies worldwide each year, of which one in five ends in an abortion. An estimated 20m unsafe abortions are carried out each year, 97% of them in developing countries. According to the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), complications from unsafe abortions account for 70,000 deaths annually, as well as countless injuries. &quot;It&apos;s such a waste of life,&quot; says Gomperts. &quot;As a doctor, I look at the abortion issue from a health perspective and the fact is that an early abortion is safer than giving birth. That is not meant to promote abortion because if women want to have children it is a risk they are naturally willing to take. However, if they don&apos;t want them they should never be forced to take that risk.&quot; It was a stint as resident doctor aboard Greenpeace&apos;s Rainbow Warrior II boat that inspired Gomperts to set up WoW. She was shocked by the number of women who were either suffering from botched back street abortions, or struggling to cope with several mouths to feed, in countries where the procedure is illegal or severely restricted. She became determined to find a way to help them. &quot;I remember meeting an 18-year-old girl in South America who was desperately trying to take care of her three younger brothers and sisters. She had recently lost her mother because of a backstreet abortion. Her mother had been pregnant for a fifth time and couldn&apos;t support another child so she had gone down the illegal route. I thought, how is it possible that a whole family has lost their mother just because she couldn&apos;t get a safe and legal abortion? &quot;I went back to the Rainbow Warrior and told the crew the story and how I wanted to help and they said that if you had a Dutch-registered ship it would be subject to Dutch law and so it would be legal to provide abortions in international waters. It seemed like the perfect solution. Of course, I had no idea at the time what I was taking on.&quot; Gomperts&apos; plan was to raise enough money to buy her own ship, which would be properly equipped with the necessary medical equipment and treatment rooms, but it quickly became clear that this wouldn&apos;t be possible. Pro-choice groups don&apos;t attract the level of donor support often enjoyed by pro-life organisations, so Gomperts turned to Plan B: finding funds for a mobile clinic that could be transferred to a hired ship for each voyage. By 2001 everything was in place for WoW&apos;s first trip. For practical reasons as much as need - proximity to the Netherlands and the lack of a language barrier - the destination was Dublin harbour. So with a cargo consisting of condoms, IUDs, the &quot;morning after&quot; pill and the abortion pill RU-486, a crew of six women and two men set sail. &quot;I was very naive when we went to Ireland,&quot; Gomperts says. &quot;I think you have to have a certain amount of naivety to do something like that because if you knew what was ahead of you, you probably wouldn&apos;t do it. I had made good links with local abortion rights groups and they were very keen for us to come and raise awareness but initially they didn&apos;t want us to offer abortions. I always said that if we couldn&apos;t do abortions the whole trip was pointless, so we left it that we would offer medical abortions with the abortion pill.&quot; (Medical abortions involve taking pills that induce an early miscarriage, while surgical abortion - which the ship doesn&apos;t offer - is performed under local or general anaesthetic.) However, it became clear when Gomperts arrived in Ireland in the full glare of the world&apos;s media that she had underestimated how controversial the trip would be. While the ship was en route, conservative members of the Dutch parliament had announced that WoW was not licensed to offer the pill legally. It was made clear to Gomperts that she could face imprisonment if she continued with her project. &quot;It was a complete nightmare. We had such high hopes when we set off from the Netherlands, only for them to come crashing down when we hit port. The legal issues were cleared up a year later but there were so many obstacles that it was impossible to solve them in a few days.&quot; It was a major setback and press coverage was mainly negative. Headlines included &quot;Dutch activists renege on abortions promise&quot; and &quot;Abortion boat admits Dublin voyage was a publicity sham&quot;. In the end, the ship distributed all its contraceptives and &quot;morning after&quot; pills and received more than 200 calls from women requesting abortions they couldn&apos;t provide. &quot;I was surprised by how much impact the trip had politically,&quot; Gomperts says. &quot;I think abortion is one of those issues within the EU where countries don&apos;t want to interfere with each other&apos;s policies. This was a very visual challenge to Ireland&apos;s policy and, being a Dutch ship, it made some people nervous. There are other organisations in the Netherlands that work for abortion rights but they just use advocacy and not loopholes in the law. We use these loopholes but I don&apos;t see it as any different from women travelling to England to have abortions, which happens all the time. The difference is, the ship is a symbol of freedom of choice.&quot; Indeed Gomperts&apos; methods are deliberately confrontational. She uses direct action, which is more associated with the anti-abortion movement, and seems unconcerned at being such a figurehead for her cause. Given the lengths that some groups will go to prevent abortions, isn&apos;t she ever afraid? &quot;No,&quot; she says. &quot;I have never worried about my safety - other people do, but I don&apos;t. People are very passionate about this issue and I recognise and respect that. The most aggressive crowd I have seen was in Poland when we visited in 2003. We had to have a lot of security because the anti-abortion protesters were throwing eggs and red paint and it got quite unpleasant. However, when you are in the middle of a campaign there is so much to think about that fear is not an emotion you feel. You just have to get on with it.&quot; There have been some successes. In 2004 when Women on Waves sailed to Portugal they were blockaded by two war ships, which refused to let them enter Portuguese waters. Gomperts says this &quot;disproportionate response&quot; by the government caused such a furore in the country that it ensured abortion was a key issue in the 2005 election, which ended with the ruling party being replaced by the Socialist party. In February this year, Portugal held a national referendum on abortion and in April, President Cavaco Silva ratified a law allowing women to obtain abortions until the 10th week of pregnancy. It is this kind of success that propels Gomperts forward, she says. She has recently been battling with the Dutch government for permission to provide abortions on the ship until the 12th week of pregnancy, instead of the seven weeks that the organisation&apos;s licence currently covers. &quot;There is a very small window in which we can help women at the moment. I would like that extended because it is still safe under the conditions we provide. &quot;We would never provide surgical abortions purely for practical reasons. You need at least 20 minutes for each woman so we would have to stay out in international waters for a lot longer. We also know that the services we provide will never be able to meet the demand. It is a symbolic gesture. We know we won&apos;t solve the problem.&quot; Gomperts was born in Suriname (her father is from the former Dutch colony) before moving at the age of three to the Netherlands, her mother&apos;s country. Most of her formative years were spent in the port of Vlissingen before she moved to Amsterdam to study art and medicine. She wanted to be an artist but says she wasn&apos;t &quot;good enough&quot;. After various medical internships, she stumbled across abortion as a specialty. &quot;It is a profession where you can really help somebody in a very complete way. You need a lot of psychological and surgical expertise, so even though it is a very small field there is a lot of variety. It is also one of those issues that the more you know, the more the injustice gets to you. Now my aim is to take this whole debate outside the high ground of morality because it doesn&apos;t have anything to do with morality. Many women who I have helped have said they are generally against abortion but that their situation is &apos;different&apos;. &quot;Even if you are against abortion you might face a moment where your situation is &apos;different&apos;. My work is about ensuring there is a fundamental respect that a woman can make that decision for herself at that point in her life.&quot; During her time as director of WoW, Gomperts has had two children; one is two, the other 14 months. Has motherhood changed her perspective? &quot;Of course having children has changed me as person, but it hasn&apos;t changed the way I feel about abortion. If anything, it has become even clearer to me how important it is that [having children] is something you really want. I enjoy it tremendously but it is so demanding that it must be a voluntary decision.&quot; Gomperts has been called many names since setting up her organisation, one of which - &quot;pirate&quot; - elicits raised eyebrows and a resigned shake of the head when I mention it. But how would she describe herself? &quot;That&apos;s too difficult,&quot; she replies. &quot;I guess one of my strengths has been to make the impossible possible. When people say you can&apos;t do it I become determined to make it happen.

But this relatively short 186mph line from the Channel tunnel to London looks likely to be the UK&apos;s only sniff of the rail revolution that has been sweeping Europe. Over the last two decades, France has virtually replaced its classic long-distance rail system with a integrated network of high-speed lines, used by its famous TGVs or &quot;Trains \u00e1 Grande Vitesse&quot;. Germany has built numerous sections of high-speed line, allowing its superb InterCity Express or &quot;ICE&quot; to operate across the country. Even Spain, flushed with the success of its first line from Madrid to Seville, is building numerous new sections. A 2-hour 35-minute link between Madrid and Barcelona will open in December, along with a line to Malaga, bringing Madrid-Malaga under three hours for the first time. In Switzerland, an alpine tunnel under the L&amp;oumlat;tschberg Pass opens in December, knocking an hour off the Zurich-Milan journey. In Italy, high-speed lines link Milan, Florence and Rome, another to Naples has just been opened, and more are under construction. Our government believes that a UK north-south high-speed link would not win back substantial numbers of people from domestic airlines. This flies in the face of practical experience in almost every country that has introduced high-speed rail. A three-hour journey time used to be the magic figure. If the centre-to-centre train ride was three hours or less, so the marketing manual said, trains could compete with airlines even for the lucrative, time-sensitive business market. But air travellers are being told to check in two hours before takeoff even for a 60-minute flight; skies are congested and delays common. Guillaume Pepy, chief executive of French Railways (SNCF), declared that with increasing airline hassle and delays, plus the added productivity of a train journey featuring laptop power points and wireless internet, the magic three hours has become four or even five. He points to the Perpignan-Paris TGV, which has a five-hour journey time and a 50% share of the air-rail market. There is no reason to believe that UK travellers are any different. A small revolution has also swept across Europe&apos;s sleeper trains. Deutsche Bahn (German Railways) has successfully revamped its overnight services as &quot;city night line&quot;, with new sleeping cars offering hotel-style accommodation as well as couchettes and reclining seats. With online sales and competitive pricing, they&apos;ve made these trains viable on many longer-distance routes where even high-speed trains are unable to compete with air on journey time. Indeed, an expansion is planned for December, with sleeper trains from Germany to Prague, Copenhagen, Warsaw, Milan and Vienna extended to start in Amsterdam, plus several new routes. Spain has developed its own &quot;trainhotel&quot; concept, both on domestic routes such as Barcelona-Seville and international ones such as Barcelona and Madrid to Paris, and Barcelona to Milan and Zurich. The concept has proved successful, and more &quot;trainhotel&quot; trainsets are on order to replace the remaining classic sleeper trains. To coin a phrase, Europe seems to be seeing a new &quot;age of the train&quot;.

I&apos;ve got a glass of champagne and am gliding smoothly through Kent at 186 mph. It&apos;s shiny and comfortable and fantastic. But Gordon Brown must be worried. The city of Nice is now closer to Westminster than Kirkcaldy! This little piece of continental bliss extending over from France means that a Parisian can now be at Luton airport more quickly than a Londoner can get to Charles de Gaulle airport by air. Eurostar is clearly eroding our Britishness and could very well undermine our position as the world&apos;s top flyers. Furthermore, the only decent train route in Britain has to suffer the humiliation of having one end in France. I&apos;m surprised Gordon didn&apos;t put a stop to it. British flyers emit far more per head than anyone else in the world - about 40% more than the second-placed country, Ireland. You might think it&apos;s because we&apos;re on an island. But another island people, the Japanese, fly significantly less than half of what we do. Paris is the number one destination to reach from Heathrow with more than 60 flights a day from London. Manchester, Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Brussels and Leeds are all top destinations, too. Despite these air journeys being more than 10 times more damaging to the climate than the equivalent trips by train, Brown prefers them. Perhaps he sees them as more British. Maybe that&apos;s why he appointed the aviation lobbyist and former BAA boss, Joe Irvin, as his special adviser and not Bob Crow of the rail and shipping union, RMT. Actually, as every schoolboy knows, the train was invented by Stephenson and is in fact British. The plane on the other hand is American - just like the nuclear bomb, the machine gun and the incandescent light bulb. All of those devices need phasing out. While the plane may still come in handy for many journeys, there certainly isn&apos;t the need for new runways to provide for these short-haul trips and so today&apos;s arrival at St Pancras offers some rare good news on the emissions front. Since aviation already contributes 13% of the UK&apos;s climate impact, Eurostar&apos;s new facilities could see that figure seriously dented as more sustainable rail travel becomes quicker and more accessible. We already know that when the west coast mainline was redone, the proportion of people flying to taking the train to and from Manchester went from 60:40 to 40:60. While government revision of airport expansion plans is well overdue, it wasn&apos;t just today&apos;s train that arrived on schedule; the entire line is the biggest construction project in British history and yet it arrived on time and on budget.

The 17-year-old, who has not been named, is alleged to have tricked players of 3D cartoon world Habbo Hotel before removing a number of virtual items they had bought. It is believed to be the first time European officers have arrested someone for stealing virtual property. &quot;The accused lured victims into handing over their Habbo passwords by creating fake Habbo websites,&quot; said a spokesman for Sulake, the Finnish company that runs Habbo. &quot;As in many other virtual worlds, scamming for other people&apos;s personal information such as user names has been problematic for quite a while.&quot; The website, which has around 6 million users each month, is popular among teenagers and younger web surfers around the world. Users of the site are able to create and dress characters, or decorate their virtual hotel rooms with items and furniture bought using real money. Police in Amsterdam confirmed that five other teenagers were being questioned over the theft, which is believed to have netted items worth around \u20ac4,000 (\u00a32,800). The sale of virtual goods for internet games and online worlds is a boom industry, with the market currently valued at around \u00a3750m a year.

Examine the &apos;global newspaper&apos; beloved of the Guinness Book of Records. Over 23.1 million read it each morning. It is published in 70 editions, 23 countries and 19 languages. The audience is young, rich and influential - what every media mogul craves. Only a few days ago, it announced rather grandly that company HQ would be moving from Luxembourg to dear old Fleet Street.  All hail to the smart Swedes who started Metro and the daily freesheet revolution. But let&apos;s draw a veil over current performance. Shares are down by about a third this year. In the first nine months of 2007, the enterprise lost $32.7m on sales of $314m. That will surely improve in the run-up to Christmas, but it is still another confidence cruncher to be jotted down after 2006&apos;s retreat from Finland and Poland. What&apos;s gone wrong?  The first, thing to note is blindingly obvious: if you&apos;re giving your paper away, then there&apos;s only one revenue stream - the advertising. But if those ads diminish or stall as costs go up, then trouble comes swiftly round the back. The latest issue of Business Week, for instance, reports Metro International advertising revenue down 5 per cent in Philadelphia and 12 per cent in Boston as US growth ebbs away.  And you don&apos;t need many trouble spots around the globe to find yourself in bigger trouble, either, because cutting back isn&apos;t much of an escape route if you&apos;re already down to the bone. The 80 print sites around the globe, 900 delivery trucks and 3,500 employees involved in distributing the paper are inescapable overheads. So what do you chop? Not editorial, such as it is. That&apos;s where a new batch of rivals is causing you more problems. Northern Europe was pretty solid territory for the original Metros in 2006. Though there was a nasty little back tax problem in Stockholm, the roots of the revolution seemed strong and profitable. But France and Spain were struggling for break-even and increasingly beset by rivals. A Norwegian company - Schibsted - owns the 20 Minutes mini-chain in Paris and Madrid, and its bouncier style and more localised content have given it a clear boost. Other competitors from New York to Amsterdam have also launched fresher, and arguably better, products. Britain&apos;s morning Metro chain is owned by Associated - nothing to do with the Norse original. Steve Auckland, its CEO in London, sees content as key to his Metro success - and the Swedes&apos; missing link. They haven&apos;t developed their string as proper papers, he says. They&apos;ve been happy to syndicate and re-process the same sparse diet worldwide. That&apos;s made them vulnerable as other publishing houses have muscled in on their patch. It is also difficult to escape because you can&apos;t re-launch a paper dished out by hand every morning. Associated&apos;s morning Metros now distribute nearly 1.4 million copies a day, and have just added 110,000 extra in London. They show what can be done if you&apos;re prepared to invest in infrastructure and getting the right number of copies to the right sites on time. Maybe they&apos;ll never be as financially attractive as a good local monopoly weekly, delivering 30 per cent profitability; but there&apos;s no reason why they shouldn&apos;t be a very good business indeed, aiming for 20 per cent when a buoyant ad market helps things along. But is it possible to fine-tune so many markets? Has Metro International been prudent to expand quite so fast and take a few knocks along the way? As one Swedish chief executive bows out and another takes over, is the magic of free, young and feisty quite what it was? Can they get by with bargain basement websites? And what, pray, would happen in global recession? You can get over-gloomy about a few hindrances. The Metro Swedes&apos; record remains astonishing. Fear of the frees still makes paid-for papers shiver. But the formula doesn&apos;t come guaranteed. It can be beaten by other newcomers. It can be outfought by multimedia companies who have other revenue streams to rely on. It can be out-thought by managements of greater experience and depth. And there are always limits.  The Swedes found that out when they started a free evening paper in Copenhagen: it folded, because evenings didn&apos;t work.  Is that the clank of the refuse trucks clearing London of its two rival evening frees in the distance? Perhaps. It&apos;s certainly the sound of brains engaging.

One of Britain&apos;s foremost talents, a young woman with kindling legs and a beehive like goth candyfloss, stands onstage swaying, staring dumbfounded as the crowd start loudly booing. Finally, Amy Winehouse (for it is she) glares out into the dark fast-emptying arena, drawling petulantly: &apos;Who&apos;s booing?&apos; Then, mystified, ranting: &apos;Why are you booing me?&apos; It&apos;s a good question: why does the crowd at the NIA boo Amy Winehouse - and then leave in droves - halfway through the long-awaited first date (the amended first date) of her UK tour? A shame, as it all starts so well. Actually, that&apos;s a lie. Winehouse is so late onstage that by the time she finally appears a slow handclap has started up, and people are lolling about on the dirty floor, bored and irritated. Of course, Birmingham should probably consider itself lucky that Amy Winehouse showed up at all (Ladbrokes were taking bets all week on yet another cancellation). Finally she totters on, dressed a bit like a hooker in search of an Amsterdam window, but gorgeous, strangely fragile, with it. It&apos;s clear by the way the crowd cheers her entrance that there&apos;s enough goodwill, enough desire to hear the dark classics of her hit album, Back to Black, for this gig to be a triumph... if she wants it to be. Sadly, perhaps inevitably, Winehouse doesn&apos;t seem to want it to be. Instead she embarks on something that is less a gig than a Spinal Tap-inspired comedy classic: dropping her microphone, swigging lustily from a beaker, having little weeps about her husband, Blake Fielder-Civil (banged up in Pentonville charged with perverting the course of justice). Then there are Winehouse&apos;s rather worrying dance routines. One is reminiscent of a frog being simultaneously electrocuted and dissected. During another I become concerned that the strobes have triggered a fit. None of which would matter were we also being treated to Winehouse&apos;s heart-snagging, era-enriching songs (&apos;Back to Black&apos;, &apos;Tears Dry on Their Own&apos;, &apos;Rehab&apos;, &apos;Wake Up Alone&apos;), all delivered by that wondrous pathos-encrusted voice. But sorry - not tonight, Birmingham. In place of the songs we&apos;d love to hear the audience is offered endless unintelligible variations of an alley cat being tortured with rusty pliers. The shrieking (clearly Winehouse&apos;s vocal version of a Get Out of Jail Free card) is so bad, it soon becomes clear that this is going to be a night of Guess-the-Song. I resort to lurking near the sound desk, trying to get a peek at the set-list. Apparently &apos;Addicted&apos;, &apos;Just Friends&apos; and &apos;He Can Only Hold Her&apos; have already happened. Well, Ms Winehouse, you could have fooled me. Let&apos;s rewind to earlier in the week when I see Kate Nash, the internet-launched, Lily Allen-endorsed auburn-haired &apos;yoof-queen&apos;, also starting a UK tour, at the Shepherds Bush Empire, performing songs from her album Made of Bricks. Often veering between horribly twee (&apos;Skeleton Song&apos;, &apos;Birds&apos;), tediously repetitive and give-me-strength scatological (&apos;Shit Song&apos;), 20-year-old Nash certainly has her limitations, sounding far too often like (very weak) Smiths meets (derivative) Streets via Tracey Ullman circa her unlamented pop star period. For all that, a couple of Nash&apos;s songs, the spiky break-up hit &apos;Foundations&apos; and the sly, subtle &apos;Nicest Thing&apos;, hint at something to come. As do Nash&apos;s own demeanour - amid the cluttered fey stage-set (a topiary horse?), and clumpy vaudeville feel (you kept expecting Nash to offer to make balloon animals), a sense of passion and intent is at least trying to seep through. All of which seem in stark contrast to Birmingham, where Winehouse, despite being just a little older and vastly more gifted, is coming across as a washed-up brat. While it would be hypocritical to condemn a 24-year-old jazz-princess, under intense tabloid-pressure, for being &apos;somewhat merry&apos; (let she without sin, etc), there is something about Winehouse at Birmingham that seemed ineffably depressing - as if one is watching some priceless elixir (promise, talent, joy?) swirling pathetically down some toxic drain. One doesn&apos;t really mind Winehouse dropping her mike, or taking cheeky swigs from her beaker, though God knows what Sirs Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Frost, sitting together in the front row, think. And it is initially touching when she dedicates &apos;Wake Up Alone&apos; to &apos;Blakey&apos; (Fielder-Civil). Less so when she keeps slipping his name into every other song, climaxing with a version of &apos;Me and Mr Jones&apos; which has turned mysteriously into &apos;Me and Mr Blakey&apos;. We are still making allowances for Winehouse as she runs off stage for a costume change (leaving the band to boringly introduce each other), coming back with exactly the same clothes on. And then introducing the band all over again. This is when the booing starts, leading Winehouse to have something of a diva-strop. Here&apos;s a transcript of what she says to the Birmingham crowd (to the best of my hearing): &apos;Who&apos;s booing? Everyone that&apos;s booing is a manky cunt. Wait till my husband gets out. He&apos;s incarcerated. But wait till he gets out (finger-jab). I mean it, cunts.&apos; How charming. One hopes Sirs Andrew and David are enjoying their evening. After this Winehouse gets halfway through &apos;Valerie&apos; before walking off. By now, only 40 minutes in, people are either booing, complaining or gone. As I leave, I realise that the only truly unforgivable thing about this evening is that the (rather brilliant, somewhat troubled) Amy Winehouse has been something that -despite everything - she has never been before: terribly boring.", "sentences": ["Finally she totters on, dressed a bit like a hooker in search of an Amsterdam window, but gorgeous, strangely fragile, with it."], "title": "The battle of the barnets", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2007/nov/18/featuresreview.review4", "tags": ["Culture", "Kate Nash"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-19T00:05:04Z", "article": "Failure to qualify for a tournament brings serious punishment and Scotland have been sentenced to a 10-month stretch. The side is confined to friendly internationals until the World Cup qualifiers start in the early autumn of next year. &quot;There&apos;ll be a lot of DVD watching, that&apos;s for sure,&quot; said the Scotland manager, Alex McLeish. He was talking about monitoring other teams but this cinema buff might also have time to catch up on movies he has missed. A period of unwelcome stillness lies ahead. Such seclusion felt inconceivable shortly before kick-off on Saturday when even the besuited corporate guests were dancing to the Proclaimers song that roared out over the Hampden loudspeakers. Walk 500 miles? There was enough energy in the ground to do that distance at a sprint. Unfortunately the euphoria came at the expense of vigilance and, in the second minute, Scotland barely defended at all as Luca Toni scored following a quick throw-in. Though Barry Ferguson equalised, the afternoon closed with Christian Panucci&apos;s winner that ensured McLeish&apos;s side would not be going to Euro 2008. The mistaken award of a free-kick to Italy for that stoppage-time goal should not be logged in the elaborate folklore of Scottish victimisation. It was the visitors who endured the gravest wrongs as the referee, Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez, and particularly his assistants denied them a valid goal before allowing Ferguson to shoot home from an off-side position. Scotland, for the sake of their sanity and their prospects, must come up with healthy reasons for remembering this defeat. Fans, coaches and players have to snip the loop running through their minds of James McFadden&apos;s missed chance in the 81st minute when Italy were, as McLeish stated, &quot;on the ropes&quot;. The incident needs to be rebranded as a glowing example of the fast, dangerous football the team can produce. The visitors, as becomes world champions, could make influential changes but the substitutions were primarily conservative. Vincenzo Iaquinta, for instance, was brought on to check the exuberant running of the right-back Alan Hutton. The Rangers player&apos;s reputation is climbing so steeply that he is now the subject of a better class of rumour, such as the weekend talk of a move to Manchester United. Scotland have not appeared at a major tournament since 1998 and attempts at revival have all been quashed until now. While they ran England close over two legs in the bid for a place at Euro 2000, that was the last defiance of a fading line-up. In another play-off Scotland were simply not good enough and were walloped by Holland in Amsterdam. The situation now is agreeably different. The 37-year-old David Weir is the only member of the line-up who may leave the international scene in the near future. Scotland&apos;s handful of relative youths, however, will have to contend with nothing more than an impatient wait for the World Cup qualifiers. As with Northern Ireland, who seem set to miss Euro 2008 despite uncanny feats, Scotland have to make do with counting the rewards they have secured. McLeish&apos;s men will be among the second seeds at Sunday&apos;s World Cup draw. It could be that Scotland will never again beat France home and away in a campaign but it could be quite a while before there is a need to pull off such a feat merely to remain in contention. It was a paradox that McLeish should be reflecting on status regained just after Italy had floored them. All the same, he knows the progress that has been made and has an eye for the perils that accompany it. &quot;Therein lies the next challenge,&quot; he said, &quot;because we&apos;ll be a scalp for nations seeded below us.&quot; So long as there is no appealing offer from an English club, McLeish will relish meeting the threat with this group. &quot;Why can&apos;t they grow as a result of this?&quot; he demanded. The manager rattled off the names of men such as Hutton, Darren Fletcher and McFadden whose best years still lie ahead. He awaits the dividends of the excitement created throughout the country. &quot;With the enthusiasm that comes from seeing a change in Scotland,&quot; McLeish said, &quot;we&apos;re hoping to get thousands of young kids wanting to play the number one sport again.&quot; The grown-ups, too, have to retain the conviction that they are on the move even when there is nowhere really to go for those 10 months.", "sentences": ["In another play-off Scotland were simply not good enough and were walloped by Holland in Amsterdam."], "title": "Football: Kevin McCarra: Where now for Scotland?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/19/scotlandfootballteam1", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Scotland"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-19T15:30:00Z", "article": "At times, long after laying the big flagstones on the path to war, mainstream US media outlets resolve to be more independent next time. And why not? As Mark Twain commented, &quot;It&apos;s easy to quit smoking. I&apos;ve done it hundreds of times.&quot; When the president and his team set out to prepare the media ground for war, they can rely on a repetition compulsion that&apos;s widespread in the American press. Major outlets seem unable to resist White House agenda-setting for war. Cases in point span decades, from Vietnam and the Dominican Republic to Grenada and Panama, to Iraq and Yugoslavia, to Afghanistan and Iraq again - with Iran likely to join the list next year. Along the way, beginning with the 1991 Gulf war, the better performances of the British press compared to the American media - high jumps over low standards - have not prevented the British government from requiting the worst aspects of the special relationship by supplying troops and weaponry for US-initiated war efforts based on deception. The political feasibility of waging these tragic wars can be largely traced to the US media&apos;s reflexive capitulations to the administration in Washington - providing stenographic services far more often than tough scrutiny. In the US, superficial self-critiques have become periodic rituals at big news organisations. But the basic and chronic failures to engage in independent journalism routinely elude serious examination, whether by the &quot;public editor&quot; at The New York Times or by The Washington Post&apos;s in-house media columnist, Howard Kurtz, who has long double dipped as a punch pulling media critic on the CNN payroll.

The belated and fuzzy outlines of the US media&apos;s second thoughts are apt to appear long after the realtime coverage has aided and abetted Washington&apos;s war planners. So, today, with few murmurs of concern from the powerhouse US media, the quality of reporting on the Iranian &quot;threat&quot; is scarcely more of a departure from the official White House line than what we were getting five years ago in countless stories about the menace of Saddam Hussein&apos;s Iraq. Since its release last summer, the full-length documentary film, War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death (based on my book of the same name) has been unanimously avoided by every one of the media outlets that it criticises, including CNN, Fox, MSNBC, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CBS, NBC and ABC. None opted to air a moment or print a word about the film, which is narrated by Sean Penn and includes stunning archival footage that undermines the pretensions of the nation&apos;s most prestigious news organisations. The documentary&apos;s critique is fundamental, and so is its indigestibility by the media that it takes on. A pivotal assumption continues to hold in America&apos;s high journalistic places: if you&apos;re pro-war, you can be objective; if you&apos;re anti-war, you&apos;re biased. Thus, as shown with network footage in War Made Easy, the widely esteemed then-ABC correspondent Ted Koppel intoned from the front line on camera at the outset of the Iraq invasion in March 2003: &quot;I must say, I was trying to think of - I was trying to think of something that would be appropriate to say on an occasion like this, and as is often the case, the best you can come up with is something that Shakespeare wrote for Henry V, &apos;Wreak havoc and unleash the dogs of war&apos;.&quot; Very few eyebrows are raised when the most highly-touted US journalists cheerled the latest US war effort in the course of their reportorial duties. As I note in the film, &quot;A news anchor will get no flak at all for making statements that are supportive of a war and wouldn&apos;t dream of making a statement that&apos;s against a war.&quot; The first UK public screening of War Made Easy is set for the evening of Tuesday November 27 at the Frontline Club in London. The documentary will also be shown on the following night at a cinema in an event sponsored by the Stop the War Coalition. (Days later, the film makes its debut at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam.) British viewers may be taken aback to see the grotesque extent to which US presidents and American news media have jointly shouldered key propaganda chores for war launches during the last five decades. But complacency would be ill-advised. The American media may be in a particularly degraded and craven state while covering the great issues of war and peace, but the tandem machinations of George Bush and Tony Blair - and indications that the current British government is unwilling to challenge the war cries from Washington now aimed at Tehran - do not attest to overall political or journalistic health in either country.", "sentences": ["(Days later, the film makes its debut at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam.)"], "title": "US media poodles", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/19/usmediapoodles", "tags": ["US news", "World news", "Iraq"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-20T00:00:27Z", "article": "You can imagine the scene: tube train crammed to bursting with commuters, trying to keep breathing for long enough to be spat back out into grey November sleet, and suddenly an immensely aristocratic voice snaps: &quot;Why don&apos;t you shut up?&quot; In Spanish.

However, clinging to the wreckage were representatives of what Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and his new wave colleagues pejoratively called le cin\u00e9ma du papa. The line of classic cinematic French storytelling was continued in the shape of Claude Sautet, Bertrand Tavernier and Pierre Granier-Deferre, who has died aged 80. It is no surprise to learn that the Parisian Granier-Deferre, after studying at l&apos;Idhec (L&apos;Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Cin\u00e9matographiques), started his career as assistant on a number of solid mainstream films, several directed by the workmanlike Denys de La Patelli\u00e8re and Jean-Paul Le Chanois, some featuring the great Jean Gabin, still trailing his past glory. He was also assistant on L&apos;Air de Paris (1954), starring Gabin and Arletty, directed by Marcel Carn\u00e9, one of the leading representatives of le cin\u00e9ma de qualit\u00e9, which the new wave reacted against but which, particularly Truffaut and Claude Chabrol, eventually came to admire. When Granier-Deferre began to direct films himself in 1962, he continued in the same tradition, featuring many of the monstres sacr\u00e9s of the French cinema - Gabin, Simone Signoret, Alain Delon, Lino Ventura, Romy Schneider, Michel Piccoli, Philippe Noiret and Jean Rochefort - and working on the scripts with a number of contemporary novelists whose books he adapted. However, the novelist he most adored, and whom he adapted more than any other, was Georges Simenon, though the latter never contributed to the screenplays. Granier-Deferre&apos;s films are among the best of the dozens based on Simenon. &quot;What interests me in Simenon is the ambiguity and ordinary madness of his characters which manifests itself at the least disturbance. I don&apos;t despise action, but I have a penchant for psychology. I&apos;m a director of chamber works.&quot; This is well displayed in his first Simenon adaptation, Le Chat (The Cat, 1971), with Gabin and Signoret as an ageing married couple, who spend their days in a rundown house on the edge of Paris. Locked in mutual hatred and contempt, they are intent on causing each other misery. The action is minimal and the dialogue almost non-existent. Yet, by dint of inspired casting and a sensitivity in imparting meaning to objects and small gestures, Granier-Deferre manages to sustain interest throughout. And, naturally, the double act of the leads, both of whom won acting awards in Berlin that year, is marvellous to watch. This was followed in the same year by another Simenon adaptation, La Veuve Couderc (The Widow Couderc), this time with Signoret in the title role opposite Alain Delon, 14 years her junior, as a fugitive to whom she gives shelter. Their love affair is brilliantly acted out against the background of the rise of fascism (it is 1934 in rural France), subtly invoked by Granier-Deferre. Le Train (The Last Train, 1973) is set in France in 1940 at the time of the German invasion. It again concentrates on the relationship of a couple - he (Jean-Louis Trintignant), separated from his wife and child, and she (Schneider), a Jew, fleeing the Nazis. Blending black-and-white with colour photography, and keeping the film intimate while horrendous events take place, Granier-Deferre again finds the right tone for the Simenon story. L&apos;\u00c9toile du Nord (The Northern Star, 1982) is set in a Belgian boarding house in the 1930s in which world-weary Noiret fascinates the landlady Signoret with his tales of Egypt, but he has blanked out the memory of his murder of an Egyptian millionaire on the Paris-Amsterdam express of the title. Despite some bizarre alterations to Simenon&apos;s novel Le Locataire (The Lodger), previously filmed in 1939 (destroyed) and 1947, it is good old-fashioned narrative cinema, assured by the contribution of the veteran screenwriter Jean Aurenche. After making his last feature film in 1995, Granier-Deferre returned to Simenon by writing 16 feature-length Inspector Maigret episodes for television with Bruno Cr\u00e9mer in the title role, directing three of them. Among his other notable films, from a different source, but with an air of Simenon&apos;s stifling atmosphere about them, were Le Cage (The Trap, 1975), a thriller with Ventura and Ingrid Thulin as a vengeful couple, and Une \u00c9trange Affaire (A Strange Affair, 1981), with Piccoli and Nathalie Baye. Granier-Deferre was an amiable and modest man, seldom seen without a large cigar. He is survived by a son with the British actor Susan Hampshire, to whom he was married from 1967 to 1974, and whom he directed in Paris in August (1966), four children by an earlier marriage and a later one by the circus star Annie Fratellini. \u00b7 Pierre Granier-Deferre, film and television director, born July 22 1927; died November 16 2007", "sentences": ["L&apos;\u00c9toile du Nord (The Northern Star, 1982) is set in a Belgian boarding house in the 1930s in which world-weary Noiret fascinates the landlady Signoret with his tales of Egypt, but he has blanked out the memory of his murder of an Egyptian millionaire on the Paris-Amsterdam express of the title."], "title": "Obituary: Pierre Granier-Deferre", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/nov/20/guardianobituaries.france", "tags": ["France", "Film", "World news", "Culture", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-20T11:48:16Z", "article": "It looked like a battle of the slogans. On either side of the campus square stood imposing library buildings bearing the names of Homer, Herodotus, Sophocles, Plato and the boast &quot;By royal charter in the reign of George II&quot;. Gathered in the middle was a group of 200 protesters carrying their own competing signs: &quot;Stop Columbia!&quot;, &quot;Harlem not for sale!&quot;, &quot;Say no to eminent domain!&quot; The protesters had huddled on a rainy Saturday around a 10ft statue of Alma Mater - the mother of learning - confronted by the mother of all neighbourhood disputes. They had marched from America&apos;s most famous black neighbourhood, Harlem, to the centre of one of the world&apos;s pre-eminent universities, Columbia, in what amounts to the ultimate clash of town versus gown. That clash comes to a head this week: by next Monday the city&apos;s planning authority must decide whether or not to allow the redevelopment of 17 acres in west Harlem and let Columbia go ahead with a massive expansion of its campus that would cost it $7bn (\u00a33.4bn) over the next 25 years. The proposal, fiercely resisted by many local residents who say it will encroach upon the black American nature of Harlem, would mark the third dramatic expansion in Columbia&apos;s history since it was founded with just eight students in 1754 in what is now downtown Manhattan. In the 1840s the university moved in search of extra space to mid-town Manhattan to where the Rockefeller Centre now stands; then it moved again in 1896 to its present location in uptown Morningside Heights. Now Columbia University, which its president Lee Bollinger calls the &quot;quintessential great urban university&quot;, says it needs to expand again so that it can remain globally competitive. Bollinger points out that Columbia students, of whom there are now more than 20,000, enjoy less than half the space per head than their equivalents at rivals Harvard, Yale or Princeton. The university has earmarked a largely manufacturing area in west Harlem which it plans to develop into &quot;Manhattanville&quot;, complete with a new business centre, research laboratories, and improved facilities for students and professors. Renzo Piano, co-designer of the Paris Pompidou centre and architect of the recently completed New York Times building in Manhattan, has produced the plans in sparkling glass and metal. &quot;This is vital to the future of the university,&quot; said Warren Whitlock, one of the directors of the Columbia project. &quot;Space is at a premium in this university. The way things are now we are asking Nobel laureates to work in antiquated facilities.&quot; The university insists that Piano&apos;s designs will provide local people with new open space and improved access across the island to the Hudson river and generate 6,000 jobs. But many Harlemites remain sceptical. A community board of local groups and businesses has already voted against Manhattanville by 32 to two votes. Residents have been angered by the threatened use of &quot;eminent domain&quot; to compulsorily purchase the homes of around 400 people living in the Manhattanville zone. The hostility rests upon decades of mutual suspicions. Columbia, with its mainly white and affluent student body, stands on top of a hill, rather like a medieval Italian town, overlooking the largely black and until recently overwhelmingly poor neighbourhood of central Harlem. Tom Kappner, one of the protesters who marched to Columbia, has lived in Harlem since 1966 when he graduated from the university. &quot;I have seen the university systematically erode diversity by driving out people of colour and the poor, and replace it with a sterile conformity of white upper middle-class students and faculty,&quot; he said. Kappner bore witness to the events of 1968, the memory of which still rankles with Harlemites. The university decided to build a gymnasium for its students on land that had been open to the neighbourhood. In what became known as the case of Gym Crow - a pun on the Jim Crow discriminatory laws in the south - the university tried to assuage angry residents by allowing them to use the facilities via a discreet side entrance. The plan backfired after black activists joined hands with students in bloody demonstrations that temporarily closed the campus. That gym was never built. This time Columbia says it has learned from past mistakes and is offering local people full access to its proposed sports hall in Manhattanville - via the front door. But such acts have proved insufficient to win over many Harlemites, who fear that a massive expansion of Columbia will merely increase the pace of gentrification that is already transforming the area. Harlem&apos;s townhouses, the focal point of black migration to the neighbourhood since the first world war, rose 300% in value during the 1990s to up to $3m - well beyond the purses of most black families who have been forced into state-owned housing projects or out of Harlem altogether. In their place affluent white homeowners have arrived. Bill Clinton set up his post-presidential offices in 125th street, close to the Manhattanville zone, and although he is respected by many African Americans as the country&apos;s &quot;first black president&quot; the move was symbolic of the sea-change in the area. To some extent Harlem has been a victim of its own success. Michael Adams, another protester and author of Harlem Lost and Found, moved to the area 25 years ago after he completed a post-graduate course at Columbia. &quot;People like me came here because we saw Harlem as the spiritual centre of African America, but also because we had a vision of the vibrant area it could become. &quot;Now we&apos;ve realised that vision, but the nightmare is that now we are not rich enough to enjoy it.&quot; Gentrification is not unique to Harlem; it is being played out furiously across Manhattan, from the Lower East Side to the garment district. &quot;What is happening to Harlem is part of the resurgence of Manhattan as a whole,&quot; said Kenneth Jackson, a Columbia professor and editor of the Encyclopaedia of New York City. &quot;What we are talking about is change. Manhattan is changing and when that happens somebody loses out.&quot; America&apos;s black capital moves with the times The name Harlem is Dutch and was coined in the days when New York was known as New Amsterdam. But for more than 100 years it has been what Columbia&apos;s Kenneth Jackson calls &quot;a worldwide symbol of black urbanisation&quot;. Black migration to the neighbourhood took off during the first world war, when large numbers of African Americans travelled north to escape Southern discrimination and to seek work in war industries. The 1920s saw a cultural blooming in the so-called Harlem Renaissance, associated with such names as Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington and Fats Waller in music; Langston Hughes and Ralph Ellison in literature; and Orson Welles, who staged his famous black Macbeth in Harlem in 1936, in theatre By 1930 the area had been dubbed the capital of black America. The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, a leading human rights group, was founded in Harlem in 1910 and Marcus Garvey based his back-to-Africa movement here in the 1920s. Malcolm X was assassinated in the Audubon Ballroom in 1965 (Columbia knocked the building down in 1994, causing further antagonism). Harlem also gave rise to the first black mayor of New York city, David Dinkins, and today plays host to the preacher and agitator Al Sharpton.  \u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday November 22 2007. In the article above we said that Columbia University has more than 2,000 students; we meant to say more than 20,000 students.

There is something about people and trees. The head forester at Sherwood weeps every time one of her ancient oaks falls with a wrenching sound like the end of the world. Her oldest standing tree, the phenomenal Major Oak, 1,100 years old at least and possibly older, has been cloned, and one of its siblings grows outside the United Nations building in New York. There must by now be a small forest of Boscobel oaks. The original is said to be the ancestor of all those Royal Oak pub signs, the actual tree in whose branches Charles II hid in 1651, after his defeat at the battle of Worcester. The present tree is the slightly younger twin of the original, which was hacked up to the last inch of root by royalist souvenir hunters - but acorns have been sold and given by the score, and now sprout all over the world. Newton&apos;s apples also drop all over the place. The scientist - notoriously cagey about his working methods - probably made up the story about being inspired by the apple long after he started work on the theory of gravity, but the anecdote was enthusiastically embroidered by contemporaries. Trees solemnly claimed as the very one whose apple fell, as William Stukeley wrote, not &quot;sideways or upwards, but constantly to the earth&apos;s centre&quot; - grow in a Cambridge college, in King&apos;s School, Grantham, at a National Trust mansion, and in the grounds of the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, where staff were wont to eat their lunchtime sandwiches in its shade, and wait for inspiration to strike them forcefully on the head. Nobody would ever gaze reverently at a slime mould, one of the most ancient life forms on earth, and think with awe that it was already oozing quietly as Shakespeare picked up his quill. Trees, however, are seen in many cultures if not quite animate, certainly as more than just the raw material for fires and furniture. The Amsterdam tree itself appears in the pages of the most famous teenage diary in the world. The tree&apos;s green spring shoots and bare winter branches were one of Anne&apos;s few reference points for the real world outside, beyond the bookshelf concealing the entrance to her family&apos;s cramped shelter. Millions of visitors to the Anne Frank House museum have looked up at its branches, been moved by a feeling of kinship with it and with her - and thousands campaigned, demonstrated, and threatened legal action against the death sentence passed by city officials, who say the tree is diseased and dangerous. The tree was reprieved yesterday.

Not because it has stopped dispensing money or has refused my card, but because it won&apos;t sing to me. I adjust the volume on the headset I&apos;m wearing and incline towards the screen. A fierce buzzing erupts, like angry electronic bees. The woman behind me taps me on the shoulder. &quot;Are you going to be much longer?&quot; she says. &quot;There&apos;s a queue.&quot; I apologise and head off to listen to the sounds emanating from a nearby church. I position the headset&apos;s antenna close to the metal railings - and quickly pick up Radio Five Live loud and clear. The reason I&apos;m wandering around Huddersfield in headphones is because it&apos;s the opening weekend of the Contemporary Music festival, and the hills are alive with the sound of electromagnetic interference. German sound artist Christina Kubisch has devised a walking tour that enables you to tune in to the secret frequencies of the city, using special headphones that turn the inaudible clouds of electrical emissions into audible sound. Kubisch, who has devised similar pieces in cities worldwide, likes Huddersfield. &quot;It combines elements of a big city and a small provincial town, so you get a wide variety of electrical signals within a small area,&quot; she says. &quot;New York and Tokyo are like electro-acoustic symphonies. I think of Huddersfield as chamber music.&quot; Strangely, Kubisch&apos;s Electrical Walk is far from the most bizarre thing happening at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music festival, which this year celebrates its 30th anniversary. As well as the expected world premieres by leading ensembles such as Musikfabrik, the Arditti Quartet and the Evan Parker ensemble, there are club nights in a mill, private hotel-room performances and a Viennese orchestra that makes instruments out of vegetables. Thirty years is a long time to remain contemporary, and there were indications in recent years that the festival was losing its edge. Last year, the new artistic director, Graham McKenzie, decided a shake-up was needed and began to stage concerts in unusual locations, while broadening the definition of contemporary music to incorporate elements of experimental jazz, electronica and performance art. &quot;The festival was often described in newspapers as a &apos;hardy perennial&apos;,&quot; McKenzie says. &apos;But who has passionate feelings for a hardy perennial?&quot; He is the first director of the festival to come from a non-conventional classical music background. After training as a social worker, he ran the Glasgow Centre for Contemporary Art, and spent much time in Amsterdam, soaking up contemporary music and visual art. It is no surprise, then, that this year&apos;s composer-in-residence, Yannis Kyriakides, is a young Amsterdam-based musician who studied with the grand master of Dutch contemporary music, Louis Andriessen. Under McKenzie, the festival has also forged a relationship with Dutch new music organisation Gaudeamus, which promotes an avant-garde club night known as the Night of the Unexpected. The event has never occurred outside Amsterdam before, but this year Huddersfield hosted its own Night of the Unexpected at Bates Mill, a working textile complex on the edge of town. The evening begins with a giant brass band powering through the harmonic uncertainties of Alvin Curran&apos;s composition Oh Brass on the Grass, Alas. Then violinist Monica Germino gives a solo performance on an electronically manipulated instrument whose screeching frequencies bring Bates Mill closer to the sound-world of Bates Motel. It&apos;s an emphatic statement of the festival&apos;s radical new agenda and seems to capture the imagination of a predominately studenty crowd. Yet such wild departures run the risk of alienating some of the festival&apos;s most loyal supporters. &quot;Obviously, it&apos;s my responsibility to try and establish a balance,&quot; McKenzie says. &quot;If you look at the programme there are no fewer premieres of standard, notated music than in previous years. But it&apos;s not enough simply to celebrate the 70th, 80th and 90th birthdays of composers whose major achievements occurred in the last century. When I took the job people told me, &apos;There are so many neglected masters.&apos; My response is, let&apos;s not create a whole new generation of neglected masters.&quot; At the end of an intense weekend of concerts, workshops and events what I really long for is a sit-down. Thankfully, this is what Nicholas Brown&apos;s installation at the George Hotel provides. You are directed to a suite on the second floor and put your feet up, while two violinists perform for you. Brown says the concept of the piece is to &quot;obviate the structures of concertising by returning music to a domestic environment&quot;.

But Anne Frank&apos;s tree is sick - terminally so, according to Amsterdam city council, which wants to put it out of its misery with an axe and chainsaw. Conservationists say it may be sick but that it is a symbol that can be saved. They are battling to stop the felling of the 22-metre (72ft) tree that comforted the girl who embodied courage in the face of barbarism. Lawyers, tree surgeons, politicians and bloggers are all in a mighty battle over the fate of the 150-year-old chestnut. &quot;It&apos;s certainly diseased and it needs to be taken care of,&quot; said Edwin Koot of Utrecht&apos;s Tree Foundation, leading the campaign to save the tree. &quot;But we can put a construction around the trunk and even if it breaks, there will be no damage.&quot; Hans Westra disagrees. The director of the Anne Frank Foundation is worried about the impact of a storm and the risk to the building where Anne&apos;s family hid from the Nazis for two years. &quot;The facts that I have are that the living wood in the tree is diminishing very fast. Last year it was down to 36%. Now it&apos;s 28%. The experts say a tree has to be cut down when the living wood is under 33%. &quot; The tree was still standing yesterday, despite the council&apos;s plan to send in chainsaws, lumberjacks, scaffolding and tower cranes to bring it down at dawn. A stay of execution was granted late on Tuesday by Judge Jurjen Bade after Koot&apos;s foundation appealed. The judge ordered both sides to reach a compromise within weeks. Felling, he said, should be the last resort. That scotched Charles Kuijper&apos;s hopes of a lucrative trade. The neighbour picked up one of the tree&apos;s fruits from the garden and hawked it on eBay as &quot;the last chance to get an original chestnut ...Grow your own Anne Frank tree anywhere&quot;. &quot;Terrible, this merchandising,&quot; said Westra. &quot;Anyone who buys it is completely stupid.&quot; But bidding has hit $10,000. Hidden in a secret annexe, Anne watched the tree through the only piece of glass that was not blacked out. Decades after she died in Bergen-Belsen camp, her father, Otto, dwelt on what the chestnut meant to Anne. &quot;She longed for it during that time when she felt like a caged bird. How could I have suspected ... how important the chestnut tree was to her.&quot; Anne wrote in her diary of the hope the tree gave her. &quot;Nearly every morning I go to the attic to blow the stuffy air out of my lungs. From my favourite spot on the floor I look up at the blue sky and the bare chestnut tree, on whose branches little raindrops shine, appearing like silver,&quot; she wrote in February 1944. &quot;As long as this exists, I thought, and I may live to see it, this sunshine, the cloudless skies, while this lasts I cannot be unhappy.&quot; Two months later, she noted: &quot;April is glorious ... Our chestnut tree is in leaf, and here and there you can already see a few small blossoms.&quot; And a month later, weeks before the Nazis arrived: &quot;Our chestnut tree is in full bloom.

And yet that building was waved through, as was the terminal after that. No expansion at Heathrow ever gets anything as unequivocal as a nod; it receives a resigned shrug, a worn-out sigh. However justified, resistance always comes to seem futile, outgunned by the government and the aviation industry. That same weariness could be detected yesterday, even as the transport secretary, Ruth Kelly, began her consultation into the building of a third runway at Heathrow. John Stewart, a hardened campaigner against the scheme, admitted the battle was as good as lost: &quot;Given the framework that the government has chosen, it will be difficult to challenge the plan.&quot; If that is what the dedicated are saying, imagine how others feel. Labour is already committed to a third runway at Heathrow - as well as to others at Stansted, Birmingham and Edinburgh. The argument is a simple one: beefing up our airports will boost the economy. Besides, the Department for Transport sees a massive increase in air travel as inevitable. It expects the number of passengers to double by 2030, to 465m. Informed by such thinking, the 238-page official consultation document published yesterday accepts the case for expanding Heathrow. The biggest question Ms Kelly is posing is how intensively the runways should be used. This is not a consultation, nor even an attempt at conversion; it is a lecture. Thanks to Christmas, the process has been extended by more than the bare minimum, but that is likely to be the biggest concession. Ministers will hold no public meetings with local residents, but their officials will stage a series of roadshows, or exhibitions. Even these will be woefully limited: the village of Sipson, due to be obliterated by the new runway, will not get an official visit. The document&apos;s figures on noise and pollution were provided by Heathrow&apos;s owners, BAA - and some of the report&apos;s arguments were so lopsided that they too might as well have been. Gordon Brown may have come to power promising greater openness, but this report shows more of the old thinking that always puts growth and business interests first. Visitors to Heathrow know it is bursting at the seams. Before increasing capacity, however, a better first step would be divesting the airport of most of the flights for journeys that could reasonably be carried out by other modes of transport. Consumers can and do change their behaviour: a few years ago the ratio of air travellers to train passengers on the journey between London and Manchester was 7:3. Since Virgin brought in its high-speed service between the two cities that ratio has been reversed. The government should have seized this as a chance to encourage greener travel. True, it is lobbying for the introduction of aviation into the European carbon-trading scheme. But that does not atone for building a third runway, as Ms Kelly thinks it does. Any Europe-wide consensus on including air travel in the scheme will probably come after the consultation is over. Besides, the scheme has a very patchy record. Given Mr Brown&apos;s commitment this week to taking a global lead in tackling climate change, it would have been far more consistent - and refreshing - for the government to talk about reducing air travel. Instead, it appears hellbent on creating extra capacity - which will very quickly be taken up by airlines. The aviation industry often argues that if Britain does not give it room to grow, other countries will. Amsterdam will take up the slack, say BAA and others, and besides, China and India are fast taking to the plane. That aviation is a global business is undeniable; all the more reason for Britain to take an international lead. Instead the government rolls over and accepts the huge growth in air travel as unstoppable.", "sentences": ["Amsterdam will take up the slack, say BAA and others, and besides, China and India are fast taking to the plane."], "title": "Leader: A closed debate on Heathrow", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/23/politics.transport", "tags": ["Politics", "Transport", "Airline industry", "Green politics", "UK news", "Business", "World news", "Travel and transport", "Climate change", "Environment", "Heathrow"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-23T14:32:37Z", "article": "1) We Have A Dream - Scotland 1982 World Cup squad Predating the self-deprecating stylings of David Baddiel and Frank Skinner by 14 years, but also managing to be funny and genuinely likeable to boot, this unhinged rant is unquestionably the best official World Cup song of all time. Having learned four years earlier in Argentina that, contrary to Andy Cameron&apos;s grimly inaccurate assertion, Scotland were extremely unlikely to shake anyone up by winning a single thing, the national team opted to play it for laughs by getting the star of Gregory&apos;s Girl, John Gordon Sinclair, to scream like a breathless madman about taking a penalty in his sleep only to wake up and find he&apos;s been kicking his wife. Anal music-buffs might care to know that as a result of this paean to accidental domestic violence reaching No5, Gregory was in the charts at the same time as his Girl: Clare Grogan&apos;s Altered Images were at No37 with Pinky Blue. 2) Oei Oei Oei, Dat Was Me Weer En Loei - Johan Cruyff What Johan Cruyff was to Total Football, Peter Koelewijn was to Dutch-speaking rock: here are Peter and his Rockets performing a piece of Buddy Holly footpaddery on some 1960 Netherlands television programme or other. It was inevitable the two Dutch masters would work together at some point, and with Ajax presumably unwilling to drop Wim Suurbier for Koelewijn, the pair were forced to lay down some dots in the recording studio during the heady summer of 1969 instead. This classic oompah-fest, the title of which roughly translates to &quot;Oof, oof, oof, that was another wack&quot;, was the result, a Brel-influenced bawdy romp which positively reeks of shouting, fighting, drinking and whoring. Try to listen to it without wishing you were spilling out onto an Amsterdam street at carouse o&apos;clock. You can&apos;t, can you? 3) Maradona - Andres Calamaro All the best art is borne of adversity. And so it was that when Argentinian singer-songwriter Andres Calamaro split up with his long-time girlfriend, he poured his heart out on Honestidad Brutal, a double album of 37 songs, one for every year of his life. Spread out over two CDs, the songs deal with the pain of romance on the rocks... except for the two about Diego Maradona, that is. The tenth track on each disc is given over to tributes to Argentina&apos;s greatest No10: Hacer el Tonto is a duet with the great man himself, Maradona crooning in the style of Charles Aznavour (with emphysema), but the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the trumpet-tootling Maradona: &quot;He is not a person like any other ... he is an angel ... and he has a celestial gift.&quot; Now, remember this album is an open love letter to his former girlfriend. No wonder she did one. 4) Smells Like Team Spirit (LP) - Wimbledon FC &quot;We are all for Wimbledon, for ever, ever more,&quot; sing the club&apos;s 1997 squad on We are Wimbledon. &quot;We&apos;re the Dons, we&apos;re the Dons, we&apos;re the Dons from Wimbledon FC ... we&apos;ll entertain you ever more,&quot; they add on the plaintive The Dons Song. Stop! We can take no more! With the club having met a brutal end at the murderous hands of Pete Winkelman and the MK Dons, the vocals of Neil Ardley, Alan Kimble, Peter Fear et al seem to drift from beyond the grave, eerily reminiscent of Lennon&apos;s Free as a Bird, as ethereal and detached as Elliott Smith on From A Basement On A Hill. An album of loss and regret right up there with Bob Dylan&apos;s Blood on the Tracks, it also contains a version of Woolly Bully by Vinnie Jones plus spoken-word interviews with Chris Perry and Terry Burton. 5) This Time (LP) - England 1982 World Cup squad The 1982 World Cup finals proved to be the high watermark for British footballing musicianship, properly crafted pop singles like World In Motion and Three Lions missing the point of the genre completely. While the Scots were hollering like clowns, England released the more measured high-concept album This Time, a K-Tel long player which featured Glenn Hoddle&apos;s half-decent rendition of We Are The Champions, the only version of You&apos;ll Never Walk Alone enjoyable to Evertonians - Viv Anderson and Trevor Francis positively desecrate it - Kevin Keegan&apos;s No33 smash Head Over Heels, and erstwhile Comedians comedian and Runaround host Mike Read&apos;s cockernee knees-up Bulldog Bobby. But of course the album will best be remembered for its double-A-side lead single: the almost Germanic stomp of This Time (We&apos;ll Get It Right) and England (We&apos;ll Fly The Flag). The latter was a reworking of a British Airways advert which would itself be famously renosed into the Scottish terrace anthem We Hate Jimmy Hill, He&apos;s A Poof, He&apos;s A Poof after Hill dismissed David Narey&apos;s wondergoal against Brazil as &quot;a toepoke&quot;. 6) We&apos;ve Got A Feeling - Basile Boli and Chris Waddle Chris Waddle was the best winger in Europe at the time this preposterous yet strangely entertaining single was released.

A friend recommended I act &apos;stupid&apos; on dates because men don&apos;t like women who appear to be more intelligent, confident and attractive than them, have stronger opinions or are too independent. Is my friend right? As a strategy it has limitations. When do you plan to reveal the real you? Evolutionary psychologists say that men want women with glossy hair, smooth skin and good muscle tone because they show good health for child-bearing. Women like men with big wallets. So have we evolved? Surveys show that men still rate attractiveness highly, but a study in Sex Roles, of 199 people in Amsterdam, showed men and women rated the importance of intelligence equally. A match.com survey found that while most men said they&apos;d be happy to marry a career-minded woman, most women thought it would put men off. Anecdotally, men prefer women who are almost as smart as them. There are, however, no anecdotes suggesting men want someone less attractive. A study led by Michelle Taylor from the University of Edinburgh, published in Personality And Individual Differences, compared the IQ tests of 900 people (born in 1921), taken at age 11, with their marriageable status 40 years later. For every 16-point rise in IQ, women were 40% less likely to be married. But this is an association that could mean smart women know marriage benefits men more than women and decide not to get married, or it may mean their chances are reduced because they do intimidate some men. The truth is probably a bit of both. Recent studies from the US show women with high-powered jobs are no less likely to be married than other women. Being too opinionated, not listening or seeming uninterested will put men off. Dates may make you anxious and more intimidating than you mean to be.

Why yesterday in particular? The Department for Transport has just rolled out its consultation paper on the government&apos;s proposal that Heathrow should get a third runway and a sixth terminal. This is in addition to, not instead of, the fact that Stansted is going to get a second runway. The transport secretary Ruth Kelly and her predecessors have not been shy about the government&apos;s belief that this is essential for UK plc. The venue the industry chose to mount its latest lobbying attempt was no accident: the London Stock Exchange. Journalists and photographers faced a panel consisting of the director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Richard Lambert, airport owner BAA&apos;s chief executive, Stephen Nelson, British Airways CEO, Willie Walsh, and Virgin Atlantic chief, Steve Ridgway. Well, the aviation men would lobby for a third runway, wouldn&apos;t they? But also on the bench with the CBI was Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC. It looks like a formidable line-up: the government, the CBI, the air transport industry and the unions. Surely they have the power to bulldoze this plan through? Maybe. Whatever the arguments for it, the task will be politically difficult. So what are the pros and cons, given that the aviation white paper says the southeast needs two more runways by or before 2020? First, the pros of a Heathrow third runway: having one big, three-runway hub is far more efficient from the air travellers&apos; and the airlines&apos; points of view than London having three two-runway airports. The big hub would shift more people per unit of real estate, and it would give them more destination and airline choices in one place. Meanwhile, global big business likes using Heathrow, although it is falling out of love with it right now because the airport is so close to capacity that it is becoming a nightmare to travel through, and operating so close to margins means that delay or flight cancellation is far more likely than at competing European hubs like Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. As Ridgway said at the Stock Exchange conference: &quot;Capping Heathrow isn&apos;t green. It just shifts business to our competitors.&quot; That is what worries the government. Aviation in the UK is a huge employer and world connections generate wealth for cities and nations. Hence Brendan Barber&apos;s backing for Heathrow expansion. Now the cons: the Heathrow solution may be the most efficient, but growth in air movements there affects far more people than expansion at Stansted or Gatwick would do, given that they are rurally located whereas Heathrow is right on the edge of the metropolis. Airlines can argue until kingdom come that they will be operating quieter, cleaner aeroplanes than they do now, but the many thousands of homes that will be affected by the vicinity of the airport would - if everything BA dreams of were delivered - suffer up to 702,000 aircraft movements compared with the 480,000 they get now. Quieter and cleaner maybe, but more continuous. Lastly, there is another uncomfortable fact: if Heathrow didn&apos;t get its extra runway, Gatwick would get another one by about 2020, and Stansted could face a third runway before 2030.", "sentences": ["Meanwhile, global big business likes using Heathrow, although it is falling out of love with it right now because the airport is so close to capacity that it is becoming a nightmare to travel through, and operating so close to margins means that delay or flight cancellation is far more likely than at competing European hubs like Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt."], "title": "Uncomfortable truths", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/25/uncomfortabletruths", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Airline industry", "Climate change", "Travel", "Business", "Transport", "UK news", "Environment", "Air transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-26T10:58:00Z", "article": "Mid-morning, West London:  At last a face-to-face session with Paul Staines who writes the popular rightwing blog, Guido Fawkes, scourge of us Westminster lackeys, scribblers and politicians alike.

A work true to the spirit of the 1960s, it shocked a society that had not yet completed the transition from provincial conservatism to the libertarianism of modern Amsterdam (by no means shared by the whole of the rest of the country; and even Amsterdam now seems to be having second thoughts). As a sculptor he was receiving important commissions as early as 1956, when he won a medal for a bronze statue. In the same year he was asked to prepare a monument to the victims of the disastrous North Sea floods of 1953 for a town in the worst affected province of Zeeland. The first version, a revolutionary work made of glass, was rejected and he finally produced, in 1957, a bronze showing a mother with a drowned child on her arm. Death was a recurrent theme in his writing too, not least because his eldest brother died of diphtheria at 22 in 1944. He continued to work in glass, most notably for the monument to the victims of Auschwitz in Amsterdam. Jan Wolkers was born in Oegstgeest, near Leiden, South Holland, the third of 11 children of a not very successful grocer. His parents belonged to the Calvinist Dutch Reformed Church, in which the teenaged Jan lost interest during the war, although his religious background often played a considerable role in his writing. He left school early to help in the shop and spent the latter part of the war as a &quot;diver&quot; - hiding to avoid forced labour in Germany. After the war he did odd jobs and took art lessons in Leiden, also learning to type. He spent time in Paris, the Hague, Amsterdam, Salzburg and elsewhere studying painting and sculpture, sometimes on scholarships and under leading artists. He married Maria de Roo in 1947, a relationship overshadowed by the death of their second child in her second year in an accident in the bath in 1951. Much of his writing derived from his own life and experience, and eventually he wrote about the little girl&apos;s death in the cathartic novel Een Roos van Vlees (A Rose made Flesh) in 1963. The marriage broke up and in 1958 Wolkers wed Annemarie Nauta, whom he met on further studies in France. Turkish Delight, a love story and his most popular novel, translated into some 12 languages, derives from this short-lived relationship, telling the tale of a sculptor who has an on-off-on affair with a woman who eventually falls ill, goes into hospital and will only eat the Turkish delight her lover brings in. He had a furious row with his publishers, who tried to persuade him to substitute Latin terms for some of his sexual vocabulary. Wolkers stuck to his guns, pointing out that even the Bible contained explicit sexual references. Steamy sex or not, the book is now regarded as the best of its kind written in Dutch. In 1973 it was made into an Oscar-nominated film by the Dutch director Paul Verhoeven, starring Rutger Hauer and Monique van de Ven, held to be one of the best films ever made in Dutch. Wolkers moved in 1981 to the village of Westermient on the island of Texel, the largest and westernmost of the Dutch Frisian islands, with his third wife, Karina Gnirrep. Twin boys were born of this marriage, also in 1981. Wolkers sometimes showed some other Dutch characteristics apart from the frankness of his writing. He took the view that his talent should have been recognised earlier, so refused two of Holland&apos;s great literary prizes in the 1980s. In 1963 he received an award from the city of Amsterdam, but returned it three years later on grounds of excessive force used by the police in dealing with protests against the marriage of the future Queen Beatrix to a German diplomat, Claus von Amsberg. When some of his glass sculptures were vandalised, including the Auschwitz piece, Wolkers said he would use more steel in future, but went on using glass freely. \u00b7 Jan Hendrik Wolkers, sculptor and writer, born October 26 1925; died October 19 2007", "sentences": ["A work true to the spirit of the 1960s, it shocked a society that had not yet completed the transition from provincial conservatism to the libertarianism of modern Amsterdam (by no means shared by the whole of the rest of the country; and even Amsterdam now seems to be having second thoughts).", "He continued to work in glass, most notably for the monument to the victims of Auschwitz in Amsterdam.", "He spent time in Paris, the Hague, Amsterdam, Salzburg and elsewhere studying painting and sculpture, sometimes on scholarships and under leading artists.", "In 1963 he received an award from the city of Amsterdam, but returned it three years later on grounds of excessive force used by the police in dealing with protests against the marriage of the future Queen Beatrix to a German diplomat, Claus von Amsberg."], "title": "Obituary: Jan Wolkers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/nov/27/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries", "tags": ["Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-11-28T10:35:31Z", "article": "Breakfast, west London I was lucky enough to miss Geordie property developer David Abrahams&apos;s appearance on both Newsnight and the Today programme, though I have read the Paxo transcript in vain hope of enlightenment.

Labour MPs and officials I talk to describe Mr Abrahams in terms like &quot;a bit mad, but not bad&quot; and &quot;a flamboyant eccentric who has been looking for attention for years&quot;. One described talking him out of kidnapping a school bus 30 years ago - as a publicity stunt to highlight the shortage of school buses! None of which sheds much light on whether there is a criminal dimension to all this. I don&apos;t mean the use of surrogates to send his cheques to Hattie Harman and to Labour coffers. That was clearly in breach of Labour&apos;s own clean-up legislation in 2000, but merely sloppy - says me - unless a sinister motive (not a merely weird one) can be uncovered. It&apos;s a shambles, but remember no one has signed off on the EU&apos;s shambolic accounts for many years. At least the transparency rules Tony Blair introduced seem to be working to the extent that they shed light on all sorts of strange practices that went unchallenged for decades. But exotic bodies like the West Midlands Industrial Council still seem able to transmit donors&apos; cash to Tory candidates and funds without names being named. Memo to self: find time to check that one. One oddity is that a lot of people who knew Abrahams or knew about him didn&apos;t realise how much money he has. Today&apos;s Daily Mail, which asks &quot;So Can It Get Any Worse?&quot; (daft question: every new day is worse than yesterday in the Mail), also reports on &quot;Fantasy World of Labour&apos;s Dodgy Donor&quot; in greater detail than most. It&apos;s pretty weird and I suspect stems from something fundamental in Mr Abrahams&apos;s private life, not his public one. Not that using dodgy sources ever stopped the newspapers. Having a rich fantasy life is no bar to getting rich either. The two fantasies often go together. MEANWHILE, Radio 4 did find 30 seconds or so at 8.08 this morning to mention that the global economy might be about to hit a perfect storm as this summer&apos;s liquidity crisis matures into something worse and world trade starts to contract.  There&apos;s a lot of gloom around in the financial pages at present. If the gloomsters are right (for once) it will make this week&apos;s navel fluff about what Hattie said to David said to Hilary look less than critical to our survival on the planet. But hey, it&apos;s been a slow news week. LAST NIGHT I attended the Guardian&apos;s public service awards because I was on a judging panel. Old age has made me as wary of awards as I am of political scandals, but it turned out to be an enjoyable event. I sat next to an impassioned barrister called Quincy Whitaker. We discuss books (we have both just read and greatly admired King Leopold&apos;s Ghost, the scandalous story of the Belgian Congo), education and the perceived threat to civil liberties posed by the Labour government which - as the daughter of Hampstead&apos;s former Labour MP - she was raised to support. As so often in these conversations I am left feeling like a silly old fart for resisting the suggestion that the government&apos;s anti-terror legislation, plus GB&apos;s desire to extend 28 days pre-charge detention to 56, are cynically motivated to wrongfoot opposition parties which vote against them, should anything go wrong.  Quincy, who is present as a chum of fellow-judge, ex-MP Oonagh King, says it is now impossible for people like her to lecture other countries about the need to charge suspects rather than simply bang them up. As a country boy I take a lot of what north London lefties say with a pint of salt, but she is hugely impressive and likeable.  A graduate of Haverstock comprehensive school I ask her to guess how big she thinks my &quot;small Cornish grammar school&quot; was in the &apos;0s? Quincy says &quot;600&quot; - having mentally halved the size of her own school. Barely half that, I explain. &quot;I knew I&apos;d be wrong,&quot; she replies. Quincy&apos;s school history syllabus was set by the old ILEA, so it was pretty right-on. One teacher dismissed the Stock Exchange as &quot;gambling for toffs&quot;, but Quincy&apos;s class spotted that his passion for Lenin was full of authoritarian contradictions - so he educated them by default. Alan Johnson, our jack-the-lad health secretary, is the event&apos;s keynote speaker. He tells his well-polished joke about how being a postman prepares you for government: you get to open red boxes, you focus on delivery and every day you worry about what&apos;s in the Mail. The awards go to an impressive set of innovative practices in the public sector which often get little national recognition beyond the Guardian&apos;s Society section every Wednesday. Bulky Bob&apos;s refuse and recycling operation in Liverpool (which I helped to pick) has the most eye-catching title, though the most excited winners are the mostly black young staffers who run Lambeth council&apos;s peer mentor scheme to keep kids out of gangs and reoffending. After Quincy has left for an unspecified assignation Oonagh King tells me they are the nicest awards she has attended. &quot;It gives people a chance to feel like Angelina Jolie,&quot; she says, as the parade of winners receive their awards and compere Kirsty Wark shakes their hands. There is a slightly gawky girl-next-door side to Ms Wark, quite at odds with her TV tough guy image. It makes her more appealing. I ask Oonagh about the split between George Galloway (who beat her in Tower Hamlets) and his Muslim allies in Respect. She says it is hardly surprising, is it? THE GUARDIAN&apos;s much-loved sketchwriter of my youth, the late Norman Shrapnel, used to refuse to meet MPs because it might compromise his independent judgement. Actually this gentle, kindly man was notoriously shy, so his policy also served as a useful excuse. How times change. Nowadays some of the sketchwriters see themselves as political activists. The Indy&apos;s Simon Carr reports on his freedom of information applications, apparently designed to prove he was right all along about something or other.  At yesterday&apos;s No 10 presser the Mail&apos;s Quentin Letts could be heard showing Nick Robinsonand co how to do their job properly. Did Brown support Hattie Harman 100%, 90%, 20% or 10% - or did he just wish she would jump off a cliff, he asked gracefully. What would Norman, Colin Welch and other gentler shades have made of it. IT&apos;S AMAZING what you overhear. In an Amsterdam hotel the other morning some perfectly nice Middle Britons were discussing their weekend plans, which included shopping, boozing and eating, plus a trip to see the van Goghs. Then one upright 50-something chap started discussing his latest Dutch tattoo. &apos;&apos;It was pretty expensive; he charges 150 euros an hour.&apos;&apos;  Do you think the government should do something? Offer counselling ? Ban it - or even make tattos compulsory? Transparency laws would require us all - even David Abrahams and Hattie Harman - to register whatever design we have tucked away. On second thoughts, perhaps not. Lunchtime, Westminster Prime minister&apos;s question time has just produced two of the loudest cheers I can remember hearing, three if you count the laughter for Vince Cable&apos;s lethal joke about Gordon Brown &quot;being transformed from Stalin to Mr Bean&quot; in a matter of weeks. Tory MPs roared when David Cameron reached his peroration about Brown - &apos;&apos;Is this man not cut out for the job?&apos;&apos; - and Labour rallied equally noisily when their own leader rattled off Labour&apos;s record of stability in contrast to the Tories&apos; self-inflicted sterling crisis of 1992. Dave was standing behind Norman Lamont in the photo. I again thought that Brown is starting to find his feet. He stuck to the line that he had acted to restore the integrity of his party&apos;s funding as soon as he learned of David Abrahams&apos;s third-party donations. He defended Jon Mendelsohn, the new man, in charge of the cash since only September 3. There&apos;s still no killer fact to keep the story going, though that won&apos;t stop the World at One, which loves this sort of &apos;&apos;mounting pressure&apos;&apos; stuff. Labour MPs piled in with dull-but-worthy questions about real life, to demonstrate business-as-usual. Opposition MPs piled in to do the opposite. Which version most impresses any viewers who might be watching? You tell me. Only right at the end did Ken Purchase, an old Labour sweat who used to be Robin Cook&apos;s bagman, get one important ball back over the net when he urged a wider inquiry - plus &quot;four or five Panorama programmes&quot; - which will also &quot;audit the trail of the [Michael] Ashcroft money.&quot; What is striking week after week is how well Acting Leader Cable does. Have the Lib Dems put the wrong two candidates in the frame, too young and inexperienced, while the man best equipped to be party leader stares them in the face, old and bald though he is? Week after week Cable shows unerring instinct and huge self-confidence, exactly what Ming never did.  Meanwhile Chris Huhne, the leadership underdog, is doing what underdogs must: drawing attention to himself. He wrote to the Met chief, Ian Blair, asking the boys in blue to step in. Another job for Mr Yates? Footnote: Tory knights Patrick Cormack and Peter Tapsell are often mocked for being pompous and self-important by younger MPs who contribute far less to parliamentary politics than either of them.  Tapsell&apos;s question to Brown at PMQs today was a turkey. But Cormack delivered a good-natured ball despite the jeers. &quot;What [jeers]... what [jeers]... what does the prime minister want for Christmas?&apos;&apos; Brown coped. He smiled.

But if that suggests a solipsistic, navel-gazing singer, that&apos;s not how the 29-year-old Cape Verdean singer sees herself. While her music is languid and introspective, the songs have moral depths - she wants young people who hear her music &quot;to catch the train of responsibility and the train of consciousness: be active&quot;. She talks of feeling a deep sense of responsibility towards Lusophone youth, and her performance shows why she has become a cultural figurehead for the isolated islands off the coast of west Africa. Tavares was actually raised in Lisbon. Her parents had arrived there from Cape Verde in the mid-1970s. They were part of the wave of immigration from Portugal&apos;s former African colonies that followed the fall of the Salazar dictatorship to fill jobs in the country&apos;s construction and tourism industries. She&apos;s part of the very audience that is so proud of her: the Cape Verde diaspora (there are more people of Cape Verdean descent in Boston alone, for example, than there are in the 10 islands that make up the little republic). She says of the country: &quot;It&apos;s like the womb of my family. Sometimes I feel like I&apos;m home, then I get homesick for Lisbon. But as a young Portuguese person growing up there without any real reference to my own culture or history, it&apos;s cool for me to go there and hang out with older musicians.&quot; Her childhood, she says, was &quot;unfortunate and lonely&quot;. Her father left the family and moved to the US, while her mother took their youngest children to the south of Portugal, leaving Sara in the care of an old Portuguese woman. &quot;But it was my fortune, too,&quot; she says, &quot;because my life was more constant than my brothers&apos; and sisters&apos;. I had an older, churchgoing woman caring for me, giving me a structure that shaped me.&quot; Her family history seems to inform the mournful choruses of her ballad Guisa (Lament) - &quot;Guisa di Mama, Guisa di Papa&quot;. She was, she says, &quot;a very serious child - going to church, looking after myself&quot;. She loved football, and she loved music. The great soul singer Donny Hathaway was a favourite, along with Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin. Their songs led her to learn English. &quot;I wanted to know every word they sang, because that music is all about the heart,&quot; she explains. Mostly she sang gospel, launching the first Portuguese gospel choir, with people from Portugal&apos;s African community - &quot;That&apos;s when I fell in love with the idea of making a living out of music.&quot; Her first steps in that direction came with victory in a Portuguese TV talent contest, the prize being a recording contract with BMG, which led to her being the Portuguese entry in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest with the song Chamar a M\u00fasica. That wasn&apos;t the route she wanted to follow, but, she concedes, it gave her a start. She has talked before of Cape Verde being a &quot;metisse culture&quot;, in which different traditions and languages are mixed together. That&apos;s the case with her music, too, which is rich with multilingual slang - Portuguese, Creole, Angolan. She reckons the slang helps her connect with younger people, but she also sees its linguistic significance. &quot;I think anthropologists will study the slang because it speaks a lot about our social evolution and the identity of cities,&quot; she says. But while Tavares might be singing to young people, are they listening? She thinks for a moment, then quotes a line from her song Poka Terra, itself borrowed from an Angolan reggae band in Lisbon: &quot;An alligator that sleeps will be turned into an alligator bag on sale in some store.&quot; But if Tavares believes she has to help inform young people, she&apos;s more ambivalent about being cast as any kind of spokeswoman for her sex. Though one of her songs, Muna Xeia (Full Moon) explores the sensibilities of women, she shies away from the suggestion that it might have a feminist message. &quot;No-oo!&quot; she says. &quot;I do see the reason for the feminist revolution, but some girls don&apos;t want to be responsible, they just want to be Barbies. I look at singers who always want to be up in front, acting beautiful, but I don&apos;t know too many girls who are into staying at home for hours, like Joni Mitchell, working out their poetry or their instrument.&quot; So how do the young women who want to act beautiful view this dreadlocked singer, who clearly doesn&apos;t have a thought of emulating Jennifer Lopez? She says her peers are rejecting hair, getting it straightened like Beyonc\u00e9&apos;s. &quot;My message is obviously about loving what you are. As for the way I dress, they&apos;re like, &apos;You&apos;re a bit freaky, but we like you anyway.&apos;&quot; Later on she is sitting on the stage, under dim light, plucking rippling melodies from a small thumb piano.

We felt very very hot on the plane to Zurich and were told that the air conditioning had broken down. Never mind.  We caught the train easily to take us to Interlaken, but after half an hour it ground to a halt. We waited for ages listening to various announcements from the guard, only to be told finally to collect our suitcases and get out on to the track and walk to the next station.  We stumbled along with our wheelie cases - not much use on a railway track - and caught a bus to Berne. Thousands of people were stranded like us as we were told that the whole Swiss railway system had had a power cut.  Luckily we found the only free taxi in the town and it took the four of us, squashed in, to Interlaken for \u00a3120. The holiday was brilliant after that with sunshine all the way, pleasant walking and train journeys to Zermatt and Davos.  Quite relaxed about the journey home (after all, lightning never strikes twice) we happily caught the train back to Zurich Airport. There was a two-hour delay, but we boarded the plane and set off. After half an hour the captain announced that we were going back as the aircraft would not pressurise. So that&apos;s what it was - we had felt very peculiar.  We had to queue for two hours in the airport to get our cases back, then pick up tickets for the following morning. At midnight we were taken to a hotel and given a magnificent meal, all one hundred of us, before finally being allocated rooms. Ours had a single bed. I spent the night on the floor. The flight back to Amsterdam the following morning was fine but when we were due to board the next plane were told it had a fault, but another had been found and would only delay us by half an hour.

On Thursday afternoon, however, Brown was given just one minute&apos;s notice before Sky News reported that he was to become only the second sitting British Prime Minister to be subject to a police investigation. The grim news was delivered by aides to Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, the Cabinet Secretary. Barely six months after Tony Blair had left Downing Street under the cloud of a police probe into the cash for honours affair, Brown was told that he, too, would be subject to the relentless scrutiny of Scotland Yard. The announcement marked the lowest point of Brown&apos;s bleakest week in Downing Street after the disclosure that Labour had broken party funding laws. To the consternation of ministers, who thought the sleaze of the Blair era would be ended by the arrival of the super-serious son of the Scottish manse, Brown had to admit that Labour had erred once again by accepting donations from a millionaire property developer who went to extraordinary lengths to protect his identity. &apos;The money was not lawfully declared, so it will be returned,&apos; a gloomy Prime Minister said at his monthly Downing Street press conference on Tuesday after the disclosure that Labour had benefited to the tune of more than \u00a3600,000 from a bizarre funding scheme arranged by David Abrahams, an eccentric tycoon. The money was channelled to Labour over four years via four people: two Abrahams employees of modest means, the Tory-supporting wife of another employee and his solicitor. &apos;How big Labour backer is a jobbing builder who knows NOTHING about his \u00a3200,000 donation,&apos; explained the headline in last weekend&apos;s Mail on Sunday. This ran next to a picture of Ray Ruddick, a builder who managed to become Labour&apos;s third largest donor despite living in a council house. It has been a week of extraordinary revelations which summoned the ghosts of Labour&apos;s past funding rows; a week when the general secretary of the party resigned; a week that briefly placed the Prime Minister&apos;s camp at odds with his deputy; and a week that ended with Wendy Alexander, a key Brown ally who leads Labour in the Scottish Parliament, fighting for her political life after falling foul of donation rules. As he tried to regain the initiative yesterday by pledging his support for a radical reform of party funding, Brown knows he is presiding over a party which has sunk to its lowest levels since the ascendancy of Margaret Thatcher. A poll in Friday&apos;s Daily Telegraph gave the Conservatives an 11-point lead, their largest lead over Labour since 1988 - a year after Thatcher&apos;s third landslide election victory. Ministers have been left spluttering as they worked out how Brown had managed to throw away an apparently unassailable poll lead over the summer. The rigid discipline of New Labour, which ensured that the party achieved a rare handover of power in June without a shot being fired, appears now distinctly shaky as ministers bicker and supporters of the PM point the finger of blame at the ancien regime for landing them in such a mess. &apos;It&apos;s all over, we&apos;re fucked,&apos; one senior Labour MP said. &apos;It&apos;s just a case of limping to defeat at the next election.&apos; Cabinet ministers believe that such views are massively overblown and that Brown can recover. Nevertheless, any sense of complacency lingering from the summer evaporated last week as they watched a supremely confident David Cameron taunt Brown by asking: &apos;Is this man simply not cut out for the job?&apos; The Tory leader had reason to be pleased with himself: Labour had fallen victim to the sort of tactics Brown deployed against the Tories with such damning results a decade ago. Operation Under the Water, the informal name given to a Tory campaign to identify controversial Labour donors, could leave Brown right there. Under the water. On an unseasonably hot, late autumn day, Brown had a lot on his mind as he stood to attention in a dark suit and mauve tie on Horse Guards Parade for one of the most colourful ceremonies staged by the British establishment. As he waited alongside the Queen on the morning of Tuesday, 30 October, to welcome King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia on a state visit to Britain, Brown knew that a year of cross-party negotiations on party funding would come to an end later that day. He had no idea this would set in process a series of events that would lead to a police investigation on donations. Hours after the welcoming ceremony, one of Whitehall&apos;s silkiest operators finally pulled the plug on the talks after they reached deadlock on trade union funding. A last-ditch meeting, chaired by the retired official Sir Hayden Phillips in the bowels of the Palace of Westminster, had failed to find a meeting of minds. Jack Straw, the Justice Secretary, who had been Labour&apos;s lead negotiator in the talks, had a few brief words with his Tory counterpart, the shadow cabinet office minister Francis Maude, before they headed their separate ways. The Tory response to the collapse of the talks was clear: expose Labour&apos;s dodgy donors and their donations. Operation Under the Water was under way. From his desk at Tory HQ, a young researcher, Richard Hardyment, filed a request under the freedom of information laws to the Highways Agency. Nothing in his request indicated initially that Her Majesty&apos;s Loyal Opposition was sniffing for a scandal. Hardyment left a mobile number and a Google mail address on the request form. But his questions showed that this was no fishing expedition. Would the Highways Agency, Hardyment asked, provide him with details of all its correspondence with Durham Green Developments about its recent planning application for a development near junction 61 of the A1? An innocent enough request, it seemed to officials, until they later realised this was the controversial planning application by David Abrahams. Durham Green Developments is registered at his Gosforth home. There was more which showed that Hardyment, a young Cambridge graduate, had an eagle eye. In addition to asking for the Highways Agency&apos;s letters, he also asked for correspondence with &apos;persons acting on behalf of Durham Green Developments including but not exclusively Raymond Ruddick and Janet Kidd&apos;. They were the company&apos;s sole directors. But more importantly Ruddick and Kidd were the two employees used by Abrahams to funnel donations to the Labour Party. A month before the Mail on Sunday revealed their names, the Conservatives were on to the case. Now Brown is struggling to regain the political initiative. A testing weekend at the Commonwealth Heads of Government summit in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, where guests struggled with basic hotel facilities, ended on a sour note for Brown. As he left a dinner hosted by the Prince of Wales, the Prime Minister was told that a story was breaking back home that a millionaire had been hiding donations to Labour. Multi-millionaire Tory donor Lord Ashcroft was also attending the summit as a guest of the Belize government. With an early flight back to London the next day, the prime ministerial party was not kept up to date with every detail of the news back home. Brown was not told that Peter Watt, the general secretary of the Labour Party, had released a statement saying there had been no breach of the rules after he approved the Abrahams donations. Watt resigned two days later when he discovered that the donations were unlawful. Straw, one of the &apos;greybeards&apos; of the government who introduced the funding legislation which has given Labour such grief, knew the party was in trouble. As he prepared to go on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 the next morning, a dumbfounded Straw told staff: &apos;This can&apos;t be right. How on earth did we ever agree to this?&apos; A swirling mess was developing through the morning on Sunday. As Straw made clear his horror at the hidden donations, Harriet Harman, the party&apos;s Deputy Leader and a cabinet minister, was said to be &apos;spitting tacks&apos; that she had accepted a donation from Janet Kidd for her deputy leadership campaign. Why was she not told that there could be problems with the donation? Brown touched down at Heathrow at 4.30pm on Sunday to be told that matters had worsened. Watt was consulting lawyers to discover whether he had breached electoral law. &apos;What was Peter thinking?&apos; the Prime Minister asked. &apos;How long has this been going on?&apos; A planned relaunch speech by Brown the next day, in which he would spell out his plans for welfare reform to the CBI, was drowned out by the funding furore. As he returned to Downing Street, Brown was told that Watt had received clear legal advice: he had breached the law. Watt started drafting his resignation statement, to the horror of his colleagues who knew he was experiencing a difficult time in his personal life. The former nurse lost his father four months ago and his wife is in the late stages of pregnancy. The couple foster disabled children. Ministers who filed into Downing Street in sombre mood for the weekly cabinet meeting the following morning were expecting a discussion about what they thought would be Labour&apos;s low point: the loss of the details of half the population on two CDs the week before. They covered this ground but an impromptu discussion was soon held about the funding row. Brown was asked almost immediately whether the disputed \u00a3650,000 would have to be returned, a move that would make it all but impossible to guarantee the wages of Labour staff. Brown was in no doubt: he told colleagues that the money was &apos;tainted&apos; and it would have to be returned, a decision he announced at his press conference a few hours later. The sight of Brown experiencing such obvious political pain in front of the cameras - it was only at the seventh attempt that journalists wrung from him a clear statement of support for Harman - gave Cameron all the material he needed for their weekly encounter the next day at Prime Minister&apos;s Questions. He was ready with a simple message: that the man who sold himself as solid and competent had lost his grip. To loud cheers on his benches, Cameron said: &apos;The Prime Minister&apos;s excuses go from incompetence to complacency and there are questions about his integrity. Are not people rightly asking, &quot;Is this man simply not cut out for the job&quot;?&apos; Cameron showed the dexterity which is delighting Tories when he was able to cope with a bit of sharp practice by Labour. At 11.57am, three minutes before the start of the question session, Jon Mendelsohn, Labour&apos;s chief fundraiser, put out a statement saying that he had known about the unconventional fundraising arrangements since the end of September. Cameron was able to strike home when he asked how Mendelsohn could still be in place when he had known about the arrangements for a month. The Brown camp knew it was experiencing nothing short of a dreadful week. A particularly dangerous moment came when Harman appeared to declare war on the Brown camp. Her team blamed Chris Leslie, Brown&apos;s leadership campaign manager, for suggesting that she approach one of the Abrahams front people for a donation to help clear the debts from her deputy leadership campaign. The Brown camp was relaxed about the outburst; it was widely seen as a move to pacify Harman&apos;s husband, the trade unionist Jack Dromey, who is supposed to be Labour&apos;s treasurer. He was once again left in the dark about funding arrangements and was said to be on the warpath. If the Tories had set in motion the showdown over funding, it was left to the Liberal Democrats to deliver the most wounding jibe of the week. Vince Cable, the Lib Dems&apos; acting leader, prompted gales of laughter in the Commons when he said: &apos;The House has noticed the Prime Minister&apos;s remarkable transformation in the past few weeks from Stalin to Mr Bean.&apos; Cable encapsulated in a hilarious image how Brown had fallen from the ultimate control freak to a hapless creature unable to control events. The final stage in this journey was completed with the help of a loner who would himself not look out of place in the world of Rowan Atkinson&apos;s most famous creation. The neighbouring houses in a suburb of Newcastle are hardly the sort of places you expect to find a millionaire Labour bankroller. A tiny shed containing a couple of old refrigerators sits in what was once the front garden of two properties knocked together. A wheelie bin full of building rubbish and an old newspaper dated 2 October are the only indication that anybody has been to the property recently. The red-brick house, which has a cheap, plywood front door, is probably the scruffiest in the road, much to the annoyance of neighbours who claim it has been little more than a building site for months. It is here that Abrahams, who also has a \u00a31m flat in north London, calls home. The man who likes to paint himself in the press as a reclusive &apos;serial philanthropist&apos;, cuts a strange figure. Sometimes Abrahams, who also calls himself David Martin, gives his age as 53. Official records show that he was born in 1944, making him 63. He speaks in whispered tones and sounds genuinely naive, almost child-like. One former minister who regularly encountered him described him as &apos;creepy&apos;. &apos;When I saw him on the television my heart sank; I had bumped into him loads of times and he unnerved me,&apos; he said. At first glance Abrahams does not appear to be have the sort of wealth necessary to make the lion&apos;s share of a million pounds-worth of donations to Labour. His battered Volvo outside his Newcastle house - inside which an illuminated Elvis figurine resides - is hardly a signifier of a high-roller, someone given a front row seat when Tony Blair made his valedictory speech at Trimdon Labour club in June. Accounts filed at Companies House show that most of his business ventures are dormant. The tiny offices of accountant Robert Miller &amp; Co in the village of Cleadon act as the modest business address of Abrahams&apos;s empire. But closer analysis suggests that Abrahams is an extremely wealthy man who owns scores, possibly hundreds, of properties around the north east, many of which he inherited from his father, Bennie Abrahams, the former Lord Mayor of Newcastle. Last year alone Abrahams sold several properties at Hazel Court in Haswell, near Durham. The development consists of nine flats and 12 two-bedroom terraced homes. Two are currently on sale for \u00a3120,000 each. Despite his claims that he is shy - the reason he has given for not making the donations in his own name - Abrahams courts publicity. He has been active in the Fabian Society in the north east, pensioners&apos; rights groups, the Alzheimer&apos;s Society and prisoner support organisations and for many years was a staunch supporter of Labour Friends of Israel. He is also fond of writing to local papers denouncing the Conservative years. This year he gave hundreds of thousands of pounds to endow a chair in Middle East politics at Warwick University. Given his father&apos;s political background - and the fact his mother Marion was also a Labour councillor in Newcastle - it was perhaps inevitable that Abrahams, an only son, would also try his hand at politics. A stint as a Labour councillor in the north east in the Seventies ended when he lost his seat. One local politician who knew him at the time and is now a major player in the Labour Party said that he was a liability. &apos;If I had known we were taking his money, I would have warned the party to be very careful,&apos; the person said. Despite the reservations about his political acumen, Abrahams attempted to stand for Parliament. An attempt to contest the seat of Richmond in Yorkshire in 1990 for Labour ended in ignominy when Abrahams presented a woman, Anthea Bailey, as his wife in an attempt to woo the selectors. It turned out that Abrahams had paid her to pose as his wife and had promised to put her son through private school if she kept up the pretence. The Richmond debacle was just one of a bizarre string of events that have peppered Abrahams&apos;s life. Once, the man who liked to speak out on the plight of the homeless found himself in court facing a charge of evicting someone illegally. The case was dropped. Another time Abrahams ended up travelling to Amsterdam after being taken in by the infamous conman, Joe Flynn, who convinced him he was a private investigator with evidence that Richmond Labour party was bugging him. While his political career faltered, Abrahams&apos; property empire took off as he moved on from building homes and flats to developing business parks, something that gave him greater financial firepower. His latest venture, a new business park in Durham that promises to bring 5,000 jobs into the region, caught the attention of Hardyment, the young Tory researcher. The Highways Agency had blocked the scheme for years. And then, last year, Abrahams received the green light. Locals were perplexed. &apos;Originally they were worried it would create congestion,&apos; said Denis Jackson, chair of Durham Liberal Democrats. &apos;I can&apos;t see what changed to alter their view.&apos; The government has categorically denied there is any linkage between the hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations Abrahams has given to Labour and its shift in position. But it was the sort of negative publicity Labour struggled to fight off. Outside the tight circle of north east Labour politics, Abrahams is a less well known figure on the political circuit in London. But he was persistent, as ministers who have been badgered by Abrahams at endless party functions can testify. At many of these events Abrahams came into contact with Jon Mendelsohn, a fellow leading light in the Labour Friends of Israel, who is now Labour&apos;s chief fundraiser. It was at Labour Friends of Israel that Mendelsohn and Abrahams fell out spectacularly. Some suggest it was an ideological clash - with Abrahams keen to reach out to a number of controversial Palestinian groups, an approach with which Mendelsohn disagreed. Others say it was simply a clash of personalities. &apos;Abrahams was very old Labour compared with Mendelsohn&apos;s more polished Islington style,&apos; recalls one LFI member. The collapse in relations explains why Abrahams is now so determined to criticise Labour after the party -- in his eyes -- turned on him this week. To help his battle Abrahams last week hired a former Conservative spin doctor, Martin Minns, to settle a few scores. Minns&apos;s new work could be seen yesterday when Abrahams wrote an article for the Guardian in which he blamed Labour for failing to check the rules on donations. He goes on the offensive again today in the Independent on Sunday, claiming that Mendelsohn voiced support for his anonymous system of donations in April, five months before his appointment as Labour&apos;s fundraiser. Mendelsohn, who categorically denies this, will find himself in the spotlight after Abrahams confirmed that he remains in his sights. A self-proclaimed &apos;ethical lobbyist&apos;, Mendelsohn is a choice target for Labour&apos;s opponents. A multi-millionaire thanks to the \u00a310m sale of his lobbying company, LLM, he was appointed as Labour&apos;s chief fundraiser in September. Mendelsohn first rose to national prominence when he was exposed by The Observer in 1997 as one of a small cadre of lobbyists who boasted of their access to the New Labour hierarchy. As one of the best connected men in London - his wife Nicola is a good friend of Brown&apos;s wife, Sarah - Mendelsohn has a contacts book to die for. Brown is standing by his fundraiser who has won plaudits in Downing Street for trawling through Labour&apos;s donors to check for skeletons. Number 10 insists that he was acting to challenge the Abrahams donations inherited from the Blair era. Aides believe that Brown avoided meltdown last week, and set the course for a revival by ordering that all damaging information should be put into the public domain. There will be no drip-drip revelations and no tussle with the police, as there was under Blair, they say. The Tories believe that they have scented blood, but senior party figures are being cautious. One shadow cabinet member told The Observer: &apos;The scale of what has happened is going to do lasting damage to Gordon Brown and the Labour Party. But this has not provided the Tory party with an express train to victory at the next election. We have a long way to go and must not be complacent.&apos;", "sentences": ["Another time Abrahams ended up travelling to Amsterdam after being taken in by the infamous conman, Joe Flynn, who convinced him he was a private investigator with evidence that Richmond Labour party was bugging him."], "title": "Focus: Labour's dangerous donor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/dec/02/uk.partyfunding", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "Party funding", "Labour"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-12-02T14:00:00Z", "article": "Belgium and the Netherlands, two founding members of the European Union, are increasingly divided about what that project now means. The EU&apos;s reform treaty is now the focus of that dispute, but its roots go deeper. At one point, according to press reports, the row became so serious that the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, had to intervene. Europe cannot afford a dogfight between these two founding member states, so it&apos;s high time to put emotions aside and review their differences on the future course of European integration. As a former Dutch state secretary for European affairs and Benelux coordinator, I believe that the Netherlands and Belgium can once again play complementary roles. From the very beginning, these countries have represented the different aspects of Europe&apos;s identity: Belgium, as an industrial country, continentally oriented, bilingual, and an intermediary with southern Europe, and the Netherlands with its strong agricultural and trading tradition and its Anglo-Saxon and Atlantic orientation. Of the two, Belgium tends to be more uncritically supportive of the EU. Polls show that more than 80% of Belgians want yet more integration, whereas roughly 50% of the Dutch describe themselves as Eurosceptics. They value the union for its economic benefits, but are wary of its politics. Belgian-Dutch cooperation has in years past been essential in helping Europe to move forward. The Benelux Economic Union treaty of 1944 was an early testing ground for the Europe of the Six, and it was the joint Benelux Memorandum, fathered by the far-sighted JW Beyen and presented in Messina in 1955, that gave the impetus to the creation of the common market. Indeed, it was the basis on which the Belgian foreign minister, Paul-Henri Spaak, and his colleagues worked when setting the scene for the treaty of Rome and the EEC. The Spaak committee devised a system that balanced the voting power of states of varying size. Clearly, a system of one vote per member state would have meant domination by Europe&apos;s smaller states. Conversely, a system based on population would have gone too far in favouring the big ones. Balance was achieved partly by a system of weighting of votes in the council of ministers, where most decisions are taken. With each enlargement of the union, this system of decision-making has been largely maintained. The equilibrium in voting rights between small and large member states was also secured by vesting exclusive authority to propose regulation in the commission, which expresses the common interests of the community. This authority was reinforced by requiring unanimity among member states to overrule the commission - a provision that has strengthened the smaller states against the larger ones. As open economies, Belgium and the Netherlands have both been interested in developing the internal market, while differing in their methods. Belgium followed the mainly French monetarist school, while the Netherlands shared Germany&apos;s preference for economic convergence before committing to exchange-rate parity. Once President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d&apos;Estaing and Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt made the joint Franco German proposal for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) (pdf), both Belgium and the Netherlands worked together to achieve that common goal. Along with Luxembourg, they were an important factor in creating EMU. In 1991, when the Netherlands held the European presidency, Belgium supported its far-reaching draft for a treaty of European Union. The Dutch proposed bringing all European decision-making (on economy, foreign policy, justice, and home affairs) into a single framework. The proposal turned out to be a step too far and subsequently went down in Dutch history as &quot;black Monday&quot;, named (pdf) after the day on which the then foreign minister, Hans Van den Broek, faced near-unanimous opposition in the European council of ministers. Belgium, though, was the one member state that supported the Dutch in this brave venture. But the Belgians and Dutch have also been less than cooperative at times. When it came to voting rights in the European parliament and in the council, the Dutch fought doggedly to get one extra vote in Amsterdam in 1991 and another in Nice in 2000. This may have satisfied nationalist feelings in the Netherlands, as the country is 1.5 times the size of Belgium, but it did not go down well in Belgium. The two countries also found themselves in opposing camps over the war in Iraq, and, of course, in their attitudes about further political integration. The Netherlands&apos; current reserved stance on further political integration is not in its broader interest. But Belgium could have shown greater understanding for the Netherlands&apos; position after Dutch voters decisively rejected the proposed European constitution in the mid-2005 referendum. Belgium and the Netherlands need to resuscitate their cooperative efforts within the Benelux framework. The Benelux economy is the EU&apos;s fourth largest. Belgium will be serving on the United Nations security council for the next two years, and has indicated that it wants to give its mandate a European dimension. The coming period could thus be used in both countries to review traditional positions and reflect on how European policy can best serve their common needs. Traditionally, the Netherlands has thought of itself as the smallest of the EU&apos;s large member states. But others generally see it as the largest of the small. Accepting this view could have a healthy impact on its behaviour in the EU. After all, the three largest EU states - Germany, Britain, and France - can be expected to seek agreements among themselves about the Union&apos;s future shape, so the Benelux countries&apos; common goal should be to influence their actions and ensure that their thinking is acceptable to the whole community.

Her friends included such writers as Mary McCarthy, Elizabeth Bishop and Philip Roth, as well as influential figures in the publishing world such as Philip Rahv and Jason Epstein. Hardwick came to New York from the hinterlands. She was born into a large family in Kentucky, a southern border state that tends to produce literary sensibilities very different from those that flourish in the deep south. Her father was a left-leaning blue-collar worker who ran a plumbing and heating business. No doubt it contributed to her alienation from the mint julep school of southern writing that she was a city girl, from Lexington. After graduating from the University of Kentucky and taking an MA in English, Hardwick moved to New York, where she studied briefly at Columbia University and set up as a freelance writer. In these years, the early 1940s, she also wrote her first novel, The Ghostly Lover (1945), which traces the sentimental education of a young woman from her 16th year to her departure from home to head north. This novel, uneven as it is, deserves more attention than it has received. It paints a portrait of a young woman inhibited from striking out on her own because she feels that her parents, especially her mother, need her to play mother to them. It brought her to the attention of Rahv, the editor at Partisan Review who had 10 years earlier helped launch the career of McCarthy. As in the case of McCarthy, Hardwick had initially attracted attention by way of her acerbic reviews in Partisan. In 1946 Hardwick met Lowell at a party in Greenwich Village. They met again at Yaddo, the writers&apos; colony in upstate New York, and married in 1949. Lowell was generally regarded as the most gifted English language poet of his generation. However, he was also already launched on a lifetime of manic depression. Shortly after meeting Hardwick, he passed through a violently psychotic phase that led to him being given shock treatment in hospital. During their honeymoon, Lowell entered the depressive aftermath of his manic episode and was confined again. Such behaviour would occur nearly every year for the rest of Hardwick&apos;s life with him. There were good times, too. The couple had a daughter, Harriet, their only child, who survives her, when Hardwick was 40. And they travelled a great deal - to the mid-west, where Lowell taught at the University of Iowa and Hardwick attended a murder trial that became the focus of her second novel, The Simple Truth (1955); to Florence and Amsterdam for extended stays; to Boston, the city of Lowell&apos;s blue-blood parents; and to Maine, where they often spent the summer. Many of the best essays in Hardwick&apos;s four collections are about places. In 1960, they returned to New York and settled in an apartment on West 67th Street where Hardwick lived until her death. After 1963, when Hardwick founded the New York Review of Books with Epstein and his wife Barbara, who died last year, and a few others, she no longer had to worry about where to place her work. Soon, other writers, especially women, would be celebrating her dry, lean, often cryptic essays. Cynthia Ozick considered Hardwick to be America&apos;s most significant literary essayist; writers as different as Joan Didion, Susan Sontag and Roth agreed in praising her unusual prose style; and Isaiah Berlin spoke of her as the most intelligent woman he had known. All of these figures, apart from the novelist Ozick, were themselves associated with the New York Review of Books, a publication remarkable for chumminess and logrolling as well as for the talent of its mostly Anglo-American contributors. In the case of Hardwick, the encomia may have been a response to her public conduct as well as to her literary achievement. For the price of her marriage to Lowell was a high one. Hardwick met her fate with considerable dignity and a minimum of self-pity. In 1970 Lowell left her for a new life in London with the British writer Caroline Blackwood. The public humiliation of abandonment was multiplied by a violation of trust. Suffering with his own guilt, Lowell published poems in which he transcribed parts of telephone conversations and letters that revealed Hardwick&apos;s anguish and desire to have her husband back. These poems appear in Lowell&apos;s collection The Dolphin (1973). Moreover, between 1970 and 1977, even after Lowell had divorced Hardwick, married Blackwood and had a son by his new wife, Lowell compounded the injury he had done by frantic shuffling between England and America, unable to decide which woman he wanted and needed. Hardwick was severely tested by Lowell&apos;s instability in these years. She continued to go out into society, often with gay men, who had been frequent companions before she married. She also taught writing, retiring in 1985. Her last review, for the New York Review of Books, was in 2003: more than 4,500 words on Nathanael West. Her biography of Herman Melville was published in 2000. But in general she found her chief consolation in her memories and in her own work, producing Sleepless Nights and Seduction and Betrayal, Women and Literature (1974). The large theme of the latter, and perhaps the great theme of Hardwick&apos;s writing about women in general, is the pathos of women&apos;s lives insofar as they are inevitably &quot;the second sex&quot;, not for the social-political reasons Simone de Beauvoir had proposed, but simply on account of the greater willpower, energy and physical strength of men. There were certain parallels between Thomas Carlyle&apos;s high-handed treatment of his wife Jane, about which she writes, and Lowell&apos;s treatment of Lizzie. Hardwick dealt with what she saw as an inevitable condition by making personal loyalty her own highest value. Moreover, before Lowell left her, she had accepted the burden of looking after the deeply disturbed poet by putting her own writing on the back burner. And in her writing she praised women, such as her own mother, who accepted their lives without thinking very much about whys and wherefores. These women - waitresses, cleaners, shop assistants - Hardwick honoured for doing the world&apos;s work, usually without much in return from their menfolk. Hardwick maintained her dignity, withstanding the temptation of public displays of rage and exposure of the wrongs done to her. Lowell was not wholly unaware of her suffering, to judge from the soliloquy he gives the terrified wife in his poem from the 1950s, To Speak of Woe that is in Marriage. It may seem to confirm Hardwick&apos;s ultimately despairing sense of the way things were that although Lowell returned to her, in 1977, he died in a taxi on the way from the airport to their apartment later that year. \u00b7 Elizabeth Bruce Hardwick, writer, born July 27 1916; died December 2 2007 \u00b7 This obituary has been revised since the death of the writer in 2003", "sentences": ["And they travelled a great deal - to the mid-west, where Lowell taught at the University of Iowa and Hardwick attended a murder trial that became the focus of her second novel, The Simple Truth (1955); to Florence and Amsterdam for extended stays; to Boston, the city of Lowell&apos;s blue-blood parents; and to Maine, where they often spent the summer."], "title": "Obituary: Elizabeth Hardwick", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/dec/06/guardianobituaries.usa", "tags": ["US news", "World news", "Books", "Culture", "New York", "Elizabeth Hardwick"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-12-06T11:05:00Z", "article": "Lufthansa, the German flagship airline, today left the way clear for Air France-KLM to take over ailing Italian rival Alitalia after pulling out of the race at the last minute.

There&apos;s that name, for a start. There&apos;s the fact that they have a song about goats. There&apos;s their occasional habit of performing in drag. There&apos;s the general air of farce about them, typified by the cartoonish humour in plenty of their songs. There&apos;s their on-stage banter, consisting of random facts (saltwater fish have sex differently from freshwater fish, apparently). And there&apos;s the fact that they are often compared to another bunch of indie comics, Half Man Half Biscuit. &quot;We didn&apos;t set out to make the most ridiculous thing ever,&quot; says drummer Dan Haggis. &quot;But it all changes once we get a hangover inside of us. If you can make people laugh then it&apos;s great.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think many bands have toured as hard as we have this year. And when you have, you will realise there are parts when you just lose your mind,&quot; adds singer/guitarist Matthew Murphy. &quot;I&apos;m sure there are other bands who do that,&quot; counters Haggis. &quot;But I don&apos;t think there are many others who share a love for the surreal.&quot; Actually, the Wombats aren&apos;t as zany as you might fear. Catch them playing live, and you&apos;ll be taken by surprise. Underneath the humour is a taut and powerful guitar pop group, whose use of humour is often blacker than expected - witness the recent hit Let&apos;s Dance to Joy Division. But the humour is important: it&apos;s what brought them together in the first place. In 2003, Murphy and Haggis were students at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, where they met bassist Tord Overland Knudsen and discovered a mutual love of lyrics about animals. &quot;We wrote this song about a goat,&quot; says Haggis. &quot;We were walking down the high street hung over one day when we passed this art shop with a picture of a goat. It was painted to look like Prince Charles. They also had another one of Britney as a sheep.&quot; The trio started playing gigs to raise enough money to buy the sheep painting. &quot;It was quite hard to do,&quot; says Murphy. &quot;The gigs were terrible. We even did one at the Cavern but our songs were just so stupid. Charles the Goat turned into this epic prog-rap about this goat who was an alcoholic - it was just bad.&quot; But if it started as a joke, it soon became serious. In 2007, the Wombats have released their debut album (strictly, it was their second - they put out a hastily cobbled- together album in Japan earlier in the year), had two top 40 singles, and played 260 gigs (they became the first band to sell out the 1,200-capacity Liverpool Academy without a record deal). &quot;It has been amazing, but it still doesn&apos;t feel like anything has changed because we haven&apos;t really had time to stop and smell the roses, as it were, or reflect over how hard we&apos;ve worked,&quot; says Murphy. &quot;I still feel there is more to do.&quot; &quot;I reckon when Christmas comes and we finally get time off, we&apos;ll probably just ring each other after two weeks and go, &apos;Oh my God - what&apos;s happened over the past year?&apos;&quot; says Haggis. &quot;But it feels good. It feels like things are definitely heading in the right direction.&quot; &quot;It has got to the point where if we&apos;ve got too much time off now we start to feel bored,&quot; Knudsen adds. The live shows are what has galvanised their fanbase - not surprising, perhaps, given how many they play. And they cross borders, too (I&apos;m meeting them in Amsterdam, where they are playing the London Calling festival), despite the importance of their lyrics to the songs. They even played to a 10,000-strong crowd at a Chinese festival last year before they had signed a deal (the LIPA funded the trip) - their biggest crowd at home at that point had been 500 or so. &quot;We have some fans who come to nearly all our shows,&quot; says Haggis. &quot;One from the UK told us he&apos;s coming here to Amsterdam and then on to Italy. That&apos;s what is always amazing and surprising. When we go to places outside the UK, we don&apos;t expect anyone to know who we are. Like our gig in Venlo [in the Netherlands] - there were 10 pretty hardcore fans at the front. I mean, in Venlo? It was pretty weird. &quot;It&apos;s so nice winning over new crowds in America and Europe. People may have heard one song and they&apos;re a bit intrigued, and they come along to a show and the work is on us. Whereas in the UK, at the minute, the crowd helps us so much, they carry you along and then you get to the end and you&apos;re like, &apos;Yeah, that was fun.&apos;&quot; &quot;Like V festival. That was amazing,&quot; says Knudsen. &quot;It was the first gig we did in the UK after the American tour. The Kill the Director single had come out here. The song was on the radio quite a bit and we didn&apos;t see the consequence of that until we came back to V.&quot; &quot;We opened the set with Kill the Director thinking it would get things going a bit,&quot; says Haggis. &quot;I started drumming and these two turned around to me and went, like, &apos;What&apos;s going on?&apos; Literally the whole tent just went &apos;Arrrggggghhh!&apos;&quot; The appeal is simple: bucketloads of charm, catchy melodies, comically self-deprecating lyrics about romantic misadventures, and a huge sense of fun - they have posted their own karate parodies on YouTube. All of which has led to accusations that they are reliant on gimmicks, which reached their peak when Let&apos;s Dance to Joy Division was released at more or less the same time as the Ian Curtis biopic, Control. &quot;It was just a coincidence,&quot; says Haggis. &quot;There are some hardcore Joy Division fans who think you&apos;ve just name-dropped the band to appeal to all these people and we just have to tell them: I think you&apos;ve missed the point to the song.&quot; &quot;Yeah,&quot; says Murphy, his mop of red-tinted curls bobbing up and down as he speaks. &quot;It could have just as easily been called Let&apos;s Dance to Radiohead or Nick Drake or the Smiths. I&apos;ve said this so many times: we are a serious band, but we&apos;re not preoccupied with being serious all the time. We don&apos;t want to dress in black leathers and be really moody. We just want to be ourselves. So on that day, if it means being complete and utter morons, then so we will.&quot; The other accusation is that they are stage school puppets - anathema to rock&apos;s cult of authenticity. &quot;We&apos;re really proud that we come from Liverpool and its heritage,&quot; Murphy responds, &quot;but I don&apos;t think we feel that the city or LIPA has had any bearing on us as a band, apart from the fact that we met there. It was just a place to be creative.&quot; That said, Murphy did encounter the institute&apos;s co-founder while he was a student: &quot;I had a half-hour session with Paul McCartney. He was going through his divorce and kept leaving the room to use the phone. Then he came back and I started to play him Patricia the Stripper and without really thinking I said, &apos;This song&apos;s about falling in love with a whore.&apos; He looked at me and said, &apos;Hmmm, that sounds like a bad thing to do.&quot; Later that night, Amsterdam welcomes the Wombats with hearty cheers and loud singing. &quot;If there is any confusion about whether we&apos;re serious or funny, it now seems a lot of people are getting it and tapping into it,&quot; says Murphy. &quot;We have started getting more and more absolute nutters at gigs. Young kids who come up to us and talk nonsense and do silly things. It&apos;s not the main thing we&apos;re trying to do but it&apos;s nice to see people letting themselves go.&quot; \u00b7 The album, A Guide to Love, Loss and Desperation, is out now on 14th Floor", "sentences": ["And they cross borders, too (I&apos;m meeting them in Amsterdam, where they are playing the London Calling festival), despite the importance of their lyrics to the songs.", "&quot;One from the UK told us he&apos;s coming here to Amsterdam and then on to Italy.", "Then he came back and I started to play him Patricia the Stripper and without really thinking I said, &apos;This song&apos;s about falling in love with a whore.&apos; He looked at me and said, &apos;Hmmm, that sounds like a bad thing to do.&quot; Later that night, Amsterdam welcomes the Wombats with hearty cheers and loud singing."], "title": "'We didn't set out to make ridiculous songs'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/dec/07/popandrock2", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "The Wombats"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-12-08T00:02:54Z", "article": "Why now?

These tiny family-run places are totally different to one another in feel and style, yet what they have in common is what makes them precious; they are the real thing. So what is the real thing? In every European city family-run bars and shops have held their own against global-market madness. Only in England were we in serious danger of losing everything - yes everything, our delis, pubs, bookshops, coffee houses, clothes, shoes, furniture, ceramics, hardware, THE LOT, to chain stores and supermarkets. The nation of shopkeepers had sold up. Retailing and e-tailing were the king and queen of spend. But, and this is cause for full-time fireworks and a resident brass band, things are changing. It seems like the lure of the small, the independent, the beautiful, is hardwired into our DNA. We feel better when someone is talking to us. We like it when we can browse in peace. We want to ask for assistance at the food counter and have someone tell us, like they&apos;re in love, why they prefer Lancashire Crumbly to Lancashire Creamy. When I was a kid my mum used to send me to buy those cheeses from the shop that sold nothing but cheese, butter, bacon, and pickles. The cheese was cut with a knife and wrapped in greaseproof brown paper. Then ASDA arrived, the shop closed down, and we made do with Edam or factory Cheddar. Progress, progress. The fact is that if you can support your local wine merchant who buys wine from particular estates that he or she knows well, or if you spend money at the shop that sells imported goods carefully sourced by the owner, your money is doing everybody good: You are keeping someone in business, someone who in turn has a stake in the neighbourhood both as a thriving area and a nice place to live, and in the wider world your money is going forward to other local and family run concerns, who are in turn spending much of their income where they live. This is how money should work - by direct benefit. It is the opposite of global economics, where indirect benefit is supposed to trickle down through communities lucky enough to have a rip-off factory or multi-national outsourcer nearby. I have a simple rule in life - &apos;Do it from the heart or not at all.&apos; I&apos;m not here to make a profit for somebody who couldn&apos;t care less about what they are selling, about how it is made, or about me. I want passion, commitment, conscience - something more than the transaction. The big problem with the corporate shopping experience - whether it&apos;s food, books, records, whatever, is that it is about getting the goods and going home. They want you through the store as fast as possible with the maximum number of purchases - hence shopping trolleys the size of mobile homes and assistants trained to zoom in and harass anyone who is &apos;just looking&apos;. This might be because corporate shopping is run by straight white Alpha Males - the world&apos;s worst shoppers. You&apos;ve seen them, tapping their feet, checking their phones, hands in pockets while wifey or mistressy tries on another frock. They HATE shopping, but they run the chains, and behind all the phoney retail smiling and the robotic flat language of fake helpfulness dinned into their low-paid employees, Corporate shopping knows only two words - BUY. GO. Just stop giving them your money. Give it to me instead. At least that&apos;s what I thought when I decided I wanted a shop on the ground floor of my house in London. I had been offered a lot of money by a coffee chain, but I don&apos;t like coffee chains, what I do like is real food farmed and produced in a way that is fair on the land and fair on labour. I met a fantastic guy, a chef called Harvey Cabaniss, trained at Fergus Henderson&apos;s legendary St John&apos;s restaurants, who wanted to run his own quirky kind of deli in my space, and we made a deal. I had always been envious of a food and wine shop called Mabey&apos;s in Stow on the Wold, for its friendly perfection: everything you want and time to enjoy it. I thought &quot;if I can do this I should, because doing what you can makes a difference.&quot; It might be a tiny, butterfly-wing difference, but every pound you spend outside the global chain funds an alternative. When you support your local bookshop or butcher, you will pay more for what you buy, but it will be a price that reflects the reality of the situation. When you shop at your local bookshop or butcher, or buy furniture from craftsman, or get those plates from the woman who fires them in her own kiln, you are not just buying things, you are actively supporting a different way of life. Discounting means someone in the chain of supply is taking a loss or having to cut corners. In animal welfare terms, it matters very much that we should not ask farmers to cut corners. And when it comes to toys or shoes, would you want your little boy to be working in a sweatshop instead of going to school? We all know, or should know by now, the politics of shopping, and that is reason enough to be thinking local and independent, but let&apos;s not leave out the pleasure of the experience - because shopping is not just about the goods you take home, or how much money you spend; in a big city or a dull town, finding a network of shops gives you back the essential community that modern life has trashed. If you&apos;re not feeling great, a friendly face can cheer you up. If you want a bit of gossip, you won&apos;t get it at the checkout. Shopping is sharing as well as spending: whether it&apos;s popping out for a pint of milk and a chat, foraging in the bookshop and discussing the new titles with the owner, finding the perfect present from that emporium where everything is hand-sourced or just mooching through the bustle of a market, having a look round. Shopping is trading in the true sense of the word - It&apos;s an exchange. A real little shop will give you more than you are paying for, because not everything that matters in this life can be bought. \u00b7 Jeanette Winterson&apos;s deli Verde is at 40 Brushfield St, London E1 6AG.

Fair play to somebody who works this stuff out!&apos; &apos;Uh-oh,&apos; says Thom Yorke. &apos;No. That&apos;s pure coincidence. Having not read that particular section of the Bible ...&apos; he adds with a wryness so thick you could eat it with a fork. &apos;Some people,&apos; notes Phil Selway, &apos;have far too much knowledge for their own good, you know.&apos; And now here&apos;s Maja Dorn, 33, from Germany: &apos;Can you say something about the sales figures of In Rainbows, the average price paid only for the download and the number of ordered discboxes? In which countries the most discboxes?&apos; Ed: &apos;I think there&apos;s about 80,000 discboxes.&apos; Jonny: &apos;60,000.&apos; Ed: &apos;It was 65,000 a week ago.&apos; Colin: &apos;It&apos;s 72,000.&apos; Answering that question, it appears, might take some time... Welcome to Radiohead vs The People, an OMM-curated global interrogation of the world&apos;s first post-tomorrow band. As you may have heard if you&apos;ve switched on the TV, or opened a newspaper, or talked to anyone, or walked down a desert track in Mongolia, on 10 October this year Thom Yorke (39, vocals, guitar, keyboards), Ed O&apos;Brien (39, guitar), Jonny Greenwood (36, guitar, weird obscure muso kit), Colin Greenwood (38, bass) and Phil Selway (40, drums) released their seventh album and first in four years, In Rainbows. They had only announced its existence on 1 October, when a posting appeared on Dead Air Space, the diary section of Radiohead.com: &apos;Hello everyone. Well, the new album is finished, and it&apos;s coming out in 10 days. We&apos;ve called it In Rainbows. Love from us all. Jonny.&apos; Initially the album was solely available via download. Boldly, simply, Radiohead were allowing anyone interested to set their own price: \u00a300.00 if they wanted. A discbox, offering the download but also double vinyl and CD versions of In Rainbows, plus &apos;enhanced CD with [eight] additional new songs, artwork and photographs of the band&apos;, would be available in December at the fixed price of \u00a340. But, yes, it&apos;s worth repeating: You could get the new album from one of the biggest rock bands in the world for free This was the proverbial butterfly flap that caused a far-off hurricane. Debate raged. Really raged. Radiohead - who had previously sold 23 million albums via traditional channels - were single-handedly tearing down the music industry. No, cheeky kids were tearing down Radiohead, taking the band at their word and paying precisely nothing for the 10 tracks. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and the entire global technological and media top brass were committing hara kiri. Guy Hands - boss of Terra Firma, the private equity firm who earlier this year bought Radiohead&apos;s old label EMI for \u00a32.4bn - knocked over his latte. Bono was in the corner in a huff, muttering &apos;damn, why didn&apos;t we think of that?&apos; The record shop was dead, the DIY age was here and long live the virtual store! Could this business model be applied to, say, cars and comestibles too? Nothing would ever be the same again ... Liam Gallagher, asked if Oasis - also currently without a record deal - would release their next, seventh album via a similar &apos;honesty box&apos; mechanism, replied with much cursing and a pithy &apos;over my dead body&apos;. Jay-Z, though, was mad for it: &apos;What Radiohead did with their album was a genius idea. I&apos;m going to pay $50 for it.&apos; &apos;The kamikaze pilot in me wants to do the same damn thing,&apos; Courtney Love wrote on her blog. &apos;I&apos;m grateful for Radiohead for making the first move. I&apos;d do it differently. That&apos;s why B-sides are no longer B-sides, but have to be A-sides, to an extent.&apos; Right on, Courtney. Gene Simmons of Kiss, waggling his big tongue, was less impressed: &apos;Are they on fucking crack?&apos; he spluttered. &apos;Do they really believe that&apos;s a business model that works?&apos; Lily Allen exhaled a ring of fag smoke and huffed: &apos;It&apos;s arrogant for them to give their music away for free - they&apos;ve got millions of pounds. It sends a weird message to younger bands who haven&apos;t done as well. You don&apos;t choose how to pay for eggs. Why should it be different for music?&apos; &apos;How do the band respond to comments by Lily Allen and others accusing them of being arrogant and inconsiderate for putting their music out for whatever price the fans wished to pay?&apos; - Jacob Day, 25, Orem, Utah Thom: &apos;That&apos;s from Lily Allen?&apos; No, that&apos;s from Jacob in Utah, but Lily Allen said that last week. Thom [clapping hands and emitting high-pitched laughter]: &apos;Oh, I&apos;m upset about that.&apos; So that&apos;s no comment? Thom: &apos;Well, that was my comment. It makes me laugh.&apos; And in the middle of all this, some people were even asking about said music. Like, was In Rainbows really the warmest, most approachable yet still daring Radiohead album yet? Might this be, in Radiohead terms, the perfect storm: the record that married the big rock welly of The Bends, the heart and soul of OK Computer, and the sonic adventurism of Kid A and Amnesiac. So many questions, so little response from Radiohead. So, when they finally agreed to talk, OMM decided to follow the spirit of the In Rainbows &apos;initiative&apos; and have fans and album-purchasers help with the questions. In the middle of last month I asked through two Radiohead fansites, Ateaseweb.com and Greenplastic.com, for questions for the band. I also asked respondents to include, if they didn&apos;t mind, the amount they&apos;d paid for In Rainbows. Thirty-six hours later, some 700 emails from all over the world were testing the capacity of the OMM inbox. I then hooked up with Radiohead in London on a wet Monday morning in late November. The venue was handy both for the M40 to Oxford and Marylebone Station (four-fifths of Radiohead still live in Oxfordshire, where they formed the band in 1986 while attending the private, boys-only Abingdon School; Ed O&apos;Brien lives in north London). Ed, Colin and Jonny are interviewed together, and then Thom and Phil. Few groups enjoy the bond with their fans that Radiohead do. By any measure, they qualify as one of the world&apos;s biggest bands, but politically attuned and socially-aware, they are wary of the baggage that implies, and operate almost under the radar - now more so than ever. Given the invitation, the type of question submitted was a long way from &apos;why are you so fit, Ed?&apos; Although someone did ask that, too. What follows is a selection of the best with some further context and interpretation. &apos;The In Rainbows cover art departs from the impersonal and apocalyptic imagery of recent albums. The music does the same. It&apos;s warm and inviting. The whole aesthetic points to a shinier, happier Radiohead. Do the band agree a shift has occurred? If so, why do they think it happened?&apos; - Wes Jarrell, 25, USA Thom: &apos;Uhnnnn, yeah, kind of. More sort of explosive and ... Explosive is perhaps not the right word but in-your-face, spontaneous. That&apos;s what we were aiming at.&apos; Ed: &apos;I think the big thing was Thom&apos;s lyrics really. That always heralds something. The music always seems really strong, but the lyrics were ...&apos; Where has that come from within Thom? Ed: &apos;I think not being scared to be personal. And not being scared to ... I think it was really liberating for him to do [his solo album] The Eraser. His voice is really upfront. That&apos;s the most noticeable thing. He&apos;s not hiding. And after OK Computer he sort of withdrew a bit. I think it&apos;s also being bold enough and brave enough to be personal. And you know what... there&apos;s stuff to write about in your late thirties. You&apos;ve lived. You&apos;ve started families up.&apos; Jonny: &apos;You&apos;re a different person.&apos; Ed: &apos;Yeah, you&apos;ve stopped dealing with, &quot;Me, I&apos;m the centre of everything.&quot; Because you&apos;ve got kids you can&apos;t do that. So, it changes. It was like, &quot;Wow, there&apos;s a warmth to these songs, it&apos;s very human.&quot;&apos; &apos;Lyrically, In Rainbows seems to revolve around infidelity and relationships. This is a big jump from the more world-focused, environmentally-charged lyrics in the previous two-three albums. Was Thom more focused on family life and dealing with personal matters during the songwriting process for this album?&apos; - Bianca Carlson, 30, Denver, Colorado Thom: &apos;More focused on not getting into large generalities, definitely. Other than that, I couldn&apos;t really say, to be honest.&apos; &apos;To what extent is In Rainbows about middle-age malaise and the sort of drifting moods you find in the corners of 15-year-old marriages?&apos; - Anthony Strain, 28, Modesto, California Thom: &apos;It was much more about the fucking panic of realising you&apos;re going to die! And that any time soon [I could] possibly [have] a heart attack when I next go for a run. You know what I&apos;m saying.&apos; Before the release of his solo album in July last year, Yorke told me that being in Radiohead &apos;was getting boring and it just got a bit weird and self-perpetuating ... &apos;It felt like everyone was under obligation to do it rather than because we wanted to do it. And one of the things I had wanted to do for ages was get stuck into a bunch of things that I had been mucking around with that didn&apos;t fit into the Radiohead zone.&apos; The band had started recording a new album sometime in 2005 in the wake of the brain-scrambling world tour (another one) in support of 2003&apos;s Hail to the Thief. They began working on album seven with Mark &apos;Spike&apos; Stent. Then, throughout May, June and August last year, around the July release of The Eraser, Radiohead toured the UK, Europe and America. They were &apos;road testing&apos; new songs - 11 in total by the tour&apos;s end. They had done this before, when they meandered through Spain and Portugal in summertime prior to the recording of Hail to the Thief, and it had worked fine. So it seemed last year: &apos;Nude&apos;, a &apos;lost&apos; Radiohead song that they had been trying to record for a decade, was finally sounding great. &apos;Reckoner&apos; was a &apos;cock-rocking guitar stomp&apos; (\u00a9 Jordan Cox, 21, Auckland, New Zealand). &apos;House of Cards&apos; was a beautiful, ethereal ballad. Radiohead were, as Yorke said, &apos;getting to a good space&apos;. But away from the stage ... The sessions with Stent seemed to have come to naught. Maybe they would produce themselves. Whatever, no one was breathing down their necks - their contract with EMI had been fulfilled, so Radiohead were unsigned. No deadlines, no focus ... When the tour ended in Amsterdam on 28 August 2006, the band were still, it would transpire, all over the shop. That said, back in the spring, Yorke had been restless. He knew Radiohead had become bogged down in the studio in the past (see: the agonising sessions that would eventually produce Kid A and Amnesiac). And he had an eye on the future. &apos;It seems crazy to have this all [new material] sitting around,&apos; he said. The new album was, &apos;to varying degrees, finished, [and] to just have to wait for another six months, eight months, seems nuts.&apos; Oooh ... somewhere in the recesses of the collective Radiohead psyche a little idea may have just begun - as Yorke put it last month - &apos;floating around&apos;. Fast forward to April this year. Having reunited last autumn with Nigel Godrich for sessions in a leaky country mansion in Wiltshire, their own Oxfordshire studio and in Godrich&apos;s place in London&apos;s Covent Garden, Radiohead are, at last, at the mixing stages of the making of their seventh album.

I have a flat in Amsterdam and travel frequently by air; I&apos;d rather go by train sometimes, via Brussels, as would my visitors. Is it possible to get good deals to Brussels and Amsterdam? I would recommend not taking the Thalys from Brussels but taking the ordinary international or Benelux train, as the Thalys always seems unpleasantly crowded. Also, is it true that the new high-speed line between Brussels and Amsterdam will open in December?Jane Ruthven, Alston The trick to securing low fares is to book early and be flexible. Eurostar fares to Brussels (and Paris) start from \u00a359 return on eurostar.com, by phone on 08705 186186 or at Eurostar stations. If this isn&apos;t available on the date your want, the website has a tracker where you can search for the nearest date when it is. Eurostar also offers through tickets to Amsterdam combining Eurostar to Brussels with an onward Thalys journey to Amsterdam. The cheapest fare combines the \u00a359 return to Brussels with the cheapest Brussels-Amsterdam fare of \u00a323 return. Thalys trains can be busy but, like Eurostar, have compulsory reservations so you always get a seat. One problem is that while Eurostar tickets go on sale 120 days before travel, Thalys seats go on sale 90 days before. The only way around this is to be very coordinated and hope that new alliances such as Railteam (railteam.com) iron out these inconsistencies. The new Brussels-Amsterdam high-speed line, known as HSL-Zuid (hslzuid.com), is set to open late in 2008. Once complete, fastest journey times between Amsterdam and Brussels will be reduced from just under three hours to one hour, forty-four 44 minutes.  We are a couple in our mid-fifties with a 16-year-old son and a 14-year-old daughter. The criteria for our next holiday, as requested by them, is to go somewhere they would find similar-aged teenagers to hang out with, and plenty of activities. We don&apos;t like self-catering and feel they are still too young to, say, go alone to a club or bar in the evenings. Rosemary Stevens, London This is a difficult age for holidays, as you&apos;ve suggested. A good option is family holidays offered by Intrepid Travel (01373 826611; intrepidtravel.com) and Explore Worldwide (0870 333 4001; explore.co.uk). These active small group trips are a great way to meet other families and they cover a huge range of destinations. Another starting point is Responsible Travel (responsibletravel.com), which brings together ethically sound holidays from a variety of operators. A week in Slovenia&apos;s Julian Alps including orienteering, hiking and rafting costs from \u00a3749 per person. You could easily tack on visits to Trieste and Venice before heading home.  Veterans of travelling with teenagers swear by getting them involved in the planning - an evening at home with maps, guidebooks and the internet is a great way to get everyone excited. My wife and I are planning an independent holiday in Canada using a hired car. We would very much like to drive along Highway 20 to Bella Coola in British Columbia. The guidebook gives a clear description of an unpaved section of this road, known as the Hill. The problem is that the car hire company says that using this section of road would render the loss damage waiver and liability cover void, even for four-wheel-drives. Do you know of a way of dealing with this? The travel agent said we could always do it at our own risk while driving carefully.Martin Carter, by email Car hire firms are not keen on you going off paved roads in Canada. However, on any exploration of the wilder parts of British Columbia some driving on gravel tracks is inevitable. If you&apos;re planning on taking the ferry from Port Hardy to Bella Coola and then driving inland, you&apos;ll get into some very wild terrain and, as you point out, tackle a 22-mile stretch of gravel road over a 1,524m pass. On this stretch the road is narrow and bordered by sheer drops on one side and bare rock on the other.  Other than this though, Highway 20 is paved and in good condition. Though this road is used by timber trucks, the roads hire companies really want you to avoid are the logging tracks where huge, speeding trucks have right of way and the risk of flying gravel chipping paintwork is significant. Neither international big boys nor local operators I tried would offer liability cover for driving off-road. I&apos;d second your travel agent&apos;s advice, while emphasising you are taking a risk that could cost you a lot. I travelled widely around the province two summers ago in a compact two-wheel-drive and had a fantastic time, driving carefully off-road where necessary. If any reader has another solution, we&apos;d love to hear it. My brother and three of his friends, all Indians over 60 and very strict vegetarians, want to tour Europe by coach this summer. What do you suggest?Mahesh Dutta, Portsmouth Vegetarians still get an inconsistent deal travelling in Europe. In many countries there&apos;ll be at least one meat-free option, but in France and Spain particularly this isn&apos;t a given. Coach tour operator Leger (0845 408 0769; leger.co.uk), suggests that you mention you don&apos;t eat meat at every opportunity: when booking, when checking in, and when sitting down to dinner. There are links and recommendations for vegetarian restaurants Europe-wide at veggieheaven.com. FEEDBACK Regarding your reply last week about Accrington, I&apos;d like to add some suggestions about the land of my childhood, the Ribble Valley, which I recently persuaded my Brentford-born husband to visit. We stayed at the Shireburn Arms Hotel in Hurst Green (01254 826518; shireburnarmshotel.com) which has wonderful views across the valley to Pendle, and we found the Three Fishes at Mitton (01254 826888; thethreefishes.com) an eating place not to be missed. It specialises in local dishes made with local ingredients - and they are scrumptious.

At the company&apos;s headquarters outside Toulouse in October, he was hosting a glitzy ceremony to celebrate the long-delayed delivery of the first superjumbo Airbus, the A380. But the assembled media circus was far more interested in the chronic financial turbulence at Airbus - and in the investigation into alleged insider trading at its loss-making parent EADS - than the new plane on the tarmac outside. &apos;Ask me about all that tomorrow,&apos; he said perched uncomfortably on a stool, microphone in hand. &apos;Today is the day we want to celebrate. Have a look around - is it spoiling the party?&apos; Today, the thought of celebrating is the last thing on the minds of Airbus management and its 57,000 workers, with about 10,000 in the UK. On Friday morning, Enders, EADS boss Louis Gallois and other senior executives gathered for a sombre board meeting in Amsterdam. While the rain lashed down outside, they debated the proposed sale of nine plants in Europe, including the wing-component manufacturing facility at Filton, near Bristol, which employs about 4,000 people. Part of the Power8 restructuring plan announced in February, these sales will save \u20ac2.1bn annually and cut 10,000 jobs by 2010. But also on the agenda were ideas to make even deeper, more painful cuts than those originally planned. EADS said last month that as a result of the weakening dollar, an extra \u20ac1bn in annual savings would have to be found. Analysts say that the UK wing-assembly plant in Broughton, North Wales, which employs 6,000 people, could be next on the block. Tom Williams, executive vice president for programmes and former head of Airbus in the UK, refused to rule out the possibility it could be sold or closed down. &apos;There are no guarantees,&apos; he told The Observer. &apos;No one has any God-given right to any particular work share or programme of work in the future. We are in the situation where we are looking at everything.&apos; He said this could include cutting R&amp;D spending or aircraft development programmes. &apos;Is there anything we should do which is more radical?&apos; he added. &apos;Are there some programmes we can&apos;t afford to do?&apos; The euro&apos;s strength against the dollar is taking a massive bite out of Airbus&apos;s profits. Airbus&apos;s costs are largely in euros. And like oil, the planes it sells are priced in the greenback. Airbus says that every 10 per cent rise in the euro against the dollar costs it more than \u20ac1bn in operating profits. Two years ago, the euro was worth around $1.20. On Friday it closed at almost $1.47, yet Power8&apos;s cost-cutting plans were based on an anticipated euro exchange rate of $1.35. To add insult to injury, US-based Boeing&apos;s costs are all in dollars, giving Airbus&apos;s arch-rival a crucial advantage in an already cut-throat industry. In recent days, the howls of pain from EADS executives have become louder. Analysts say this is one way of softening up workers for more cuts. Enders has said that the weakening dollar is &apos;life-threatening&apos; for Airbus. &apos;It has gone beyond the pain barrier,&apos; he added last month. Last weekend it was the turn of Gallois. The EADS chief executive, who had previously labelled the sickly dollar as &apos;unbearable&apos;, said it posed an &apos;existential&apos; threat to the company. Williams, who was born in Glasgow, speaks more plainly. &apos;It&apos;s a bloody battle,&apos; he said. Last year Airbus made pre-tax losses of \u20ac572m. But this can&apos;t all be attributed to a weakening dollar. Its superjumbo is two years late, costing it an estimated \u20ac6.8bn in late delivery penalties and lost sales. There are also delays over its A400M military transport plane and countless redesigns of its wide-body version of the mid-range A350 jet have put its delivery further behind that of Boeing&apos;s rival 787 Dreamliner. Airbus is moving more production overseas and into dollar-denominated areas such as China, and possibly the US, Japan and Russia. But this isn&apos;t just to limit currency costs. Its assembly plant in China which will open by 2009 is part of a joint venture which Airbus hopes will help it sell more planes to Chinese airlines, a huge growth market. Manufacturing costs in China are also lower than in Europe. As John Scholle, aviation analyst from Global Insight, said: &apos;The weak dollar is a big problem for Airbus. But expansion outside of Europe is probably going to happen anyway to cut costs.&apos; Williams admitted currency factors are not the only consideration for Airbus. &apos;We need to be strategic. We need to think &quot;How do we do business in these countries? and how can we be local there?&quot;&apos; He added that the push overseas must not be driven by currency concerns alone: &apos;It&apos;s a bit like kids playing football - they all rush off in one direction onto one side of the field. We mustn&apos;t do something that three or four years later we wish we came to another conclusion.&apos; British defence company BAE Systems sold its stake in EADS last year. About 40 per cent of the company&apos;s shares are listed, with about half of the remainder owned by the French government and German state and private banks. Russian bank VTB, a Spanish state holding company and Dubai-based investors own the rest. German and French ministers have a history of powerful lobbying against job cuts in their own countries. Scholle from Global Insight said this makes the UK&apos;s highly efficient Broughton plant more vulnerable: &apos;Airbus becomes a point of national pride for French and German governments and it&apos;s a source of jobs, so there&apos;s always the potential for politicians to meddle. The UK government has less influence over the company.&apos; Williams insisted that secretary of state for business, John Hutton, and other ministers regularly lobby Enders and Gallois: &apos;I don&apos;t think it makes a big difference. There is no lack of pressure.&apos;  Airbus is the result of a 40-year-old vision for European aerospace firms to collaborate, largely to compete against US firms including Boeing. But globalisation means the world is much bigger than the US and Europe. Markets such as China are emerging. Howard Wheeldon, from BGC Partners, said: &apos;What we are seeing through the momentum of dollar collapse and the devastating effect that it is having on EADS probably marks the end of the great European dream for Airbus. Of course, it doesn&apos;t mean the end of Airbus - far from it. But as Boeing has already done, it requires Airbus to become a truly global company.&apos; And in the long run, that could spell bad news for Broughton, soon to be the UK&apos;s remaining Airbus plant.", "sentences": ["On Friday morning, Enders, EADS boss Louis Gallois and other senior executives gathered for a sombre board meeting in Amsterdam."], "title": "Please fasten your seatbelts, Airbus is in for a bumpy ride", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/09/theairlineindustry1", "tags": ["Business", "Airline industry", "EADS", "Airbus"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-12-10T23:59:00Z", "article": "On a late July morning in 1987, I got on a coach at Victoria station and got off it again, about 16 hours later, in Holland. I was leaving England. I&apos;d had enough. Margaret Thatcher had just been re-elected, for the third time. I was a newly qualified teacher at an inner-London comprehensive school, living in a small one-bedroom flat on a bus route in Acton, a part of west London then, as now, largely untroubled by the trauma of gentrification. It was no life, I decided, for a man of my talents. The previous year, Maggie had abolished the GLC, and London was falling to pieces. It was a mean, miserable place, dirty and deeply depressing. Londres se tiermondise, Le Monde had crowed on its front page: London is turning into a third-world city. I hadn&apos;t a clue what I was going to do in Amsterdam, beyond hang out in coffee shops with lots of other like-minded but essentially idle insurrectionists and slowly mutate into some kind of latter-day hippy (an ambition I have, alas, failed spectacularly to fulfil). But whatever it was, it had to be better than London in 1987. I left without a backward glance. Nearly 20 years later, after living and working in a number of European cities - principally Amsterdam, Helsinki and, for nearly a decade, Paris - I came back. Older, obviously; broader of beam and thinner of thatch, without the wife with whom I had left but with a French partner and two small children. And my, how the place has changed. Just look at it now, all primped, preening and ahead-of-the-curve, packed near to bursting with primped, preening and ahead-of-the-curve people, from every corner of the known world. It&apos;s weird, to be honest. Not that I hadn&apos;t been back since 1987, of course, but never for much more than a week at a time, and rarely more often than once a year. So actually living here again is unsettling. So much is so terribly old and familiar, so much so excitingly new and different. Like catching your aunt in Agent Provocateur, perhaps (though maybe exciting is not quite the word), or discovering your roast beef and yorkshire is served with pan-fried ricotta, raspberry and rutabaga coulis and a sprinkling of oven-toasted hemp seeds, which it probably is, somewhere. The thing is, though, at the risk of sounding like some sad old fart, there are actually a few things about New Britain I don&apos;t fully understand. Here are some of them. So what&apos;s a skinny latte, then? When I left London for Amsterdam, your best chance of getting a decent cup of coffee was, frankly, to move to Amsterdam. Or Paris, or Milan, or even (I imagine) Irkutsk. Tea we were good at. You could get a good strong stand-your-spoon-up-in-it chipped mug of PG Tips anywhere, even in the cafe opposite Acton Town tube. What you couldn&apos;t get in a cafe was coffee. Now whether Starbucks, Caff\u00e8 Nero, Costa Coffee etc actually count as cafes in the historically accepted sense of the term is, of course, debatable, but it is at least true that it is now possible to consume, on a great many high streets in Britain, and every few yards in parts of central London, something that might reasonably be called coffee. Except, obviously, it won&apos;t be called coffee. It&apos;ll be called espresso or ristretto or latte or mocha or cappuccino or americano or macchiato or some unholy combination of the above, such as double mocha macchiato with whipped cream and crushed Bolivian brazil nuts from the farm of our friend Raul Ramirez. Each of these is available in a range of coffee varieties such as Colombia Narino Supremo and Guatemala Antigua. So while we seem at long last to have embraced (a travesty of) cafe society, we now need a menu to order our coffee. Is this progress? Reader, I do not know. Er, WTF? So I&apos;m in a branch of Starbucks, studying the menu, and the woman in front of me says: &quot;Yeah, hi, yeah. Can I get a skinny latte, with wings?&quot; Did I know what she wanted? Not until the girl behind the counter - the &quot;barista&quot;, as I have since learned to call her - yelled to her colleague: &quot;Anna, one skimmed latte to go.&quot; For some of us, even the phrase &quot;to go&quot; has a faintly exotic ring to it. It know it sounds ridiculous, but we used to say &quot;to take away&quot;. Come to that, when did people start saying &quot;Can I get&quot; instead of &quot;Could I have&quot;? Or &quot;Laters&quot; rather than &quot;Goodbye&quot;? And that whole &quot;so&quot; thing, as in &quot;This is so not going to happen,&quot; or &quot;Jon, you&apos;re so going to regret agreeing to write this piece&quot; is a new one on me. The language has changed. And I&apos;m, like, I cannot believe I just said that. Moshpit, petrolhead, man flu, property porn and sponsored wedding are words and phrases to whose meanings I have but recently been introduced (and, obviously, WTF). Not that I&apos;m complaining: some are brilliant. Stoozing, for example, I discovered last week. It means borrowing money on a new credit card during the zero-interest period, and investing it for personal gain. Very New Britain, that one. Since when have you had to pay to park your car outside your house? In 1987 I had a black Fiat Uno that I could park outside my flat in Acton with impunity. Indeed, I could park it anywhere in Acton with impunity, as long as it wasn&apos;t on a yellow line. And the yellow lines, generally, were on roads where you could see that if people did park their cars, the traffic would suffer. Now I have to pay \u00a380 a year to park my Toyota estate outside my flat in Chiswick, west London (in two decades, I have moved, geographically speaking, half a mile). What is more, I cannot park my Toyota anywhere else useful in Chiswick - like, say, within a mile or so of the shops - on pain of being fined \u00a340. How did this happen? Why is the London Underground still such utter shite? Twenty years ago the District line was diabolical; the Northern line was a nightmare; the Central line was OK, except when it wasn&apos;t, in which case it just stopped; and the Piccadilly line was fast, but felt like travelling in a badly overcrowded sauna. These days, amazingly, the District line is diabolical; the Northern line is a nightmare; the Central line is OK, except when it isn&apos;t, in which case it just stops; and the Piccadilly line is fast, but like travelling in a badly overcrowded sauna. Why do Londoners put up with this? In any other major European city there would be a massed and bloody uprising. A protest movement would be launched; tens of thousands of commuters would collectively refuse to pay for their tickets; the offices of TfL (who?) would be comprehensively trashed and effigies of its so-called managers burned on bonfires lit on that gruesome stretch of track where the Hammersmith &amp; City, Circle and Metropolitan lines merge, and trains take, on average, four long and agonising days to pass through five stations. When you have waited 22 minutes for a District line train, spent three-quarters of an hour on the Piccadilly line (where temperatures regularly reach 147C), changed platforms four times at Camden because no one knows where the hell the next train is coming from (or whether it will come at all); when, above all, you have paid \u00a34 (versus Paris, \u20ac1.50, ie \u00a31; New York, $1,50, ie 75p) for the privilege, you have to wonder. For the Parisienne in my life, this is beyond even Gallic sarcasm. (&quot;Hah!&quot; I thrust. &quot;At least in London the whole Underground doesn&apos;t simply come to a halt because the drivers are defending their right to retire at 50.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; she ripostes, &quot;but that&apos;s mainly because in London they won&apos;t be able to afford to retire till they&apos;re 80.&quot;) Hey, but guess what: the buses are brilliant! I love London&apos;s buses! There are so many of them! You never have to wait more than five minutes! When did that happen? (I know, actually; it was to do with the congestion charge, wasn&apos;t it?) Well, it&apos;s worked. In 1987, if you suggested someone take the bus, they would look at you as if you&apos;d suggested they take a blunt knife to a particularly treasured body part. Then, buses were like an endangered species; for days on end you&apos;d see none, then all of a sudden along would come eight. Now they are everywhere. So that&apos;s excitingly new and different. A minor caveat to the above My friend Caroline, who left Britain in 1993, came back last summer after spells in Berlin, Moscow and Paris and furnished several fine ideas for this article, would like to point out that there is one bad thing about the buses (and in fact it also applies to the tube) and it&apos;s the fact that these days, people eat burgers in them. Also kebabs, and yes, even classic pan-baked pizzas with BBQ sauce, bacon, chicken, cherry tomatoes, red onions and an extra drizzle of rich authentic-tasting sauce from the farm of our, etc. Just when did it become socially acceptable, I often wonder, to eat your main meal of the day on the top of the number 43? OK, OK. But what else is excitingly new and different? The energy, the entrepreneurism, the ambition, the can-do, the internationalism, the &quot;I&apos;m out of a job next month but I&apos;ve got some stuff lined up&quot;, the smiling service. The politeness (though that may not be new; I have come from Paris). Shops where shop assistants assist. Helpful Poles, Latvians and Lithuanians. Child-friendly restaurants. Restaurants full stop, really, if I could afford them. Oyster cards. Topshop (I&apos;m told). Good schools (that was a joke). And BBC4. Enough with the good news! When did it become an overriding social imperative for the under-25s to throw up and pass out on the pavement on Friday nights? Much has already been written about this, so I do not intend to add to it beyond remarking that it didn&apos;t use to happen in Acton in 1987, or at least not to anything like the same extent, not even outside the King&apos;s Arms, and that it certainly does not happen anywhere else I have lived, with the possible exception of Helsinki, where six litres of lager is widely considered a necessary preamble to any form of social intercourse beyond the basic &quot;Good evening&quot; or, in Finnish, &quot;Hyva ilta&quot;. And there, the girls do not, on the whole, wear microskirts. How come dental treatment has overtaken the summer holiday as the biggest item on the family budget? To be honest, I don&apos;t remember ever having to pay for dental care in Britain in the 1980s, although this could be because I didn&apos;t actually go to the dentist in Britain in the 1980s. But I&apos;m fairly sure you didn&apos;t have to pay the equivalent of \u00a345 for a small filling on the NHS - assuming you can find a dentist today who is willing to accept you as an NHS patient, which is unlikely because more than two million people in New Britain can&apos;t. Otherwise, I&apos;m told, you&apos;re looking at upwards of \u00a380 with a private practitioner. I appreciate that, thanks largely to the immense foresight and efficacy of our government, among the many major advances achieved in this fine country since I last lived here is the fact that we all now enjoy an infinitely wider degree of choice in virtually every aspect of our daily lives, from healthcare to (for example) varieties of Sainsbury&apos;s own-brand cook-in sauce. But I fear \u00a380 for minor but vital tooth maintenance might perhaps be a choice too far. On the other hand, having to book an appointment to see your doctor the day before you get ill is pretty damn excitingly new and different. This is beginning to sound like a Daily Telegraph editorial. But dammit, I don&apos;t care. So: when did the telly start going downhill? For years I would go on French tele-vision and say smugly: &quot;British TV&apos;s the best in the world. Look at yours! Pah! Gameshows, quizzes, variety programmes, celebrities, reality rubbish, even Jon Henley. How is it possible that a nation as cultivated as the French can produce such lamentable television? This is a national disgrace.&quot; Now I turn on British TV and it&apos;s all game shows, quizzes, variety programmes, celebrities and reality rubbish (though rarely, sadly, Jon Henley). There are still some fantastic documentaries and dramas. But the best series are all American. How did that happen? And when did &quot;being famous&quot; become a career goal for the young? Maybe I&apos;m just old. But if so, I&apos;m not enjoying the benefits. How come I can&apos;t buy a house? In 1985, I bought a one-bed flat in Acton with my then wife for \u00a332,000. Between us, a probationary teacher and a first-year trade journalist in our early 20s, our annual salaries amounted to roughly half that sum. Today, an identical flat three doors down the same road is on the market for \u00a3249,950, probably seven times our combined earnings if we were in the same jobs now, and a three-bedroomed house in somewhere I would like to bring up my children (or even Acton - I&apos;m not proud) is beyond my means. As a place to live, London appears to have become a city for the very rich or the very poor. Those in the middle - the teachers and journalists, plumbers and carpenters, civil servants and middle managers who used to prosper in places such as Clapham or Tufnell Park - now struggle to afford Reading. I earn a reasonable salary and I feel poor. This, it seems to me, is actually rather serious. Um, education? No. Too painful. Too right. But did you know that in some countries, you can spend entire dinner parties with the parents of school-age children and the word will not even come up? Not once. Imagine. On the whole, though, I love being back. Really I do. One last question: what&apos;s with all the Porsches? Well, that&apos;s the big change, really. The one really stand-out, in your face, can&apos;t-fail-to-notice-it difference; the one you tell your foreign friends about first. London now - you can smell it - is about money. About making it and talking about it and spending it (on Sundays, too! On \u00a32,000 handbags!) and showing everyone how much of it you&apos;ve got. And if we don&apos;t have enough of it, we borrow, remortgage or put it on plastic. We&apos;re way deeper in debt than any other nation in Europe. We work longer hours than anyone else on the continent. Take fewer holidays. Are never off the BlackBerry. And shop, to the death. We are sacrificing our lives, and the quality of our lives, on the altars of work and commerce. It&apos;s not like that where I&apos;ve spent the last 20 years. It wasn&apos;t like that here in 1987.

If I were them, I&apos;d concentrate on the architecture, and the good lunch afterwards, in the former riding school of a royal palace. Wonderful city, Lisbon. Pity about the treaty. In the English version I have downloaded from the official website of the European Union, it has 175 pages of treaty text, 86 pages of accompanying protocols, a 25-page annexe, renumbering the articles in existing treaties, and a 26-page &quot;final act&quot;, which includes no fewer than 65 separate &quot;declarations&quot;. And that&apos;s just the English version; it will be disseminated in all the 23 official languages of the EU and - a detail buried in declaration 16 - in several non-official ones as well. Since the mere printing of the treaty in all these languages will require the destruction of several forests, it is hard to reconcile with its own commitment, in a new Article 2, to protecting the environment. Many of the qualifying declarations are the result of interventions by Europe&apos;s awkward squad, which at the time the treaty was negotiated consisted of Britain and Poland under the Kaczynski twins, and now consists of Britain. Several of them are the result of translation into euro-legalese of Gordon Brown&apos;s &quot;red lines&quot;, designed to protect him from Eurosceptic onslaught and save him from a referendum. (Denmark has just helped too, by deciding not to have a referendum.) They include pesky and largely pointless reservations about what should be one of the main benefits of this treaty - mechanisms for a stronger, better coordinated European foreign policy. Elsewhere, 16 member states declare (number 52) that they still like the EU&apos;s symbols: its flag, anthem and motto (&quot;United in diversity,&quot; in case you had forgotten), the euro and Europe Day on May 9. Well, bully for them. The list of signatories does not include France. Does this mean France disapproves of these symbols? And if we are &quot;united in diversity&quot;, why do only 16 out of 27 member states unite to endorse this motto? I am, however, delighted to see that my all-time favourite from earlier versions of the would-be constitution has survived. I hereby award the Salvador Dal\u00ed prize for the most surreal EU treaty declaration to number 58, in which the governments of Latvia, Hungary and Malta solemnly declare that the spelling of the name of the single currency on banknotes and coins &quot;has no effect on the existing rules of the Latvian, Hungarian or Maltese languages&quot;. What is it, we wonder, about the word &quot;euro&quot; that so horribly twists Latvian, Hungarian and Maltese tongues? And what is the intended effect of this declaration? Is the fear that, but for this prophylactic incantation, the very word &quot;euro&quot; will act like some sort of semantic polonium, slowly devouring the organic substance of the Latvian, Hungarian and Maltese languages? I think we should be told. To my left, there squats this monstrous 312-page spotted dick, plus copies of earlier treaties without which it cannot be understood; to my right, an elegant, pocket-sized, burgundy-coloured volume of just 60 pages, which contains both the Declaration of Independence and the 220-year-old constitution of the United States of America, with all subsequent amendments. &quot;We, the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity...&quot; begins their effort. &quot;His Majesty the King of the Belgians...&quot; ours begins, and proceeds, through a thicket of presidents and crowned heads and a reference to completing &quot;the process started by the Treaty of Amsterdam and by the Treaty of Nice&quot;, to this inspiring first article: &quot;The Treaty on European Union shall be amended in accordance with this article.&quot; It then provides for the addition to the existing treaty preamble of some of Val\u00e9ry Giscard d&apos;Estaing&apos;s frightful waffle from the failed constitution. &quot;Ach, Europa!&quot; as the writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger once exclaimed. It&apos;s painful to recall that ours was once meant to be something like theirs: a noble, clear statement of what our union is, how it works and the values it stands for, in muscular prose. That was the hope of at least some in Europe when we set out on this journey six years ago - and not just among the Euro-elites. In a Eurobarometer poll conducted in autumn 2001, two-thirds of those asked said they thought the EU should have a constitution. Even in Britain, the figure was 58%. What a falling-off there has been. We set out to give ourselves a constitutional banquet and ended up with a dog&apos;s dinner. Yet the European Union continues to function and grow. &quot;Eppur si muove&quot; (And yet it moves) - Galileo&apos;s legendary defiant sigh - is perhaps the true, secret motto of the European Union. Our leading expert on the EU&apos;s institutions, Professor Helen Wallace, has just published a report on how the EU has been working since the great eastward enlargement of May 2004. Against sombre predictions of gridlock, she finds that it has continued to work rather well, through pragmatic adaptation and non-treaty reforms. Now this amending treaty of Lisbon, modest and hedged about with qualifications though it is, should enable the union to work just a little bit better when - assuming all 27 member states ratify it - it comes into force in January 2009. But a noble constitutional document, comparable to that of the United States, it is not. It more nearly resembles the instruction manual for a forklift truck. In itself, it will do nothing to convince Europe&apos;s citizens, or the rest of the world, of what the European Union is good for. But it will help the EU to do things that may convince them. Now that the end of this long, disappointing constitutional debate is at last in sight, it should free us to concentrate on what this union does, rather than what it is, or says it is. In fact, the EU will define what it is by what it does. Will it help to create jobs, strengthen a free-trading world, encourage development, or combat climate change? What can it offer neighbours who will not become members, in the arc of crisis that surrounds us, from Murmansk to Casablanca? We cannot wait until January 2009 to address these questions. By then, a new American president will want to hear our answers. A short walk from the Jer\u00f3nimos monastery, down the estuary shore that leads to the Atlantic, is the magnificent tower of Bel\u00e9m, a gleaming white Manueline fortress that Europe&apos;s early modern explorers would have passed as they sailed out to discover new worlds. After their doubtless excellent lunch, today&apos;s European leaders should take a digestive stroll to the tower of Bel\u00e9m, and contemplate the wider horizon.

In the spirit of a creative encounter between the graphic explorations of Leonardo Da Vinci and the architectural inventiveness of Buckminster Fuller, Pickering has built up a body of work out of the geometric Inversion Principle. From painstaking intersections of banal cardboard, plaster, acetate and steel wire, Pickering conjures architectural enchantments.

Something Happened is a work based on Natalia Ginzburg&apos;s 1947 novel, \u00c8 Stato Cosi, and depicts two lovers arguing. The film swerves between a Hollywood love story and a behind-the-scenes documentary as the artist gets the couple to repeat their lines endlessly, echoing earlier art works by the legendary American conceptual artist Bruce Nauman.

Here it presents neon works by Fiona Banner, Alec Finlay, Richard Meitner and Vong Phaophanit. All four artists adapt neon&apos;s use in urban signage and advertising to a fine art agenda more inclined to enigmatic seductions. Neon is recognised for its haunting allure, its atmosphere of nocturnal writing on the wall. Fiona Banner simplifies neon&apos;s potential back to its calligraphic basics in an illumination of the 26 letters of the alphabet. In contrast, Vong Phaophanit presents Neon Rice Field (pictured), made for the Turner Prize exhibition of 1993. Reminiscent of the artist&apos;s origins in Laos, a former French colony bordering on Vietnam, the installation&apos;s unsettling neon resonance is half muted beneath a field of American long grain rice. rc \u00b7 National Glass Centre, to Mar 24 Pat Graham London Graham is best known as a chronicler of the indie scene in Washington DC in the early-90s. Shooting the likes of Royal Trux, Fugazi and touring with the Make-Up and Modest Mouse, Graham captured a gang of musicians as extreme in their performances as their politics. While on the road, he began to document the detached world of the peripatetic, overnight staying traveller. This exhibition coincides with the publication of a new book that charts the evolution of Washington&apos;s underground music scene, and Graham&apos;s candid images offer us unrestricted access to this world. From the euphoria of being onstage to the dingy motels and remote gas stations, it&apos;s as much a personal diary as a record of an era. jl \u00b7 Rough Trade East, E1, to Feb 1 Thomas Zipp London Black Sabbath provide inspiration for Thomas Zipp&apos;s new show Planet Caravan.

The term N11 was coined in a recent report by Goldman Sachs, and refers to the up-and-coming &quot;Next 11&quot; countries who are snapping at the heels of India, China, Russia and Brazil as investment opportunities - Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, South Korea, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Turkey and Vietnam. Over the past three years, economic growth across Goldman Sachs&apos;s N11 has averaged 5.9%, the strongest in 15 years and more than double the 2.3% average growth of Old Europe. Marian Salzman, an energetic New York trend-spotter at the ad agency JWT, who was one of the first to talk up &quot;Chindia&quot; in 2007, now says that she is &quot;watching N11 with interest&quot;. And where the money goes, there is a good chance that cultural fascination will follow. Peer-to-peer lending Jeremy Gutsche, a Toronto-based trend-spotter who runs the website Trendhunter.com, is a good example of a new breed of trend-spotter who collects insights by cultivating an online community of trend-watchers around the world. In keeping with the egalitarian ethos of the web, Gutsche argues that one of the key financial trends of 2008 will be the growth of person-to-person lending exchanges in which borrowers and lenders come together directly on the web and cut out the banks. Some of these lending operations use an eBay-like auction in which the lender who is willing to provide the lowest interest rate gets the borrower&apos;s loan; others are for people who already know one another but who want someone to help formalise the loan arrangement. A good example of the latter is CircleLending, an American firm in which Richard Branson&apos;s Virgin USA recently acquired a majority stake. Much the same model of &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; lending is slowly working its way into the charitable sector. Outfits such as Kiva.org, for example, put potential &quot;social investors&quot; together with small businesses in the developing world, who promise to send back regular email updates on how the business is doing. Social networking grows up Next year will see online social networking cease to be the preserve of the young. According to data recently released by the European Interactive Advertising Association, 18% of European over-55s now visit a social networking site at least once a month, not far behind the &quot;digital generation&quot; of 16- to 34-year-olds, where 28% access such sites. The past year has seen a 12% jump in these so-called silver surfers, and new social networking forums such as MyChumsClub and Saga Zone are appearing to accommodate older users. Online social networking is maturing in other ways, too. Following concerns that office-bound staff were spending too much of their day on social networking sites such as Facebook - a recent survey concluded that office workers in the UK spend company time worth \u00a3130m each day browsing online - many British firms are now mounting crackdowns against their use. As people get used to juggling a multiplicity of new roles and new rules, says London-based trend-spotter Tamar Kasriel, the result will be to fuel confusion about how personal the personal computer is when it&apos;s at work. Twitchiness among employers, says Kasriel, is largely responsible for the latest internet abbreviation, NSFW, or &quot;not suitable for work&quot;, which bored office workers are increasingly using to preface any material they forward to their friends. Reverse knowledge migration Another solid basis for futurological speculation is to follow the flow of people. Paul Saffo, a respected California-based forecaster, argues that the next few years will see the beginnings of a &quot;reverse knowledge migration&quot; in which, as well as bright and well-educated workers coming from the developing world to the west, people will start to move in the opposite direction. This new global class of &quot;cyber-gypsies&quot;, says Saffo, will not only include American and European Asians returning &quot;home&quot;, but also highly educated, non-Asian Americans and Europeans going off to make their fortunes in places such as China. The trend, he argues, will soon move from a source of sociological curiosity to a source of alarm for governments and businesses. Companies, universities and thinktanks in Europe and America, he warns, who often smugly assumed that they would be a magnet for the world&apos;s talent, are going to discover that this is no longer the case. Handmade on the net For some years now, one staple of futurological speculation has been the quest for authenticity in what seems like an anonymous and artificial world. Witness, for example, the young fashionistas who self-consciously reclaim dreary leisure activities - everything from bingo to choir practice, from quiz nights to knitting - that would have bored even their parents rigid. A new twist on all this, says Reinier Evers of the Amsterdam firm Trendwatching.com, is the sprouting of internet-based ventures that purvey handmade and highly traditional fare. In Switzerland, for example, Netgranny (netgranny.ch) is a collective comprised of 15 cheerful-looking grannies who knit socks on demand and sell them online. Customers can choose their favourite granny by picture, pick the colour of their socks, or opt for a granny &quot;surprise&quot; design. It takes two weeks for a granny to knit a pair of socks; at \u20ac26 (\u00a319) apiece, including delivery, they make an excellent idea for a Christmas gift. Something very similar is being touted by the Danish company Mormor.nu, which sells traditional handmade baby and children&apos;s wear online. Mormor.nu is Danish for &quot;Grandma.now&quot;. All its products are handmade from pure wool, alpaca or cotton. Old knitting and crochet techniques and patterns have been revived, while the colours and materials have been updated. For a dash of extra authenticity, the company&apos;s workers are as steeped in tradition as its products; the youngest member of staff is 68. Likewise, Etsy (etsy.com) is an online marketplace for handmade goods that features more than 26,000 vendors from across the world and sells everything from scented soy candles to a tennis-ball chair. It is only two years old, but so far more than 1m items have been sold and 300,000 people have joined as members. Clubbing together If at first his or her predictions don&apos;t come to pass, the seasoned futurologist can simply hunker down and wait. Nearly a decade ago, for example, the American futurologist Jeremy Rifkin argued that we were all moving into &quot;the age of access&quot; - from an economy in which it was good to own stuff into one in which people would prefer to rent it. Nothing much happened, and people quickly moved on, but just recently the idea is beginning to look more plausible. For those who want to take out a time-share in a dog, for example, 2007 saw the launch in California of a &quot;shared pet ownership&quot; company, FlexPetz; the firm is fast expanding, and is now opening a branch in London. Meanwhile, a new Germany company called L\u00fctte-Leihen is renting out baby clothes to parents of fast-growing young children; several companies, such as Bag, Borrow or Steal in America and Be a Fashionista in the UK, are renting out designer handbags; and the Dutch company Rent-a-Garden is leasing out sculptures and potted plants to those who want to give their back gardens a much needed summertime makeover. Sharing the costs, Salzman points out, is becoming increasingly popular in many different retail sectors. The inexorable rise of &quot;fractional luxury&quot;, for example, is giving not-quite-wealthy-enough people the opportunity to buy a time-share in anything from a racehorse to a jumbo jet. Outfits such as PartialOwner.com and Fractionallife.com are extending the partial-ownership model to everything from homes to luxury cars and restaurants. Art lovers, too, can now buy into syndicates to purchase artwork. ARTvest in Glasgow, for example, was set up last year to enable people to pool their funds and get a foothold in the expensive market for contemporary art. Sharing the costs can be fun, too. Young women in Argentina and elsewhere, Salzman says, are holding clothes-swapping parties in order to share out the costs of getting hold of the latest fashion gear. The new vicarious consumption Ambitious futurologists need credible buzzwords, but good ones are in perilously short supply. One option is to take an old trend off the peg, dust it down a bit and give it a whole new twist. The idea of &quot;vicarious consumption&quot; was first coined 100 years ago by the economist Thorstein Veblen to describe the thrill rich people get when they buy their butler a lovely new uniform. Nowadays, reckons Evers, it is making a comeback in a whole new form. Just as book reviews have become a substitute among many of us for reading books, Evers says, our enthusiasm for endless product reviews is becoming a way through which we can vicariously experience almost anything through the eyes (and sometimes ears) of people who have already been there. Sites dedicated to reading reviews on other people&apos;s experiences, such as iliketotallyloveit.com and ballofdirt.com, offer a heady mixture of entertainment, voyeurism and exhibitionism, and are already quietly attracting millions on the web. DIY education The rise of blogging and self-broadcasting sites such as YouTube as an alternative to TV, says Gutsche, has brought with it a burgeoning demand among people to learn new skills, not from professional educators but from their peers. A good example, he says, is the proliferation of virtual cooking classes on YouTube, in which people persuade each other to experiment with their favourite recipes. Then there are the home videos that take people through the easiest way to unlock or otherwise manipulate their iPhones or other gadgets. The &quot;education&quot; on offer at such sites does not have to be improving. Willitblend.comb, for example, spoofs the growth of DIY education videos by showing viewers how to granulate their iPhones or iPods in a blender. Then there is the popularity of bizarre videos demonstrating that if, for example, you shove a packet of Mentos mints into a bottle of Diet Coke, the whole thing explodes - the YouTube equivalent, it would appear, of the school chemistry experiment. Digital housecleaning One consequence of the matrix of social networking sites such as Facebook and Second Life that are colonising the web is that our private selves are soon going to be on display as never before. In an age of &quot;digital individualism&quot;, in which many of us work so hard to create and customise our identities on the net, it is ironic that all this information ends up stored on an anonymous bank of computer servers, to be cooled by some bored warehouse caretaker. While there is a much greater acceptance among young people of living life in the glare of the net, says Salzman, the lust for digital exhibitionism will soon wither when they come to start looking for a job. With admissions offices and human resources departments increasingly using the web to vet prospective candidates - two-thirds of companies readily admit to keeping tabs on employees by checking social networking sites, according to the British recruitment agency Poolio - a good chunk of the incriminating material whirling around the cybersphere will somehow have to be expunged. MySpace pages will be cleaned up and mass &quot;Facebook suicides&quot; will soon become the norm as young people try to agree a bond of forgetting by deactivating their profiles in unison. Companies will spring up like Reputation Defender, an American firm that promises to search out and destroy all inaccurate, inappropriate, hurtful and slanderous information that exists on its clients. Virtual identity managers Another consequence of the public display of ourselves on the net is that many of us are going to end up hiring professional stand-ins. By 2011, reckon the researchers at technology advice firm Gartner, 80% of internet users and major companies will have avatars, or digital replicas of themselves, for online work and play. Kasriel predicts that this will give rise to a new cadre of independent advisers - what she calls &quot;holistic identity managers&quot; - whose job it will be to garden the internet profiles of business people and keep them on the straight and narrow. Very soon, she believes, it will come as no surprise at all when we learn that high-ranking executives are not writing and updating their own profiles but paying someone else to do it for them. Already, sites such as FakeWebcam.com allow paying people to pre-record videos of themselves and play them on a loop as if they were visible on their webcam. The aesthetically challenged might even think about hiring more attractive stand-ins as well as scriptwriters. For those who can afford it, smile - it&apos;s not you on candid camera.  \u00b7 James Harkin&apos;s book Big Ideas: The Essential Guide to the Latest Thinking will be published in February by Atlantic Books.", "sentences": ["A new twist on all this, says Reinier Evers of the Amsterdam firm Trendwatching.com, is the sprouting of internet-based ventures that purvey handmade and highly traditional fare."], "title": "James Harkin on the shape of things to come", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/dec/18/science.business", "tags": ["Technology", "Science", "Business", "Digital media", "Media"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-12-18T09:27:56Z", "article": "Mid-morning, west London What a joy to read my colleague David Hencke&apos;s scoop on the latest report on Britain&apos;s battered honours list.

The Labour academic was deemed too smart and too independent ever to be made a minister in the Blair-Brown era. It&apos;s not that they&apos;re overburdened with talent, so that must be it.  Good, by the sound of it, that the committee has sensibly refrained from lashing out at the Electoral Commission or at Inspector John Yates of the Yard (I&apos;ve personally demoted him) for getting their own inquiry suspended for 19 months while he tried to bring prosecutions against assorted Blair proteges, several of them so wholesome you could eat your breakfast off them. Far better than blame is to propose solutions to this mess, which is linked both to the party funding problem and to Lords reform. The BBC said this morning that Labour has spent 10 years - shocking - on Lords reform. In fact, Lords reform has been proposed for over 100 years and got virtually nowhere before Blair. For better or worse. The Wright reforms would cause far more headaches for the Tories than for Labour - which is only fair because it&apos;s been their racket for so long, as nice John Major failed to grasp on the Andy Marr show. One Wright proposal I would take issue with is that it will cut the &quot;marketable value&quot; of a peerage if it is decoupled from the right to sit in the Lords. So it should, because nowadays it confuses a social honour with a political honour. My impression has long been that few &quot;social&quot; peers - the kind whose donations to parties ease their way to a peerage in all major parties - want to do the hard graft that involves being an active member of the upper house, all that revising of badly drafted Commons bills. That may be why Tory donor Lord Laidlaw is a persistent tax exile on leave in Monaco.

The Latin medical term for this particular form of insecurity is smalldickitis. I have no idea what it means in English. I WATCHED Gordon Brown&apos;s report to MPs of the EU summit yesterday afternoon. It was pretty dull and earnest, so it generated little attention. Two things were striking. One was that Brown, famous for throwing his weight around in private (I have never actually witnessed it), seems to find it hard to be aggressive in public. As Charlie Kennedy - in a rare intervention - complained, if Brown wants to persuade voters Europe is a good thing he must stop using Eurosceptic and defensive language all the time. It was worse than that. Led by Tieless Dave (not on good form either; they&apos;re all tired) a succession of rightwing Tory MPs who are obsessed with what they perceive to be the Menace of Europe proffered glass chins in the form of daft questions. Brown failed to punch many of them, though he got better as the hour dragged on. Thus he let Bill Cash off, failed to thump a suggestion from nice-but-daft Iain Duncan Smith that Labour MPs should have a free vote on the reform treaty ratification (the Tories are just as divided) and only gently grazed David Heathcoat-Amory. Anyone who can&apos;t thump IDS should worry. Only with John Redwood did he manage to land some sort of a blow. Redwood had also predicted that the 1997 Amsterdam treaty &quot;would abolish Britain. Britain is still here.&quot; Perhaps GB&apos;s No 10 minders ought to wind the boss up by insulting him for 20 minutes (&quot;you&apos;re a wimp&quot;) before they put him into the ring.

Kelly&apos;s admirers recall that when troubled by the List 98 row over child molestation - a fashionable focus of contemporary panic - the then-education secretary marshalled all the facts, then announced actions and survived the tabloid tumult. Yesterday she even took the trouble to look both feminine and smart, not something she used to bother about. The great and always glamorous Barbara Castle would have advised her to try harder. I can hear her saying: &quot;It matters, dear.&quot; TALKING of which, I did feel a bit sorry for one of Darling&apos;s questioners, who spoke of the &quot;calamitous event&quot; whereby HMRC sustained its huge data loss - and proposed a new form of audit - like the NAO and others who audit cash - which would follow such administrative failures. This thoughtful idea came from the aforementioned Tony Wright, chair of the Commons public administration select committee.  Little did he then know that his own committee had just suffered a bit of an audit loss to our own Mr Hencke. But he does now. 4.30pm A lot in politics depends on luck. Nick Clegg is a lucky fellow.

As Huhne&apos;s concession speech made plain, and Clegg&apos;s reinforced, the Lib Dems will unite behind their new leader. But the result is a tricky one, as Ladbrokes were quick to register.  &quot;Will Calamity Clegg outlast Ming?&quot; the bookies asked, before providing their own answer: odds now stand at 1/7 that Clegg will outdo Sir Ming&apos;s 17 months. That is just as much nonsense as suggestions that Gordon Brown will soon step down or - current until early October - that David Cameron would be removed before Christmas after losing the November non-election.  For better or worse, Clegg will lead his party into the 2009-10 general election against Gordon and Dave. Why? Because there is no appetite for a protracted battle: Huhne has lost twice (Campbell beat him by 29,697 to 21,628 in 2006) and the party has again endorsed the safer candidate. It always does, though they do not always turn out to be safe.  Previous party leaders have fallen by the wayside over drink (Charles Kennedy) and (in Jeremy Thorpe&apos;s case) conspiracy to murder (acquitted).  Clegg played it safe during his campaign and his narrow victory may incline him to play it safer yet as the more aggressive, more experienced and proactive candidate - Huhne - watches from the wings.  He will not watch alone: Vince Cable&apos;s interim leadership has set a higher bar of expectation for whichever younger man won. Age, it seems, was not Campbell&apos;s real problem, it was attitude: not enough samba. Clegg is aware of the problem of expectation which he faces.

SellaBand will have a dedicated store on Amazon as well as an affiliate sales deal and promotion to the 50 most active reviewers on The Vine, retail website&apos;s reviewers&apos; programme. Albums by SellaBand acts will retail for \u00a38.99 on Amazon in the UK and revenues will be shared equally between the artists, Sellaband and the fans. Amsterdam-based Sellaband is home to 6,000 new bands and operates as a user-determined record label.  Fans can listen to tracks for free, but support bands by pledging money and once a band reaches $50,000 (\u00a324,830) in investment, Sellaband helps them record an album. To date, 11 bands have reached the $50,000 threshold and three have released albums.  Sellaband makes its money through advertising, sponsorship and through the interest on money invested in the site&apos;s bands, with more than $1.5m (\u00a3745m) invested so far. Johan Vosmeijer, the SellaBand managing director, said the bands have a broad appeal, from heavy metal to jazz and hip hop, and that the site thinks of itself as &quot;the record label of the future&quot;. &quot;The advantage for fans is that they feel part of the activity. There are direct friendships between the bands and their fans, and they even organise their own festivals,&quot; he added. &quot;Record companies are afraid to embrace new technologies and new opportunities because they don&apos;t know what to do with the web. SellaBand discovers and nurtures new bands - it&apos;s a new economic model.&quot; Partnering with Amazon gives Sellaband&apos;s artists a more high--profile platform, and also fits with the user-generated ethos of the retail site, which features extensive reviews and discussion about its products. Amazon will be offering further incentives for bands as they build their audience and investment, adding credits to a band&apos;s account once they reach $30,000 and offering extra promotion for the band once they reach $35,000. SellaBand works with digital distributor The Orchard, one of the suppliers for the iTunes Store, and, under the new deal, through Amazon.  Vosmeijer, who previously worked as general manager for Sony Music, said the site had 150,000 unique users each month but that its priority was the develop its artists, not &quot;global domination&quot;.

The winged silhouette of Earthrace inched up the Thames into London yesterday in preparation for an environmentally friendly assault on the world circumnavigation record. Moored outside the O2 in Greenwich, skipper Pete Bethune from New Zealand said he planned to use nothing but biofuels to power his carbon fibre vessel westwards from Valencia, through the Panama canal, on towards Singapore and back again through Suez - a journey of 26,000 miles. The circumnavigation record stands at 74 days, 23 hours and 53 minutes by Cable and Wireless Adventurer, a British boat which ran on conventional fuel in 1998. Earthrace will sail from Valencia in March next year and is aiming to be back around 65 days later, having negotiated the perils of gun-toting pirates in the Caribbean, floating logs off Borneo and towering 12m high seas in the Pacific - some of the problems faced on the craft&apos;s first failed record attempt this spring. Three heavy storms and problems with the law put paid to that bid. A Guatemalan shark fisherman was killed and another injured when Earthrace hit their boat while sailing at night, which saw Bethune held briefly in prison. None of that was enough to put him off a second attempt and a trained crew will be complemented by paying members of the public in a mission that is equal parts record attempt and evangelical mission to trumpet the value of biofuels in the fight against global warming. Sitting in the cramped cockpit of his 78ft (24m) vessel, Bethune, a former oil industry worker, curses a &quot;dirty&quot; commuter boat which pumps out smoke and jokes he has &quot;swung over to the dark side&quot; by embracing plant power. &quot;The record is just a small part of the package,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to make people aware that biofuels need to be part of our transport energy mix and people should support them should they become available.&quot; The boat is nothing if not eye-catching; &quot;like something out of Dan Dare in the Eagle&quot; said David Noall, the master of the Queen Elizabeth Pier.  Its chiselled prow is designed to pierce waves rather than ride over them and is weighed down by 2.5 tonnes of fuel. By slicing through the biggest swells the boat maintains its speed. The designers told Bethune it would work &quot;like a hot knife through butter&quot;.  &quot;It&apos;s nothing like that,&quot; he said. &quot;In big seas it is brutal and violent. We had a big storm in New Zealand with 12 metre waves and we had five metres of water on top of the windscreen here. The surge of energy works its way through the boat as it goes through the wave.&quot;  The best respite is to strap into the racing car-style seats for the pilot and navigator or to lie on the ship&apos;s beanbag. Otherwise it can be agony, he said. The poundings left one crew member with kidneys so bruised that he urinated blood for 10 days, and another with a dislocated shoulder and cracked ribs. The \u00a33m boat is made from carbon fibre and is powered by two 540 horsepower engines which emit a deafening 85 decibels at cruising speed of 40 knots. The only way of escaping if the boat capsizes is by hacking a hole in the hull with an axe which hangs ominously on the cabin wall, which is otherwise decorated with good luck messages from some of the 100,000 members of the public in 60 cities around the world who have paid \u00a33 to tour the boat.  There are narrow bunks for the five crew members who operate a &quot;hot bed&quot; shift system and sail 24 hours a day when possible. &quot;It&apos;s a small space and it&apos;s hard to cook in rough seas, but you get along and it&apos;s been the best experience,&quot; said Liz Monahan, a 19-year-old volunteer from Maine, who got on the boat 12 days ago in Barcelona and has travelled via Gibralter and Lisbon to London. Adam Carlson, a 21-year-old sailor trained on combat boats in the Swedish navy, has been on board for the last four and a half months. He has tied up Earthrace in Hamburg, Amsterdam and Paris after they sailed up the Seine for two days and moored beside the Place de la Concorde. &quot;For sure we will break the record,&quot; he said over the noise of the engines. &quot;We have a really competent crew and we are having a refit in Valencia with experts from all across Europe coming to help us out.&quot; Bethune, who knows the dangers, is less sure and puts their chances at 50/50. &quot;The boat is fast enough to get the record, but you don&apos;t go round the world without having dramas on the way,&quot; he said. &quot;You pass through some of the most dangerous waterways in the world. We were east of Nicaragua earlier this year and a vessel approached us which looked just like pirates. There were five guys with M-16 assault rifles. We started to pull away and they caught us up and said they were navy but we weren&apos;t stopping so they opened fire. There are a couple of bullet holes in the boat from where they shot at us. And for example in Borneo, the fishermen tow logs out into the water to attract fish but they are dangerous for carbon hulled boats. If you hit one at 30 knots you are going down.

VS Naipaul. Eamonn McCabe The debates raging this year over the appointment of celebrities to prize committees and their stewardship by oleaginous former MPs seem all the more downmarket when considering who was on the 1971 Booker panel: John Fowles, Saul Bellow, Lady Antonia Fraser and Philip Toynbee with the respected critic John Gross as chair. Perhaps, however, the experience of 1971 was enough to make the prize organisers think twice about including so many free-thinking intellectual heavyweights again. While Gross would cheerily describe the books he had to read as &quot;rather a good lot&quot;, Fowles, never one to mince his words said (probably more accurately): &quot;Some of the publishers&apos; entries were insults to the judges and the others on their lists.&quot; Bellow meanwhile declared that: &quot;Five per cent were interesting,&quot; and added: &quot;For the rest it was like meeting virgins, who are neither wise nor foolish, but just bald.&quot; Most egregiously of all, and thus proving that the contemporary debate about whether the prize should go to the writer or the book (pace Ian McEwan and Amsterdam), Bellow also let slip that the prize had gone to: &quot;the best writer, but not the best book.&quot; He did so a full month before the prize was due to be officially announced, and, in fact, a week before the shortlist was even published. I&apos;ve been unable to discover which book Bellow actually thought better than In A Free State, but that&apos;s by-the-by. Perhaps the most striking thing about the statement is that everybody seems to have assumed from it that VS Naipaul was going to win, even though other contenders included Doris Lessing and Elizabeth Taylor. The Trinidadian titan&apos;s status in 1971 was especially high, before all those memoirs complaining about his all-elbows personality and after a remarkable decade of writing beginning with A House For Mr Biswas. This breakthrough comic masterpiece, still regarded as one of his best, had been produced at a price, however. The strain of writing it left him, he said, &quot;a changed man&quot;. He also noted sadly: &quot;One has been damaged.&quot; That damage appears most starkly in his Booker winner. The good humour of his earlier books has been replaced by something harder and sharper, full of loathing and disgust. Something cruel even, although made all the sadder by Naipaul&apos;s equally strong compassion. Even in those early days a spot of minor controversy flared up because of the book&apos;s being a story suite rather than one whole novel. Two short stories, One Out of Many and Tell Me Who to Kill, and the novella In A Free State are book-ended by two fragments of travel journal The Tramp At Piraeus and The Circus At Luxor. All concern different people and are in fact, set in very different places and even climates. All five are united, however, as studies of characters who are not in their native countries, of alienation, of racial tension and of sudden unpredictable shifts in power. The Tramp At Piraeus is the literary equivalent of a maestro flexing his fingers, testing his theme with a few chords and melody lines before plunging into the main piece. It&apos;s a profoundly uncomfortable description of the bullying of a mentally ill English tramp by two Libyans and a German on a ship sailing from Greece. One of the most exquisitely painful short pieces I have read for a long time, tense and tragic, with no word out of place and no word superfluous, it actually promises more than the rest of the book can deliver. The two short stories One Out Of Many and Tell Me Who To Kill are impressive enough, but not so brilliantly realised. It&apos;s possible for instance to detect inconsistencies of voice in Naipaul&apos;s supposedly barely literate, but actually very learned sounding, protagonist in Tell Me Who To Kill. The final squib is equally discomfiting, but featuring as it does some stereotypically chic and heartless Italians and indistinguishable Chinese characters, it leaves something of a sour aftertaste. The main chunk of the book, In A Free State, meanwhile, is a flawed masterpiece. It&apos;s easy to see why contemporary reviewers described this novella as a &quot;Conradian tour de force&quot;. Obsessed with savagery, cruelty, the human facility for violent sadism and unleashing horror, this story of a long drive to a place where there&apos;s &quot;nothing to do&quot; undertaken by two British acquaintances in a former African colony, is a worthy heir to Heart Of Darkness. Interestingly, although the writer has recently suggested he has no literary influences, at the time of writing he was happy to acknowledge a debt to Ibsen. There&apos;s definitely something of the Scandinavian playwright in the intensity of the dialogue that the two travelling companions engage in, not to mention the air of doom that hangs over the whole. There&apos;s also plenty that is Naipaul&apos;s own, however. He inhabits the minds of his protagonists totally and never flinches at unveiling their darker parts of their characters - the way they think &quot;Africans&quot; &quot;stink&quot;, their own self-hatred, their lack of purpose, the depths to which they will sink in order to survive. There are some superb set pieces (particularly an uncomfortable night in a hotel run by a colonel who bullies and rages at his native staff, but knows they will soon kill him). As the drive becomes a race against time and impending civil war, the tension is ratcheted up with accomplished skill. On top of all that, of course, there is the exquisite prose. It seems churlish then to complain about such a fine piece of writing. But I did have some grumbles. In contrast to his ability to lay bare the psychology of racism, Naipaul&apos;s depiction of a homosexual is clumsy. Bobby, the male half of the dysfunctional lead duo, is something of a gay caricature. He&apos;s arrogant, highly-strung, masochistic, full of &quot;cunt&quot; hatred and pathetically weak and needy when it comes to his &quot;adventures&quot; with local men. The portrayals of these &quot;natives&quot; meanwhile, may well be deliberately wafer-thin, presumably in order to reflect the way the Europeans view them, but they remain correspondingly unsatisfying. Finally, there&apos;s an intangible quality missing that makes it hard to warm to this book, in spite of its dazzling prose. As Naipaul&apos;s sometime editor Diana Athill said of the bulk of his later works, &quot;they impress, but they do not charm.&quot; There&apos;s no doubt, pace Bellow, that Naipaul deserves a Booker. Whether this is the right work for the award, however, is another question... Next time: a short diversion to the Hugo awards and the first novel to win it: Alfred Bester&apos;s The Demolished Man.

Pulling crackers. Watching the Queen&apos;s speech. Decorating the tree. Attending midnight Mass. Listening to Bing Crosby. In our increasingly secularised and fragmented society, many of us still cling to the rituals of Christmas as a common and comforting bond. But there are also an ever-growing number of us who say &quot;bah, humbug&quot; to it all and head for the nearest airport in search of some winter sun. According to the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA), an incredible 3.5m of us will travel abroad over this Christmas and New Year. Heathrow alone will handle - perhaps that&apos;s too generous a word - around 1.2 million passengers. We live, of course, in age where extended family doesn&apos;t just mean you might have an aunt who lives in Perth, Scotland, but rather Perth, Australia. But not all these journeys abroad are to meet up with distant relatives - far from it. &quot;Lucky holidaymakers will be swapping thermals for bikinis and turkey for curry or tapas, with the Canary Islands, Egypt and Goa topping the list,&quot; says Abta. &quot;Many are also beating the Christmas sales rush by heading off to Dubai for cheap prices, great shopping and five-star luxury.&quot; It says that city breaks are also very popular at this time of year, too, with Paris, Amsterdam, Dublin and New York among the most visited cities by Britons. The era of cheap flights has liberated us from having to spend a tense and dreary few days with the in-laws. Now we can escape it all and spend the time away, on our own terms. This is just one of the many reasons why more and more people choose to fly, not just in the UK but across the world, and why politicians are so hesitant to reign in this growth, despite the considerable - and fast growing - climate-change impact of aviation. On Thursday, EU ministers finally agreed to the terms and conditions of how aviation will enter the European carbon emissions trading scheme. But under considerable pressure from the aviation lobby, the original proposals were predictably watered down. Instead of entering the scheme in 2011, aviation will now enter in 2012. Airlines will only have to buy 10% of the permits at auction, meaning that they are gifted the rest which, in theory, will enable them to make a considerable profit by passing on the cost to passengers. And the cap is based on 2004-6 emissions rather than the 1990 norm applied to most other sectors. With the US threatening a trade war if the EU actually proceeds with this scheme - it still needs approval from MEPs - it seems that aviation will forever be treated as the favourite child, getting far more generous and larger presents than any of its siblings. Whereas most of the other major sectors responsible for considerable emissions - steel, concrete, power stations, car manufacturers, mining etc - are having to face up to a future of deep cuts in emissions, aviation is being treated with kid gloves, as it has always been when you consider its laughable tax liability. The aviation industry is often heard asking why it is being singled out for attention by climate change campaigners. The reason is simple: it is the fastest-growing source of emissions and is displaying little attempt, like most other sectors, to tackle its emissions. It is also a source of emissions that can be classified as &quot;non essential&quot; - two-thirds of passengers passing through UK airports are leisure travellers, as opposed to business travellers or what the industry refers to as VFRs (visiting friends and relatives). We don&apos;t need to go on cheap shopping trips to Dubai, whereas we do need power to heat our homes and cook our food. With that in mind, aviation would come quite far down a list of necessary emissions. But no one is saying let&apos;s lock up all the planes in hangars somewhere and throw away the keys. Aviation is clearly an important industry and we will continue to &quot;need&quot; to fly in some circumstances. But we, as a society, urgently need to have a debate about whether it deserves its current special status over and above all other sectors that makes flying so cheap that we can go shopping in Dubai for Christmas bargains. Surely it should be the same rules for all? And if any sector is going to be given special dispensation to pollute, it should be one that meets more of humanity&apos;s essential needs than aviation? The simple and unpalatable truth is that aviation will have to become more proportionately expensive in coming years - whether emissions trading or oil price rises causes this first is open to debate - so that the kind of binge flying that is becoming habitual among many now is curtailed. If aviation is to be kept within the strait jacket proposed by the EU emissions trading scheme then flying can&apos;t be an impulsive act of whimsy any longer, but that of need. It is not the people who go on holiday to the Mediterranean once a year, or only fly to see a relative at Christmas, who are largest source of the problem. It is the still relatively small, but growing, percentage of flyers who take multiple flights a year - often to visit their second-homes, incidentally, but that&apos;s a debate for another time perhaps - because they can afford to due to such cheap deals. If we are serious about managing emissions, we just can&apos;t afford to let flying off to grab a few days of cheap winter sun become yet another Christmas ritual.", "sentences": ["&quot;Many are also beating the Christmas sales rush by heading off to Dubai for cheap prices, great shopping and five-star luxury.&quot; It says that city breaks are also very popular at this time of year, too, with Paris, Amsterdam, Dublin and New York among the most visited cities by Britons."], "title": "Getting burnt by the winter sun", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/21/gettingburntbythewintersun", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Religion", "Transport", "UK news", "Environment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-12-21T23:55:56Z", "article": "Police serve hash cake to cannabis suspect  A man being held on suspicion of growing cannabis got an unintended treat in his lunch - a piece of hash cake. &quot;It was an accident,&quot; Alwin Don, a police spokesman, said yesterday.

Violet Durling, who had worked for the royal couturier Sir Norman Hartnell, died after Susan Turner, 48, from Barkingside, east London, started a blaze in a workshop below the flat where Durling lived. A jury at the Old Bailey heard that Turner, who had been adopted, felt she had suffered financially at the hands of her family. Jurors in a previous trial earlier this year had failed to reach a verdict. Turner was convicted at the second trial after prosecutors were allowed to present crucial forensic evidence. The court heard that a partial DNA profile of the killer was detected on a blue bottle top, from an accelerant container, found at the scene. Turner, who represented herself, had denied having anything to do with her aunt&apos;s death. &quot;I loved my aunt, I would never have hurt my aunt,&quot; she told the court. &quot;All I have ever done was try to protect her, that&apos;s all.&quot; Turner had already inherited more than \u00a3100,000 in her adopted father&apos;s will. But after killing her aunt she went on a &quot;ferocious&quot; spending spree around Europe, jurors were told. Peter Kyte QC, prosecuting, said she felt hostility to the rest of her family and that she had been &quot;badly-treated financially&quot;. He said her behaviour had been bizarre and erratic in the days leading up to the murder. Durling, who the court heard was close to her niece, had made a will in 2001 in which she left the business to Turner, her brother Siddie, and their sister, with the remainder of the estate being left to Turner and her two daughters. But a month before Durling&apos;s death Turner unsuccessfully tried to have the will changed so that the whole of the business passed to her. She was already going through her previous inheritance at &quot;quite a rate&quot; and had spent \u00a350,000 by the time of her aunt&apos;s death. On February 17 last year Siddie Durling closed up the family shop in Plaistow, east London, which specialised in reconditioning car engines. An employee opened up on Monday morning to discover there had been a fire and found Durling&apos;s body in the kitchen of the flat upstairs. Fire investigators discovered containers of brake fluid, which they believed had been used to start the blaze. The main fire on a shelf in the shop, whose fumes were thought to be the likely cause of Durling&apos;s death, was doused when water stored on a shelf above fell on it. But whoever started the fire then tried to light another blaze on the stairs leading up to her flat. There was no sign of forced entry so whoever started the fire must have let themselves in or have been let in by Durling, the jury heard. Burnt items of clothing were found in a barbecue at Turner&apos;s home after Durling&apos;s death. Turner had by then already fled on a one-way ticket to Amsterdam, from where she also travelled to France, Italy and Spain. She was finally arrested in August last year after returning to Britain. The case was adjourned until February 11 so a QC could be instructed to appear on Turner&apos;s behalf at a sentencing hearing.", "sentences": ["Turner had by then already fled on a one-way ticket to Amsterdam, from where she also travelled to France, Italy and Spain."], "title": "Niece found guilty of murdering 100-year-old aunt for inheritance", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/22/ukcrime.uknews4", "tags": ["UK news", "Crime"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-12-22T23:48:01Z", "article": "Somewhere in my pre-Christmas clutch of invitations is one for a book launch that, although organised by friends, I have put in a mental box marked &quot;optional&quot;.

Drop a small spoonful of batter into the fat - it should puff and turn golden brown after about a minute. Dip two spoons into the hot fat, then use them to scoop up a tablespoon of batter and slide it into the oil. Fry three or four at a time, turning them so they cook evenly. Drain on kitchen towel, and repeat. Give them a hefty dredge of icing sugar, and serve.

Over the 12 days of Christmas I&apos;ve already committed a number of crimes, but they are piddling in comparison. The Christmas carbon crimes include: \u0095 Driving out to the countryside for a big walk (which always seems completely illogical, but how else are you supposed to get there? Tell me that please) \u0095 Letting the children sit in front of the TV in the morning so that I can get a bit of a Christmas lie-in \u0095 Succumbing to the lure of teeny things to stuff into the boys&apos; stockings because it turns me briefly into a super-heroine \u0095 Having a Christmas tree - although latest thinking on this, is that it&apos;s okay! Hurrah! \u0095 Hanging up my beloved twinkling Xmas lights and bickering with the boys about which setting we prefer \u0095 Leaving lots of lights on because the house is full and it&apos;s Christmas for goodness sake \u0095 Cooking enough food  to stuff my whole family and produce our own mini-mushroom cloud of methane gas.  But these are such piddling offences, really.  I find myself rolling possibilities around my mind at the oddest times: after a couple of weeks of this I&apos;ve narrowed them down and decided that if I was really rich, and climate change didn&apos;t exist, and there was no war and famine and everyone loved each other blah blah, then I&apos;d fly to Amsterdam for a lovely weekend away with my husband, and maybe fly to Thailand for a week of doing sod all, and after that I&apos;d buy a classic old car, one of those slightly boxy early 1980s Jaguar XJSs and I&apos;d drive around in it with the windows down and very loud music playing and big thick sunglasses on, and then I&apos;d have three huge deep baths in one day, with a glass of Australian white wine and a large bowl of out-of-season strawberries.

What would you do?", "sentences": ["I find myself rolling possibilities around my mind at the oddest times: after a couple of weeks of this I&apos;ve narrowed them down and decided that if I was really rich, and climate change didn&apos;t exist, and there was no war and famine and everyone loved each other blah blah, then I&apos;d fly to Amsterdam for a lovely weekend away with my husband, and maybe fly to Thailand for a week of doing sod all, and after that I&apos;d buy a classic old car, one of those slightly boxy early 1980s Jaguar XJSs and I&apos;d drive around in it with the windows down and very loud music playing and big thick sunglasses on, and then I&apos;d have three huge deep baths in one day, with a glass of Australian white wine and a large bowl of out-of-season strawberries."], "title": "Guilty carbon pleasures", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethicallivingblog/2007/dec/28/carbonfantasies", "tags": ["Ethical and green living", "Environment", "Life and style", "Carbon footprints", "Travel and transport", "Transport", "UK news", "Greenhouse gas emissions"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-12-29T23:39:11Z", "article": "To buy tickets for gigs overseas, go to the artist&apos;s website and follow the link to the official agent, or try Ticketmastereurope.com.

I can hardly conceive how the city of my birth will reshape itself in coming years. Post-hurricane devastation and the loss of half its population could lead to a renaissance, as happened in San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. Or it could splutter out in an exploitative mess fuelled by developers and bureaucrats. I plan to reacquaint myself with those classic New Orleans experiences that tourists used to take for granted - brunch at the Court of Two Sisters, dinner at Commander&apos;s Palace, and any bar that serves Dixie Blackened Voodoo beer ice-cold.  MATT TURNER Editor, hotel design magazine Sleeper Of the 50-plus hotels that are scheduled to open in Beijing for the Olympics next year, none will hold a torch to the new Mandarin Oriental. It is part of the China Central Television headquarters and will be housed in its own iconic structure, with two restaurants linked via a champagne bar suspended above a dramatic staircase with stunning views of the optical illusion that is the main CCTV building.  At the other end of the design spectrum will be The Other Side in Neiden (theotherside.no), Norway, which opens in the spring close to the Russian border. Guests will be met at the airport by husky sleigh and taken to a resort perched on a plateau overlooking salmon rivers, Arctic tundra and the Barents Sea, with interior design inspired by the culture of the local Sami people. The hotel promises &apos;an extreme take on modern luxury&apos;, &apos;otherworldly shamanism&apos;, and a chance to see the northern lights. Sounds good to me. SARA HENRICHS Travel editor, *Wallpaper In the spring I hope to go to Miami for the opening of the Mondrian South Beach (mondriansouthbeach.com), designed by multiple award-winning Marcel Wanders. It&apos;s a sister hotel to the Delano. Wanders promises that the South Beach will be his &apos;Sleeping Beauty&apos; creation. The exterior boasts a 16-storey wall of artwork that will be visible throughout the Miami Beach area, while a floating, elliptical, black-lacquered staircase leads guests away from the lobby, where vast digital images inspired by fairy tales will play against the walls.  STEPHEN BAYLEY The Observer&apos;s design critic Nice is one of my very favourite places. I suffer from the Englishman&apos;s hopelessly sentimental view of the south of France, but that apart, it&apos;s still a wonderful city: sophisticated and cosmopolitan or rough and romantic, according to choice. You can have a fine glass of champagne or a pissaladiere (the local take on pizza) and a tumbler of Provencal ros\u00e9, depending on where you are. I&apos;ve been going there often since 1981, but for the past few years enjoyment has been compromised because the vast Place Massena has been excavated for tramways, turning the centre of the city into a building site. I&apos;m looking forward to Nice getting back to its familiar sunny chaos in 2008. THE TOUR OPERATORS TOM BARBER Director, Original Travel  I&apos;m excited about the Musandam Peninsula in Oman. It&apos;s separated from the rest of the country by the UAE and is totally unspoilt with mountainous scenery and great diving. The Evason Hideaway Zighy Bay (sixsenses.com/hideaway-zighybay) opening in January, sits on a huge bay. You can get there by boat, by four-wheel-drive over mountains - or you can paraglide in.  Closer to home, I think Romania&apos;s one to watch. The Danube Delta is beautiful and unspoilt and you get all the African birds on their migration route to Europe in April and May. It&apos;s the best wildlife experience you can have without going to Africa. You can stay at a new eco-lodge, The Delta Nature Resort (deltaresort.com). VICTORIA MCCLELLANDProduct director, Wellbeing Escapes  There&apos;s been a big shift from traditional spas to wellness resorts. Rather than pampering experiences, people are looking for longer-lasting substantial health benefits. They want a measure of self-improvement that they can incorporate into their lives back home. Ayurvedic treatments will continue to be big in 2008. Of all the Ayurvedic resorts, the Kalari Kovilakom in Kerala, India (kalarikovilakom.com) is perhaps the most powerful. It&apos;s really strict and really authentic and the results last.  Brazil is coming up in the wellness market. It&apos;s not really been on most people&apos;s radar, but the resorts there are trying to do something interesting, using local artisans and products. At some luxury spas you feel as though you could be anywhere in the world, but in Brazil they feel wholly authentic and unique to that country. The Kiaroa Eco-Luxury Resort (kiaroa.com) is fantastic. You fly into Salvador and then take a small plane to a private landing strip on the Marau peninsula. The spa is fabulous and there are just 28 rooms in 24 acres of lush jungle, fringed by beaches of gorgeous white sand. TOM MARCHANTManaging director, Black Tomato Panama looks set to explode in 2008. It&apos;s stunningly beautiful, with amazing beaches and rainforest. The canal is incredible: it starts in an industrial zone and then emerges into open water dotted with tiny islands full of monkeys. It&apos;s a cool place to kayak, despite the crocodiles. Panama City&apos;s Unesco-protected Old Town is special, with its French and Spanish heritage - atmospheric and safe. It&apos;s easy to explore the city&apos;s jazz bars and cafes. One of the best eco-lodges is Coral Lodge, Bocas del Toro (blacktomato.co.uk/experiences/escape+time/a+secret+ paradise), with over-water villas, pristine rainforest and mangrove kayaking. We are seeing a lot more interest in the Syrian capital, Damascus. It&apos;s like Marrakesh was 20 years ago, all crumbling city walls, amazing souks, mosques and coffee houses where the aroma is so dense you can almost feel it. The fact that it&apos;s only a six-hour flight away makes it a viable long-weekend destination. The city&apos;s first boutique hotel, the Al Mamlouka (almamlouka.com) recently opened in a 17th-century house in the Christian quarter of the Old City. It&apos;s been refurbished in traditional style and some of the rooms still have 200-year-old Christian frescos on the ceilings. TONY HOPKINS  Director of products, Thomas Cook  The latest destination to make a splash is Port Ghalib on the Red Sea in Egypt. It&apos;s a remote stretch of unspoilt coastline, perfect for diving and snorkelling. The resort is new, having opened its doors to the paying public in November. The area offers rolling hills, desert terrain and coral reefs, not to mention ancient monuments locally and in the adjacent Nile Valley. We&apos;re featuring a four-star hotel, the Sun Oasis. It&apos;s ideal for families and those looking to take advantage of local activities. THE HOTEL GURUS  JAMES LOHAN Founder, Mr &amp; Mrs Smith hotel guides  Since having a child a few months ago, I&apos;m trying to stay closer to home. Fortunately, in Wales, the sprucing up of time-locked coastal havens has brought boutique hotels, delis and craft shops, which have sprinkled just the right amount of style dust over extraordinarily scenic surroundings. Cardigan Bay has hidden coves and sweeping river estuaries. Hurst House (hurst-house.co.uk) in Carmarthen Bay has reopened after a huge overhaul, and as well as seductive rooms, it has a helipad, a spa, a swimming pool, and a fire-breathing dragon sculpture in the courtyard. At the other end of the spectrum, The Drawing Room near Powys (the-drawing-room.co.uk) is a discreet three-bedroom hideaway. The owners describe it as a restaurant with rooms, and while it is unashamedly food-centric, it would be a mistake to think the rooms are an afterthought. NIKKI TINTO Founder, hotel website i-escape.com Luang Prabang in Laos is a hotbed of boutique hotels. It&apos;s a beautiful spiritual city on the banks of the Mekong, famed for its cafes and bars and Buddhist temples. It has always been on the backpacker trail, but is moving into the mainstream. Our favourites are La Residence Phou Vao (residencephouvao.com/web/plua/laos.jsp) - which is the best in town. The Apsara (theapsara.com) is the best budget option, with colourful interiors, super-stylish rooms and an easy-going ambiance. Siem Riep in Cambodia also has some lovely new boutique hotels. You could spend three or four days exploring the temples and into the jungle. The speedboats linking Siem Riep with Phnom Penh used to be basic affairs serving backpackers, but now we&apos;re seeing new, sophisticated luxury craft plying the route. It&apos;s mainly French ex-pats who are driving the new trade, investing heavily in the area&apos;s tourist infrastructure. Our favourite top-end hotel is the newly opened Heritage Suites (i-escape.com/heritagesuiteshotel.php), but the budget Hanuman Alaya (i-escape.com/hanumanalaya.php) is no less charming.  ALASTAIR SAWDAY Publisher, Special Places to Stay accommodation guides When I read about Count Kalnoky&apos;s Romanian guesthouses (transylvaniancastle.com/kalnoky.html) I was so excited I almost had to be restrained. They were mostly built in the 1800s and have been beautifully restored to keep their Transylvanian character, with big gardens and storks nesting on nearby rooftops. There are woodstoves, luscious bathrooms, a sauna and billiard room and a sense of distance.  Miklosvar is a remote village with little infrastructure. There may be an occasional electricity failure and the village streets remain unpaved and pot-holed. Perhaps it is a bit crude to want to enjoy something so removed from the experiences of the local people. But a combination of a country so long ignored and troubled, and a great house of such character, is hard not to long for. HERBERT YPMA Creator, Hip Hotels Tangalle in Sri Lanka must surely be one of the few remaining secrets the Indian Ocean has left to offer. Guests at the new Amanwella resort (amanresorts.com) get three things: a beautiful beach all to themselves; architecture and design inspired by Sri Lanka&apos;s legendary Geoffrey Bawa; and the level of personal indulgence and luxury that Aman has specialised in. I&apos;d also like to go to the Maldives, which is very underrated as a family destination. Each resort is on its own island so you can&apos;t lose your kids, and the water isn&apos;t deep. At resorts such as Soneva Fushi (sixsenses.com) they can cycle around the island, watch films on the sand and stay in a room that has a slide into a swimming pool. For those with a taste for contemporary luxury and a short attention span, I&apos;d recommend the W Retreat &amp; Spa (starwoodhotels.com/whotels). With three vastly different restaurants, god knows how many bars, a spa complex that looks like something out of an architecture competition, it&apos;s a tiny little power house of an island. THE ADVENTURERS  AMANDA MARKS Managing director, fair-trade travel company Tribes There&apos;s a lot of really good stuff going on in Zambia at the moment. It has always been known for its walking safaris but there&apos;s much more than that, from boating safaris on the Zambesi to excellent fishing. The lodges are fantastic, the guiding is wonderful, it&apos;s properly wild and a lot of tourism is done ethically, from safaris with people like Robin Pope and Norman Carr, to smaller operators - and the anti-poaching measures in Zambia are great.  I&apos;m planning to take my family to South Africa in the summer. We&apos;re going to the Pafuri Camp (pafuri.com) in the northern part of the Kruger National Park, which is ideal for walking safaris. I know my sons, who are seven and 10, will love it. We&apos;re then going to the Shiluvari Lake Lodge by the Limpopo. The Venda tribe live there and it&apos;s home to lots of artists. JONNY BEALBY Founder, adventure travel company Wild Frontiers I am looking forward to the colourful Shandor Polo Festival in northern Pakistan which, combined with a short walk in the Hindu Kush, will represent a classic adventure trip. We&apos;ll be running a trip there in July. At 3,800m, it&apos;s the highest polo ground in the world and I&apos;ve heard it&apos;s an extraordinary spectacle. Chitral and Gilgit - the Man United and Liverpool of Pakistani polo - come together for three days of competition ending in a grudge match overseen by the president and 20,000 fanatical locals. With canvas tents, campfires and various sideshows and events, it&apos;s a scene that resembles the eve of some medieval battle.  HILARY BRADT Founder, Bradt Travel Guides From 1 April all pensioners in England can travel free on local buses in any area of the country. So in spring my friend and I will see if we can travel all the way from Land&apos;s End to the Wash without paying. We expect to augment the bus travel with a spot of hitchhiking. The route and time taken will be entirely in the lap of the gods.  Travel trends for 2008? My hunch is that more people will want to go on expedition cruises rather than conventional ones. Silversea Cruises (silversea.com) is adding a small (150 passengers) ship to its fleet, but this will visit unusual destinations and use Zodiacs (inflatable boats) to land in remote areas and uninhabited islands. CHARLIE HOPKINSON Director, overland expedition company, Dragoman Our overland trip from Istanbul to Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan is selling phenomenally well for 2008. But it&apos;s the Georgia part of the trip that we&apos;re excited about. It&apos;s a stunning country - like Europe 50 years ago. Our trip includes Georgian home stays with local families, plenty of Georgian wine and food, and walks in the Caucasus. Our demographics are changing at Dragoman. The 40-plus market has taken off. The average age of the next St Petersburg trip, for example, is 43. Whereas the younger traveller still comes to us saying they want to follow the well-trodden hedonistic path used by their peers, the older travellers are looking for challenging trips, through challenging terrain. We&apos;re having to look at our programmes to cater for this demographic - more hotels and less camping, and shorter hours on the road - removing the rough edges.  THE HEDONISTS PETE TONG DJ The new Fasano Hotel in Rio (fasano.com.br) has become a home from home for me since it opened on Ipanema beach last summer. It&apos;s almost perfect, not too over-styled, just how you would want your own apartment. I will be staying there in February for the carnival. I will also be travelling to Sao Paulo and Curitiba in south-east Brazil. It&apos;s all part of the Bacardi B-Live global music and cultural exchange, where artists collaborate to give local singer-songwriters the chance to work with internationally renowned musicians. For next summer, Mykonos is the hot clubbing destination. Its beauty blows me away. One of the two hottest clubs there is Cavo Paradiso (cavoparadiso.gr), on the top of a hill with an awe-inspiring view. The party goes on all night and until the middle of the next day, with partygoers spreading down the cliffs all the way down to the other hot club, the Paradise Club (paradiseclub-mykonos.com). TREMAYNE CAREW POLE Publisher, Hedonist&apos;s Guides I had an amazing time in Sierra Leone - it&apos;s got the most beautiful beaches, big game fishing, elephants, leopards and lions, and it&apos;s just a six-hour flight from London. The infrastructure is very basic but it&apos;s one to watch. Otherwise the Central Asian &apos;stans&apos;, especially Kazakhstan, are very interesting right now. We launched a Hedonist&apos;s Guide to Almaty in November. It&apos;s where Moscow was 10 years ago, very exciting and vibrant, with that slight air of Russian decadence because of all the petro-dollars floating through. The nightlife is meant to be fantastic and on the doorstep is a wild, rugged land of steppes, mountains and lakes. NEIL GREENWAY Creator, efestivals.co.uk British festivals are set for a tricky 2008 - this year&apos;s atrocious summer means people will probably wait to see what the weather&apos;s like before booking. I&apos;m going to Wychwood and Guilfest because they&apos;re small, friendly and civilised. Endorse It (lgofestivals.com) in Dorset (8-10 August) is a crap name, but a nice festival with lots of ska and reggae and an old-style feel, as if a group of friends have put up a stage in a field. Festivals abroad are growing in stature, especially in Eastern Europe. Tickets to Opener (opener.pl) in Gdansk, Poland (4 -6 July) cost \u00a340, which means you can buy a ticket, fly there and get drunk all weekend for the cost of a ticket to Reading - and it has most of the same acts.  RALPH MOORE Assistant editor, Mixmag If you want cutting-edge electronic music, the next place to blow (after Berlin of course) will be Bucharest, Romania. The biggest techno record across Europe this summer was a remix of St Germain&apos;s &apos;Rose Rouge&apos; by Raresh, a young Romanian DJ who is leading the charge in Bucharest, along with Rhadoo and Petre Ispirescu. There&apos;s an excitement in the city because they are discovering quality techno for the first time. Our spies tell us that the key clubs are Krystal Glam (clubkristal.ro) and Webclub (thewebclub.ro), which are visited by Ibiza/Cocoon DJ legends such as Luciano and Ricardo Villalobos. I haven&apos;t been yet, but it&apos;s definitely on the agenda for 2008. THE ETHICAL TRAVELLERS  MARK SMITH Creator, rail information website Seat61.com This year we&apos;ll see Amsterdam becoming a European rail destination to rival Paris and Brussels. Since the high-speed line to the Channel Tunnel was completed in November, you&apos;ve been able to hop on a Eurostar in central London, make one quick change in Brussels, and reach Amsterdam in about five-and-a-half hours, with no airport blues. But a new high-speed line across the Netherlands, opening late next year, will cut London-Amsterdam to four hours 10 minutes, city centre to city centre, changing in Brussels. You can also now combine the city with Prague, Vienna, Milan, Copenhagen or Warsaw, thanks to the recent launch of new &apos;City Night Line&apos; sleeper services from Amsterdam (bahn.de/citynightline). GREG STEVENSON Owner, Under the Thatch, an ethical cottage rental company  I set up Under the Thatch in Wales to preserve traditional buildings and local communities. I&apos;d love to do something similar in Eastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria. Property developers - many of them British - have been buying up 10 houses at a time, wonderful stone-tiled buildings. They&apos;re either being left empty and will eventually rot, or being modernised really badly. At Under the Thatch, we restore sensitively and drop the prices until the cottages fill, so we can employ people all year round. In Bulgaria there&apos;s a risk that buildings that have been preserved by poverty will be ruined by people who see it as the new Costa del Sol.  LUCY SIEGLEEthical columnist, The Observer This year we&apos;ll see a rise in the standard and variety of homegrown &apos;eco-ware&apos; hotels. The Andaz (formerly the Great Eastern) on Liverpool Street is at the vanguard (andaz.com). It has a fairtrade purchasing policy, intelligent lighting, a super-duper heating system and water reduction policy, and it sources food and drinks locally. All of which means you can have a break in the city without leaving a footprint the size of greater London.  Travellers are beginning to realise that the term &apos;no-frills airline&apos; is shorthand for &apos;intense misery&apos;, what with the security queues, the being barked at like an errant two-year-old, and the cancellations - never mind the carbon emissions. This really could be the age of the train. I quite fancy a &apos;deluxe compartment&apos; on the Danube Express (danube-express.com). Billed as a luxury &apos;hotel on wheels&apos;, from May it will run from Budapest to cities including Istanbul, Prague, Krakow and Berlin, pulled by a modern, electric locomotive.  SIAN BERRY Green Party candidate for Mayor of London I&apos;ve spent much of 2007 travelling around the UK doing research for my book, 50 Ways to Greener Travel. I have noticed a huge swing towards people taking domestic holidays in the old-school places: seaside resorts and national parks. We have the most stunning coastline, beaches and countryside in the world. It&apos;s a pity the train companies aren&apos;t doing much about high fares and complicated booking procedures. Though if you take a carful of people, it&apos;s as efficient for your carbon footprint as travelling by train. More and more people I know are planning to take the train to Europe. Even my non-green friends are turning their backs on low-cost flying, keen to rediscover the romance of rail travel. Can there be anything more romantic than a sleeper cabin? And some of them are even talking about InterRailing in 2008, now it&apos;s open to all ages. Personally, I&apos;d love to go to Copenhagen - the cycling capital of Europe.  THE LUXURY LOVERS GLEN DONOVAN Founder, luxury travel company Earth  I&apos;m very excited by Brazil. We&apos;ve discovered some great new boats - converted fishing boats, not gin palaces, with just six to eight cabins - which you can hire to travel along the smaller tributaries of the Amazon.  Warapuru (warapuru.com), the new Anouska Hempel hotel on the coast at Itacare in Bahia, opens next year. We&apos;re hoping it will kickstart a wave of Aman-style small boutique hotels. The hotel will have 40 pavilions tucked away in the rainforest with a spa and a beach club. I&apos;m also likely to be spending a lot of time on the Gower Peninsula in Wales in 2008 - I&apos;ve just bought a ruined barn there. The beaches are different from Brazil&apos;s but, in their own way, just as staggering.  MELINDA STEVENS Travel editor, Tatler Of course there will be fresh places on the up which will be exciting to visit this year, but there are also some old favourites which have strapped on their dancing shoes and are ready to jig. Thailand, for example, has been in and out of fashion since before the Vietnam War, but this year it&apos;s going crazy, with a mass of upmarket hotel openings including the splashiest of the lot, Soneva Kiri on Koh Kood (sixsenses.com) scheduled to open by the end of 2008, with its massive private villas, personal butlers and knockout beach. The Soneva properties are all about eco-cool, but it doesn&apos;t stop them from being the most indulgent places on the planet.  WENDY KENNEALLY Senior product manager, long-haul specialist Kuoni Travel Bali is seeing a return to popularity, with business up by 26 per cent for 2008 so far. The country offers a superb combination of fascinating culture, beautiful beaches and excellent service. At the top end, the private villas of the Chedi Club (ghmhotels.com) - a former tea estate among rice paddies - or the lavish Ritz-Carlton (ritzcarlton.com), which has been renovated, are noteworthy, while there are also some wonderful options inland such as The Alila Ubud (alilahotels.com). India is also booming for 2008. We are seeing an increase in boutique properties with a twist, such as tea estates, small palaces which are run by descendents of the royal families, as well as luxury tented accommodation. PHILIP HAMILTON-GRIERSON Marketing director, luxury tour operator Cox &amp; Kings We&apos;re particularly excited about a luxury train we&apos;re launching in India in the autumn. It will travel from Mumbai to Kolkata and run year round, offering affordable luxury and visiting major places of interest en route, such as Varanasi and Delhi. It&apos;s like a cruise on land - you have the benefit of keeping your things in one place yet seeing a lot of the country. We&apos;re also offering a new boat in the Galapagos Islands called La Pinta, starting in March. It claims to be the most luxurious vessel in the region and is good news as the Americans tend to block-book boats, making availability tight. There&apos;s a restriction on numbers visiting the Galapagos, so it will become an increasingly exclusive destination. ESCAPE&apos;S PICKS JOANNE O&apos;CONNOREscape editor I&apos;ve just finished reading Philip Pullman&apos;s Northern Lights and am now obsessed with the idea of seeing the Aurora Borealis. This winter, tour operators Black Tomato and Original Travel are starting tours to Svalbard, a remote archipelago inside the Arctic Circle where there are almost as many polar bears as humans. I want to go dog-sledding under the northern lights and enjoy a pint in the northernmost pub in the world. After that, I might need some sunshine, so I&apos;ll head to Turkey to walk the Lycian Way. There are some lovely guesthouses opening along this coastal route to cater for walkers. Exclusive Escapes has a good selection, and for 2008 it can arrange stays with locals in traditional village houses. TOM HALLTravel editor, Lonely Planet Bmi&apos;s takeover of the routes and fleet of BMed (British Mediterranean Airways) has got me interested in using two of their more unusual routes to visit Syria. An open-jaw trip into Damascus, below, and out of Aleppo would get any traveller&apos;s mouth watering. Damascus&apos;s Old City and Umayyad Mosque for starters, then Palymra&apos;s enormous Roman ruins, the Crusader castle of Krak des Chevaliers, and finishing with a few days getting lost in Aleppo&apos;s souks. For somewhere different, Yemen is an increasingly accessible trip for anyone with a nose for an under-rated Arabian adventure - and there won&apos;t be a chintzy Dubai-style hotel complex in sight.  TOM ROBBINSEscape deputy editor Last winter, the ski industry was obsessed with exploring ever more exotic slopes, from Japan to Alaska, Kashmir and Kamchatka. But this year things are turning full circle - the real trend is the rediscovery of the tiny, traditional mountain villages of the Alps. Perhaps it&apos;s because of the best early-season snow in Europe for more than a decade, combined with a growing aversion to long-haul flights and the over-crowded pistes of the mega-resorts. Swiss villages such as Lenzerheide, Grimentz, Vals and St Peter, for example, once dismissed as too small for anyone but families and learners, are now drawing advanced skiers looking for powder fields that don&apos;t get tracked out by others within an hour of the lifts opening. Young companies like Snowmotions (00 41 76 345 6292; snowmotions.com) are specialising in such villages and also offer guides to take guests on long off-piste tours from hamlet to hamlet, without another soul in sight.", "sentences": ["THE ETHICAL TRAVELLERS  MARK SMITH Creator, rail information website Seat61.com This year we&apos;ll see Amsterdam becoming a European rail destination to rival Paris and Brussels.", "Since the high-speed line to the Channel Tunnel was completed in November, you&apos;ve been able to hop on a Eurostar in central London, make one quick change in Brussels, and reach Amsterdam in about five-and-a-half hours, with no airport blues.", "But a new high-speed line across the Netherlands, opening late next year, will cut London-Amsterdam to four hours 10 minutes, city centre to city centre, changing in Brussels.", "You can also now combine the city with Prague, Vienna, Milan, Copenhagen or Warsaw, thanks to the recent launch of new &apos;City Night Line&apos; sleeper services from Amsterdam (bahn.de/citynightline)."], "title": "Where's hot for 2008?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/dec/30/2", "tags": ["Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2007-12-30T23:39:20Z", "article": "Felicity Jones  The multi-tasker &apos;Taking Ambridge to Amsterdam&apos; is how Felicity Jones describes her part in the forthcoming BBC production of The Diary of Anne Frank, alongside fellow Archers veteran Tamsin Greig. Jones, 24, joined the radio soap at 15 through her drama group at Birmingham&apos;s Television Workshop, but has appeared as Emma Grundy only intermittently, owing to other commitments: roles in The Worst Witch and Joe Absolom&apos;s Servants and an English degree at Oxford, completed in 2006. Since then, Jones, 24, has played the lead in Northanger Abbey, part of ITV&apos;s Jane Austen season, last spring, and starred opposite David Morrissey in Channel 4&apos;s Cape Wrath, but her highlight so far is starring in Polly Stenham&apos;s That Face at the Royal Court. &apos;It was my first professional foray into theatre and Polly&apos;s first script: really exciting.&apos; As well as playing Anne Frank&apos;s sister Margot in the five-part series airing early next year, she&apos;ll be in the BBC&apos;s heavyweight film of Brideshead Revisited, scripted by Andrew Davies, and on the big screen in Flashbacks of a Fool, starring Daniel Craig. She has a Doctor Who episode in the works and will find time to appear in The Archers again soon. &apos;I miss it if I&apos;m not doing it. Plus, I get to explore my devilish side through Emma.&apos;Killian Fox Alfie AllenThe reformed slacker Alfie Allen might never fully escape the slack image created by his sister Lily&apos;s song about him (&apos;Alfie&apos;). But as his career blossoms on stage and screen, he&apos;s doing all he can to disprove the depiction of a stoned slacker who stays in bed until half-past three. Recounting how he was summoned to the Wolseley for an 8am breakfast with playwright Peter Shaffer, he can&apos;t resist boasting: &apos;I got in before him!&apos; Improved time-keeping skills aren&apos;t all he has to be proud of. Having already graced our screens in Atonement and Stephen Poliakoff&apos;s recent BBC drama Joe&apos;s Palace, we&apos;ll see him next March as Daniel Craig&apos;s best mate - &apos;a mean bastard&apos; - in Flashbacks of a Fool. &apos;I do seem to play mean bastards quite a bit,&apos; he says. His next role will mark a departure from the bruiser typecast: he is to take over the part of the disturbed Alan Strang in Shaffer&apos;s Equus from Daniel Radcliffe. As for the famous family (his father is Keith Allen, his mother film producer Alison Owen), it is, he complains, more hindrance than help. &apos;People are going to be lining up to shoot me down... they really want to see whether you&apos;ve got what it takes,&apos; he says. But, as he chuckles over the &apos;better, bigger year&apos; ahead, he certainly doesn&apos;t seem too worried: &apos;I&apos;ll definitely, well, hopefully, surprise people.&apos; Hermione Buckland-Hoby Ryan MolloyThe musical star He&apos;ll play Frankie Valli in the forthcoming West End production of Broadway hit Jersey Boys, but Ryan Molloy&apos;s life story has been just as dramatic as that of the falsetto-voiced crooner. Raised in Newcastle, Molloy, 31, studied at UCLA and courted stardom through a series of US talent shows before landing a record deal back home with RCA. The deal fell through before he could release an album, but Molloy bounced back, his powerful voice and sculpted good looks propelling him into musical theatre. His first break was Taboo in 2002, playing Steve Strange opposite Boy George. For the next two years, he toured with Jerry Springer: The Opera before winning his first lead, in the Rod Stewart musical Tonight&apos;s the Night. The big highlight so far has been Jude Kelly&apos;s revival of On the Town for the ENO last summer, though Molloy has since starred in Eurobeat at the Edinburgh Fringe. What&apos;s more, he took over from Holly Johnson as lead singer of Frankie Goes to Hollywood when the band re-formed to tour in 2004. Jersey Boys is the main thing on Molloy&apos;s horizon, although he is putting finishing touches to a solo album and exercising his idiosyncratic sense of humour with his &apos;comedy band&apos; Suntan: &apos;We played a gig in Zermatt recently. For a while, we were the highest group in the world.&apos;KF Carey MulliganThe go-getter When Carey Mulligan asks, she usually gets. The 22-year-old actress made her first lucky strike, having never been to drama school or university, when she wrote to Julian Fellowes with a request for advice and support. He introduced her to friends who offered her an audition, leading to her role as Kitty in Joe Wright&apos;s Pride and Prejudice at the age of 19. Next came the BBC&apos;s acclaimed adaptation of Bleak House Landing the role of Nina in the Royal Court&apos;s Seagull this year was another piece of wish-fulfilment. No sooner had she told her boyfriend she would love to play the part than her agent rang. At first, Mulligan thought she had taken on too much: &apos;I would come away at the end of every evening in the first week of rehearsals crying. I felt like the smallest, tiniest person in the room&apos; but it soon became one of the happiest times of her life and garnered glowing reviews. Mulligan is now rehearsing for a small part in the Jim Sheridan film Brothers and will start on an independent British film in March. Next on the wishlist is a move away from costume drama. &apos;I want a gun and a car chase,&apos; she says with a laugh, although she would make an exception to play Ophelia to Jude Law&apos;s Hamlet in the 2009 Kenneth Branagh production. In true Mulligan style, she has &apos;told everyone I know just in case they happen to know Kenneth Branagh&apos;.Katie Toms", "sentences": ["Felicity Jones  The multi-tasker &apos;Taking Ambridge to Amsterdam&apos; is how Felicity Jones describes her part in the forthcoming BBC production of The Diary of Anne Frank, alongside fellow Archers veteran Tamsin Greig."], "title": "New faces 2008: Actors", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2007/dec/30/featuresreview.review11", "tags": ["Culture", "Carey Mulligan", "Felicity Jones"]}]}
